      <title>What is missing from this picture? Persistent homology and mixup barcodes as a means of investigating negative embedding space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work in the information sciences, especially informetrics and scientometrics, has made substantial contributions to the development of new metrics that eschew the intrinsic biases of citation metrics. This work has tended to employ either network scientific (topological) approaches to quantifying the disruptiveness of peer-reviewed research, or topic modeling approaches to quantifying conceptual novelty. We propose a combination of these approaches, investigating the prospect of topological data analysis (TDA), specifically persistent homology and mixup barcodes, as a means of understanding the negative space among document embeddings generated by topic models. Using top2vec, we embed documents and topics in n-dimensional space, we use persistent homology to identify holes in the embedding distribution, and then use mixup barcodes to determine which holes are being filled by a set of unobserved publications. In this case, the unobserved publications represent research that was published before or after the data used to train top2vec. We investigate the extent that negative embedding space represents missing context (older research) versus innovation space (newer research), and the extend that the documents that occupy this space represents integrations of the research topics on the periphery. Potential applications for this metric are discussed.</description>

      <title>Detecting Early and Implicit Suicidal Ideation via Longitudinal and Information Environment Signals on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On social media, many individuals experiencing suicidal ideation (SI) do not disclose their distress explicitly. Instead, signs may surface indirectly through everyday posts or peer interactions. Detecting such implicit signals early is critical but remains challenging. We frame early and implicit SI as a forward-looking prediction task and develop a computational framework that models a user's information environment, consisting of both their longitudinal posting histories as well as the discourse of their socially proximal peers. We adopted a composite network centrality measure to identify top neighbors of a user, and temporally aligned the user's and neighbors' interactions -- integrating the multi-layered signals in a fine-tuned DeBERTa-v3 model. In a Reddit study of 1,000 (500 Case and 500 Control) users, our approach improves early and implicit SI detection by 15% over individual-only baselines. These findings highlight that peer interactions offer valuable predictive signals and carry broader implications for designing early detection systems that capture indirect as well as masked expressions of risk in online environments.</description>

      <title>Seeing Hate Differently: Hate Subspace Modeling for Culture-Aware Hate Speech Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hate speech detection has been extensively studied, yet existing methods often overlook a real-world complexity: training labels are biased, and interpretations of what is considered hate vary across individuals with different cultural backgrounds. We first analyze these challenges, including data sparsity, cultural entanglement, and ambiguous labeling. To address them, we propose a culture-aware framework that constructs individuals' hate subspaces. To alleviate data sparsity, we model combinations of cultural attributes. For cultural entanglement and ambiguous labels, we use label propagation to capture distinctive features of each combination. Finally, individual hate subspaces, which in turn can further enhance classification performance. Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art by 1.05\% on average across all metrics.</description>

      <title>Strategic Behavior in Crowdfunding: Insights from a Large-Scale Online Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines strategic behavior in crowdfunding using a large-scale online experiment. Building on the model of Arieli et. al 2023, we test predictions about risk aversion (i.e., opting out despite seeing a positive private signal) and mutual insurance (i.e., opting in despite seeing a negative private signal) in a static, single-shot crowdfunding game, focusing on informational incentives rather than dynamic effects. Our results validate key theoretical predictions: crowdfunding mechanisms induce distinct strategic behaviors compared to voting, where participants are more likely to follow private signals (odds ratio: 0.139, $p &lt; 0.001$). Additionally, the study demonstrates that higher signal accuracy (85\% vs. 55\%) decreases risk aversion (odds ratio: 0.414, $p = 0.024$) but increases reliance on mutual insurance (odds ratio: 2.532, $p = 0.026$). However, contrary to theory, increasing the required participation threshold (50\% to 80\%) amplifies risk aversion (odds ratio: 3.251, $p = 0.005$), which, pending further investigation, may indicate cognitive constraints.
  Furthermore, we show that while mutual insurance supports participation, it may hinder information aggregation, particularly as signal accuracy increases. These findings advance crowdfunding theory by confirming the impact of informational incentives and identifying behavioral deviations that challenge standard models, offering insights for platform design and mechanism refinement.</description>

      <title>Multilevel User Credibility Assessment in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13305v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online social networks serve as major platforms for disseminating both real and fake news. Many users--intentionally or unintentionally--spread harmful content, misinformation, and rumors in domains such as politics and business. Consequently, user credibility assessment has become a prominent area of research in recent years. Most existing methods suffer from two key limitations. First, they treat credibility as a binary task, labeling users as either genuine or fake, whereas real-world applications often demand a more nuanced, multilevel evaluation. Second, they rely on only a subset of relevant features, which constrains their predictive performance. In this paper, we address the lack of a dataset suitable for multilevel credibility assessment by first devising a collection method tailored to this task. We then propose the \textit{MultiCred} model, which assigns users to one of several credibility tiers based on a rich and diverse set of features extracted from their profiles, tweets, and comments. MultiCred leverages deep language models for textual analysis and deep neural networks for non-textual data processing. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MultiCred significantly outperforms existing approaches across multiple accuracy metrics.

      <title>Ideology and polarization set the agenda on social media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The abundance of information on social media has reshaped public discussions, shifting attention to the mechanisms that drive online discourse. This study analyzes large-scale Twitter (now X) data from three global debates--Climate Change, COVID-19, and the Russo-Ukrainian War--to investigate the structural dynamics of engagement. Our findings reveal that discussions are not primarily shaped by specific categories of actors, such as media or activists, but by shared ideological alignment. Users consistently form polarized communities, where their ideological stance in one debate predicts their positions in others. This polarization transcends individual topics, reflecting a broader pattern of ideological divides. Furthermore, the influence of individual actors within these communities appears secondary to the reinforcing effects of selective exposure and shared narratives. Overall, our results underscore that ideological alignment, rather than actor prominence, plays a central role in structuring online discourse and shaping the spread of information in polarized environments.</description>

      <title>Maximum entropy temporal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02098v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temporal networks consist of timestamped directed interactions that may appear continuously in time, yet few studies have directly tackled the continuous-time modeling of networks. Here, we introduce a maximum-entropy approach to temporal networks and with basic assumptions on constraints, the corresponding network ensembles admit a modular and interpretable representation: a set of global time processes and a static maximum-entropy edge, e.g. node pair, probability. This time-edge labels factorization yields closed-form log-likelihoods, degree, clustering and motif expectations, and yields a whole class of effective generative models. We provide maximum-entropy derivation of an inhomogeneous Poisson edge intensity for temporal networks via functional optimization over path entropy, connecting NHPP modeling to maximum-entropy network ensembles. NHPP consistently improve log-likelihood over generic Poisson processes, while the maximum-entropy edge labels recover strength constraints and reproduce expected unique-degree curves. We discuss the limitations of this framework and how it can be integrated with multivariate Hawkes calibration procedures, renewal theory, and neural kernel estimation in graph neural networks.</description>

      <title>Error Bounds for the Network Scale-Up Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10640v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Epidemiologists and social scientists have used the Network Scale-Up Method (NSUM) for over thirty years to estimate the size of a hidden sub-population within a social network. This method involves querying a subset of network nodes about the number of their neighbours belonging to the hidden sub-population. In general, NSUM assumes that the social network topology and the hidden sub-population distribution are well-behaved; hence, the NSUM estimate is close to the actual value. However, bounds on NSUM estimation errors have not been analytically proven. This paper provides analytical bounds on the error incurred by the two most popular NSUM estimators. These bounds assume that the queried nodes accurately provide their degree and the number of neighbors belonging to the hidden population. Our key findings are twofold. First, we show that when an adversary designs the network and places the hidden sub-population, then the estimate can be a factor of $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ off from the real value (in a network with $n$ nodes). Second, we also prove error bounds when the underlying network is randomly generated, showing that a small constant factor can be achieved with high probability using samples of logarithmic size $O(\log{n})$. We present improved analytical bounds for Erdos-Renyi and Scale-Free networks. Our theoretical analysis is supported by an extensive set of numerical experiments designed to determine the effect of the sample size on the accuracy of the estimates in both synthetic and real networks.</description>

      <title>A data-driven analysis of the impact of non-compliant individuals on epidemic diffusion in urban settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13325v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Individuals who do not comply with public health safety measures pose a significant challenge to effective epidemic control, as their risky behaviours can undermine public health interventions. This is particularly relevant in urban environments because of their high population density and complex social interactions. In this study, we employ detailed contact networks, built using a data-driven approach, to examine the impact of non-compliant individuals on epidemic dynamics in three major Italian cities: Torino, Milano, and Palermo. We use a heterogeneous extension of the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model that distinguishes between ordinary and non-compliant individuals, who are more infectious and/or more susceptible. By combining electoral data with recent findings on vaccine hesitancy, we obtain spatially heterogeneous distributions of non-compliance. Epidemic simulations demonstrate that even a small proportion of non-compliant individuals in the population can substantially increase the number of infections and accelerate the timing of their peak. Furthermore, the impact of non-compliance is greatest when disease transmission rates are moderate. Including the heterogeneous, data-driven distribution of non-compliance in the simulations results in infection hotspots forming with varying intensity according to the disease transmission rate. Overall, these findings emphasise the importance of monitoring behavioural compliance and tailoring public health interventions to address localised risks.</description>
