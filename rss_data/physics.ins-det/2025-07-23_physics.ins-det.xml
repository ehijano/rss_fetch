      <title>The Automatic Calibration Method of the Compton Edge Based on Normalized Cross-correlation and Simulated Annealing Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate energy channel calibration in scintillation detectors is essential for reliable radiation detection across nuclear physics, medical imaging, and environmental monitoring. Organic scintillators like BC408 and EJ309 lack full-energy peaks, making their Compton edge a critical calibration alternative where traditional peak methods fail. Existing Compton edge identification techniques - Gaussian fitting for the 50%-70% amplitude point, first derivative minimum detection, and Monte Carlo simulation - suffer significant degradation from low count rates, spectral overlap, and subjective interval selection. For the first time, we propose an automated calibration procedure based on Normalized Cross-Correlation (NCC), Simulated Annealing (SA), and a convolutional response model to address these issues. This method automates the selection of the Compton edge interval through NCC-based matching, utilizes SA for global parameter optimization, and then employs a convolutional model for precise matching. Experiments involving the irradiation of organic scintillators (BC408, EJ309) and inorganic scintillators (NaI:Tl, LaBr3:Ce) with 137Cs, 22Na, 54Mn, and 60Co radiation sources demonstrate that this method achieves accuracy commensurate with full-energy peak calibration method (cosine similarity &gt;99.999%) and exhibits superior stability compared to the two traditional methods. In the extreme cases of spectral overlap and low count rate, the average errors of this method are 19.77% and 15.65% of those from the two traditional methods in BC408, 56.44% and 33.15% of those from the two traditional methods in EJ309. This work advances detector calibration and offers a scalable, automated solution for high-energy experiments and portable devices.</description>

      <title>Yield, noise and timing studies of ALICE ITS3 stitched sensor test structures: the MOST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the LHC long shutdown 3, the ALICE experiment upgrades the inner layers of its Inner Tracker System with three layers of wafer-scale stitched sensors bent around the beam pipe. Two stitched sensor evaluation structures, the MOnolithic Stitched Sensor (MOSS) and MOnolithic Stitched Sensor with Timing (MOST) allow the study of yield dependence on circuit density, power supply segmentation, stitching demonstration for power and data transmission, performance dependence on reverse bias, charge collection performance, parameter uniformity across the chip, and performance of wafer-scale data transmission.
  The MOST measures 25.9 cm x 0.25 cm, has more than 900,000 pixels of 18x18 $\mu$m$^2$ and emphasizes the validation of pixel circuitry with maximum density, together with a high number of power domains separated by switches allowing to disconnect faulty circuits. It employs 1 Gb/s 26 cm long data transmission using asynchronous, data-driven readout. This readout preserves information on pixel address, time of arrival and time over threshold. In the MOSS, by contrast, regions with different in-pixel densities are implemented to study yield dependence and are read synchronously.
  MOST test results validated the concept of power domain switching and the data transmission over 26 cm stitched lines which are to be employed on the full-size, full-functionality ITS3 prototype sensor, MOSAIX. Jitter of this transmission is still under study. This proceeding summarizes the performance of the stitched sensor test structures with emphasis on the MOST.</description>

      <title>Observation of a phase transition in KTaO$_3$ induced by residual niobium impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the observation of a phase transition in a KTaO$_3$ crystal, corresponding to a paraelectric-to-ferroelectric transition. The crystal was placed inside a copper cavity to form a dielectric-loaded microwave cavity, and the transition was observed to occur near 134 K. As the cavity was cooled, the frequencies of both transverse electric and transverse magnetic resonant modes decreased (corresponding to an increase in permittivity). The mode frequencies converge at the transition temperature (near 134 K) and, below this point, reverse their tuning direction, increasing their frequency with decreasing temperature. This behaviour corresponds to a decrease in dielectric permittivity and is atypical for pure KTaO$_3$. To investigate further, we conducted impurity analysis using Laser Ablation inductively coupled mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS), revealing a significant concentration ($\sim$ 7\%) of niobium (Nb) in the crystal. This suggests that the observed phase transition is driven by residual Nb impurities, which induce ferroelectricity in an otherwise paraelectric host. Similar crystals with a lower concentration ($&lt;$ 2\%) did not undergo a phase transition but exhibited a loss peak at this temperature. These findings have practical implications for the design of tunable devices, for example, resonator-based dark matter detectors, where low-loss material phase stability and tunability are crucial.</description>

      <title>Quantum Dot Based Chromatic Calorimetry: A proposal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chromatic calorimetry introduces a novel approach to calorimeter design in High Energy Physics (HEP) by integrating Quantum Dot (QD) technology into traditional homogeneous calorimeters. The tunable emission spectra of QDs provide new possibilities for energy reconstruction and potentially improved particle identification in homogeneous devices. This paper presents the initial conceptual design of a chromatic calorimeter aimed at validating the feasibility of QD-based chromatic calorimetry. The study evaluates its expected performance through detailed simulations, comparing the results to the existing calorimetric technologies. By embedding QDs with distinct emission properties within scintillators, we aim to improve both timing resolution and longitudinal segmentation, thus opening new avenues for precision measurements in future HEP experiments. While further development and validation are required, QD-enhanced detectors may represent a viable option for future HEP experiments, providing an additional tool for addressing the evolving demands of particle detection.</description>

      <title>Performance of a SiPM-based, plastic scintillator muon veto prototype for CUPID</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CUPID will be a next-generation experiment searching for neutrinoless double beta decay in the inverted mass ordering regime. The reduction of backgrounds in the region of interest is critical to the performance of the experiment. Despite its underground location, muon-induced events will be a non-negligible source of background for CUPID, and their mitigation will be critical in reaching CUPID's target sensitivity. This mitigation will be achieved with a muon veto system, which must fit within the physical constraints of the existing infrastructure while maximizing geometrical coverage. We present the design, construction, and characterization of prototypes for a modular system of plastic scintillator panels with embedded plastic wavelength-shifting fibers connected to silicon photomultipliers for the CUPID muon veto. The 100$\, \times \,$50$\, \times \, $2.5\,cm$^3$ panel prototype presented here exhibited a light yield of ($55.9 \,\pm \,1.5$)\,p.e./MeV with a position reconstruction resolution of 25$\,\times \,$25\,cm$^2$. This design also achieves a muon detection efficiency of $(98\,\pm \,1)\%$. We compare the light yield, uniformity, and position reconstruction potential of different prototype designs.</description>

      <title>Role of defects in atom probe analysis of sol-gel silica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06138v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Silicon dioxide is a suitable material to encapsulate proteins at room temperature so that they can be analysed at the atomic level using laser-assisted atom probe tomography (La-APT). To achieve this goal, in this study we show that UV and deep UV lasers can achieve a high success rate in La-APT of silica in terms of chemical resolution and three-dimensional image volume, with both lasers providing comparable results. Since the La-APT analyses are driven by photon absorption, in order to understand the mechanisms behind the enhanced absorption of UV light, we performed density functional theory calculations to model the electronic and optical properties of amorphous silica matrices generated using a Monte Carlo approach to structural optimisation. In particular, we have investigated the role of various defects introduced during sample preparation, such as substitutional and interstitial carbon, sodium and gallium ions, and hydrogen. Our results show that the presence of defects increases the absorption of silica in the UV and deep-UV range and thus improves the La-APT capabilities of the material. However, due to the low density of free charge carriers resulting from the absorption of laser energy by defects, deviations from the nominal chemical composition and suboptimal chemical resolution may occur, potentially limiting the optimal acquisition of APT mass spectra.</description>
