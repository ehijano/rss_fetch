      <title>Projective and Carrollian geometry at time/space-like infinity on projectively compact Ricci flat Einstein manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we discuss how to construct canonical \emph{strong} Carrollian geometries at time/space like infinity of projectively compact Ricci flat Einstein manifolds $(M,g)$ and discuss the links between the underlying projective structure of the metric $g$. The obtained Carrollian geometries are determined by the data of the projective compactification. The key idea to achieve this is to consider a new type of Cartan geometry based on a non-effective homogeneous model for projective geometry. We prove that this structure is a general feature of projectively compact Ricci flat Einstein manifolds.</description>

      <title>Geometric surgeries of three-dimensional flag structures and non-uniformizable examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a notion of geometric surgery for flag structures, which are geometric structures locally modelled on the three-dimensional flag space under the action of ${\mathrm{PGL}}_3(\mathbb{R})$. Using such surgeries we provide examples of flag structures, of both uniformizable and non-uniformizable type.</description>

      <title>SYZ and optimal transport stability of Weyl polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove optimal transport stability (in the sense of Andreasson and the second author) for reflexive Weyl polytopes: reflexive polytopes which are convex hulls of an orbit of a Weyl group. When the reflexive Weyl polytope is Delzant, it follows from work of Li, Andreasson, Hultgren, Jonsson, Mazzon, that the weak metric SYZ conjecture holds for the Dwork family in the corresponding toric Fano manifold. In particular, we show that the weak metric SYZ conjecture holds for centrally symmetric smooth Fano toric manifolds.</description>

      <title>Positive Ricci curvature on connected sums of fibre bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of preserving positive Ricci curvature along connected sums. In this context, based on earlier work by Perelman, Burdick introduced the notion of core metrics and showed that the connected sum of manifolds with core metrics admits a Riemannian metric of positive Ricci curvature. He subsequently showed that core metrics exist on compact rank one symmetric spaces, certain sphere bundles and manifolds obtained as boundaries of certain plumbings. In this article, we show that core metrics can be lifted along general fibre bundles, including sphere bundles and projective bundles. Our techniques also apply to spaces that decompose as the union of two disc bundles such as the Wu manifold. As application we show that all classes in the torsion-free oriented bordism ring can be represented by connected manifolds of positive Ricci curvature.</description>

      <title>A family of $4$-manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature and prescribed asymptotic cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that for any finite subgroup $\Gamma &lt; O(4)$ acting freely on $\mathbb{S}^3$, there exists a $4$-dimensional complete Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ with ${\rm Ric}_g \geq 0 $, such that the asymptotic cone of $(M,g)$ is $C(\mathbb{S}_\delta^3 /\Gamma )$ for some $\delta = \delta (\Gamma ) &gt;0$. This answers a question of Bru\`e-Pigati-Semola [arXiv:2405.03839] about the topological obstructions of $4$-dimensional non-collapsed tangent cones. Combining this result with a recent work of Bru\`e-Pigati-Semola [arXiv:2405.03839], one can classify the $4$-dimensional non-collapsed tangent cone in the topological sense.</description>

      <title>The geometric Toda equations for noncompact symmetric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper has two purposes. The first is to classify all those versions of the Toda equations which govern the existence of $\tau$-primitive harmonic maps from a surface into a homogeneous space $G/T$ for which $G$ is a noncomplex noncompact simple real Lie group and $T$ is a maximal compact torus, i.e., a maximal torus inside a maximal compact subgroup $H &lt; G$. Here $\tau$ is the Coxeter automorphism which Drinfel'd &amp; Sokolov assigned to each affine Dynkin diagram. This allows $\tau$ to be either an inner or an outer automorphism. We show that, up to equivalence, the real forms $G&lt;G^\mathbb{C}$ which are compatible with $\tau$ can be classified using a simple labelling of the corresponding affine diagram.
  The second purpose is to establish when stability criteria can be used to prove the existence of solutions. We interpret the Toda equations over a compact Riemann surface $\Sigma$ as equations for a metric on a holomorphic principal $T^\mathbb{C}$-bundle $Q^\mathbb{C}$ over $\Sigma$. The corresponding Chern connection, when combined with a holomorphic field $\varphi$, produces a $G$-connection which is flat precisely when the Toda equations hold. We call the pair $(Q^\mathbb{C},\varphi)$ a Toda pair. We classify those real forms of the Toda equations for which the Toda pair is a principal pair (in the sense of Bradlow et al.) and we call these totally noncompact Toda pairs. Using the stability theory for principal pairs we prove that for totally noncompact cyclic Toda pairs $(Q^\mathbb{C},\varphi)$ the corresponding Toda equations always admit solutions. Every solution to the geometric Toda equations has a corresponding $G$-Higgs bundle. We explain how to construct this $G$-Higgs bundle directly from the Toda pair and show that Baraglia's cyclic Higgs bundles arise from a very special case of totally noncompact cyclic Toda pairs.</description>

      <title>Integral curvature estimates for solutions to Ricci flow with $L^p$ bounded scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove $\textit{localised, weighted}$ curvature integral estimates for solutions to the Ricci flow in the setting of a smooth four dimensional Ricci flow or a closed $n$-dimensional K\"ahler Ricci flow. These integral estimates improve and extend the integral curvature estimates shown by the second author in an earlier paper. If the scalar curvature is uniformly bounded in the spatial $L^p$ sense for some $p&gt;2,$ then the estimates imply a uniform bound on the spatial $L^2$ norm of the Riemannian curvature tensor. Stronger integral estimates are shown to hold if one further assumes a weak non-inflating condition. In a sequel paper, we show that in many natural settings, a non-inflating condition holds.</description>

      <title>Bottom spectrum of three-dimensional manifolds with scalar curvature lower bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical result of Cheng states that the bottom spectrum of complete manifolds of fixed dimension and Ricci curvature lower bound achieves its maximal value on the corresponding hyperbolic space. The paper establishes an analogous result for three-dimensional complete manifolds with scalar curvature lower bound subject to some necessary topological assumptions. The rigidity issue is also addressed and a splitting theorem is obtained for such manifolds with the maximal bottom spectrum.</description>

      <title>Concurrent normals problem for convex polytopes and Euclidean distance degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is conjectured since long that for any convex body $P\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ there exists a point in its interior which belongs to at least $2n$ normals from different points on the boundary of $P$. The conjecture is known to be true for $n=2,3,4$.
  We treat the same problem for convex polytopes in $\mathbb{R}^3$. It turns out that the PL concurrent normals problem differs a lot from the smooth one. One almost immediately proves that a convex polytope in $\mathbb{R}^3$ has $8$ normals to its boundary emanating from some point in its interior. Moreover, we conjecture that each simple polytope has a point in its interior with $10$ normals to the boundary. We confirm the conjecture for all tetrahedra and triangular prisms and give a sufficient condition for a simple polytope to have a point with $10$ normals.
  Other related topics (average number of normals, minimal number of normals from an interior point, other dimensions) are discussed.</description>

      <title>Stability theory over toroidal or Novikov type base and Canonical modifications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We set up a generalization of ubiquitous one parameter families in algebraic geometry and its use for stability theories ([Mum65, HL14, AHLH23]) to families over toric varieties, Novikov type rings, or its complex analytic analogues. The language allows us to reformulate degenerations of "irrational" direction in various literatures as canonical objects in a unified manner.
  Compatibly, we generalize the stable reduction type theorem for $\Theta$-stratification in [AHLH23] of Langton type to our higher rank setup.</description>

      <title>Geometry of three-dimensional manifolds with positive scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.05595v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to derive volume and other geometric information for three-dimensional complete manifolds with positive scalar curvature. In the case that the Ricci curvature is nonnegative, it is shown that the volume of the manifold must be of linear growth when the scalar curvature is bounded from below by a positive constant. This answers a question of Gromov in the affirmative for dimension three. Volume growth estimates are also obtained for the case when scalar curvature decays to zero. In fact, results of similar nature are established for the more general case that the Ricci curvature is asymptotically nonnegative.</description>

Abstract: We prove a sharp isoperimetric inequality for measured Finsler manifolds having non-negative Ricci curvature and Euclidean volume growth. We also prove a rigidity result for this inequality, under the additional hypotheses of boundedness of the isoperimetric set and the finite reversibility of the space.
  As a consequence, we deduce the rigidity of the weighted anisotropic isoperimetric inequality for cones in the Euclidean space, in the irreversible setting.</description>

Abstract: In any 5 dimensional closed Sasakian manifold we prove that any minmax operation on the area among Legendrian surfaces is achieved by a continuous conformal Legendrian map from a closed riemann surface $S$ into $N^5$ equipped with an integer multiplicity bounded in $L^\infty$. Moreover this map, equipped with this multiplicity, satisfies a weak version of the Hamiltonian Minimal Equation. We conjecture that any solution to this equation is a smooth branched Legendrian immersion away from isolated Schoen-Wolfson conical singularities with non zero Maslov class.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we formulate and prove a gauge equivalence for unitary connections and skew-Hermitian Higgs fields of suitable regularity that are mapped to the same function under the non-abelian X-ray transform on nontrapping asymptotically hyperbolic spaces with negative curvature and no nontrivial twisted conformal Killing tensor fields with certain regularity. If one furthermore fixes such a connection with zero curvature, a corollary provides an injectivity result for the non-abelian X-ray transform over skew-Hermitian Higgs fields.</description>

Abstract: The classical Llarull theorem states that a smooth metric on $n$-sphere cannot have scalar curvature no less than $n(n-1)$ and dominate the standard spherical metric at the same time unless it is the standard spherical metric. In this work, we prove that Llarull's rigidity theorem holds for $L^{\infty}$ metrics on spheres with finitely many points punctured. This is related to a question of Gromov.</description>

      <title>Berry Connections for 2d $(2,2)$ Theories, Monopole Spectral Data &amp; (Generalised) Cohomology Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Berry connections for supersymmetric ground states of 2d $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ GLSMs quantised on a circle, which are generalised periodic monopoles. Periodic monopole solutions may be encoded into difference modules, as shown by Mochizuki, or into an alternative algebraic construction given in terms of vector bundles endowed with filtrations. By studying the ground states in terms of a one-parameter family of supercharges, we relate these two different kinds of spectral data to the physics of the GLSMs. From the difference modules we derive novel difference equations for brane amplitudes, which in the conformal limit yield novel difference equations for hemisphere or vortex partition functions. When the GLSM flows to a nonlinear sigma model with K\"ahler target $X$, we show that the two kinds of spectral data are related to different (generalised) cohomology theories: the difference modules are related to the equivariant quantum cohomology of $X$, whereas the vector bundles with filtrations are related to its equivariant K-theory.</description>

      <title>Quantization of K\"ahler Manifolds via Brane Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14574v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In their physical proposal for quantization [20], Gukov-Witten suggested that, given a symplectic manifold $M$ with a complexification $X$, the A-model morphism spaces $\operatorname{Hom}(\mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{cc}}, \mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{cc}})$ and $\operatorname{Hom}(\mathcal{B}, \mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{cc}})$ should recover holomorphic deformation quantization of $X$ and geometric quantization of $M$ respectively, where $\mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{cc}}$ is a canonical coisotropic A-brane on $X$ and $\mathcal{B}$ is a Lagrangian A-brane supported on $M$.
  Assuming $M$ is spin and K\"ahler with a prequantum line bundle $L$, Chan-Leung-Li [10] constructed a subsheaf $\mathcal{O}_{\operatorname{qu}}^{(k)}$ of smooth functions on $M$ with a non-formal star product and a left $\mathcal{O}_{\operatorname{qu}}^{(k)}$-module structure on the sheaf of holomorphic sections of $L^{\otimes k} \otimes \sqrt{K}$.
  In this paper, we give a careful treatment of the relation between (holomorphic) deformation quantizations of $M$ and $X$. As a result, Chan-Leung-Li's work [10] provides a mathematical realization of the action of $\operatorname{Hom}(\mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{cc}}, \mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{cc}})$ on $\operatorname{Hom}(\mathcal{B}, \mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{cc}})$. By Fedosov's gluing arguments, we also construct a $\mathcal{O}_{\operatorname{qu}}^{(k)}$-$\overline{\mathcal{O}}_{\operatorname{qu}}^{(k)}$-bimodule structure on the sheaf of smooth sections of $L^{\otimes 2k}$ to realize the actions of $\operatorname{Hom}(\mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{cc}}, \mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{cc}})$ and $\operatorname{Hom}(\overline{\mathcal{B}}_{\operatorname{cc}}, \overline{\mathcal{B}}_{\operatorname{cc}})$ on $\operatorname{Hom}(\overline{\mathcal{B}}_{\operatorname{cc}}, \mathcal{B}_{\operatorname{cc}})$, which is related to the analytic geometric Langlands program.</description>

Abstract: In their celebrated paper of 1976, Rothschild and Stein prove a lifting procedure that locally reduces to a free Lie algebra any family of smooth vector fields $X_1,\dots,X_q$, over a manifold $M$ respecting the H\"ormander's condition. Then, a large class of differential operators can be lifted, and they find that fundamental solutions on the lifted space can be re-projected to fundamental solutions of the given operator on $M$. In case that the Lie algebra $\mathfrak g=\mbox{Lie}(X_1,\dots,X_q)$ is finite dimensional but not nilpotent, this procedure could introduce a strong tilting of the space. In this paper we represent a global construction of a Lie group $G$ associated to $\mathfrak g$ that avoid this tilting problem. In particular $\mbox{Lie}(G)\cong\mathfrak g$ and a right $G$-action exists over $M$, faithful and transitive, inducing a natural projection $E\colon G\to M$. We represent the group $G$ as a direct product $M\times G^z$ where the model fiber $G^z$ has a group structure. We prove that for any simply connected manifold $M$ -- and a vast class of non-simply connected manifolds -- the existence of a fundamental solution for a differential operator $L=\sum_{\alpha\in\mathbb N^q} r_\alpha\cdot X^\alpha$ of finite degree over $M$, follows via a saturation method from the existence of a fundamental solution for the associated lifted operator over a group $G$. This is a generalization of Biagi and Bonfiglioli analogous result for homogeneous vector fields over $M=\mathbb R^n$.</description>

      <title>Compact moduli of Calabi-Yau cones and Sasaki-Einstein spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct proper moduli algebraic spaces of K-polystable $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano cones (a.k.a. Calabi-Yau cones) or equivalently their links i.e., Sasaki-Einstein manifolds with singularities.
  As a byproduct, it gives alternative algebraic construction of proper K-moduli of $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano varieties. In contrast to the previous algebraic proof of its properness ([BHLLX, LXZ]), we do not use the $\delta$-invariants ([FO, BJ]) nor the $L^2$-normalized Donaldson-Futaki invariants. We use the local normalized volume of [Li] and the higher $\Theta$-stable reduction instead.</description>
