      <title>ALICE Upgrades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ALICE collaboration prepares multiple upgrades to further extend the reach of heavy-ion physics at the LHC. For LHC Run 4 (2030-2033), a Forward Calorimeter (FoCal) system combines a high-granularity electromagnetic silicon-tungsten calorimeter with a conventional hadronic calorimeter leading to an excellent two-shower separation for neutral pion reconstruction and photon isolation. Direct photon measurements with FoCal will uniquely constrain the low-x gluon structure of protons and nuclei via forward measurements of direct photons. Additionally, ALICE will employ bent, wafer-scale pixel sensors achieving truly cylindrical tracking layers with very low material budget. These layers will replace the three innermost layers of the Inner Tracking System resulting in an improvement in pointing resolution allowing new measurements of heavy-flavour hadrons and dielectrons.
  For Run 5 and beyond, a next-generation detector system, ALICE 3, has been conceived to gain unique access to the interaction and thermalization of heavy flavour probes in the QGP as well as to the thermal radiation carrying information about the temperature and the restoration of chiral symmetry. At its core, it combines a high-resolution vertex detector with a large-acceptance silicon pixel tracker. For the identification of particles, a combination of a time-of-flight system, a ring-imaging Cherenkov detector, an electromagnetic calorimeter, a muon identifier, and a dedicated forward detector for ultra-soft photons, are envisaged.</description>

      <title>CaloChallenge 2022: A Community Challenge for Fast Calorimeter Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of the "Fast Calorimeter Simulation Challenge 2022" - the CaloChallenge. We study state-of-the-art generative models on four calorimeter shower datasets of increasing dimensionality, ranging from a few hundred voxels to a few tens of thousand voxels. The 31 individual submissions span a wide range of current popular generative architectures, including Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Normalizing Flows, Diffusion models, and models based on Conditional Flow Matching. We compare all submissions in terms of quality of generated calorimeter showers, as well as shower generation time and model size. To assess the quality we use a broad range of different metrics including differences in 1-dimensional histograms of observables, KPD/FPD scores, AUCs of binary classifiers, and the log-posterior of a multiclass classifier. The results of the CaloChallenge provide the most complete and comprehensive survey of cutting-edge approaches to calorimeter fast simulation to date. In addition, our work provides a uniquely detailed perspective on the important problem of how to evaluate generative models. As such, the results presented here should be applicable for other domains that use generative AI and require fast and faithful generation of samples in a large phase space.</description>

      <title>In-situ Transmission Kikuchi Diffraction Nano-tensile Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel methodology for in-situ Transmission Kikuchi Diffraction (TKD) nano-tensile testing that enables nanoscale characterization of the evolution of complex plasticity mechanisms. By integrating a modified in-situ Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) nanoindenter with a microscale push-to-pull device and a conventional Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) detector, we achieved TKD measurements at high spatial resolution during mechanical deformation. A dedicated Focused Ion Beam (FIB) procedure was developed for site-specific specimen fabrication, including lift-out, thinning, and shaping into a dog-bone geometry. The methodology was demonstrated on two case studies: (i) a metastable $\beta$-Ti single crystal, on which we quantified the initiation and evolution of nanoscale twinning and stress-induced martensitic transformation, and (ii) a $CuAl/Al_2O_3$ nanolaminate, which showed nanoscale plasticity and twinning/detwinning in a complex microstructure. Overall, this approach provides a robust alternative to in-situ EBSD and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) testing, facilitating detailed analysis of deformation mechanisms at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Measurement of muon flux behind the beam dump of the J-PARC Hadron Experimental Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17868v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A muon-flux measurement behind the beam dump of the J-PARC Hadron Experimental Facility was performed with a compact muon detector that can be inserted into a vertical observing hole with 81 mm in diameter which was dug underground. The detector consists of 12 plastic scintillation strips with a length of 80 mm each, which are arranged with cylindrical shape and contained inside an aluminum housing with an outer diameter of 75 mm. A silicon photomultiplier is coupled to the end of each strip to collect the scintillating light. The flux of the muons penetrating the beam dump was scanned vertically at intervals of 0.5 m, showing a wide distribution with a maximum at the beam level. The muon flux was consistent with the expectation from a Monte-Carlo simulation at more than 1 m away from the beam axis, which is expected to be used for signal-loss evaluation in the future KOTO II experiment for measuring rare kaon decays. The data can also be used in improving the accuracy of shielding calculations in the radiation protection.</description>
