      <title>Ultraviolet observations of atmospheric escape in exoplanets with the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the many recommendations of the Decadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics 2020, we found that a priority area of research is to pave the pathways towards finding and characterizing habitable worlds. In this context, we aim to understand how planetary systems evolve through atmospheric escape, and develop techniques to identify potentially Earth-like worlds. Using the ultraviolet (UV) capabilities of the Habitable Worlds Observatory, we can use transit spectroscopy observations to determine what processes drive the evolution of exoplanets, how well can small exoplanets retain atmospheres, and search for Earth-like atmospheres. We advocate the development of a UV spectrograph that is capable of moderate- to high-resolution spectroscopy of point sources, access to key spectral features between 1000 and 3000 Angstrom, and UV detectors that are resilient to high count rates.</description>

      <title>High-order expansions of multi-revolution elliptic Halo orbits in the elliptic restricted three-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-revolution elliptic Halo (ME-Halo) orbits are a special class of symmetric and periodic solutions within the framework of the elliptic restricted three-body problem (ERTBP). During a single period, an M:N ME-Halo orbit completes $M$ revolutions around a libration point and the primaries revolve N times around each other. Owing to the repeated configurations, ME-Halo orbits hold great promise as nominal trajectories for space mission design. However, a major challenge associated with ME-Halo orbits lies in their mathematical description. To this end, we propose a novel method to derive high-order analytical expansions of ME-Halo orbits in the ERTBP by introducing two correction terms into the equations of motion in the y- and z-directions. Specifically, both the coordinate variables and correction terms are expanded as power series in terms of the primary eccentricity, the in-plane amplitude, and the out-of-plane amplitude. High-order approximations are constructed using a perturbation method, and their accuracy is validated through numerical analysis. Due to the inherent symmetry, ME-Halo orbits can be classified into four distinct families: southern/northern and periapsis/apoapsis groups. The analytical approximations developed in this study not only provide high-accuracy initial guesses for the numerical computation of ME-Halo orbits, but also offer new insights into the dynamical environment near collinear libration points in the ERTBP, thereby advancing practical applications in mission design.</description>

      <title>SPHEREx Re-Observation of Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS in December 2025: Detection of Increased Post-Perihelion Activity, Refractory Coma Dust, and New Coma Gas Species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In December-2025, the NASA SPHEREx spacecraft re-observed ISO 3I/ATLAS post-perihelion, finding a much more active object compared to August-2025 SPHEREx pre-perihelion observations, with marked evidence for development into an cometary body fully sublimating all its ices. The new imaging spectrophotometry is dominated by spatially resolved features due to dust scattered-light and thermal emission plus gas-emissions from CN (0.93 um), H2O (2.7 um), organic C-H (3.2 to 3.6 um), CO2 (4.25 to 4.27 um), and CO (4.6 to 4.8 um). The CO2 gas-coma continues to be extended out to a 3 arcmin radius. The continuum spectral signature of H2O-ice absorption has mostly disappeared, replaced by scattered-light plus thermal-emission from organo-silicaceous dust grains while the H2O gas-emission is 20 times brighter. All but the organics-gas comae are circularly symmetric, while a weak pear-shaped solar-pointing dust tail consistent with large dust grains is now present. The new appearance of CN and C-H features suggests that these species are contained either in H2O phases or were trapped under them.</description>

      <title>Rings around irregular bodies. II. Numerical simulations of the 1/3 spin-orbit resonance confinement and applications to Chariklo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rings have been found around Chariklo, Haumea and Quaoar, three small objects of the Solar System. All these rings are observed near the second-order spin-orbit resonances (SORs) 1/3 or 5/7 with the central body, suggesting an active confinement mechanism by these resonances. Our goal is to understand how collisional rings can be confined near second-order SORs in spite of the fact that they force self-intersecting streamlines.We use full 3D numerical simulations that treat rings of inelastically colliding particles orbiting non-axisymmetric central bodies, characterized by a dimensionless mass anomaly parameter mu. While most of our simulations ignore self-gravity, a few runs include gravitational interactions between particles, providing preliminary results on the effect of self-gravity on the ring confinement. The 1/3 SOR can confine ring material, by transferring the forced resonant mode into free Lindblad modes. We derive a criterion ensuring that the 1/3 SOR counteracts viscous spreading. Assuming meter-sized ring particles, and tau~1, this requires a threshold value mu &gt; 1e-3 in Chariklo's case. The confinement is not permanent as a slow outward leakage of particles is observed in our simulations. This leakage can be halted by an outside moonlet with a mass of ~1e-7 - 1e-6 relative to Chariklo, corresponding to subkilometer-sized objects. With self-gravity, the ring viscosity nu increases by a factor of few in low-tau rings due to gravitational encounters. For large tau, self-gravity wakes enhance nu by a factor of ~100 compared to a non-gravitating ring, requiring ~10-fold larger mu since the threshold value increases proportional to square-root of nu.</description>

      <title>Magma Ocean Waves and Thermal Variability on Lava Worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lava worlds are rocky planets with dayside skins made molten by stellar irradiation. Tidal heating on these shortest-period planets is more than skin deep. We show how orbital eccentricities of just a few percent (within current observed bounds and maintained secularly by exterior companions) can create deep magma oceans. ``Lava tidal waves'' slosh across these oceans; we compute the multi-modal response of the ocean to tidal forcing, subject to a coastline at the day-night terminator and a parameterized viscous drag. Wave interference produces a dayside heat map that is spatially irregular and highly time-variable; hotspots can wander both east and west of the substellar point, and thermal light curves can vary and spike aperiodically, from orbit to orbit and within an orbit. Heat deposited by tides is removed in steady state by a combination of fluid, mushy, and solid-state convection in the mantle. For Earth-sized planets with sub-day periods, the entire mantle may be tidally liquified.</description>

      <title>Limit cycles and the climate history of Mars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evidence for fluvial features and standing liquid water indicate that Mars was a warmer and wetter place in its past; however, climate models have historically been unable to produce conditions to yield a warm early Mars under the faint young sun. Some models invoke thick greenhouse atmospheres to produce continuously warm conditions, but others have argued that available geologic evidence is more consistent with short-duration and transient warming events on an otherwise cold Mars. One possibility of harmonizing these perspectives is that early Mars experienced climate limit cycles that caused the climate to oscillate between short periods of warmth and prolonged periods of glaciation, due to modulation of greenhouse warming by the carbonate-silicate cycle. This study suggests that episodic limit cycling during the Noachian and Hesperian periods provides a hypothetical explanation for the timing and formation of fluvial features on Mars. A schematic time-forward trajectory of the full history of Mars is calculated using an energy balance climate model, which includes an active carbonate-silicate cycle, instellation changes due to the sun's main sequence evolution, variations in the obliquity of Mars, and supplemental warming from additional greenhouse gases beyond carbon dioxide alone. These calculations demonstrate the viability of a climate history for Mars involving episodic limit cycling to enable the formation of the valley networks at 4.1-3.5 Ga and delta features at 3.3-3.0 Ga, interspersed with cold stable climates and ending in the late Amazonian in a carbon dioxide condensation regime. This schematic climate trajectory provide a plausible narrative that remains consistent with available geologic data, and further exploration of warming mechanisms for the climate of Mars should consider the possibility of episodic transient events driven by carbonate-silicate limit cycling.</description>

      <title>Characterization of two new transiting sub-Neptunes and a terrestrial planet around M-dwarf hosts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the confirmation of three transiting exoplanets orbiting TOI-1243 (LSPM~J0902+7138), TOI-4529 (G~2--21), and TOI-5388 (Wolf~346) that were initially detected by TESS through ground-based photometry and radial velocity follow-up measurements with CARMENES. The planets present short orbital periods of $4.65$, $5.88$, and $2.59$ days, and they orbit early-M dwarfs (M2.0V, M1.5V, and M3.0V, respectively). We were able to precisely determine the radius of all three planets with a precision of $&lt; 7\, \%$, the mass of TOI-1243 b with a precision of $19\, \%$, and upper mass limits for TOI-4529 b and TOI-5388 b. The radius of TOI-1243 b is $2.33\pm0.12\, {R_{\oplus}}$, its mass is $7.7 \pm 1.5\,{M_{\oplus}}$, and the mean density is $0.61 \pm 0.15 \, {\rho_\oplus}$. The radius of TOI-4529 b is $1.77 ^{+0.09}_{-0.08} \, {R_{\oplus}}$, the $3 {\sigma}$ upper mass limit is $4.9 \, {M_{\oplus}}$, and the $3 {\sigma}$ upper density limit is $0.88\, {\rho_\oplus}$. The third planet, TOI-5388 b, is Earth-sized with a radius of $0.99 ^{+0.07}_{-0.06} \, {R_{\oplus}}$, a $3 {\sigma}$ upper mass limit of $2.2 \, {M_{\oplus}}$, and a $3 {\sigma}$ upper density limit of $2.2\, {\rho_\oplus}$. While TOI-5388 b is most probably rocky, given its Earth-like radius, TOI-1243 b and TOI-4529 b are located in a highly degenerate region in the mass-radius space. TOI-4529 b appears to lean toward a water-world composition. TOI-1243 b has enough mass to host a significant H-He envelope, although a water-world and pure rocky compositions are also consistent with the data. Our analysis indicates that future atmospheric observations using JWST can aid in determining their real composition. The sample of small planets around M dwarfs is widely used to understand planet formation and composition theories, and our study adds three planets to this sample.</description>

      <title>Functionalization of Benzene Ices by Atomic Oxygen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small aromatic molecules, including functionalized derivatives of benzene, are known to be present throughout the different stages of star and planet formation. In particular, oxygen-bearing monosubstituted aromatics, likely including phenol, have been identified in the coma of comet 67P. This suggests that, earlier in the star and planet formation evolution, icy grains may act as both reservoirs and sites of functionalization for these small aromatics. We investigate the ice-phase reactivity of singlet oxygen atoms (O($^1$D)) with benzene, using ozone as a precursor that is readily photodissociated by relatively low-energy. Our experiments show that O($^1$D) efficiently reacts with benzene, forming phenol, benzene oxide, and oxepine as the main products. Phenol formation is temperature-independent, consistent with a barrierless insertion mechanism. In contrast, the formation of benzene oxide/oxepine shows a slight temperature dependence, suggesting that additional reaction pathways involving either ground-state or excited-state oxygen atoms may contribute. In H$_2$O and \COO ice matrices we find that dilution does not suppress formation of phenol. We extrapolate an experimental upper limit for the benzene-to-phenol conversion fraction of 27-44$\%$ during the lifetime of an interstellar cloud, assuming O($^1$D) production rates based on CO$_2$ ice abundances and a cosmic-ray induced UV field. We compare these estimates with a new analysis of data from the comet 67P, where the C$_6$H$_6$O/C$_6$H$_6$ ratio is 20$\pm$6$\%$. This value lies within our estimated range, suggesting that O($^1$D)-mediated chemistry is a viable pathway for producing oxygenated aromatics in cold astrophysical ices, potentially enriching icy planetesimals with phenol and other biorelevant compounds.</description>

      <title>Exoplanet transit search at the detection limit: detection and false alarm vetting pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the primary mission goals of the Kepler space telescope was to detect Earth-like terrestrial planets in the habitable zone around Sun-like stars. These planets are at the detection limit, where the Kepler detection and vetting pipeline produced unreliable planet candidates. We present a novel pipeline that improves the removal of localized defects prior to the planet search, improves vetting at the level of individual transits and introduces a Bayes factor test statistic and an algorithm for extracting multiple candidates from a single detection run. We show with injections in the Kepler data that the introduced novelties improve pipeline's completeness at a fixed false alarm rate. We apply the pipeline to the stars with previously identified planet candidates and show that our pipeline successfully recovers the previously confirmed candidates, but flags a considerable portion of unconfirmed candidates as likely false alarms, especially in the long period, low signal-to-noise ratio regime. In particular, several known Earth-like candidates in the habitable zone, such as KOI 8063.01, 8107.01 and 8242.01, are identified as false alarms, which could have a significant impact on the estimates of $\eta_{\oplus}$, i.e., the occurrence of Earth-like planets in the habitable zone.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous thermally-driven erosion can explain dearth of dark near-Sun asteroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent models of the near-Earth asteroid population show that asteroids must be super-catastrophically destroyed when they evolve to orbits with perihelion passages well inside of Mercury's orbit. The heliocentric distances at which the disruptions typically occur are tens of solar radii, which is too far from the Sun for asteroids to be destroyed by sublimation and tidal disruption. The typical disruption distance also appears to be larger for darker asteroids. Here, by carrying out irradiance experiments in vacuum that replicate the conditions in the near-Sun environment, we show that CI meteorite simulants are destroyed within minutes when exposed to the level of solar irradiance encountered at heliocentric distances of up to about 0.2 au. Our results provide an explanation for the scarcity of dark, carbonaceous asteroids with perihelion distances less than 0.2 au, and for the observed mass-loss rate of the asteroid-like object 322P/SOHO~1 assuming its composition is similar to CI carbonaceous chondrites.</description>

      <title>Exoplanet characterization with NASA's Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>

Abstract: Exoplanet atmosphere characterization has seen revolutionary advances over the last few years, providing us with unique insights into atmospheric chemistry, dynamics and planet formation mechanisms. However, true solar system analog planets remain inaccessible. A major goal for exoplanet science over the coming decades is to observe, and characterize, temperate rocky planets and cool gas giants in orbit around solar-type stars, with the prospect of detecting signs of habitability or even life. Characterization and categorization of these planets relies on direct spectroscopic observations capable of identifying molecular species in their atmospheres; however, these observations represent a substantial engineering challenge due to the extreme contrast between a temperate, Earth-sized exoplanet and its parent star. NASA's next flagship mission, the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) - planned for launch in the mid-2040s - will boast a coronagraphic instrument capable of reaching the needed 10$^{-10}$ contrast, on an ultrastable platform enabling long integration times to achieve the required signal to noise. HWO will cover near-ultraviolet to the near-infrared wavelengths, enabling detections of key biosignature molecules and habitability indicators such as ocean glint and a vegetation `red edge'. Via early involvement in this groundbreaking observatory, including a potential UK instrument contribution, the UK exoplanet community now has an important opportunity to influence the telescope's design. To maintain our international competitiveness, we must be at the forefront of observational campaigns with HWO when it eventually launches, and this comes with the need for parallel development in laboratory astrophysics and computational modelling. Maximising our exploitation of this transformative NASA mission requires consistent financial support in these areas across the next two decades.</description>

      <title>Transiting exoplanets as the immediate future for population-level atmospheric science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transit method, during which a planet's presence is inferred by measuring the reduction in flux as it passes in front of its parent star, is a highly successful exoplanet detection and characterization technique. During transit, the small fraction of starlight that passes through a planet's atmosphere emerges with the fingerprints of atmospheric gases, aerosols and structure. During eclipse, the relatively small contribution of light from the planet itself may be observed as the planet is occulted by the star. For planets in near-edge-on, short-period orbits, observing the system throughout an entire orbit allows the varying flux from the planet to be extracted as the illuminated `dayside' rotates in and out of view. With spectroscopic observations, we can characterize not only the overall composition of the atmosphere, but also glean insights into atmospheric structure and dynamics. With over 6,000 transiting planets now discovered, such observations are currently our only window into a consistent sample of planetary atmospheres large enough to attempt a population-level study, a critical next step for our understanding of atmospheric science. The vast exoplanet population provides a laboratory for atmospheric physics, including chemistry, dynamics, cloud processes and evolution; extending these results to a larger number of targets will allow us to explore the effects of equilibrium temperature, gravity, mass and parent star type on atmospheric properties, as well as map observable trends to formation scenarios. These findings are critical for addressing STFC's Science Vision Challenge B: how do stars and planetary systems develop and how do they support the existence of life?. Here we outline how the UK must fit within this strategic context, suggest approaches and development for the future, and outline the unique capabilities and leadership of scientists across the UK.</description>

      <title>NASA Decadal Astrobiology Research and Exploration Strategy (NASA-DARES 2025) White Paper -- Habitable Worlds Observatory Living Worlds Science Cases: Research Gaps and Needs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06386</link>

Abstract: Executive Summary: The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) is the first astrophysics flagship mission with a key cross-divisional astrobiology science goal of searching for signs of life on rocky planets beyond our solar system. The Living Worlds Working Group under the Science, Technology, and Architecture Review Team (START) was charged with investigating how HWO could characterize potentially habitable exoplanets orbiting stars in the solar neighborhood, search for signs of life, and interpret potential biosignatures within a false positive and false negative framework. In particular, we focused on (1) identifying biosignatures that have spectral features in the UV-Vis-NIR wavelength range and defining their measurement requirements, (2) determining additional information needed from the planet and planet system to interpret biosignatures and assess the likelihood of false positives, and (3) assembling current knowledge of likely HWO target stars and identify which properties of host stars and systems are most critical to know in advance of HWO. The Living Worlds atmospheric biosignatures science case is considered one of the key drivers in the design of the observatory. An additional 10 astrobiology science cases were developed that collectively revealed key research gaps and needs required to fully explore the observatory parameter space and perform science return analyses. Investment in these research gaps will require coordination across the Science Mission Directorate and fall under the purview of the new Division-spanning astrobiology strategy.</description>

      <title>Simulations of Electron Beam Interactions in Brown Dwarf Atmospheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over two decades ago, the first detection of electron cyclotron maser instability (ECMI) radio emission from a brown dwarf confirmed the presence of aurorally precipitating electrons on these objects. This detection established that brown dwarfs can exhibit magnetic activity that is planetary and auroral, rather than stellar in nature. This discovery motivated ongoing observational searches for the corresponding optical, ultraviolet (UV), and infrared (IR) auroral emission expected based on solar system analogs. The continuing nondetection of such auroral emission indicates important differences exist between auroral processes on brown dwarfs and solar system planets. In this work, we implement a Monte Carlo simulation of monoenergetic electron beams interacting with brown dwarf atmospheres, as a step towards understanding the physics of brown dwarf auroral emission. We detail the algorithm and underlying assumptions, and validate against previously published Jovian results (Hiraki et al. 2008). Our results agree well with literature, with some discrepancy from our updated interaction cross sections. We demonstrate the applicability of our simulation across the range of surface gravities and effective temperatures of radio-emitting brown dwarfs. We present an analytic parameterization of interaction rates based on our finding that atmospheric column density governs the interaction profiles. We apply this parameterization to calculate the total volumetric interaction rates and energy deposition rate for representative electron beam energy spectra enabling future predictions for spectra of aurorally emitting brown dwarfs. Simulations of high energy electron interactions with substellar hydrogen-dominated atmospheres will guide observational searches for multi-wavelength auroral features beyond the solar system.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The solution space of differentially rotating polytropes with n=1 has been studied numerically. The existence of three different types of configurations: from spheroids to thick tori, hockey puck-like bodies and spheroids surrounded by a torus, separate from or merging with the central body has been proved. It has been shown that the last two types appear only at moderate degrees of rotation differentiality, sigma~2. Rigid-body or weakly differential rotation, as well as strongly differential, have not led to any "exotic" types of configurations. Many calculated configurations have had extremely large values of parameter tau, which has raised the question of their stability with respect to fragmentation.</description>

      <title>On the 3D time evolution of the dust size distribution in protostellar envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dust plays a fundamental role during protostellar collapse, disk and planet formation. Recent observations suggest that efficient dust growth may begin early, in the protostellar envelopes, potentially even before the formation of the disk. Three-dimensional models of protostellar evolution, addressing multi-size dust growth, gas and dust dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics, are required to characterize the dust evolution in the embedded stages of star formation. We aim to establish a new framework for dust evolution models, following in 3D the dust size distribution both in time and space, in MHD models describing the formation and evolution of star-disk systems, at low numerical cost. We present our work coupling the COALA dust evolution module into the code RAMSES, performing the first 3D MHD simulation of protostellar collapse including simultaneously polydisperse dust growth modeled by the Smoluchowski equation as well as dust dynamics in the terminal velocity approximation. Ice-coated micron-sized grains can rapidly grow in the envelope and survive by not entering the fragmentation regime. The evolution of the dust size distribution is highly anisotropic due to the turbulent nature of the collapse and the development of favorable locations such as outflow cavity walls, which enhance locally the dust-to-gas ratio. We analyzed the first 3D non-ideal MHD simulations that self-consistently account for the dust dynamics and growth during the protostellar stage. Very early in the lifetime of a young embedded protostar, micron-sized grains can grow, and locally the dust size distribution deviates significantly from the MRN initial shape. This new numerical method opens the perspective to treat simultaneously gas/dust dynamics and dust growth in 3D simulations at a low numerical cost for several astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>A model of the heliocentric dust ring on Venus orbit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A heliocentric dust ring on Venus orbit was discovered following observations by the Helios spacecraft, and then confirmed thanks to observations by STEREO and the Parker Solar Probe. The impact risk it poses needs to be evaluated for any spacecraft crossing the ring. This study aims to provide a first model of the dust ring, in terms of distribution of particles (including size distribution), velocity, density of the ring, and deduce a first estimation of the impact risk to spacecrafts crossing the ring. We seek to describe the orbits of dust particles in the ring. We explore a first simple model, that leads us to propose a second, more elaborate, model. This model is then populated by particles that we integrate for 2000 years. We demonstrate that the dust ring will persist over the next 2000 years, only slightly extending radially and perpendicularly to the Venus orbital plane. We show that particles tend to accumulate at Venus orbit, but that along it the differences in density is negligible. We compute the number of particles we can expect to find in the ring. Finally, as an example, we apply this model to Bepi-Colombo to obtain a first estimate of the impact flux in function of radius and mass, for radii between 2 $\mu$m and 2 cm (i.e. for masses between 10^-2 kg and 10^-14 kg). We also present the impact velocity and direction of impacts with respect to Bepi-Colombo. We are able to conclude that the ring seems to present a low risk for spacecrafts using Venus as a gravity assist.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21840v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spectroscopic parameters of methane from many different studies were gathered to improve the HITRAN database towards its 2024 version. After a validation process using high-resolution FTS and CRDS spectra, about 80,000 lines of the four most abundant isotopologues were replaced from the dyad to the triacontad regions. These changes amount to 51,000 transition wavenumbers, 18,000 line intensities, 33,000 pressure-broadening half-widths, and 3300 assignments. 44,000 new lines were added with 16,000 old lines removed, extending the database from 12,000 cm$^{-1}$ up to 14,000 cm$^{-1}$, and covering some gaps. A greater focus was brought on the pentad, octad, and tetradecad regions, targeted by several remote sensing instruments. In these regions, comparisons of spectral fits from multiple line lists were performed, taking only the parameters that provide best fit for each line. In the $\nu _3$ band, in addition to replacing the previous values, speed-independent pressure broadening parameters of $^{12}$CH$_4$ were gathered and used to fit Pad\'e-approximant functions. These functions then replaced any outdated experimental data in $\nu _3$, missing data in the new lines, as well as the values that were determined to be outside their physical boundaries. The CH$_3$D broadening parameters were replaced in the same manner, for missing and low or high values, using a semi-empirical formula instead.</description>

      <title>JCMT Constraints on the Early-Time HCN and CO Emission and HCN Temporal Evolution of 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interstellar objects (ISOs), particularly those with cometary activity, provide unique insight into the primordial physical and chemical conditions present during the formation of the planetary system in which they originated. Observations in the sub-mm regime allow for direct measurements of several parent molecules released from the comet nucleus into the coma. Here we present observations of the third ISO, 3I/ATLAS, with the `\=U`\=u heterodyne receiver on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), which targeted emission from HCN($J = 3 - 2$) and CO($J = 2 - 1$). Our observations, taken between 16 July 2025 and 21 July 2025 (UT), when 3I/ATLAS was at a heliocentric distance between 4.01 and 3.84 au, provide the earliest sub-mm constraints on its activity. We do not detect HCN or CO in these epochs, with 3$\sigma$ upper-limits on the production rates of $Q(HCN) &lt; 1.7 \times 10^{24}$ s$^{-1}$ at $r_h = 4.01 - 3.97$ au and $Q(CO) &lt; 1.1 \times 10^{27}$ s$^{-1}$ at $r_h = 3.94 - 3.84$ au, respectively. We combine this HCN limit with later JCMT observations of HCN to constrain its temporal evolution. Fitting the HCN detections with a $Q(HCN) \propto r_h^{-n}$ model and accounting for the upper-limits yields $n = 12.7^{+6.9}_{-2.5}$. This slope is steeper than those of typical Solar System comets, but consistent with the production rate slopes measured for other species in the coma of 3I/ATLAS.</description>

Abstract: Extensive rovibrational line lists are constructed for 12 isotopologues of carbon dioxide: $^{12}$C$^{16}$O$_2$, $^{13}$C$^{16}$O$_2$, $^{12}$C$^{17}$O$_2$, $^{13}$C$^{17}$O$_2$, $^{12}$C$^{18}$O$_2$, $^{13}$C$^{18}$O$_2$, $^{16}$O$^{12}$C$^{17}$O, $^{16}$O$^{12}$C$^{18}$O, $^{16}$O$^{13}$C$^{17}$O, $^{16}$O$^{13}$C$^{18}$O, $^{17}$O$^{12}$C$^{18}$O, and $^{17}$O$^{13}$C$^{18}$O. The variational program TROVE was employed together with an exact kinetic energy operator, accurate empirical potential energy surface (Ames-2) and the ab initio dipole moment surface Ames-2021-40K. Empirical energy levels from the most recent MARVEL analyses, as well as from the HITRAN and CDSD databases, are used to replace calculated values where available. The line lists are further supplemented by assigning AFGL quantum numbers using machine-learning based estimators. The resulting data were employed to generate opacities with four radiative transfer codes, TauREx, ARCiS, NEMESIS, and petitRADTRANS, both for individual isotopologues and for CO$_2$ at terrestrial isotopic natural abundance. All line lists and associated data are available at www.exomol.com.</description>

      <title>Vetting and False Positive Analysis of TOI 864.01: Evidence for a Likely Hierarchical Eclipsing Binary Masked by Dilution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02171v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed vetting analysis of the TESS candidate TOI 864.01, initially identified as a potential ultra-short-period ($P \approx 0.52$ d) Earth-sized planet orbiting an M-dwarf. Using 12 sectors of TESS photometry spanning a multi-year baseline, we recover a robust periodic transit-like signal. While the recovered transit depth is attenuated by detrending ($\approx 158$ ppm), the SPOC pipeline reports an undiluted depth of $\approx 640$ ppm. Stellar characterization based on Gaia DR3 astrometry yields a nominally single-star solution (RUWE = 1.18), highlighting the limitations of astrometric vetting for tight companions. Incorporating archival high-resolution imaging from the TESS Follow-up Observing Program (TFOP SG1) reveals a stellar companion at a separation of 0.04", unresolved by both Gaia and TESS. Accounting for this close contaminant renders statistical validation inapplicable, as False Positive Probability calculations fail to converge in this regime of extreme dilution. Bayesian model comparison between planetary and eclipsing binary scenarios yields an inconclusive result ($\Delta \ln Z \approx 0.09$), consistent with the strong degeneracy introduced by unresolved blending. Ground-based follow-up photometry further supports significant dilution, with a measured transit depth ($\approx 0.37$ ppt) shallower than predicted under an undiluted planetary scenario ($\approx 0.64$ ppt). Notably, ground-based observations also reveal a transit timing offset of 6.3 minutes late compared to the SPOC ephemeris, further supporting a non-planetary interpretation. Taken together, the available evidence favors a hierarchical eclipsing binary interpretation. We therefore classify TOI 864.01 as a probable False Positive and recommend its retirement from planetary candidate lists.</description>

      <title>Energetic particles accelerated via turbulent magnetic reconnection in protoplanetary discs - I. Ionisation rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. Ionisation controls the chemistry, thermal balance, and magnetic coupling in protoplanetary discs. However, standard ionisation vectors such as stellar UV, X-rays, Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) might not be efficient enough, as UV/X-rays are attenuated rapidly with depth, while GCRs are modulated. Turbulence-induced magnetic reconnection in disc atmospheric layers offers a physically motivated, in situ source of energetic particles (EPs) that has never been considered. Aims. We quantify the ionisation and heating produced by EPs accelerated by turbulent reconnection, identify where they dominate over X-rays and GCRs, and determine energetic thresholds for their relevance. We provide scalable diagnostics tied to the local energy budget. Methods. We adopt a Fermi-like acceleration model with parameters linked to a turbulent reconnection geometry trigger by the magneto-rotational instability, yielding a steady-state energy distribution of the EP forming a power-law of index $p=2.5$. We propagate electrons and protons through the disc and compute primary and secondary ionisation and associated heating on a fiducial T Tauri disc model background. The non-thermal normalisation is set by the fraction of local viscous accretion energy dissipation channelled to EPs, parametrised by $\kappa$. Results. For $\kappa\gtrsim 0.4\%$, EPs ionisation overpass standard ionisation sources in the disc atmosphere and intermediate/deep layers out to radii of a few tens of astronomical units. Even at $\kappa\sim 0.025\%$, EPs contribute at the few-percent level, thus are chemically and dynamically relevant. These results identify EPs accelerated by turbulence-induced magnetic reconnection as a rather robust, disc-internal ionisation channel that should be included in thermo-chemical models of protoplanetary discs.</description>
