      <title>Risk Premia in the Bitcoin Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on options and realized returns, we analyze risk premia in the Bitcoin market through the lens of the Pricing Kernel (PK). We identify that: 1) The projected PK into Bitcoin returns is W-shaped and steep in the negative returns region; 2) Negative Bitcoin returns account for 33% of the total Bitcoin index premium (BP) in contrast to 70% of S&amp;P500 equity premium explained by negative returns. Applying a novel clustering algorithm to the collection of estimated Bitcoin risk-neutral densities, we find that risk premia vary over time as a function of two distinct market volatility regimes. In the low-volatility regime, the PK projection is steeper for negative returns. It has a more pronounced W-shape than the unconditional one, implying particularly high BP for both extreme positive and negative returns and a high Variance Risk Premium (VRP). In high-volatility states, the BP attributable to positive and negative returns is more balanced, and the VRP is lower. Overall, Bitcoin investors are more worried about variance and downside risk in low-volatility states.</description>

      <title>The Economic Consequences of Being Widowed by War: A Life-Cycle Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite millions of war widows worldwide, little is known about the economic consequences of being widowed by war. We use life history data from West Germany to show that war widowhood increased women's employment immediately after World War II but led to lower employment rates later in life. War widows, therefore, carried a double burden of employment and childcare while their children were young but left the workforce when their children reached adulthood. We show that the design of compensation policies likely explains this counterintuitive life-cycle pattern and examine potential spillovers to the next generation.</description>

      <title>Stylized facts in money markets: an empirical analysis of the eurozone data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the secured transactions recorded within the Money Markets Statistical Reporting database of the European Central Bank, we test several stylized facts regarding interbank market of the 47 largest banks in the eurozone. We observe that the surge in the volume of traded evergreen repurchase agreements followed the introduction of the LCR regulation and we measure a rate of collateral re-use consistent with the literature. Regarding the topology of the interbank network, we confirm the high level of network stability but observe a higher density and a higher in- and out-degree symmetry than what is reported for unsecured markets.</description>

      <title>Economic Anthropology in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the intersection of economic anthropology and generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). It examines how large language models (LLMs) can simulate human decision-making and the inductive biases present in AI research. The study introduces two AI models: C.A.L.L.O.N. (Conventionally Average Late Liberal ONtology) and M.A.U.S.S. (More Accurate Understanding of Society and its Symbols). The former is trained on standard data, while the latter is adapted with anthropological knowledge. The research highlights how anthropological training can enhance LLMs' ability to recognize diverse economic systems and concepts. The findings suggest that integrating economic anthropology with AI can provide a more pluralistic understanding of economics and improve the sustainability of non-market economic systems.</description>

      <title>LTPNet Integration of Deep Learning and Environmental Decision Support Systems for Renewable Energy Demand Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Against the backdrop of increasingly severe global environmental changes, accurately predicting and meeting renewable energy demands has become a key challenge for sustainable business development. Traditional energy demand forecasting methods often struggle with complex data processing and low prediction accuracy. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel approach that combines deep learning techniques with environmental decision support systems. The model integrates advanced deep learning techniques, including LSTM and Transformer, and PSO algorithm for parameter optimization, significantly enhancing predictive performance and practical applicability. Results show that our model achieves substantial improvements across various metrics, including a 30% reduction in MAE, a 20% decrease in MAPE, a 25% drop in RMSE, and a 35% decline in MSE. These results validate the model's effectiveness and reliability in renewable energy demand forecasting. This research provides valuable insights for applying deep learning in environmental decision support systems.</description>

      <title>Reducing annotator bias by belief elicitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crowdsourced annotations of data play a substantial role in the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It is broadly recognised that annotations of text data can contain annotator bias, where systematic disagreement in annotations can be traced back to differences in the annotators' backgrounds. Being unaware of such annotator bias can lead to representational bias against minority group perspectives and therefore several methods have been proposed for recognising bias or preserving perspectives. These methods typically require either a substantial number of annotators or annotations per data instance. In this study, we propose a simple method for handling bias in annotations without requirements on the number of annotators or instances. Instead, we ask annotators about their beliefs of other annotators' judgements of an instance, under the hypothesis that these beliefs may provide more representative and less biased labels than judgements. The method was examined in two controlled, survey-based experiments involving Democrats and Republicans (n=1,590) asked to judge statements as arguments and then report beliefs about others' judgements. The results indicate that bias, defined as systematic differences between the two groups of annotators, is consistently reduced when asking for beliefs instead of judgements. Our proposed method therefore has the potential to reduce the risk of annotator bias, thereby improving the generalisability of AI systems and preventing harm to unrepresented socio-demographic groups, and we highlight the need for further studies of this potential in other tasks and downstream applications.</description>

      <title>Three connected problems: principal with multiple agents in cooperation, Principal--Agent with Mckean--Vlasov dynamics and multitask Principal--Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15818v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address three Principal--Agent problems in a moral hazard context and show that they are connected. We start by studying the problem of Principal with multiple Agents in cooperation. The term cooperation is manifested here by the fact that the agents optimize their criteria through Pareto equilibria. We show that as the number of agents tends to infinity, the principal's value function converges to the value function of a McKean--Vlasov control problem. Using the solution to this McKean--Vlasov control problem, we derive a constructive method for obtaining approximately optimal contracts for the principal's problem with multiple agents in cooperation. In a second step, we show that the problem of Principal with multiple Agents turns out to also converge, when the number of agents goes to infinity, towards a new Principal--Agent problem which is the Principal--Agent problem with Mckean--Vlasov dynamics. This is a Principal--Agent problem where the agent--controlled production follows a Mckean-Vlasov dynamics and the contract can depend of the distribution of the production. The value function of the principal in this setting is equivalent to that of the same McKean--Vlasov control problem from the multi--agent scenario. Furthermore, we show that an optimal contract can be constructed from the solution to this McKean--Vlasov control problem. We conclude by discussing, in a simple example, the connection of these problems with the multitask Principal--Agent problem which is a situation when a principal delegates multiple tasks that can be correlated to a single agent.</description>

      <title>Toward a More Populous Online Platform: The Economic Impacts of Compensated Reviews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.11051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many companies nowadays offer compensation to online reviews (called compensated reviews), expecting to increase the volume of their non-compensated reviews and overall rating. Does this strategy work? On what subjects or topics does this strategy work the best? These questions have still not been answered in the literature but draw substantial interest from the industry. In this paper, we study the effect of compensated reviews on non-compensated reviews by utilizing online reviews on 1,240 auto shipping companies over a ten-year period from a transportation website. Because some online reviews have missing information on their compensation status, we first develop a classification algorithm to differentiate compensated reviews from non-compensated reviews by leveraging a machine learning-based identification process, drawing upon the unique features of the compensated reviews. From the classification results, we empirically investigate the effects of compensated reviews on non-compensated. Our results indicate that the number of compensated reviews does indeed increase the number of non-compensated reviews. In addition, the ratings of compensated reviews positively affect the ratings of non-compensated reviews. Moreover, if the compensated reviews feature the topic or subject of a car shipping function, the positive effect of compensated reviews on non-compensated ones is the strongest. Besides methodological contributions in text classification and empirical modeling, our study provides empirical evidence on how to prove the effectiveness of compensated online reviews in terms of improving the platform's overall online reviews and ratings. Also, it suggests a guideline for utilizing compensated reviews to their full strength, that is, with regard to featuring certain topics or subjects in these reviews to achieve the best outcome.</description>

      <title>Do Unions Shape Political Ideologies at Work?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.02637v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Labor unions' greatest potential for political influence likely arises from their direct connection to millions of individuals at the workplace. There, they may mobilize and change the ideological positions of both unionizing workers and their non-unionizing management. In this paper, we analyze the workplace-level impact of unionization on workers' and managers' political campaign contributions in the United States from 1980 to 2016. To do so, we link establishment-level union election data with transaction-level campaign contributions to federal and local candidates. Using a difference-in-differences design, validated through regression discontinuity tests and a novel instrumental variable approach, we find that unionization leads to a leftward shift of campaign contributions. Unionization increases the support for Democrats relative to Republicans not only among workers but also among managers, suggesting that it does not exacerbate political cleavages between the two groups. Our findings are not driven by compositional changes of the workforce and are stronger in establishments where, after union certification, the employer and the union agree on a collective bargaining agreement.</description>

      <title>Integrating solid direct air capture systems with green hydrogen production: Economic synergy of sector coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00665v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the global pursuit of sustainable energy solutions, mitigating carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions stands as a pivotal challenge. With escalating atmospheric CO2 levels, the imperative of direct air capture (DAC) systems becomes evident. Simultaneously, green hydrogen (GH) emerges as a pivotal medium for renewable energy. Nevertheless, the substantial expenses associated with these technologies impede widespread adoption, primarily due to significant installation costs and underutilized operational advantages when deployed independently. Integration through sector coupling enhances system efficiency and sustainability, while shared power sources and energy storage devices offer additional economic benefits. In this study, we assess the economic viability of polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzers versus alkaline electrolyzers within the context of sector coupling. Our findings indicate that combining GH production with solid DAC systems yields significant economic advantages, with approximately a 10% improvement for PEM electrolyzers and a 20% enhancement for alkaline electrolyzers. These results highlight a substantial opportunity to improve the efficiency and economic viability of renewable energy and green hydrogen initiatives, thereby facilitating the broader adoption of cleaner technologies.</description>

      <title>The Pass-through of Retail Crime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper shows that retailers increase prices in response to organized retail crime. We match store-level crime data to scanner data from the universe of transactions for cannabis retailers in Washington state. Using quasi-experimental variation from robberies and burglaries, we find a 1.5-1.8% price increase at victimized stores and nearby competitors. This rise is not driven by short-to-medium-term demand changes but is consistent with an own-cost shock. Effects are larger for independent stores and less concentrated markets. We estimate that crime imposes a 1% "hidden" unit tax on affected stores, implying $33.9 million additional social costs, primarily borne by consumers.</description>
