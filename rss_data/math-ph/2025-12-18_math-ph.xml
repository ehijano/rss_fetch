      <title>Characterising the sets of quantum states with non-negative Wigner function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For Hilbert spaces $\mathcal H\subseteq L^2(\mathbb R)$ we consider the convex sets $\mathcal D_+(\mathcal H)$ of Wigner-positive states (WPS), i.e.~density matrices over $\mathcal H$ with non-negative Wigner function. We investigate the topological structure of these sets, namely concerning closure, compactness, interior and boundary (in a relative topology induced by the trace norm). We also study their geometric structure and construct minimal sets of states that generate $\mathcal D_+(\mathcal H)$ through convex combinations. If $\mathcal H$ is finite-dimensional, the existence of such sets follows from a central result in convex analysis, namely the Krein-Milman theorem. In the infinite-dimensional case $\mathcal H=L^2(\mathbb R)$ this is not so, due to lack of compactness of the set $\mathcal D_+(\mathcal H)$. Nevertheless, we prove that a Krein-Milman theorem holds in this case, which allows us to extend most of the results concerning the sets of generators to the infinite-dimensional setting. Finally, we study the relation between the finite and infinite-dimensional sets of WPS, and prove that the former provide a hierarchy of closed subsets, which are also proper faces of the latter. These results provide a basis for an operational characterisation of the extreme points of the sets of WPS, which we undertake in a companion paper. Our work offers a unified perspective on the topological and geometric properties of the sets of WPS in finite and infinite dimensions, along with explicit constructions of minimal sets of generators.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Time from a Twisted Spectral Triple in Almost-Commutative Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This proceeding presents a synthesis of recent results on the emergence of pseudo-Riemannian structures from twisted spectral triples within the almostcommutative framework. It provides a unified algebraic mechanism for addressing the Lorentzian signature problem, demonstrating how the almost-commutative structure underlying the noncommutative Standard Model of particle physics may give rise to Lorentzian spectral triple from a purely Riemannian setting. This notably offers an alternative to Wick rotation, provided by a notion of morphism connecting twisted and pseudo-Riemannian spectral triples.</description>

      <title>Accuracy of the Yee FDTD Scheme for Normal Incidence of Plane Waves on Dielectric and Magnetic Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the accuracy of the standard Yee finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) scheme for simulating normal incidence of harmonic plane waves on planar interfaces between lossless, linear, homogeneous, isotropic media. We consider two common FDTD interface models based on different staggered-grid placements of material parameters. For each, we derive discrete analogs of the Fresnel reflection and transmission coefficients by formulating effective boundary conditions that emerge from the Yee update equations. A key insight is that the staggered grid implicitly spreads the material discontinuity over a transition layer of one spatial step, leading to systematic deviations from exact theory. We quantify these errors via a transition-layer model and provide (i) qualitative criteria predicting the direction and nature of deviations, and (ii) rigorous error estimates for both weak and strong impedance contrasts. Finally, we examine the role of the Courant number in modulating these errors, revealing conditions under which numerical dispersion and interface discretization jointly influence accuracy.</description>

      <title>Extending the explicit constraint force method to inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the explicit constraint force method (ECFM) was introduced as a principled approach to solution reconstruction in the presence of missing physics. In solution reconstruction, parameters of a physical model are estimated from sparse measurement data as a means to obtain the full solution field. In contrast, inverse problems target the missing parameters and estimate the solution along the way. Noting the similarity of the mathematical formulations of these two tasks, we investigate the use of ECFM to solve inverse problems. First, we compare the ECFM formulation of the inverse problem to a standard approach using two numerical examples. The first example provides an extension of ECFM to dynamic problems, and the second offers a novel approach to treat noisy measurement data. Next, we introduce a method to solve inverse problems for which the parameterized model has stochastic components. This approach is based on constraint forces and the polynomial chaos expansion, and is illustrated with another numerical example. Finally, we discuss extensions of ECFM to recover missing boundary conditions and domain geometries from measurement data, which are shown to be special cases of problems treated previously in the literature. The purpose of this work is to extend the mathematical framework of ECFM to novel applications and to gauge the method's viability as an alternative strategy for inverse analysis.</description>

      <title>Heisenberg-Euler and the Quantum Dilogarithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A dispersion integral representation of the Heisenberg-Euler QED effective lagrangian is derived, with Faddeev's quantum dilogarithm as a generalized Borel kernel. The nonperturbative imaginary part of the effective lagrangian is expressed as the quantum dilogarithm, while the real part has the form of a dispersion integral involving both the quantum dilogarithm and its modular dual, a manifestation of electromagnetic duality. The Heisenberg-Euler effective lagrangian generates all one-loop QED scattering amplitudes in a constant external field, with the Lorentz invariants of the constant background electromagnetic field playing the role of the Mandelstam variables in conventional QED dispersion theory.</description>

      <title>Graph-theoretical search for integrable multistate Landau-Zener models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for exactly solvable models is an evergreen topic in theoretical physics. In the context of multistate Landau-Zener models -- $N$-state quantum systems with linearly time-dependent Hamiltonians -- the theory of integrability provides a framework for identifying new solvable cases. In particular, it was proved that the integrability of a specific class known as the multitime Landau-Zener (MTLZ) models guarantees their exact solvability. A key finding was that an $N$-state MTLZ model can be represented by data defined on an $N$-vertex graph. While known host graphs for MTLZ models include hypercubes, fans, and their Cartesian products, no other families have been discovered, leading to the conjecture that these are the only possibilities. In this work, we conduct a systematic graph-theoretical search for integrable models within the MTLZ class. By first identifying minimal structures that a graph must contain to host an MTLZ model, we formulate an efficient algorithm to systematically search for candidate graphs for MTLZ models. Implementing this algorithm using computational software, we enumerate all candidate graphs with up to $N = 13$ vertices and perform an in-depth analysis of those with $N \le 11$. Our results corroborate the aforementioned conjecture for graphs up to $11$ vertices. For even larger graphs, we propose a specific family, termed descendants of ``$(0,2)$-graphs'', as promising candidates that may violate the conjecture above. Our work can serve as a guideline to identify new exactly solvable multistate Landau-Zener models in the future.</description>

      <title>Quantization in mixed polarization via transverse Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a prequantizable K\"ahler manifold $(M, \omega, L)$, Chan-Leung-Li constructed a genuine (non-asymptotic) action of a subalgebra of the Berezin-Toeplitz star product on $H^0(M, L^{\otimes k})$ for each level $k$ [14]. We extend their framework to any non-singular polarization $P$ by developing a theory of transverse differential operators associated to $P$:
  (1) For any pair of locally free $P$-modules $E, E'$, we construct a Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt isomorphism for the bundle $\widetilde{D}(E, E')$ of transverse differential operators from $E$ to $E'$. When $E, E'$ are trivial rank-$1$ $P$-modules, this recovers the PBW theorem of Laurent-Gengoux-Sti\'enon-Xu [29] for the Lie pair $(TM_\mathbb{C}, P)$.
  (2) Using these PBW isomorphisms, we show that the Grothendieck connections on the transeverse jet bundle of $L^{\otimes k}$ give rise to a deformation quantization $(C_M^\infty[[\hbar]], \star)$ together with a sheaf of subalgebras $C_{M, \hbar}^{&lt;\infty}$ that acts on $P$-polarized sections of $L^{\otimes k}$. We obtain a geometric interpretation of $(C_{M, \hbar}^{&lt;\infty}, \star)$ by evaluating at $\hbar = \tfrac{\sqrt{-1}}{k}$, yielding a sheaf $O_k^{(&lt;\infty)}$, and proving that $O_k^{(&lt;\infty)} \cong \widetilde{D}_{L^{\otimes k}}$ as sheaves of filtered algebras, where $\widetilde{D}_{L^{\otimes k}}$ is the sheaf of transverse differential operators on $L^{\otimes k}$. When $P$ is a K\"ahler polarization, this recovers the result of Chan-Leung-Li [14].
  As an application, we study symplectic tori and derive asymptotic expansions for the Toeplitz-type operators in real polarization introduced in [35].</description>

Abstract: A Riemannian metric is termed a Hessian metric if in some coordinate system it can be locally represented as the Hessian quadratic form of some locally defined smooth potential function. Under very mild extra technical conditions, we first theoretically describe the potentials of flat Hessian metrics on surfaces, and then construct these potentials explicitly using methods from integrable systems.</description>

      <title>Composite N-Q-S: Serial/Parallel Instrument Axioms, Bipartite Order-Effect Bounds, and a Monitored Lindblad Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a composite operational architecture for sequential quantum measurements that (i) gives a tight bipartite order-effect bound with an explicit equality set characterized on the Halmos two-subspace block, (ii) upgrades Doeblin-type minorization to composite instruments and proves a product lower bound for the operational Doeblin constants, yielding data-driven exponential mixing rates, (iii) derives a diamond-norm commutator bound that quantifies how serial and parallel rearrangements influence observable deviations, and (iv) establishes a monitored Lindblad limit that links discrete look-return loops to continuous-time GKLS dynamics under transparent assumptions. Building on the GKLS framework of Gorini, Kossakowski, Sudarshan, Lindblad, Davies, Spohn, and later work of Fagnola-Rebolledo and Lami et al., we go beyond asymptotic statements by providing finite-sample certificates for the minorization parameter via exact binomial intervals and propagating them to rigorous bounds on the number of interaction steps required to attain a prescribed accuracy. A minimal qubit toy model and CSV-based scripts are supplied for full reproducibility. Our results position order-effect control and operational mixing on a single quantitative axis, from equality windows for pairs of projections to certified network mixing under monitoring. The framework targets readers in quantum information and quantum foundations who need explicit constants that are estimable from data and transferable to device-level guarantees.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of the $q$-deformed Kittel--Shore model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kittel--Shore Hamiltonian characterizes $N$ spins with identical long-range interactions, and the $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ coalgebra has been proven to be a symmetry of this model, which can be exactly solved. By using quantum groups and, in particular, $\mathfrak{su}_{q}(2)$, this Hamiltonian was deformed. In this work, we study the thermodynamic properties of this deformed model for spin-$1/2$ particles. In particular, we discuss how this deformation affects the specific heat, magnetic susceptibility, magnetisation, and phase transitions as a function of the parameter $q$ of the deformation and compare them with those of the undeformed model. Deformation was found to shift the thermodynamic behaviours to higher temperatures and alter the phase transitions. The potential applications of this $q$-deformed model for describing few-spin quantum systems with non-identical couplings are discussed.</description>

Abstract: This paper gives an algebraic presentation of an algebra called the fused permutations algebra in the one-boundary case. It is obtained through a detailed study of the degenerate cyclotomic Hecke algebra. In particular, we prove that the fused permutations algebra is a quotient of the degenerate cyclotomic affine Hecke algebra, and we also describe a basis combinatorially in terms of signed permutations with avoiding patterns. In order to understand this quotient, we study the primitive idempotents of this degenerate cyclotomic affine Hecke algebra.</description>

      <title>A moment model of shallow granular flows with variable friction laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a modelling framework for granular flows based on the shallow water moment equations on inclined planes. Under the assumption of a polynomial expansion of the velocity field, the model extends the classical shallow water equations to vertically variable velocity profiles. The friction effects, which are captured through the strain-rate tensor, are incorporated into the model in two terms, the bulk and bottom friction. We propose a modelling procedure to incorporate general friction laws into our framework and exemplify this combining the Manning, Coulomb, Savage-Hutter, and $\mu(I)$-rheology friction models in our modeling framework. Moreover, we develop a path-conservative finite volume numerical scheme based on the polynomial viscosity matrix method to properly handle the stiffness of the source terms. Numerical simulations are presented for different models of friction, including the case of wet-dry fronts.</description>

      <title>A plethora of fully localised solitary waves for the full-dispersion Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The KP-I equation arises as a weakly nonlinear model equation for gravity-capillary waves with Bond number $\beta&gt;1/3$, also called strong surface tension. This equation has recently been shown to have a family of nondegenerate, symmetric `fully localised' or `lump' solitary waves which decay to zero in all spatial directions. The full-dispersion KP-I equation is obtained by retaining the exact dispersion relation in the modelling from the water-wave problem. In this paper we show that the FDKP-I equation also has a family of symmetric fullly localised solitary waves which are obtained by casting it as a perturbation of the KP-I equation and applying a suitable variant of the implicit-function theorem.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mixing and Benjamini-Schramm Convergence of Hyperbolic Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study compact hyperbolic surfaces and multiplicative observables, establishing a large-scale analogue of Zelditch's quantum mixing theorem with hypotheses that hold for both arithmetic and Weil-Petersson random surfaces of large genus. This complements the large-scale quantum ergodicity theorems of Le Masson and Sahlsten, which themselves serve as large-scale analogues of the quantum ergodicity theorem of Shnirelman, Zelditch, and de Verdiere, thereby providing a more complete picture of the asymptotic behaviour of observables in the large-scale limit. Our approach does not rely on ball averaging operators or Nevo's ergodic theorem. Instead, we introduce a new method based on the hyperbolic wave equation and the quantitative exponential mixing of the geodesic flow established by Ratner and Matheus.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit of the complex mobility matrix for the random conductance model on $\mathbb{T}^d_N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a continuous-time random walk on the $d$-dimensional torus $\mathbb{T}^d_{N}=\mathbb{Z}^d/N \mathbb{Z}^d$, possibly with long-range, but finite, jumps. The law of the jumps is regulated by a random environment $\xi$ yielding a stationary and ergodic field of random conductances. The complex mobility matrix $\sigma_N^\xi(\omega)$ measures the linear response of the random walk to a $\cos(\omega t)$-type oscillating external field. By investigating the homogenization properties of the medium, and assuming in addition that the conductances have finite second moment, we show that, for almost every realization of the environment $\xi$, the complex mobility matrix $\sigma_N^\xi(\omega)$ converges as $N\to+\infty$ to a deterministic limiting matrix $\sigma(\omega)$ and provide different characterizations of $\sigma(\omega)$.</description>

Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime number. We introduce symplectic actions of $p$-adic analytic Lie groups on $p$-adic symplectic manifolds. Then we show that any $p$-adic symplectic action $G\times(M,\omega)\to(M,\omega)$ has a momentum map $\mu:M\to\mathfrak{g}^*$, and that a proper $p$-adic symplectic action is Hamiltonian if and only if every orbit is isotropic. We conclude by defining $p$-adic symplectic toric manifolds, by analogy with the real case.</description>

      <title>What does it mean for a 3D star-shaped scatterer to be small in the time domain?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the frequency domain wave scattering problems, obstacles can be effectively replaced by point scatterers as soon as the wavelength of the incident wave exceeds significantly their diameter. The situation is less clear in the time domain, where recent works suggest the presence of an additional temporal scale that quantifies the smallness of the obstacle. In this paper we argue that this is not necessarily the case, and that it is possible to construct asymptotic models with an error that does not deteriorate in time, at least in the case of a sound-soft scattering problem by a star-shaped obstacle in 3D.</description>

      <title>A random purification channel for arbitrary symmetries with applications to fermions and bosons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The random purification channel maps n copies of any mixed quantum state to n copies of a random purification of the state. We generalize this construction to arbitrary symmetries: for any group G of unitaries, we construct a quantum channel that maps states contained in the algebra generated by G to random purifications obtained by twirling over G. In addition to giving a surprisingly concise proof of the original random purification theorem, our result implies the existence of fermionic and bosonic Gaussian purification channels. As applications, we obtain the first tomography protocol for fermionic Gaussian states that scales optimally with the number of modes and the error, as well as an improved property test for this class of states.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study the simplest example of the landscape of conformal field theories: one-dimensional CFTs with finite-dimensional state space. Following the definition of quantum field theory given by G. Segal, we formulate the condition under which a one-dimensional QFT (quantum mechanics) possesses conformal symmetry, and we give a complete classification of conformal Hamiltonians with finite rank. It turns out that correlation functions in such theories are polynomial functions of the underlying geometric data. Moreover, the one-dimensional conformal Ward identities determine their scaling behavior, so that the correlators of the conformal observables are, in fact, homogeneous polynomials.</description>

      <title>Teleportation=Translation: Continuous recovery of black hole information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The \textit{Teleportation=Translation} conjecture posits that the recovery of information from a black hole is dual to a geometric translation in the emergent spacetime. In this paper, we establish this equivalence by constructing a continuous family of unitaries that bridges the discrete algebraic teleportation protocol and modular flow. We resolve the obstruction of dynamic idempotency, inherent in Type III von Neumann algebras, by employing the Haagerup-Kosaki crossed-product construction. This lift to the semifinite envelope yields a canonical, dynamically consistent path whose unique self-adjoint generator $\tilde{G}$ is proven to be exactly twice the modular Hamiltonian difference, $\tilde{G}=2(K_{\tilde{\mathcal{M}}}-K_{\tilde{\mathcal{N}}})$. We establish this identity as a closed operator equivalence using Nelson's analytic vector theorem and quantify its structural robustness via Kosaki's non-commutative $L^p$ theory. Our results provide a concrete analytic mechanism for probing emergent geometry from quantum information, offering a kinematic framework naturally extendable to include gravitational back-reaction.</description>

      <title>A Family of Horizon-penetrating Coordinate Systems for the Schwarzschild Black Hole Geometry with Cauchy Temporal Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2009.01756v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new family of horizon-penetrating coordinate systems for the Schwarzschild black hole geometry featuring time coordinates that are Cauchy temporal functions for which the level sets are smooth, asymptotically flat, spacelike Cauchy hypersurfaces. Coordinate systems of this kind are well suited for the study of the temporal evolution of matter and radiation fields in the joined exterior and interior regions of the Schwarzschild black hole geometry, whereas the associated foliations can be employed as initial data sets for the globally hyperbolic development under the Einstein flow. For their construction, we formulate an explicit method that utilizes the geometry of - and structures inherent in - the Penrose diagram of the Schwarzschild black hole geometry, thus relying on the corresponding metrical product structure. As an example, we consider an integrated algebraic sigmoid function as the basis for the determination of such a coordinate system. Finally, we generalize our results to the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole geometry up to the Cauchy horizon. The geometric construction procedure presented here can be adapted to yield similar coordinate systems for various other spacetimes with the same metrical product structure.</description>

Abstract: We present twistor BV actions that encompasses many classically consistent bosonic holomorphic twistorial higher-spin theories with vanishing cosmological constant. Upon quantization, these actions are shown to be quantum consistent, i.e. no gauge anomaly, for some subclasses of twistorial higher-spin theories. Anomaly-free twistorial theories can be identified through an index theorem, which is a higher-spin extension of the Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch index theorem. We also discuss the anomaly cancellation mechanisms on twistor space to render anomalous theories quantum consistent at one loop.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a three-dimensional quantum field theory with an infinite-dimensional symmetry, realized explicitly through a centrally extended affine graded Lie algebra. This symmetry is a direct three-dimensional generalization of the chiral symmetry in the Wess-Zumino-Witten model. Upon performing radial quantization, we construct the Fock space of the theory and, via a three-dimensional analogue of the state-operator correspondence, we demonstrate that the algebra of local operators is endowed with the structure of a raviolo vertex algebra. Accordingly, this setup provides a framework for extending the methods of two-dimensional conformal field theory to three dimensions, and we expect it to lay the groundwork for exact methods in three-dimensional quantum field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore algebraic relations on Vassiliev knot invariants related with correlators in the 3-dimensional Chern--Simons theory. Vassiliev invariants form infinite-dimensional algebra. We focus on $k$-parametric knot families with Vassiliev invariants being polynomials in family parameters. We conjecture that such 1-parametric algebra of Vassiliev invariants is always finitely generated, while in the case of more parameters, we provide example of the knot family with infinite number of generators. Inside a knot family, there appear extra algebraic relations on Vassiliev invariants. We show that there are $\leq k$ algebraically independent Vassiliev invariants for $k$-parametric knot family. However, in all our examples, the number of algebraically independent Vassiliev invariants is exactly $k$, and it is open question if there exists a $k$-parametric knot family with a fewer number of algebraically independent Vassiliev invariants. We also demonstrate that a complete knot invariant of some $k$-parametric knot families consists of $k$ Vassiliev invariants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a positively curved FLRW spacetime as a background in which a nonrelativistic quantum particle propagates according to the Schroedinger equation. The probability fluid for the corresponding quantum states is taken as a model for the cosmological fluid filling this FLRW Universe. The Hamiltonian operator governing this fictitious particle is proportional to the Laplacian operator derived from the FLRW metric, while the mass of the particle equals the overall matter of the Universe (baryonic and dark). A complete, orthonormal set of quantum eigenstates of the Hamiltonian is obtained. Restricting to radially symmetric states, the latter are then used to compute matrix elements and expectation values of two observables for which quantum operators are identified, namely, the cosmological constant and the gravitational Boltzmann entropy. This entropy is regarded as corresponding to a positively-curved FLRW geometry when the cosmological fluid filling the Universe occupies a given quantum state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In cosmology, a basic explanation of the observed concentration of mass in singular structures is provided by the Zeldovich approximation, which takes the form of free-streaming flow for perturbations of a uniform Einstein-de Sitter universe in co-moving coordinates. The adhesion model suppresses multi-streaming by introducing viscosity. We study mass flow in this model by analysis of Lagrangian advection in the zero-viscosity limit. Under mild conditions, we show that a unique limiting Lagrangian semi-flow exists. Limiting particle paths stick together after collision and are characterized uniquely by a differential inclusion. The absolutely continuous part of the mass measure agrees with that of a Monge-Amp\`ere measure arising by convexification of the free-streaming velocity potential. But the singular parts of these measures can differ when flows along singular structures merge, as shown by analysis of a 2D Riemann problem. The use of Monge-Amp\`ere measures and optimal transport theory for the reconstruction of inverse Lagrangian maps in cosmology was introduced in work of Brenier &amp; Frisch et al. (Month. Not. Roy. Ast. Soc. 346, 2003). In a neighborhood of merging singular structures in our examples, however, we show that reconstruction yielding a monotone Lagrangian map cannot be exact a.e., even off of the singularities themselves.</description>

      <title>A Theoretical Framework for Iteratively Enhanced Room-Temperature Single-Photon Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01328v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-performance photon detection is indispensable in a wide range of quantum-optical applications and is conventionally treated as a fixed device-level operation based on single-photon detectors (SPDs). However, state-of-the-art SPDs rely on superconducting materials, which impose severe technological demands and require challenging operational conditions such as cryogenic cooling, thereby hindering scalable implementation. Here, we propose the enhanced single-photon detector (ESPD) framework, a theoretical paradigm supported by numerical simulations, that reformulates single-photon detection as an iteratively enhanced process based on state preparation, controlled operations, projective measurements, and multi-copy analysis, and enables substantial performance improvement using exclusively room-temperature components. Numerical simulations indicate that, within a physically motivated parameter regime, the ESPD framework can upgrade a legacy SPD with a detection efficiency (DE) of about 59% and a dark count rate (DCR) of about $10^{-2}$ to effective performance metrics with DE exceeding 93% and DCR below $10^{-9}$, comparable to those of superconducting SPDs. As a consequence, the minimal tolerable channel transmission rate for quantum key distribution protocols can be reduced by several orders of magnitude. While its physical realization would require substantial experimental integration, the ESPD framework establishes a general system-level perspective on photon detection, highlighting the potential of iterative quantum processing for overcoming intrinsic detector limitations at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Highly robust logical qubit encoding in an ensemble of V-symmetrical qutrits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose using even and odd Sch\"odinger cat states formed from coherent states of U(3) of an ensemble of qutrits with a symmetrical V-configuration (a qubit-disguised qutrit) to encode a logical qubit. These carefully engineered logical qubit states are parameter independent stationary states of the effective master equation governing the evolution of the ensemble and, consequently, constitute dark states and are invulnerable to dissipation and correlated collective dephasing. In particular, the logical qubit states are immune to single qutrit decay (the analogous of single photon loss process for qutrits) and simultaneous decay and driving of two qutrits (the analogous two-photon loss and driving processes for qutrits). In addition, we show how to implement the single-qubit quantum NOT gate and the Hadamard gate followed by either the phase gate or the phase and $Z$ gates. We study analytically the case of two qutrits and conclude that the logical qubit states exhibit parity-sensitive inhomogeneous broadening and local correlated dephasing: the even logical state is completely immune to these processes, while odd one is vulnerable. Nevertheless, in the presence of these interactions one can also define another odd state with mixed permutation symmetry that is immune to both inhomogeneous broadening and local correlated dephasing. We suggest that these results can be extrapolated to an arbitrary number of qutrits. The effective master equation is deduced from a physical system composed of two parametrically coupled cavities with one of them interacting dispersively with an ensemble of three-level atoms (the qutrits). In principle this physical system can be implemented by means of two coplanar waveguide resonators, a SQUID parametrically coupling them, and a cloud of alkali atoms close to one of the resonators.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a four-dimensional system composed of a mass-dimension-one fermionic field, also known as Elko, interacting with a real scalar field. Our main objective is to analyze the Casimir effects associated with this system, assuming that both the Elko and scalar fields satisfy Dirichlet boundary conditions on two large parallel plates separated by a distance $L$. In this scenario, we calculate the vacuum energy density and its first-order correction in the coupling constants of the theory. Additionally, we consider the mass correction for each field separately, namely the topological mass that arises from the boundary conditions imposed on the fields and which also depends on the coupling constants. To develop this analysis, we use the mathematical formalism known as the effective potential, expressed as a path integral in quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>A Compact Formula for Conserved Three-Point Tensor Structures in 4D CFT</title>

Abstract: We derive a compact analytic formula for a complete basis of conformally invariant tensor structures for three-point functions of conserved operators in arbitrary 4D Lorentz representations. The construction follows directly from a novel constraint equivalent to applying conservation conditions at each point: the leading terms in all OPE limits appear as symmetric traceless tensors. We derive this by lifting to a unified $\mathrm{SU}(m,m|2n)$ analytic superspace framework, where the conservation conditions are automatically solved and then reducing back to 4D CFT. The same method is also used for cases involving one non-conserved operator. This formalism further reveals a map of the counting of CFT tensor structures to that of finite-dimensional $\mathrm{SU}(2n)$ representations, solved by Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. All results can be directly re-interpreted as three-point $\mathcal{N}=2$ and $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal tensor structures via the unified analytic superspace.</description>
