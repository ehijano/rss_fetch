      <title>Private Markovian Equilibrium in Stackelberg Markov Games for Smart Grid Demand Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy introduces a great challenge to the supply and demand balance of the power grid. To address this challenge, this paper formulates a Stackelberg Markov game (SMG) between an aggregator and multiple users, where the aggregator sets electricity prices and users make demand and storage decisions. Considering that users' storage levels are private information, we introduce private states and propose the new concepts of private Markovian strategies (PMS) and private Markovian equilibrium (PME). We establish the existence of a pure PME in the lower-level Markov game and prove that it can be computed in polynomial time. Notably, computing equilibrium in general Markov games is hard, and polynomial-time algorithms are rarely available. Based on these theoretical results, we develop a scalable solution framework combining centralized and decentralized algorithms for the lower-level PME computation with upper-level pricing optimization. Numerical simulations with up to 50 users based on real data validate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed methods, whereas prior studies typically consider no more than 5 users.</description>

      <title>Finite-Agent Stochastic Differential Games on Large Graphs: II. Graph-Based Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel neural network architecture, called Non-Trainable Modification (NTM), for computing Nash equilibria in stochastic differential games (SDGs) on graphs. These games model a broad class of graph-structured multi-agent systems arising in finance, robotics, energy, and social dynamics, where agents interact locally under uncertainty. The NTM architecture imposes a graph-guided sparsification on feedforward neural networks, embedding fixed, non-trainable components aligned with the underlying graph topology. This design enhances interpretability and stability, while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters in large-scale, sparse settings. We theoretically establish a universal approximation property for NTM in static games on graphs and numerically validate its expressivity and robustness through supervised learning tasks. Building on this foundation, we incorporate NTM into two state-of-the-art game solvers, Direct Parameterization and Deep BSDE, yielding their sparse variants (NTM-DP and NTM-DBSDE). Numerical experiments on three SDGs across various graph structures demonstrate that NTM-based methods achieve performance comparable to their fully trainable counterparts, while offering improved computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Between proportionnality and envy-freeness: k-proportionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article deals with the cake cutting problem. In this setting, there exists two notions of fair division: proportional division (when there are n players, each player thinks to get at least 1/n of the cake) and envy-free division (each player wants to keep his or her share because he or she does not envy the portion given to another player). Some results are valid for proportional division but not for envy-free division.  Here, we introduce and study a scale between the proportional division and the envy-free division. The goal is to understand where is the gap between statements about proportional division and envy-free division. This scale comes from the notion introduced in this article: k-proportionality. When k = n this notion corresponds to the proportional division and when k = 2 it corresponds to envy-free division. With k-proportionality we can understand where some difficulties in fair division lie. First, we show that there are situations in which there is no k-proportional and equitable division of a pie with connected pieces when k $\le$ n -1. This result was known only for envy-free division, ie k = 2. Next, we prove that there are situations in which there is no Pareto-optimal k-proportional division of a cake with connected pieces when k $\le$ n -1. This result was known only for k = 2. These theorems say that we can get an impossibility result even if we do not consider an envy-free division but a weaker notion. Finally, k-proportionality allows to give a generalization with a uniform statement of theorems about strong envy-free and strong proportional divisions.</description>

      <title>HLSMAC: A New StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge for High-Level Strategic Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Benchmarks are crucial for assessing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms. While StarCraft II-related environments have driven significant advances in MARL, existing benchmarks like SMAC focus primarily on micromanagement, limiting comprehensive evaluation of high-level strategic intelligence. To address this, we introduce HLSMAC, a new cooperative MARL benchmark with 12 carefully designed StarCraft II scenarios based on classical stratagems from the Thirty-Six Stratagems. Each scenario corresponds to a specific stratagem and is designed to challenge agents with diverse strategic elements, including tactical maneuvering, timing coordination, and deception, thereby opening up avenues for evaluating high-level strategic decision-making capabilities. We also propose novel metrics across multiple dimensions beyond conventional win rate, such as ability utilization and advancement efficiency, to assess agents' overall performance within the HLSMAC environment. We integrate state-of-the-art MARL algorithms and LLM-based agents with our benchmark and conduct comprehensive experiments. The results demonstrate that HLSMAC serves as a robust testbed for advancing multi-agent strategic decision-making.</description>

      <title>Precomputed Dominant Resource Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08846v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although resource allocation is a well studied problem in computer science, until the prevalence of distributed systems, such as computing clouds and data centres, the question had been addressed predominantly for single resource type scenarios. At the beginning of the last decade, with the introuction of Dominant Resource Fairness, the studies of the resource allocation problem has finally extended to the multiple resource type scenarios. Dominant Resource Fairness is a solution, addressing the problem of fair allocation of multiple resource types, among users with heterogeneous demands. Based on Max-min Fairness, which is a well established algorithm in the literature for allocating resources in the single resource type scenarios, Dominant Resource Fairness generalises the scheme to the multiple resource case. It has a number of desirable properties that makes it preferable over alternatives, such as Sharing Incentive, Envy-Freeness, Pareto Efficiency, and Strategy Proofness, and as such, it is widely adopted in distributed systems. In the present study, we revisit the original study, and analyse the structure of the algorithm in closer view, to come up with an alternative algorithm, which approximates the Dominant Resource Fairness allocation in fewer steps. We name the new algorithm Precomputed Dominant Resource Fairness, after its main working principle.</description>
