      <title>Effective Connectivity-Based Unsupervised Channel Selection Method for EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing neural data such as Electroencephalography (EEG) data often involves dealing with high-dimensional datasets, where not all channels provide equally meaningful informa- tion. Selecting the most relevant channels is crucial for improving computational efficiency and ensuring robust insights into neural dynamics. This study introduces the Importance of Channels based on Effective Connectivity (ICEC) criterion for quantifying effective connectivity (EC) in each channel. Effective connectivity refers to the causal influence one neural region exerts over another, providing insights into the directional flow of information. Using this criterion, we propose an unsupervised channel selection method that accounts for the intensity of interactions among channels. To evaluate the proposed channel selection method, we applied it to three well-known EEG datasets across four categories. The assessment involved calculating the ICEC criterion using five effective connectivity metrics: partial directed coherence (PDC), generalized PDC (GPDC), renormalized PDC (RPDC), directed transfer function (DTF), and direct DTF (dDTF). To focus on the effect of channel selection, we employed the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) algorithm for feature extraction and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification across all participants. Results were compared with other CSP-based methods. The evaluation included comparing participant- specific accuracies with and without the proposed method across five effective connectivity metrics. The results showed consistent performance improvements and a significant reduction in the number of selected electrodes for all participants. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our approach achieved the highest accuracies: 82% (13 out of 22 channels), 86.01% (29 out of 59 channels), and 87.56% (48 out of 118 channels) across three datasets.</description>

      <title>Enabling Full Duplex ISAC Leveraging Waveform Domain Separability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in monostatic in-band full-duplex (IBFD) systems encounters significant challenges due to self-interference (SI) at the radar receiver during concurrent communication and radar operations. This paper proposes a novel waveform-domain self-interference cancellation (SIC) technique that leverages the unique properties of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) signals. The proposed approach designs the integrated dual-functionality frame to utilize OFDM for communication and AFDM for radar sensing, both generated using the same modulator block. Then, we establish the conditions under which a wide sense stationary (WSS) process in the time domain appears as WSS in the affine domain and demonstrate that the interfering OFDM signal behaves as an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) in this domain. Exploiting this property, the received signal is projected into the affine domain, where the SI appears as AWGN, enabling its subtraction with minimal residual interference. To further mitigate the residual SI, an iterative low-complexity windowing scheme is applied, selectively locking onto the radar signal to reduce the processed signal space. A subsequent time-domain spreading step is applied after converting the SIC-processed signal into the post-coded time domain, wherein the SI diminishes separately across the delay and Doppler axes. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance in terms of detection probability, target range and velocity root mean square error (RMSE), while maintaining high spectral efficiency and minimal computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Passive Microwave Tag Classification Using RF Fingerprinting and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an approach to identifying wireless microwave tags using radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting and machine learning. The tags are designed for low cost and simplicity, consisting of only two antennas and a single nonlinear element (a diode). An interrogating transceiver transmits a signal consisting of a set of individual frequency tones that is captured by the tag. The signal response of the diode is nonlinear, and can be represented by an infinite power series, the coefficients of which are similar but not identical for different physical diodes due to small manufacturing perturbations. The small differences in the signal responses manifest in the spectral signal response of the tag, which is retransmitted back to the interrogating transceiver. Input into machine learning algorithms, the slight differences in the spectral responses of the diodes can be used to uniquely identify devices. To demonstrate the concept, we designed 2.0 GHz tags consisting of patch antennas and a single diode, along with a bi-static radar system operating at the 2.0 GHz 802.11 Wi-Fi band transmitting multi-tone continuous wave signals representing common 802.11 training fields. The received signals were processed using a set of algorithms for comparison purposes. A real-time classification accuracy of 95% between two tags was achieved.</description>

      <title>Computationally Efficient Neural Receivers via Axial Self-Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based neural receivers are redefining physical-layer signal processing for next-generation wireless systems. We propose an axial self-attention transformer neural receiver designed for applicability to 6G and beyond wireless systems, validated through 5G-compliant experimental configurations, that achieves state-of-the-art block error rate (BLER) performance with significantly improved computational efficiency. By factorizing attention operations along temporal and spectral axes, the proposed architecture reduces the quadratic complexity of conventional multi-head self-attention from $O((TF)^2)$ to $O(T^2F+TF^2)$, yielding substantially fewer total floating-point operations and attention matrix multiplications per transformer block compared to global self-attention. Relative to convolutional neural receiver baselines, the axial neural receiver achieves significantly lower computational cost with a fraction of the parameters. Experimental validation under 3GPP Clustered Delay Line (CDL) channels demonstrates consistent performance gains across varying mobility scenarios. Under non-line-of-sight CDL-C conditions, the axial neural receiver consistently outperforms all evaluated receiver architectures, including global self-attention, convolutional neural receivers, and traditional LS-LMMSE at 10\% BLER with reduced computational complexity per inference. At stringent reliability targets of 1\% BLER, the axial receiver maintains robust symbol detection at high user speeds, whereas the traditional LS-LMMSE receiver fails to converge, underscoring its suitability for ultra-reliable low-latency (URLLC) communication in dynamic 6G environments and beyond. These results establish the axial neural receiver as a structured, scalable, and efficient framework for AI-Native 6G RAN systems, enabling deployment in resource-constrained edge environments.</description>

      <title>Towards Spectrally Efficient and Physically Reconfigurable Architectures for Multibeam-Waveform Co-Design in Joint Communication and Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Joint Communication and Sensing (JCAS) platforms are emerging as a foundation of next-generation mmWave (MMW) and sub-THz systems, enabling both high-throughput data transfer and angular localization within a shared signal path. This paper investigates multibeam architectures for JCAS that simultaneously optimize waveform shaping and beamforming across the time, frequency, code, and direct analog/ radio frequency (RF) domains. The paper compares Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM), Frequency Modulated Arrays (FMA), Time-Modulated Arrays (TMA), direct RF/MMW modulation, and Code-Division Multiple Access (CDMA)-based systems with respect to spectral efficiency, beam orthogonality, latency, and Angle-of-Arrival (AoA) estimation accuracy. The results highlight architecture-specific tradeoffs among beam agility, efficiency, accuracy and resolution, and complexity. It also provides a framework for selecting JCAS front ends optimized for power, latency, inter-beam and multi-user interference, and rapid system reconfiguration</description>

      <title>Constellation Design in OFDM-ISAC over Data Payloads: From MSE Analysis to Experimentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is one of the most widely adopted waveforms for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, owing to its high spectral efficiency and compatibility with modern communication standards. This paper investigates the sensing performance of OFDM-based ISAC for multi-target delay (range) estimation under specific radar receiver processing schemes. An estimation-theoretic framework is developed to characterize sensing performance with random communication payloads. We establish the fundamental limit of delay estimation accuracy by deriving the closed-form expression of the mean-square error (MSE) achieved using matched filtering (MF) and reciprocal filtering (RF) receivers. The results show that, in multi-target scenarios, the impact of signal constellations on the delay estimation MSE differs across receivers: MF performance depends on the fourth-order moment of the zero-mean, unit-power constellation in the presence of multiple targets, whereas RF performance depends on its inverse second-order moment, irrespective of the number of targets. Building on this analysis, we present a ISAC constellation design under specific receiver architecture that brings a receiver-dependent flexible trade-off between sensing and communication in OFDM-ISAC systems. The theoretical findings are validated through simulations and proof-of-concept experiments, and also the sensing and communication performance trade-off is experimentally shown with the proposed constellation design.</description>

      <title>Working Memory Functional Connectivity Analysis for Dementia Classification using EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Dementia, particularly Alzheimer's Disease (AD), is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by cognitive decline. Early detection, especially at the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) stage, is essential for timely intervention. Working Memory (WM) impairment is a key early indicator of neurodegeneration, affecting higher cognitive processes. Electroencephalography (EEG), with its high temporal resolution, offers a cost-effective method to assess brain dynamics. This study investigates WM-related EEG functional connectivity (FC) to identify brain network alterations across dementia stages. Methods: EEG signals were recorded from 24 participants (8 AD, 8 MCI, and 8 healthy controls) during WM tasks, including encoding, recall, and retrieval stages. Data preprocessing involved noise reduction and feature extraction using Spherical and Head Harmonic Decomposition (SHD, HHD). FC was quantified using Cross-Plot Transition Entropy (CPTE) and Phase Lag Index (PLI). Network metrics such as Degree and Eigenvector Centrality were analyzed using Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and XGBoost classifiers. Results: The CPTE-based connectivity metrics outperformed the traditional PLI approach in differentiating dementia stages, attaining a peak classification accuracy of 97.53% during the retrieval phase with the Random Forest model. A connectivity threshold of 0.5 was optimal for network discrimination. SHD and HHD features also demonstrated strong discriminative potential. AD subjects exhibited higher synchronization patterns during WM tasks than healthy controls. Conclusions: The integration of WM tasks with EEG-based FC analysis provides a robust framework for dementia classification. The proposed CPTE-based approach offers a robust, scalable, non-invasive, and effective diagnostic tool for early detection and monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases.</description>

      <title>Oscillator Drift Compensation by Line-of-Sight Tracking for Distributed Multisensor ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observed synchronization mismatches in the form of non-smooth phase progressions and drifts within mobile multisensor channel sounding measurements. However, performing Doppler estimation in a distributed multisensor integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system requires coherence among the nodes, which implies a continuously differentiable phase progression of the received signals. To correct the sounding data in post-processing, we extend traditional geometry-based drift compensation algorithms by utilizing Kalman filtering for line-of-sight (LoS) tracking, which improves the robustness of the LoS estimate in multipath scenarios. This approach smooths the phase progression and enables the correction of time-varying drifts while preserving relative sensor motion. Furthermore, we propose using the relative residual power after high-resolution parameter estimation (HRPE) as a metric for ground-truth-independent comparison of post-processing synchronization methods for recorded channel sounding data. Results show that the proposed approach outperforms traditional LoS estimation heuristics, reducing the relative residual power by more than 5 dB and the delay-Doppler estimate root mean square errors (RMSEs) by approximately 60 %.</description>

      <title>Radio over Fiber with Cascaded Structure: Algorithm for Uplink Positioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in polymer microwave fiber (PMF) technology have created significant opportunities for robust, low-cost, and high-speed sub-terahertz (THz) radio-over- fiber communications. Recognizing these potential benefits, this paper explores a novel radio-over-fiber (RoF) structure that interconnects multiple radio units (RUs) in cascade via fiber, envi- sioning its application in indoor scenarios. This structure creates a number of research opportunities when considering cascaded distortion effects introduced by non-linear power amplifiers (PAs) at the RUs and the propagation channel over the fiber. We propose maximum-likelihood and non-linear least-squares algorithms to estimate the propagation distance along the RoF and the time-of-arrival between the RoF and the user equipment. For the case of linear PAs, we derive the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound to benchmark the performance of the estimators. Finally, we investigate the use of the system for uplink positioning. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed estimators perform satisfactorily even with the cascaded effects of non- linear PAs, and that the deployment of this RoF structure can enable new cost-effective opportunities for high-resolution positioning in indoor scenarios. In the numerical evaluation, we also use measured PMF characteristics for high-density polyethylene fibers.</description>

      <title>A Robust EDM Optimization Approach for 3D Single-Source Localization with Angle and Range Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the problem of source localization, three elements usually play a very important role in accurate localization. They are the range measurements, the angle measurements and the least absolute deviation criterion, which is regarded as a robust metric for denoising the measurements. Building the three elements into a computationally tractable model is challenging. In this paper, we introduce a robust Euclidean Distance Matrix (EDM) optimization model that simultaneously incorporates the three elements. For the first time, we show that for the case of 3D single-source localization (3DSSL), the angle measurements can be represented as a simple box constraint of distances. It is achieved by reducing each of the 3D angle measurements to a two-dimensional nonlinear optimization problem, whose global minimum and maximum solutions can be characterized and utilized to get the lower and upper bounds of the distances from the unknown source to the sensors. We further develop an efficient algorithm. The high quality of the localization by the new EDM model is assessed through extensive numerical experiments in comparison with leading solvers for 3DSSL.</description>

      <title>Coherent Load Profile Synthesis with Conditional Diffusion for LV Distribution Network Scenario Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Limited visibility of power distribution network power flows at the low voltage level presents challenges to both distribution network operators from a planning perspective and distribution system operators from a congestion management perspective. Forestalling these challenges through scenario analysis is confounded by the lack of realistic and coherent load data across representative distribution feeders. Load profiling approaches often rely on summarising demand through typical profiles, which oversimplifies the complexity of substation-level operations and limits their applicability in specific power system studies. Sampling methods, and more recently generative models, have attempted to address this through synthesising representative loads from historical exemplars; however, while these approaches can approximate load shapes to a convincing degree of fidelity, the co-behaviour between substations, which ultimately impacts higher voltage level network operation, is often overlooked. This limitation will become even more pronounced with the increasing integration of low-carbon technologies, as estimates of base loads fail to capture load diversity. To address this gap, a Conditional Diffusion model for synthesising daily active and reactive power profiles at the low voltage distribution substation level is proposed. The evaluation of fidelity is demonstrated through conventional metrics capturing temporal and statistical realism, as well as power flow modelling. The results show synthesised load profiles are plausible both independently and as a cohort in a wider power systems context. The Conditional Diffusion model is benchmarked against both naive and state-of-the-art models to demonstrate its effectiveness in producing realistic scenarios on which to base sub-regional power distribution network planning and operations.</description>

      <title>Simplicial Gaussian Models: Representation and Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) are powerful tools for representing statistical dependencies through graphs in high-dimensional systems. However, they are limited to pairwise interactions. In this work, we propose the simplicial Gaussian model (SGM), which extends Gaussian PGM to simplicial complexes. SGM jointly models random variables supported on vertices, edges, and triangles, within a single parametrized Gaussian distribution. Our model builds upon discrete Hodge theory and incorporates uncertainty at every topological level through independent random components. Motivated by applications, we focus on the marginal edge-level distribution while treating node- and triangle-level variables as latent. We then develop a maximum-likelihood inference algorithm to recover the parameters of the full SGM and the induced conditional dependence structure. Numerical experiments on synthetic simplicial complexes with varying size and sparsity confirm the effectiveness of our algorithm.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Optimization for Streaming Data Via Temporal Weighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical optimization theory deals with fixed, time-invariant objective functions. However, time-varying optimization has emerged as an important subject for decision-making in dynamic environments. In this work, we study the problem of learning from streaming data through a time-varying optimization lens. Unlike prior works that focus on generic formulations, we introduce a structured, \emph{weight-based} formulation that explicitly captures the streaming-data origin of the time-varying objective, where at each time step, an agent aims to minimize a weighted average loss over all the past data samples. We focus on two specific weighting strategies: (1) uniform weights, which treat all samples equally, and (2) discounted weights, which geometrically decay the influence of older data. For both schemes, we derive tight bounds on the ``tracking error'' (TE), defined as the deviation between the model parameter and the time-varying optimum at a given time step, under gradient descent (GD) updates. We show that under uniform weighting, the TE vanishes asymptotically with a $\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ decay rate, whereas discounted weighting incurs a nonzero error floor controlled by the discount factor and the number of gradient updates performed at each time step. Our theoretical findings are validated through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Transformer-based Scalable Beamforming Optimization via Deep Residual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an unsupervised deep learning framework for downlink beamforming in large-scale MU-MISO channels. The model is trained offline, allowing real-time inference through lightweight feedforward computations in dynamic communication environments. Following the learning-to-optimize (L2O) paradigm, a multi-layer Transformer iteratively refines both channel and beamformer features via residual connections. To enhance training, three strategies are introduced: (i) curriculum learning (CL) to improve early-stage convergence and avoid local optima, (ii) semi-amortized learning to refine each Transformer block with a few gradient ascent steps, and (iii) sliding-window training to stabilize optimization by training only a subset of Transformer blocks at a time. Extensive simulations show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing baselines at low-to-medium SNRs and closely approaches WMMSE performance at high SNRs, while achieving substantially faster inference than iterative and online learning approaches.</description>

Abstract: Holographic video communication is considered a paradigm shift in visual communications, becoming increasingly popular for its ability to offer immersive experiences. This article provides an overview of holographic video communication and outlines the requirements of a holographic video communication system. Particularly, following a brief review of semantic com- munication, an architecture for a semantic-enabled holographic video communication system is presented. Key technologies, including semantic sampling, joint semantic-channel coding, and semantic-aware transmission, are designed based on the proposed architecture. Two related use cases are presented to demonstrate the performance gain of the proposed methods. Finally, potential research topics are discussed to pave the way for the realization of semantic-enabled holographic video communications.</description>

Abstract: In this chapter, we investigate the mathematical foundation of the modeling and design of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) in both the far- and near-field regimes. More specifically, we first present RIS-assisted wireless channel models for the far- and near-field regimes, discussing relevant phenomena, such as line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS links, rich and poor scattering, channel correlation, and array manifold. Subsequently, we introduce two general approaches for the RIS reflective beam design, namely optimization-based and analytical, which offer different degrees of design flexibility and computational complexity. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive set of simulation results for the performance evaluation of the studied RIS beam designs and the investigation of the impact of the system parameters.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Holistic KLD-based Waveform Design for Multi-User-Multi-Target ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20245v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework aimed at designing integrated waveforms for robust integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. The system model consists of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) base station that simultaneously serves communication user equipments (UEs) and detects multiple targets using a shared-antenna deployment scenario. By leveraging Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) to holistically characterise both communication and sensing subsystems, three optimisation problems are formulated: (i) radar waveform KLD maximisation under communication constraints, (ii) communication waveform KLD maximisation subject to radar KLD requirements, and (iii) an integrated waveform KLD-based optimisation for ISAC that jointly balances both subsystems. The first two problems are solved using a projected gradient method with adaptive penalties for the radar waveforms and a gradient-assisted interior point method (IPM) for the communication waveforms. The third, integrated waveform optimisation approach adopts an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework to unify radar and communication waveform designs into a single integrated optimisation, thereby synergising sensing and communication objectives and achieving higher overall performance than either radar- or communication-only techniques. Unlike most existing ISAC waveform designs that regard communication signals solely as interference for sensing, the proposed framework utilises the holistic ISAC waveform-that is, the superimposed communication and sensing signals-to boost detection performance in the radar subsystem. Simulation results show significant improvements in both radar detection and communication reliability compared with conventional zero-forcing beamforming, identity-covariance radar baselines, and traditional optimisation approaches,..</description>

      <title>Propagation Distance Estimation for Radio over Fiber with Cascaded Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent developments in polymer microwave fiber (PMF) have opened great opportunities for robust, low-cost, and high-speed sub-terahertz (THz) communications. Noticing this great potential, this paper addresses the problem of estimation of the propagation distance of a sub-Thz signal along a radio over fiber structure. Particularly, this paper considers a novel cascaded structure that interconnects multiple radio units (RUs) via fiber for applications in indoor scenarios. Herein, we consider the cascaded effects of distortions introduced by non-linear power amplifiers at the RUs, and the propagation channel over the fiber is based on measurements obtained from transmissions of sub-THz signals on high-density polyethylene fibers. For the estimation of the propagation distance, non-linear least-squares algorithms are proposed, and our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed estimators present a good performance on the propagation distance estimation even in the presence of the cascaded effect of non-linear PAs.</description>

      <title>Spectrum Efficiency and Processing Latency Trade-offs in Panel-Based LIS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19147v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The next generation wireless systems will face stringent new requirements, including ultra-low latency, high data rates and enhanced reliability. Large Intelligent Surfaces, is one proposed solution that has the potential to solve these high demands. The real-life deployment of such systems involves different design considerations with non-trivial trade-offs. This paper investigates the trade-off between spectral efficiency and processing latency, considering different antenna distribution schemes and detection algorithms. A latency model for the physical layer processing has been developed, using real FPGA and application-specific instruction processor (ASIP) hardware implementation results. Simulation results using an indoor environment show that distributing antennas throughout the scenario improves overall reliability, while the impact from this on latency is limited both when using zero-forcing (ZF) and Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) detection. Changing the detection algorithm to maximum-ratio combining (MRC) from ZF or MMSE, however, reduces the latency significantly, even if a larger number of antennas are needed to achieve a similar spectrum efficiency.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Advantages of Sparse Arrays in Near-Field XL-MIMO Systems: Beam Analysis and EDoF Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09234v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates near-field XL-MIMO systems with sparse uniform planar arrays (UPAs). Based on the Green's function-based channel model, the paper derives closed-form expressions for the signal beam power when the distance coordinate or the angular coordinates varies with respective to the focused position. Based on that, closed-form expressions for the lobe length and the suppressing ratio are obtained, indicating that both the distance-focusing property and the grating lobe behavior can be enhanced as the focal distance decreases or the antenna spacing increases. Furthermore, the paper introduces a crucial constraint on system parameters, under which effective degrees-of-freedom (EDoF) of XL-MIMO systems with sparse UPAs can be precisely estimated. Then, the paper proposes an algorithm to obtain a closed-form expression, which can estimate EDoF with high accuracy and low computational complexity. The numerical results verifies the correctness of the main results of this paper.</description>

      <title>Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces-Enhanced MIMO OFDM Wideband Communication Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems rely on digital or hybrid digital and analog designs for beamforming against frequency-selective fading, which suffer from high hardware complexity and energy consumption. To address this, this work introduces a fully-analog stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) architecture that directly performs wave-domain beamforming, enabling diagonalization of the end-to-end channel matrix and inherently eliminating inter-antenna interference (IAI) for MIMO OFDM transmission. By leveraging cascaded programmable metasurface layers, the proposed system establishes multiple parallel subchannels, significantly improving multi-carrier transmission efficiency while reducing hardware complexity. To optimize the SIM phase shift matrices, a block coordinate descent and penalty convex-concave procedure (BCD-PCCP) algorithm is developed to iteratively minimize the channel fitting error across subcarriers. Simulation results validate the proposed approach, determining the maximum effective bandwidth and demonstrating substantial performance improvements. Moreover, for a MIMO OFDM system operating at 28 GHz with 16 subcarriers, the proposed SIM configuration method achieves over 300% enhancement in channel capacity compared to conventional SIM configuration that only accounts for the center frequency.</description>

      <title>BrainOmni: A Brain Foundation Model for Unified EEG and MEG Signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18185v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) measure neural activity non-invasively by capturing electromagnetic fields generated by dendritic currents. Although rooted in the same biophysics, EEG and MEG exhibit distinct signal patterns, further complicated by variations in sensor configurations across modalities and recording devices. Existing approaches typically rely on separate, modality- and dataset-specific models, which limits the performance and cross-domain scalability. This paper proposes BrainOmni, the first brain foundation model that generalises across heterogeneous EEG and MEG recordings. To unify diverse data sources, we introduce BrainTokenizer,the first tokenizer that quantises spatiotemporal brain activity into discrete representations. Central to BrainTokenizer is a novel Sensor Encoder that encodes sensor properties such as spatial layout, orientation, and type, enabling compatibility across devices and modalities. Building upon the discrete representations, BrainOmni learns unified semantic embeddings of brain signals by self-supervised pretraining. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first foundation model to support both EEG and MEG signals, as well as the first to incorporate large-scale MEG pretraining. A total of 1,997 hours of EEG and 656 hours of MEG data are curated and standardised from publicly available sources for pretraining. Experiments show that BrainOmni outperforms both existing foundation models and state-of-the-art task-specific models on a range of downstream tasks. It also demonstrates strong generalisation to unseen EEG and MEG devices. Further analysis reveals that joint EEG-MEG (EMEG) training yields consistent improvements across both modalities. Code and checkpoints are publicly available at https://github.com/OpenTSLab/BrainOmni.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems will integrate both sub-6 GHz and millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency bands to meet the growing demands for high data rates. MIMO link establishment typically requires accurate channel estimation, which is particularly challenging at mmWave frequencies due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this paper, we propose two novel deep learning-based methods for estimating mmWave MIMO channels by leveraging out-of-band information from the sub-6 GHz band. The first method employs a convolutional neural network (CNN), while the second method utilizes a UNet architecture. We compare these proposed methods against deep-learning methods that rely solely on in-band information and with other state-of-the-art out-of-band aided methods. Simulation results show that our proposed out-of-band aided deep-learning methods outperform existing alternatives in terms of achievable spectral efficiency.</description>

      <title>Integrated Polarimetric Sensing and Communication with Polarization-Reconfigurable Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polarization diversity offers a cost- and space-efficient solution to enhance the performance of integrated sensing and communication systems. Polarimetric sensing exploits the signal's polarity to extract details about the target such as shape, pose, and material composition. From a communication perspective, polarization diversity can enhance the reliability and throughput of communication channels. This paper proposes an integrated polarimetric sensing and communication (IPSAC) system that jointly conducts polarimetric sensing and communications. We study the use of single-port polarization-reconfigurable antennas to adapt to channel depolarization effects, without the need for separate RF chains for each polarization. We address two core sensing tasks in IPSAC systems, target parameter estimation and target detection. For parameter estimation, we consider the problem of minimizing the mean-squared error (MSE) of the target depolarization parameter estimate, which is a critical task for various polarimetric radar applications such as rainfall forecasting, vegetation identification, and target classification. To address this nonconvex problem, we apply semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and majorization-minimization (MM) optimization techniques. Next, we consider a design that maximizes the target SINR leveraging prior knowledge of the target and clutter depolarization statistics to enhance the target detection performance. To tackle this problem, we modify the solution developed for MSE minimization subject to the same quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. Extensive simulations show that the proposed polarization reconfiguration method substantially improves the depolarization parameter MSE. Furthermore, the proposed method considerably boosts the target SINR due to polarization diversity, particularly in cluttered environments.</description>

      <title>Quantize-Sample-and-Verify: LLM Acceleration via Adaptive Edge-Cloud Speculative Decoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In edge-cloud speculative decoding (SD), edge devices equipped with small language models (SLMs) generate draft tokens that are verified by large language models (LLMs) in the cloud. A key bottleneck in such systems is the limited communication bandwidth between edge and cloud, which necessitates quantization of the information transmitted about generated tokens. In this work, we introduce a novel quantize-sample (Q-S) strategy that provably preserves the output distribution of the cloud-based model, ensuring that the verified tokens match the distribution of those that would have been generated directly by the LLM. We develop a throughput model for edge-cloud SD that explicitly accounts for communication latency. Leveraging this model, we propose an adaptive mechanism that optimizes token throughput by dynamically adjusting the draft length and quantization precision in response to both semantic uncertainty and channel conditions. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed Q-S approach significantly improves decoding efficiency in realistic edge-cloud deployment scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: EEG-based multimodal emotion recognition(EMER) has gained significant attention and witnessed notable advancements, the inherent complexity of human neural systems has motivated substantial efforts toward multimodal approaches. However, this field currently suffers from three critical limitations: (i) the absence of open-source implementations. (ii) the lack of standardized and transparent benchmarks for fair performance analysis. (iii) in-depth discussion regarding main challenges and promising research directions is a notable scarcity. To address these challenges, we introduce LibEMER, a unified evaluation framework that provides fully reproducible PyTorch implementations of curated deep learning methods alongside standardized protocols for data preprocessing, model realization, and experimental setups. This framework enables unbiased performance assessment on three widely-used public datasets across two learning tasks. The open-source library is publicly accessible at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/2025ULUIUBUEUMUEUR485384</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a machine learning-assisted channel estimation approach for massive MIMO systems, leveraging DNNs to outperform traditional LS and MMSE methods. In 5G and beyond, accurate channel estimation mitigates pilot contamination and high mobility issues that harm system reliability. The proposed DNN architecture includes multi-layer perceptrons with ReLU activation, 3 hidden layers (256, 128, 64 neurons respectively), uses Adam optimizer (learning rate 1e-4) and MSE loss function. It learns from pilot signals to predict channel matrices, achieving lower NMSE and BER across different SNR levels. Simulations use the COST 2100 public standard dataset (a well-recognized MIMO channel dataset for 5G, not synthetic datasets) with 10,000 samples of 4x4 MIMO channels under urban macro scenarios. Results show the DNN outperforms LS and MMSE by 3-5 dB in NMSE at medium SNR, with robust performance in high-mobility scenarios. The study evaluates metrics like NMSE vs. SNR, BER vs. SNR, and sensitivity to pilot length, antenna configurations, and computational complexity. The DNN has 2.3 GFlOPs computational complexity, 15.6k parameters, and 1.8 ms inference time on Raspberry Pi 4, verifying deployment feasibility. This work advances ML integration in wireless communications, facilitating efficient resource allocation and improved spectral efficiency in next-generation networks. Future work may use more real-world datasets and hybrid architectures for better generalization.</description>

      <title>CSI-BERT2: A BERT-inspired Framework for Efficient CSI Prediction and Classification in Wireless Communication and Sensing</title>

Abstract: Channel state information (CSI) is a fundamental component in both wireless communication and sensing systems, enabling critical functions such as radio resource optimization and environmental perception. In wireless sensing, data scarcity and packet loss hinder efficient model training, while in wireless communication, high-dimensional CSI matrices and short coherent times caused by high mobility present challenges in CSI estimation.To address these issues, we propose a unified framework named CSI-BERT2 for CSI prediction and classification tasks, built on CSI-BERT, which adapts BERT to capture the complex relationships among CSI sequences through a bidirectional self-attention mechanism. We introduce a two-stage training method that first uses a mask language model (MLM) to enable the model to learn general feature extraction from scarce datasets in an unsupervised manner, followed by fine-tuning for specific downstream tasks. Specifically, we extend MLM into a mask prediction model (MPM), which efficiently addresses the CSI prediction task. To further enhance the representation capacity of CSI data, we modify the structure of the original CSI-BERT. We introduce an adaptive re-weighting layer (ARL) to enhance subcarrier representation and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based temporal embedding module to mitigate temporal information loss problem inherent in the original Transformer.Extensive experiments on both real-world collected and simulated datasets demonstrate that CSI-BERT2 achieves state-of-the-art performance across all tasks. Our results further show that CSI-BERT2 generalizes effectively across varying sampling rates and robustly handles discontinuous CSI sequences caused by packet loss-challenges that conventional methods fail to address. The dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/RS2002/CSI-BERT2 .</description>

      <title>ASE: Practical Acoustic Speed Estimation Beyond Doppler via Sound Diffusion Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20142</link>

Abstract: Passive human speed estimation plays a critical role in acoustic sensing. Despite extensive study, existing systems, however, suffer from various limitations: First, the channel measurement rate proves inadequate to estimate high moving speeds. Second, previous acoustic speed estimation exploits Doppler Frequency Shifts (DFS) created by moving targets and relies on microphone arrays, making them only capable of sensing the radial speed within a constrained distance. To overcome these issues, we present ASE, an accurate and robust Acoustic Speed Estimation system on a single commodity microphone. We propose a novel Orthogonal Time-Delayed Multiplexing (OTDM) scheme for acoustic channel estimation at a high rate that was previously infeasible, making it possible to estimate high speeds. We then model the sound propagation from a unique perspective of the acoustic diffusion field, and infer the speed from the acoustic spatial distribution, a completely different way of thinking about speed estimation beyond prior DFS-based approaches. We further develop novel techniques for motion detection and signal enhancement to deliver a robust and practical system. We implement and evaluate ASE through extensive real-world experiments. Our results show that ASE reliably tracks walking speed, independently of target location and direction, with a mean error of 0.13 m/s, a reduction of 2.5x from DFS, and a detection rate of 97.4% for large coverage, e.g., free walking in a 4m x 4m room. We believe ASE pushes acoustic speed estimation beyond the conventional DFS-based paradigm and inspires exciting research in acoustic sensing.

      <title>Toward Sustainable Subterranean mMTC: Space-Air-Ground-Underground Networks Powered by LoRaWAN and Wireless Energy Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15058</link>

Abstract: Wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs), which enable real-time sensing and monitoring of underground resources by underground devices (UDs), hold great promise for delivering substantial social and economic benefits across various verticals. However, due to the harsh subterranean environment, scarce network resources, and restricted communication coverage, WUSNs face significant challenges in supporting sustainable massive machine-type communications (mMTC), particularly in remote, disaster-stricken, and hard-to-reach areas. To complement this, we conceptualize in this study a novel space-air-ground-underground integrated network (SAGUIN) architecture that seamlessly incorporates satellite systems, aerial platforms, terrestrial networks, and underground communications. On this basis, we integrate LoRaWAN and wireless energy transfer (WET) technologies into SAGUIN to enable sustainable subterranean mMTC. We begin by reviewing the relevant technical background and presenting the architecture and implementation challenges of SAGUIN. Then, we employ simulations to model a remote underground pipeline monitoring scenario to evaluate the feasibility and performance of SAGUIN based on LoRaWAN and WET technologies, focusing on the effects of parameters such as underground conditions, time allocation, LoRaWAN spread factor (SF) configurations, reporting periods, and harvested energy levels. Our results evidence that the proposed SAGUIN system, when combined with the derived time allocation strategy and an appropriate SF, can effectively extend the operational lifetime of UDs, thereby facilitating sustainable subterranean mMTC. Finally, we pinpoint key challenges and future research directions for SAGUIN.</description>
