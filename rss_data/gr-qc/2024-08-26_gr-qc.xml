      <title>A rapid multi-modal parameter estimation technique for LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will observe gravitational-wave signals from a wide range of sources, including massive black hole binaries. Although numerous techniques have been developed to perform Bayesian inference for LISA, they are often computationally expensive; analyses often take at least $\sim 1$ month on a single CPU, even when using accelerated techniques. Not only does this make it difficult to concurrently analyse more than one gravitational-wave signal, it also makes it challenging to rapidly produce parameter estimates for possible electromagnetic follow-up campaigns. simple-pe was recently developed to produce rapid parameter estimates for gravitational-wave signals observed with ground-based gravitational-wave detectors. In this work, we extend simple-pe to produce rapid parameter estimates for LISA sources, including the effects of higher order multipole moments. We show that simple-pe infers the source properties of massive black hole binaries in zero-noise at least $\sim 100\times$ faster than existing techniques; $\sim 12$ hours on a single CPU. We further demonstrate that simple-pe can be applied before existing Bayesian techniques to mitigate biases in multi-modal parameter estimation analyses of MBHBs.</description>

      <title>Stable f(Q) gravity model through non-trivial connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study effectively reconstructs a cosmological model utilizing covariant $f(Q)$ gravity within Connection-III and FLRW spacetime. The dynamic behavior of the reconstructed model is thoroughly analyzed using the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and various observational datasets. Our robust findings demonstrate that the model displays quintessence behavior at the present epoch and converges to the $\Lambda$CDM model at late time. It is confirmed through comprehensive evaluations against energy conditions that the Null Energy Condition remains positive throughout cosmic evolution, and the Dominant Energy Condition is consistently satisfied. The Strong Energy Condition is initially fulfilled in the early Universe but violated in the late epoch. Moreover, scalar perturbations extensively assess stability, affirming the strength of the model with respect to the Hubble parameter. This research offers compelling insights into cosmic acceleration, suggesting that $f(Q)$ gravity can effectively displace the $\Lambda$CDM model and provides a convincing alternative explanation for the current accelerating expansion of the Universe without relying on the cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>A note on the stability of the Cauchy horizon in regular black holes without mass inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike generic models of regular black holes (BHs) with nonzero surface gravity on both Cauchy and event horizons, an inner-degenerate counterpart with zero Cauchy horizon surface gravity was recently proposed. For this regular BH solution with spherical symmetry, we examine the stability of the Cauchy horizon from both classic and quantum mechanics viewpoints. We find that the classical perturbations do not lead to mass inflation at the Cauchy horizon, indicating classically stability, while quantum fluctuations cause it to be unstable quantum mechanically.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing of neutrinos in the Rezzolla-Zhidenko spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider gravitational lensing of neutrinos in the Rezzolla-Zhidenko spacetime in the weak-field limit with plane-wave approximation. We apply the analysis to an hypothetical system with a central object with its mass of the order of solar mass and a detector located at an Earth-like distance from the source. We find that the deformation parameters of the Rezzolla-Zhidenko metric can have significant impact on the oscillation probabilities of the neutrinos. We also investigate the role of decoherence on flavor oscillations of the lensed neutrinos and show that the parameters of the Rezzolla-Zhidenko metric does not have significant effects on the decoherence length.</description>

      <title>New series expansion method for the periapsis shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new series expansion method for the periapsis shift. The method formulates the periapsis shift in various spacetimes analytically without using special functions and provides simple and highly accurate approximate formulae. We derive new series representations for the periapsis shift in the Kerr and the Chazy-Curzon spacetimes by using the method, where the expansion parameter is defined as the eccentricity divided by the non-dimensional quantity that vanishes in the limit of the innermost stable circular orbit. That is to say, the expansion parameter denotes how eccentric the orbit is and how close it is to the innermost stable circular orbit. The smaller the eccentricity, the higher the accuracy of the formulae that are obtained by truncating the new series representations up to a finite number of terms. If the eccentricity is sufficiently small, the truncated new representations have higher accuracy than the post-Newtonian expansion formulae even in strong gravitational fields where the convergence of the post-Newtonian expansion formula is not guaranteed. On the other hand, even if the orbit is highly eccentric, the truncated new representations have comparable or higher accuracy than the post-Newtonian expansion formulae if the semi-major axis is sufficiently large. An exact formula for the periapsis shift of the quasi-circular orbit in the Chazy-Curzon spacetime is also obtained as a special case of the new series representation.</description>

      <title>A weakly-modeled search for compact binary coalescences in Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Einstein Telescope (ET) is a project of third generation gravitational wave (GW) detector with a planned sensitivity 10 times better than current detectors such as Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. The high rate of GW signals expected in the data will pose several data analysis challenges, like the ability to disentangle overlapping signals or the need to dimension the computational resources required to treat all the candidate events. We explore the behaviour and the performances of a data analysis pipeline designed to search for unmodelled GW signals with duration 1 to 1000 s on a mock dataset that consists of 1 month of data following ET design sensitivity on top of which is added a realistic distribution of compact binary coalescence (CBC) signals. Unmodelled searches are intrinsically less sensitive to CBC signals than template-based searches, but are computationally cheaper and more robust to uncertainties in the waveforms. This search recovers 38% of the total number of injected binary black hole (BBH) signals, including 89% of the systems with a total mass above 100 solar masses, as well as the majority of binary neutron star (BNS) signals closer than 850 Mpc (z = 0.17). It is also able to estimate the chirp mass of the recovered BNS with an average precision of 1.3%. Therefore, we show that this unmodelled search is able to detect a substantial amount of CBC events at a relatively low computational cost, which makes it interesting for low latency analyses and independent validation of detections made by matched filtering pipelines. We also find that the presence of many CBC signals only marginally impacts the sensitivity of the search to other kinds of unmodelled long duration transient signals, by 3% in average.</description>

      <title>The Frame-Dragging effect on the excitation rate of atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The frame-dragging phenomenon in gravitational fields is revisited to explore the geometric effects induced by spacetime curvature. We quantize a massless scalar field in the spacetime of a rotating sphere, incorporating the frame-dragging frequency into the field modes. The excitation rate for an atom undergoing uniform circular motion and interacting with the scalar field is calculated. Our results reveal that the time-dependent excitation rates of atoms following different trajectories exhibit a common envelope, from which the frame-dragging frequency can be effectively extracted. This discovery leads us to propose a novel detection scheme for measuring the frame-dragging frequency caused by rotating celestial bodies, eliminating the need for traditional starlight calibration methods.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Poisson brackets at null infinity compatible with smooth superrotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superrotations are local extensions of the Lorentz group at null infinity that have been argued to be symmetries of gravitational scattering. In their smooth version, they can be identified with the group of diffeomorphisms on the celestial sphere. Their canonical realization requires treating the celestial metric as a variable in the gravitational phase space, along with the news and shear tensors. In this paper, we derive the resulting Poisson brackets (PB). The standard PB algebra of the news and shear tensors is augmented by distributional terms at the boundaries of null infinity, including novel PB relations between the celestial metric and the radiative variables.</description>

      <title>A GPU-accelerated semi-coherent hierarchical search for stellar-mass binary inspiral signals in LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searching for gravitational waves from stellar-mass binary black holes with LISA remains a challenging open problem. Conventional template-bank approaches to the search are impossible due to the prohibitive number of templates that would be required. This paper continues the development of a hierarchical semi-coherent stochastic search, extending it to a full end-to-end pipeline that is then applied to multiple mock LISA data streams which include simulated noise. Particle swarm optimization is used as a stochastic search algorithm, tracking multiple maxima of a semi-coherent search statistic defined over source parameter space. The pipeline is accelerated by the use of graphical processing units (GPUs). No prior information from observations by ground-based detectors is used; this is necessary in order to provide advance warning of the merger. We find that the pipeline is able to detect sources with signal-to-noise ratios as low as $\rho\sim 17$, we demonstrate that these searches can directly seed coarse parameter estimation in cases where the search trigger is loud. An example of how the false-alarm probability can be estimated for this type of GW search is also included.</description>

      <title>AdS$_{3}$ spacetime genus fluctuations and their influence on the false vacuum decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we studied the genus fluctuations of the AdS$_{3}$ spacetime. The tunneling action of the high genus AdS$_{3}$ spacetime is formulated in the Siegel upper half space. Adopting the dilute wormhole gas approximation, we computed the genus creation rate in the semiclassical region. We show that a genus is more easily created in the spacetime corresponding to a larger absolute value of the cosmological constant. We find that fluctuations of fat wormholes are more likely to occur than those of thin wormholes. We also studied the influence of genus fluctuations on false vacuum decay. The vacuum decay rate will increase if the effect of genus fluctuations is included. We show that all results do not change qualitatively when the values of certain parameters are changed.</description>

      <title>Checking the Empirical Relations with the Current Localized Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although fast radio bursts (FRBs) were discovered more than a decade ago, and they have been one of the active fields in astronomy and cosmology, their origins are still unknown. An interesting topic closely related to the origins of FRBs is their classifications. On the other hand, FRBs are actually a promising probe to study cosmology. In the literature, some new classifications of FRBs different from repeaters and non-repeaters were suggested, and some tight empirical relations have been found for them. In particular, Guo and Wei suggested to classify FRBs into the ones associated with old or young populations, which have also some new empirical relations. They also proposed to use one of the empirical relations without dispersion measure (DM) to calibrate FRBs as standard candles for cosmology. This shows the potential of the new classification and the empirical relations for FRBs. Nowadays, more than 50 FRBs have been well localized, and hence their redshifts $z$ are observationally known. Thus, it is time to check the empirical relations with the current localized FRBs. We find that many empirical relations still hold, and in particular the one used to calibrate FRBs as standard candles for cosmology stands firm.</description>

      <title>Perturbations in $\mathbf{O}(D,D)$ string cosmology from double field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The low-energy limit of string theory contains additional gravitational degrees of freedom, a skew-symmetric tensor $B$-field and a scalar dilaton, that are not present in general relativity. Together with the metric, these three fields are naturally embedded in the $\mathbf{O}(D,D)$-symmetric framework of double field theory. The $\mathbf{O}(D,D)$ symmetry uniquely prescribes the interactions between the extended gravitational sector and other matter, leading to novel features beyond conventional string cosmology. In this work we present the equations of motion for linear perturbations around $\mathbf{O}(D,D)$ string cosmological backgrounds in $D=4$ under a scalar-vector-tensor decomposition. We obtain analytic solutions in the superhorizon limit for scalar perturbations around various homogeneous and isotropic background solutions, including some candidate models for bouncing cosmologies. The generalized energy-momentum tensor includes source terms for the $B$-field and dilaton, and we show how the resulting generalized conservation laws modify the conditions for conservation of curvature perturbations.</description>

      <title>The Hubble parameter of the Local Distance Ladder from dynamical dark energy with no free parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our cosmology contains Big Bang relic fluctuations by a loss of time-translation symmetry on a Hubble time scale. The contribution to the vacuum is identified with dynamical dark energy $\Lambda\simeq \alpha_p\Lambda_0$ by an IR coupling $\alpha_p\sim \hbar$ of the bare cosmological constant $\Lambda_0\sim\hbar^{-1}$ consistent with general relativity, where $\hbar$ is the Planck constant. Described by the trace $J=(1-q)H^2$ of the Schouten tensor derived from a path integral formulation with gauged global phase, the proposed $J$CDM takes us beyond the $\Lambda$CDM limit of frozen $J=\Lambda$. The Hubble constant $H_0$ in $J$CDM is effectively $\sqrt{6/5}$ times the {\em Planck} value in $\Lambda$CDM analysis of the CMB according to $H(z)=H_0\sqrt{1+(6/5)\Omega_{M,0} Z_5(z) + \Omega_{r,0}Z_6(z)}/(1+z)$, where $Z_n=(1+z)^n-1$ given densities of matter $\Omega_{M,0}$ and radiation $\Omega_{r,0}$. With no free parameters, $J$CDM hereby agrees with the Local Distance Ladder when satisfying the BAO measured by {\em Planck}. On this cosmological background, galaxies possess an essentially $C^0$-transition to anomalous dynamics due to reduced inertia below the de Sitter scale of acceleration $a_{dS}=cH$, where $c$ is the velocity of light. This is confirmed in SPARC over a 6$\sigma$ tension in $\Lambda$CDM galaxy models, pointing to ultra-light CDM of mass $m_Dc^2&lt;3\times 10^{-21}$eV. Sensitivity to this cosmological background explains the JWST 'Impossible galaxies' at cosmic dawn by rapid gravitational collapse. We comment on an outlook on future confrontations with observations by {\em Euclid}.</description>

      <title>Constraining binary mergers in AGN disks using the non-observation of lensed gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dense and dynamic environments within active galactic nuclei (AGN) accretion disks may serve as prolific birthplaces for binary black holes (BBHs) and one possible origin for some of the BBHs detected by gravitational-wave (GW) observatories. We show that a considerable fraction of the BBH in AGN disks will be strongly lensed by the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). Thus, the non-observation of lensed GW signals can be used to constrain the fraction of BBH binaries residing in AGN disks. The non-detection of lensing with current ${\cal O}(100)$ detections will be sufficient to start placing constraints on the fraction of BBHs living within accretion disks near the SMBH. In the next-generation detectors era, with ${\cal O}(10^5)$ BBH observations and no lensed events, we will be able to rule out most migration traps as dominant birthplaces of BBH mergers; moreover, we will be able to constrain the minimum size of the accretion disk. On the other hand, should AGNs constitute a major formation channel, lensed events from AGNs will become prominent in the future.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave matched filtering with variational quantum algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the application of variational quantum algorithms designed for classical optimization to the problem of matched filtering in the detection of gravitational waves. Matched filtering for detecting gravitational wave signals requires searching through a large number of template waveforms, to find one which is highly correlated with segments of detector data. This computationally intensive task needs to be done quickly for low latency searches in order to aid with follow-up multi-messenger observations. The variational quantum algorithms we study for this task consist of quantum walk-based generalizations of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). We present results of classical numerical simulations of these quantum algorithms using open science data from LIGO. These results show that the tested variational quantum algorithms are outperformed by an unstructured restricted-depth Grover search algorithm, suggesting that the latter is optimal for this computational task.</description>

      <title>The symplectic potential for leaky boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charges associated with gauge symmetries are defined on boundaries of spacetimes. But these constructions typically involve divergent quantities when considering asymptotic boundaries. Different prescriptions exist to address this problem, based on ambiguities in the definition of the symplectic potential. We propose a method well suited to leaky boundaries, which describe spacetimes than can exchange matter or radiation with their environment. The main advantage of this approach is that it relies only on the bulk Lagrangian and it is not tied to a specific choice of boundary conditions. The prescription is applied to four dimensional Einstein-Hilbert gravity in the partial Bondi gauge. This leads to a finite symplectic potential for unconstrained boundary data and reveals two new corner symplectic pairs associated with the relaxation of the gauge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.06384v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new picture of the early universe in finite nonlocal quantum gravity, which is Weyl invariant at the classical and quantum levels. The high-energy regime of the theory consists of two phases, a Weyl invariant trans-Planckian phase and a post-Planckian or Higgs phase described by an action quadratic in the Ricci tensor and where the cosmos evolves according to the standard radiation-dominated model. In the first phase, all the issues of the hot big bang such as the singularity, flatness, and horizon problems find a universal and simple non-inflationary solution by means of Weyl invariance, regardless of the microscopic details of the theory. In the second phase, once Weyl symmetry is spontaneously broken, primordial perturbations are generated around a background that asymptotically evolves as a radiation-dominated flat Friedmann--Lema\^{i}tre--Robertson--Walker universe.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes and shadow in Einstein Maxwell power-Yang-Mills black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper, we investigate the quasinormal modes of an Einstein-Maxwell power-Yang-Mills black hole in four dimensions, considering a specific value of the power parameter $p = 1/2$. This particular case represents a black hole with both Abelian and Non-Abelian charges and is asymptotically non-flat. We begin by deriving the effective potential for both a neutral massless particle and a neutral Dirac particle using the aforementioned black hole solution. Subsequently, employing the sixth-order WKB approximation method, we calculate the (scalar) quasinormal modes. Our numerical analysis indicates that these modes are stable within the considered parameter range. This result is also confirmed using the eikonal approximation. Furthermore, we calculate the shadow radius for this class of BH and derive constraints on the electric and Yang-Mills charges ($Q, Q_{\rm YM}$) by using imaging observational data for Sgr A${^\star}$, provided by the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration. We observe that as the electric charge $Q$ increases, the allowed range shifts towards negative values of $Q_{\rm YM}$. For instance, for the maximum value $Q\approx 1.1$ obtained, the allowed range becomes $-0.171 \lesssim Q_{\rm YM} \lesssim -0.087$ consistent with KECK and VLTI data, while still retaining a non-vanishing horizon.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Primordial Black Hole Evaporation with Large Extra Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spectra of gravitational waves from black hole evaporation generically peak at frequencies of order the Hawking temperature, making this signal ultra-high frequency for primordial black holes evaporating in the early universe. This motivates us to consider small black holes in theories with large extra dimensions, for which the peak frequency can be lowered substantially, since the true bulk Planck scale $M_*$ can be much smaller than the effective $M_{\rm Pl}$. We study the emission of brane-localized gravitons during the Hawking evaporation of ultra-light primordial black holes in the context of theories with large extra dimensions, with the ultimate goal of computing the contribution to the stochastic gravitational wave background. To accurately model black hole evolution, we compute greybody factors for particles of spin-0, 1/2, 1, and 2 emitted on the brane and in the bulk, presuming the majority of emission proceeds during the Schwarzschild phase. We then compute the power spectrum and present day spectral density parameter for brane-localized gravitons contributing to a gravitational wave signal. We find that for an optimal choice of parameters, the peak frequency plateaus in the sub-MHz regime, within range of planned high-frequency gravitational wave detectors, making this scenario a target for detection once their sensitivity exceeds $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been suggested to use seismic detectors on the Moon as a tool to search for gravitational waves in an intermediate frequency range between mHz and Hz. Employing three different spherically symmetric models for the lunar interior, we investigate the response of the Moon to gravitational waves in Einstein and Jordan-Brans-Dicke gravity. We find that the first eigenfrequencies of the different models depend only weakly on the model details, with the fundamental frequency $\nu_1$ close to 1\,ms both for spheroidal and toroidal oscillations. In contrast, the resulting displacement varies up to a factor two, being in the range $(2.7-5.6)\times 10^{11}/h_0$ cm for spheroidal oscillations with amplitude $h_0$. Toroidal oscillations are suppressed by a factor $2\pi\nu R/c$, both in Einstein gravity and in general scalar-tensor theories.</description>

Abstract: We give a general proof that the only static and spherically symmetric, vacuum solutions of the local scale invariant conformally coupled scalar theory of gravity, are conformal to the Schwarzschild-de Sitter solution. In this context the physical relevance of local scale symmetry is discussed in light of two complementary points of view on conformal transformations understood as either passive or active transformations.</description>

Abstract: We introduce an innovative method to explore gravity's quantum aspects using a novel theoretical framework. Our model delves into gravity-induced entanglement (GIE) while sidestepping classical communication limitations imposed by the LOCC principle. Specifically, we connect a non-relativistic two-dimensional quantum oscillator detector with linearly polarized gravitational waves (GWs), leveraging the quantum properties inherent in GWs to observe GIE within the oscillator's quantum states. Because our model adheres to both the ``event" and the ``system" localities, the detected GIE serves as a robust indicator of gravity's quantum nature. Detecting this entanglement via gravitational wave detectors could corroborate gravity's quantization and unveil crucial properties of its sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We evaluate the possibility of the formation of naked singularities in the interaction of Kerr black holes with test massless spin-2 fields. We analyse the scattering problem for both extremal and nearly extremal black holes by incorporating the explicit form of the absorption probabilities. We show that extremal black holes become non-extremal after the interaction with the modes with both positive and negative absorption probabilities. For nearly extremal black holes the absorption probability for the challenging modes turns out to be of the order $\epsilon^5$, where $\epsilon$ parametrizes the closeness to extremality. Though the highest absorption probability for $m=2$ modes pertains to spin-2 fields, its drastically small value implies that the event horizon is preserved without the need to employ the backreaction effects. The result can be qualitatively extrapolated to hypothetical higher integer spin fields. We also review and extend our previous comments on Sorce-Wald method. We show that the order magnitude problems can be avoided by abandoning the non-physical parameter $\lambda$. The conditions derived by Sorce-Wald can be legitimately used to incorporate the back-reaction effects by avoiding to multiply them by $\lambda^2$, thereby preserving the magnitude of their contribution. We apply this method to the problems of over-charging R-N black holes and over-spinning Kerr black holes, in a rough analysis ignoring absorption probabilities which could apply to test bodies.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study propagation of the high frequency electromagnetic waves in a curved spacetime. We discuss a so call spinoptics approach which generalizes a well known geometric optics approximation and allows one to take into account spin-dependent corrections. A new element proposed in this work is the use of effective action which allows one to derive spinoptics equations. This method is simpler and more transparent than the earlier proposed methods. It is explicitly covariant and can be applied to an arbitrary spacetime background. We also demonstrate how the initial value problem for the high frequency electromagnetiv wave can be soled in the developed spinoptics approximation.</description>

Abstract: The massless fields in the universal NS-NS sector of string theory form $O(D, D)$ multiplets of Double Field Theory, which is a theory that provides a T-duality covariant formulation of supergravity, leading to a stringy modification of General Relativity. In this framework, it is possible to write down the extensions of the Einstein field equations and the Friedmann equations in such a way that the coupling of gravitational and matter sectors is dictated by the $O(D, D)$ symmetry universally. In this paper, we obtain the autonomous form of the $O(D, D)$-complete Friedmann equations, find the critical points and perform their stability analysis. We also include the phase portraits of the system. Cosmologically interesting cases of scalar field, radiation, and matter are separately considered and compared with the Chameleon models in a similar setting. Accelerating phases and the conditions for their existence are also given for such cases.</description>

Abstract: Lagrange scalar densities which are concomitants of two scalar fields, a pseudo-Riemannian metric tensor, and their derivatives of arbitrary differential order are investigated in a space of four-dimensions. My intention was to construct the most general second-order Euler-Lagrange tensor densities derivable from such a Lagrangian. It is demonstrated that many such second-order Euler-Lagrange tensor densities can be derived from a set of four Lagrangians which are at most of second-order. These Lagrangians will have a total of six scalar coefficients, each of which is a concomitant of five variables: the two scalar fields, and the three inner products of the gradients of the two scalar fields. Of these six coefficient functions only one is arbitrary, while the other five must satisfy linear partial differential equations. These non-arbitrary scalar functions break up into three groups: two groups of two, and one single function, with different groups appearing in different Lagrangians. Surprisingly each of these five functions give rise to solutions to the wave equation in three-dimensional Minkowski space. However, I do not construct all of the second-order bi-scalar-tensor field equations that can be obtained in a space of four-dimensions, and remark on what needs to be done to do so. I conclude the paper by presenting twelve second-order bi-scalar-tensor Lagrangians, involving eighteen coefficient functions, and conjecture that these Lagrangians can be used to construct all possible second-order bi-scalar-tensor field equations in a space of four-dimensions.</description>

      <title>Effect of the spatial curvature on light bending and time delay in curved Einstein-Straus--de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A method of general applicability has been developed, whereby the null geodesic equations of the Einstein-Straus-de Sitter metric can be integrated simultaneously in terms of the curvature constant $k$. The purpose is to generalize the computation of light deflection and time delay by a spherical mass distribution. Assuming a flat Universe with most recent measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$ and the cosmological constant $\Lambda$, five time delays between the four bright images of the lensed quasar SDSS J1004+4112 have been forecasted and compared to others in the field. In addition, we have reviewed the question of the possible contribution of a positive $\Lambda$ to reduce the light bending, and concluded that the changes are seemingly too small to be appreciable on cosmological scales. The same conclusion has been reached regarding the time delay. Having addressed the question of the effect of the spatial curvature in both closed and open Universe, we have found that the strong lensing is slightly affected by the expected small curvature density $\Omega_{k0}$ of the current Universe within its error bar $|\Omega_{k0}|\lessapprox 0.001$, in such a way that it may safely be neglected. However, it's only if $\Omega_{k0}$ gets quite larger that the effect being noticeable. While it is only theoretically possible for $\Omega_{k0}$ to be higher, it's worthwhile to stress that this should impact the light bending and time delay, causing them to decrease or increase depending upon whether the spatial curvature is positive or negative. Furthermore, one can infer that the observed light deflection and time delay independently, that are found to be significantly deviated from those of the flat Universe, may serve as a useful means to provide constraints on $\Omega _{k0}$, thus making the approach employed in this work more promising than others.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) detect gravitational waves (GWs) via the correlations they create in the arrival times of pulses from different pulsars. The mean correlation, a function of the angle between the directions to two pulsars, was predicted in 1983 by Hellings and Downs (HD). Observation of this angular pattern is the ``smoking gun'' that GWs are present, so PTAs ``reconstruct the HD curve'' by estimating the correlation using pulsar pairs separated by similar angles. Several studies have examined the amount by which this curve is expected to differ from the HD mean. The variance arises because (a) a finite set of pulsars at specific sky locations is used, (b) the GW sources interfere, and (c) the data are contaminated by noise. Here, for a Gaussian ensemble of sources, we predict that variance by constructing an optimal estimator of the HD correlation, taking into account the pulsar sky locations and the frequency distribution of the GWs and the pulsar noise. The variance is a ratio: the numerator depends upon the pulsar sky locations, and the denominator is the (effective) number of frequency bins for which the GW signal dominates the noise. In effect, after suitable combination, each frequency bin gives an independent estimate of the HD correlation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments have reported strong evidence of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). If interpreted as primordial Gravitational Waves (pGWs), the signal favors a strongly blue-tilted spectrum. On the other hand, the Ekpyrosis-bouncing cosmology with a strongly blue-tilted GW spectrum, i.e., $n_T \simeq 2$, offers a potential explanation for the observed SGWB signal. In this paper, we construct a concrete Ekpyrosis-bouncing model, and show its capacity to intepret the PTA result without pathologies. Both tensor and scalar perturbations are analysed with constraints from the current observations.</description>

      <title>Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture Cannot be Violated in Gedanken Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We innovate a systematic investigation of the Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture (WCCC) using gedanken experiments involving black hole perturbations by test particles. We classify various WCCC violation scenarios proposed in recent decades, including Hubeny, mixed, and the latest Sorce-Wald (SW). We provide general formulae in each case, and resolve contradictions in numerous studies. Following SW type, our analysis reveals that WCCC depends on the sign choice of the parameter $W\equiv \big(\frac{\partial S}{\partial T}\big)_{Q_i; T=0}$ of the extremal black holes. $W &gt; 0$ preserves WCCC and $W &lt; 0$ would indicate potential violation. We show explicitly that $W&gt;0$ for spherically-symmetric and static black holes, and for general case, we argue that it is protected by the black hole no-hair theorem. We also consider asymptotically-(A)dS black holes and argue that there can be no violation either.</description>

      <title>Expansions for semiclassical conformal blocks</title>

Abstract: We propose a relation the expansions of regular and irregular semiclassical conformal blocks at different branch points making use of the connection between the accessory parameters of the BPZ decoupling equations to the logarithm derivative of isomonodromic tau functions. We give support for these relations by considering two eigenvalue problems for the confluent Heun equations obtained from the linearized perturbation theory of black holes. We first derive the large frequency expansion of the spheroidal equations, and then compare numerically the excited quasi-normal mode spectrum for the Schwarzschild case obtained from the large frequency expansion to the one obtained from the low frequency expansion and with the literature, indicating that the relations hold generically in the complex modulus plane.</description>

      <title>Using gravitational waves to see the first second of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves are a unique probe of the early Universe, as the Universe is transparent to gravitational radiation right back to the end of inflation. In this article, we summarise detection prospects and the wide scope of primordial events that could lead to a detectable stochastic gravitational wave background. Any such background would shed light on what lies beyond the Standard Model, sometimes at remarkably high scales. We overview the range of strategies for detecting a stochastic gravitational wave background before delving deep into three major primordial events that can source such a background. Finally, we summarize the landscape of other sources of primordial backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Atomic clock interferometry using optical tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14412v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clock interferometry refers to the coherent splitting of a clock into two different paths and recombining in a way that reveals the proper time difference between them. Unlike the comparison of two separate clocks, this approach allows testing how non-flat spacetime influences quantum coherence. Atomic clocks are currently the most accurate time keeping devices. Here we propose using optical tweezers to implement clock interferometry. Our proposed clock interferometer employs an alkaline-earth-like atom held in an optical trap at the magic wavelength. Through a combination of adiabatic, tweezer-based, splitting and recombining schemes and a modified Ramsey sequence on the clock states, we achieve a linear sensitivity to the gravitational time dilation. Moreover, the measurement of the time dilation is insensitive to relative fluctuations in the intensity of the tweezer beams. We analyze the tweezer clock interferometer and show that it is feasible with current technological capabilities. The proposed interferometer could test the effect of gravitational redshift on quantum coherence, and implement the quantum twin paradox.</description>

      <title>Litmus tests of the flat $\Lambda$CDM model and model-independent measurement of $H_0r_\mathrm{d}$ with LSST and DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this analysis we apply a model-independent framework to test the flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology using simulated SNIa data from the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and combined with simulated Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) five-years Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data. We adopt an iterative smoothing technique to reconstruct the expansion history from SNIa data, which, when combined with BAO measurements, facilitates a comprehensive test of the Universe's curvature and the nature of dark energy. The analysis is conducted under three different mock true cosmologies: a flat $\Lambda$CDM universe, a universe with a notable curvature ($\Omega_{k,0} = 0.1$), and one with dynamically evolving dark energy. Each cosmology demonstrates different kinds and varying degrees of deviation from the standard model predictions. We forecast that our reconstruction technique can constrain cosmological parameters, such as the curvature ($\Omega_{k,0}$) and $c/H_0 r_\mathrm{d}$, with a precision of approximately 0.5\% for $c/H_0r_\mathrm{d}$ and 0.04 for $\Omega_{k,0}$, competitive with current cosmic microwave background constraints, without assuming any form of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Loops, Recursions, and Soft Limits for Fermionic Correlators in (A)dS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Study of correlation functions in AdS/CFT and in-in correlators in de Sitter space often requires the computation of Witten diagrams. Due to the complexity of evaluating radial integrals for these correlators, several indirect approaches have been developed to simplify computations. However, in momentum space, these methods have been limited to fields with integer spin. In this paper, we formulate tools for evaluating Witten diagrams with spin$-\frac12$ fields in momentum space and discuss where they differ from the corresponding integer-spin analysis. We formulate our tools explicitly for massless fermions and present how appropriate Weight shifting operators with respect to the external kinematics can be used to obtain the generalization to fermions with integer mass. We apply these tools to loop Witten diagrams and also discuss their use for evaluating in-in correlators in dS. In cases where we can evaluate the loop integrals, we find their transcendentality is lower than the corresponding scalar field results. Further, we classify the nature of IR divergences encountered for interacting massive scalars and fermions. We also prove a novel Weinberg-like soft theorem for gauge fields coupled to matter in AdS and show that the universal terms in the leading soft factor are sensitive to the spin of the matter field. These generalize the recently discovered soft theorems for pure Yang-Mills to Yang-Mills with matter.</description>
