      <title>Analog ensemble forecasts of solar wind parameters: Quantification of the predictability and spectral performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecasting multiscale properties of the solar wind is one of the important aspects of space weather prediction as mesoscales, larger than one minute, can affect the magnetosphere. Amongst forecasting techniques, the Analog Ensemble (AnEn) method allows the forecast of a quantity from its past behavior, is easy and quick to implement, and results in an ensemble of time series.
  A comparison of optimal AnEn forecasts of \textit{Wind} spacecraft observations of near-Earth solar wind properties with the persistence and climatology baselines allows a quantification of the predictability of the magnetic and velocity components and magnitude. The AnEn predictions were found to be as accurate as persistence for short-term forecasts and climatology for long-term ones, and performed better than both baselines for more than 60\% of the samples for a particular lead time. Furthermore, using an AnEn instead of the baselines enables prediction of the full spectrum of solar wind fluctuations. However, using the standard averaging method to generate a unique forecast from the AnEn ensemble results in a loss of power in the small-scale fluctuations. To prevent this loss, a new spectral reduction method is proposed and compared to the standard averaging method as well as the synodic recurrence baseline. The AnEn spectral-reduced forecast is shown to be more time-accurate than the synodic baseline and more frequency-accurate than the mean-reduced forecasts. Such a reduced forecast is then confirmed to be useful as a comparative baseline in performance diagnostics of space weather models.</description>

      <title>Probability of collision in nonlinear dynamics by moment propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating the probability of collision between spacecraft is crucial for risk management and collision-avoidance strategies. Current methods often rely on Gaussian assumptions and simplifications, which can be inaccurate in highly nonlinear scenarios. This paper presents a general and efficient approach for computing collision probabilities without relying on such assumptions. Using high-order multivariate Taylor polynomials, we propagate statistical moments of initial uncertainties to the point of closest approach between the spacecraft. To compute the probability of collision, we derive a semi-analytical expression for the probability density function (PDF) of the closest approach distance, inferred from the propagated moments using orthogonal polynomials. Tested on various short-term and long-term encounters in low-Earth orbit, our method accurately handles nonlinear dynamics, non-Gaussian uncertainties, and irregular distributions. This versatile framework advances space situational awareness by providing precise collision probability estimates in complex dynamical environments. Moreover, our methodology applies to any dynamical system with uncertainty in its initial state and is therefore not restricted to collision probability estimation.</description>

      <title>What determines the brightness of magnetically open solar corona?: Insights from three-dimensional radiative MHD simulations and observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between solar coronal holes and open-field regions using three-dimensional radiative magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations combined with remote-sensing observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Our numerical simulations reveal that magnetically open regions in the corona can exhibit brightness comparable to quiet regions, challenging the conventional view that open-field regions are inherently dark coronal holes. We find that the coronal brightness is primarily determined by the total energy input from photospheric magnetic activities, such as the small-scale dynamo, rather than differences in dissipative processes within the corona. Using synthesized EUV intensity maps, we show that brightness thresholds commonly used to identify coronal holes may overlook open-field regions, especially at lower spatial resolutions. Observational analysis utilizing SDO/HMI and AIA synoptic maps supports our simulation results, demonstrating that magnetic field extrapolation techniques, such as the Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) model, are sensitive to the chosen parameters, including the source surface height. We suggest that discrepancies in estimates of open magnetic flux (the ``open flux problem'') arise both from the modeling assumptions in coronal magnetic field extrapolation and systematic biases in solar surface magnetic field observations. Our findings indicate the need for reconsidering criteria used to identify coronal holes as indicators of open-field regions to better characterize the solar open magnetic flux.</description>

      <title>An interstellar mission to test astrophysical black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black holes are the sources of the strongest gravitational fields that can be found today in the Universe and are ideal laboratories for testing Einstein's theory of General Relativity in the strong field regime. In this letter, I show that the possibility of an interstellar mission to send small spacecrafts to the nearest black hole, although very speculative and extremely challenging, is not completely unrealistic. Certainly we do not have the necessary technology today, but it may be available in the next 20-30 years. The mission may last 80-100 years, but we would be able to obtain very valuable information about black holes and General Relativity that could be unlikely obtained in other ways.</description>
