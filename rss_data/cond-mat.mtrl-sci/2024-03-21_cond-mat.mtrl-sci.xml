      <title>Intercomparison exercise on Monte Carlo simulations of electron spectra and energy depositions by a single gold nanoparticle under X-ray irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational approaches, such as Monte Carlo (MC) radiation transport simulations, are used to estimate the dosimetric effects of GNPs, where results differing by orders of magnitudes have been reported by different investigators. This has motivated an intercomparison exercise, which was conducted as a joint activity of EURADOS Working Groups 6 "Computational Dosimetry" and 7 "Internal Dosimetry". The aim of this exercise was to determine the extent of such discrepancies between the results obtained by different researchers and different codes in a very simple simulation setup.
  Several individual EURADOS associate members and two code developer groups from outside Europe participated in this exercise applying seven different MC codes to perform the simulations of a simple defined geometry set-up of one single GNP irradiated in water by kilo-voltage X-rays. Two GNP diameters of 50 nm and 100 nm of were considered and two photon spectra as generated by X-ray tubes operated at 50 kV and 100 kV peak voltages. The geometry set-up and X-ray spectra were provided by the EURADOS task group. The participants were asked to determine for each combination of GNP size and X-ray spectrum the dose enhancement ratio (DER) of 10 nm-thick water shells up to 1000 nm and 1 $\mu$m-thick water shells up to 50 $\mu$m around the GNP. Furthermore, the electron spectra emitted from the GNP and the energy depositions in water shells around it were also to be reported.
  This EURADOS report summarizes the motivation and background for the exercise, the tasks to be solved, the codes used, the results reported by the participants, the consistency checks applied in their evaluation and a best estimates and uncertainty bands derived from the final results for the energy spectra of emitted electrons and the energy imparted in the vicinity of the GNP.</description>

      <title>DyFeO3 electrode material with ultra-wide voltage window for aqueous symmetric supercapacitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aqueous supercapacitors (SCs) encounter limitations in operational voltage and energy density due to the low decomposition voltage of water. Here, we fabricate aqueous symmetric supercapacitors (ASSCs) employing DyFeO3 as an electrode material. This hybrid SC in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte exhibits a significantly high working voltage of 2.5 V, with an energy density of 41.81 Wh/kg at a power density of 1250 W/kg, maintaining 94% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles. By incorporating 20% volume of acetonitrile with water in the electrolyte, we extend the potential window to 3.1 V, with an energy density of 84.43 Wh/kg at a power density of 1550 W/kg. The as-fabricated ASSC shows promising stability during a 300-hour float voltage test with almost intact capacitance retention and Coulombic efficiency. For the first time, our study unveils the potential of porous DyFeO3 as an electrode material for advancing ASSCs, featuring an unprecedented ultra-wide voltage window, along with significantly large energy and power densities.</description>

      <title>Autonomous microARPES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) is a technique used to map the occupied electronic structure of solids. Recent progress in X-ray focusing optics has led to the development of ARPES into a microscopic tool, permitting the electronic structure to be spatially mapped across the surface of a sample. This comes at the expense of a time-consuming scanning process to cover not only a three-dimensional energy-momentum ($E, k_z, k_y$) space but also the two-dimensional surface area. Here, we implement a protocol to autonomously search both $\mathbf{k}$- and real space in order to find positions of particular interest, either because of their high photoemission intensity or because of sharp spectral features. The search is based on the use of Gaussian process regression and can easily be expanded to include additional parameters or optimisation criteria. This autonomous experimental control is implemented on the SGM4 micro-focus beamline of the synchrotron radiation source ASTRID2.</description>

      <title>Combined X-ray diffraction, electrical resistivity, and $ab$ $initio$ study of (TMTTF)$_2$PF$_6$ under pressure: implications to the unified phase diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a combined experimental and theoretical study on the quasi-one-dimensional organic conductor (TMTTF)$_2$PF$_6$, and elucidate the variation of its physical properties under pressure. We fully resolve the crystal structure by single crystal x-ray diffraction measurements using a diamond anvil cell up to 8 GPa, and based on the structural data, we perform first-principles density-functional theory calculations and derive the $ab$ $initio$ extended Hubbard-type Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we compare the behavior of the resistivity measured up to 3 GPa using a BeCu clamp-type cell and the ground state properties of the obtained model numerically calculated by the many-variable variational Monte Carlo method. Our main findings are as follows: i) The crystal was rapidly compressed up to about 3 GPa where the volume drops to 80% and gradually varies down to 70% at 8 GPa. The transfer integrals increase following such behavior whereas the screened Coulomb interactions decrease, resulting in a drastic reduction of correlation effect. ii) The degree of dimerization in the intrachain transfer integrals, as the result of the decrease in structural dimerization together with the change in the intermolecular configuration, almost disappears above 4 GPa; the interchain transfer integrals also show characteristic variations under pressure. iii) The results of identifying the characteristic temperatures in the resistivity and the charge and spin orderings in the calculations show an overall agreement: The charge ordering sensitively becomes unstable above 1 GPa, while the spin ordering survives up to higher pressures. These results shed light on the similarities and differences between applying external pressure and substituting the chemical species (chemical pressure).</description>

      <title>Exploring magnetic anisotropy in bcc-structured ferromagnetic thin films with three spin layers using the fourth order perturbed Heisenberg Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates into the analysis of ferromagnetic thin films with a body centered cubic lattice and three spin layers, utilizing the solution of the fourth-order perturbed Heisenberg Hamiltonian equation with seven magnetic energy parameters. Spin-exchange interaction, magnetic dipole interaction, second-order magnetic anisotropy,fourth-order magnetic anisotropy, applied magnetic field, demagnetization energy, and stress-induced anisotropy were all taken into account. According to 3D plots, the minimum order of energy was observed when the second order magnetic anisotropy constant in the middle spin layer is less than those of the bottom and top spin layers. In all cases, the values of stress-induced anisotropy at the maxima of 3D plots are exactly the same when the values of the second-order magnetic anisotropy constants of the bottom, middle, and top spin layers are interchanged with each other. In 2D plots, the angle between consecutive magnetic easy and hard directions is approximately 90 degrees in all cases. Additionally, the magnetic easy and hard directions were observed to have exactly the same values when the second-order magnetic anisotropy constant of the spin layers changes. These results were compared with the results obtained using the second and third order perturbed Heisenberg Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Large Exciton Binding Energy in the Bulk van der Waals Magnet CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitons, bound electron-hole pairs, influence the optical properties in strongly interacting solid state systems. Excitons and their associated many-body physics are typically most stable and pronounced in monolayer materials. Bulk systems with large exciton binding energies, on the other hand, are rare and the mechanisms driving their stability are still relatively unexplored. Here, we report an exceptionally large exciton binding energy in single crystals of the bulk van der Waals antiferromagnet CrSBr. Utilizing state-of-the-art angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and self-consistent ab-initio GW calculations, we present direct spectroscopic evidence that robust electronic and structural anisotropy can significantly amplify the exciton binding energy within bulk crystals. Furthermore, the application of a vertical electric field enables broad tunability of the optical and electronic properties. Our results indicate that CrSBr is a promising material for the study of the role of anisotropy in strongly interacting bulk systems and for the development of exciton-based optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Electricity at the macroscale and its microscopic origins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I define the fields that describe electrical macrostructure, and their rates of change, in terms of the microscopic charge density, electric field, electric potential, and their rates of change. To deduce these definitions, I lay some foundations of a general theory of structure homogenization, meaning a theory of how any observable macroscopic field is related to spatial averages of its microscopic counterpart.
  I apply homogenization theory to the fields that appear in the vacuum theory of electromagnetism and deduce that the relationships between macroscopic fields are identical in form to the relationships between their microscopic counterparts. Without invoking quantum mechanics, I derive the expressions for polarization current established by the Modern Theory of Polarization. I prove that the bulk-average electric potential, or mean inner potential, vanishes in a macroscopically-uniform charge-neutral material, and I show that when a crystal lattice lacks inversion symmetry, it does not imply the existence of macroscopic $\vec{E}$ or $\vec{P}$ fields in the crystal's bulk.
  I point out that symmetry is scale-dependent. Therefore, if anisotropy of the microstructure does not manifest as anisotropy of the macrostructure, it cannot be the origin of a macroscopic vector field. The macroscopic charge density is isotropic in the bulks of most materials, because it vanishes at every point. Therefore, regardless of the microstructure, a macroscopic electric field cannot emanate from the bulk. I find that all relationships between observable macroscopic fields can be expressed mathematically without introducing the polarization ($\vec{P}$) and electric displacement ($\vec{D}$) fields, neither of which is observable.

      <title>First-principles studies of Schottky barriers and tunneling properties at Al(111)/Si(111) and CoSi$_2$(111)/Si(111) interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present first-principles calculations of Schottky barrier heights (SBHs) at interfaces relevant for silicon-based merged-element transmon qubit devices. Focusing on Al(111)/Si(111) and CoSi$_2$(111)/Si(111), we consider various possible interfacial structures, for which we study the relaxations of the atoms near the interface, calculate the formation energies and Schottky barrier heights, and provide estimates of the Josephson critical currents based on the WKB tunneling formalism as implemented in the Simmons/Tsu-Esaki model. We find that the formation energies and SBHs are very similar for all Al(111)/Si(111) structures, yet vary significantly for the CoSi$_2$(111)/Si(111) structures. We attribute this to the more covalent character of bonding at CoSi$_2$/Si, which leads to configurations with distinct atomic and electronic structure. Our estimated Josephson critical currents, which govern the behavior of merged-element transmons, provide insight into the trends as a function of Schottky-barrier height. We show that desirable qubit frequencies of 4-5 GHz can be obtained with a Si barrier thickness of about 5-10 nm, and demonstrate that the critical current density as a function of Schottky barrier height can be modeled based on the tunneling probability for a rectangular barrier.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Neutron Nuclear-Magnetic Interference Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electron-phonon interaction plays a critical role in materials electrical, thermal, optical, and superconducting properties. However, measuring the phonon mode-resolved electron-phonon interaction has been challenging. Here we propose neutron-scattering-based Anomalous Neutron nUclear-Magnetic Interference Spectroscopy (ANUBIS), where the co-existence of neutron nuclear scattering and magnetic scattering leads to anomalous dynamical structure factor under the presence of the electron-phonon interaction. Such anomalous structure factor is linear in electron-phonon coupling constant at the phonon wavevector, and is directly proportional to the momentum and energy-resolved dielectric function. The experimental configuration can be achieved using existing polarized inelastic neutron scattering setup, and an order-of-magnitude estimate shows the viability to observe the anomalous scattering signal is around $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-3}$ relative to phonon scattering, which is achievable at emerging neutron facilities. Our proposal offers an alternative neutron-based metrology to probe the crucial electronic properties.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Modeling of Dislocation Mobility from Atomistics using Physics-Informed Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dislocation mobility, which dictates the response of dislocations to an applied stress, is a fundamental property of crystalline materials that governs the evolution of plastic deformation. Traditional approaches for deriving mobility laws rely on phenomenological models of the underlying physics, whose free parameters are in turn fitted to a small number of intuition-driven atomic scale simulations under varying conditions of temperature and stress. This tedious and time-consuming approach becomes particularly cumbersome for materials with complex dependencies on stress, temperature, and local environment, such as body-centered cubic crystals (BCC) metals and alloys. In this paper, we present a novel, uncertainty quantification-driven active learning paradigm for learning dislocation mobility laws from automated high-throughput large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) with a physics-informed architecture. We demonstrate that this Physics-informed Graph Neural Network (PI-GNN) framework captures the underlying physics more accurately compared to existing phenomenological mobility laws in BCC metals.</description>

      <title>Magnetization and exchange-stiffness constants of Fe-Al-Si alloys at finite-temperatures: A first-principles study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the magnetic properties of Sendust (Fe-Al-Si) alloys not only at 0 K but also at finite-temperatures by means of the first-principles calculations assuming A2, B2, and DO3 structures. We confirmed that the itinerant characteristics of 3d electrons of Fe are not negligible for A2 and B2 structures and a significantly small exchange stiffness constant exists at zero-temperature in a B2 structure. However, the calculated Curie temperatures are in the same order for all structures; this indicates that the Curie temperature cannot be determined only by the exchange interactions at zero-temperature in itinerant electron systems. Temperature dependence of the exchange interaction, namely spin configuration dependence, also might be important for determining it. In addition, this property might also be related to the unique behavior of the temperature dependence of the exchange stiffness constant for the B2 structure, which does not decrease monotonically as temperatures increase, contrary to the behavior expected from the Heisenberg model. In addition, we investigated composition dependence on the exchange stiffness constant at zero-temperature and confirmed that the substitution of Si with Al could improve the amplitude of the exchange stiffness constant at zero-temperature for all structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring solid-state lithium batteries perform well across a wide temperature range is crucial for their practical use. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can provide valuable insights into the temperature dependence of the battery materials, however, the high computational cost of ab initio MD poses challenges for simulating ion migration dynamics at low temperatures. To address this issue, accurate machine-learning interatomic potentials were trained, which enable efficient and reliable simulations of the ionic diffusion processes in Li6PS5Cl over a large temperature range for long-time evolution. Our study revealed the significant impact of subtle lattice parameter variations on Li+ diffusion at low temperatures and identified the increasing influence of surface contributions as the temperature decreases. Our findings elucidate the factors influencing low temperature performance and present strategic guidance towards improving the performance of solid-state lithium batteries under these conditions.</description>

      <title>Efficient Learning Strategy for Predicting Glass Forming Ability in Imbalanced Datasets of Bulk Metallic Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prediction of glass forming ability (GFA) and various properties in bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) pose a challenge due to the unique disordered atomic structure in this type of materials. Machine learning shows the potential ability to find a way out. However, the training set from the experimental data of BMGs faces the issue of data imbalance, including the distribution of data related to elements, the range of performance data, and the distribution of sparse and dense data area in each specific system. In this work, the origin of the data imbalance and its impact on the GFA prediction ability of machine learning models are analyzed. We propose the solutions by training the model using the pruned dataset to mitigate the imbalance and by performing an active experimental iterative learning to compensate for the information loss resulting from data reduction. The strategy is proved in Zr-Al-Cu system, and the automated workflow has been established. It effectively avoids the prediction results from trapping into the intensive training data area or from inducing by the data distribution of similar element systems. This approach will expedite the development of new BMGs compositions especially for unexplored systems.</description>

      <title>Temperature dependent conductivity, dielectric relaxation, electrical modulus and impedance spectroscopy of Ni substituted Na$_{3+2x}$Zr$_{2-x}$Ni$_{x}$Si$_2$PO$_{\rm 12}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the structural, dielectric relaxation, electric modulus and impedance behavior of Ni-doped NASICON ceramic Na$_{3+2x}$Zr$_{2-x}$Ni$_{x}$Si$_2$PO$_{\rm 12}$ ($x=$ 0.05--0.2) prepared using the solid-state reaction method. The increase in dielectric constant with temperature and decrease with frequency is explained on the basis of space charge polarization using the two-layer model of Maxwell-Wagner relaxation. The dielectric loss peak at lower temperatures follows the Arrhenius-type behavior with frequency having activation energy of 0.27$\pm$0.01~eV of dipolar relaxation, suggests similar type of defects are responsible for all the doped samples. The real ($\epsilon$ $^{'}$) and imaginary ($\epsilon$ $^{''}$) permittivity variation with frequency shows the broad relaxation behavior indicates the non-Debye type of relaxation in the measured temperature range. The permittivity values decrease with the amount of doping due to the increased number of charge carriers upon Ni doping at the Zr site. The grain contributions are observed at higher frequencies, while grain-boundary contributions occur at the lower side of frequencies. The imaginary part of the electric modulus also shows two types of relaxation peaks for all the samples indicating similar activation energy at low temperatures and variable activation energy at higher temperatures. The fitting of the imaginary modulus using KWW function shows the non-Debye type of relaxation. We find that all modulus curves merge with each other at low temperatures showing a similar type of relaxation, while curves at high temperatures show the dispersed behavior above the peak frequency. The {\it a.c.} conductivity data are fitted using the double power law confirming the grain and grain boundary contributions in total conductivity.</description>

      <title>Epitaxial growth and magnetic properties of Mn5(SixGe1-x)3 thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural and magnetic properties of Mn5(SixGe1-x)3 thin films were investigated. Ferromagnetic Mn5Ge3 and anti-ferromagnetic Mn5Si3 thin films have been synthesized and characterized as these compounds exhibit interesting features for the development of spintronics. Here, Mn5(SixGe1-x)3 thin films were grown on Ge(111) substrates by co-deposition using molecular beam epitaxy. Crystalline thin films can be produced with controlled Si concentrations ranging from 0 to 1. The thin films were relaxed by dislocations at the interface with the substrate. A lattice parameter variation was observed as the Si content increased, which is comparable to previous works done in bulk. Reflection highenergy electron diffraction diagrams and X-ray diffraction profiles showed that lattice parameters a and c are shrinking and that the surface roughness and crystallinity degrade as the Si amount increases. Magnetometric measurements revealed a ferromagnetic behavior for all Si concentrations. The measured average ferromagnetic moment per manganese atom decreased from 2.33 to 0.05 {\mu}B/Mn atom. No ferro to anti-ferromagnetic transition was observed contrary to the bulk Mn5(SixGe1-x)3 compound.</description>

      <title>Magnetocrystalline anisotropy in metallic systems: fast and stable estimation in Green`s functions formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we suggest a theoretical approach, that allows to study the effects of magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MCA) in metallic systems using the Green`s functions formalism. We demonstrate that employment of the reciprocal space resolution instead of its reduction in the inter-site variant essentially improves the numerical stability of MCA energy by means of Monkhorst-Pack grid density and spatial convergence. The latter problem is able to be completely removed due to rigorous analytical replacement of pairwise atomic summation by simple composition of sublattices contributions, calculated as a whole. The approach is validated on the effective model of single atom, which nevertheless inherits the qualitative MCA picture of Co monolayer and Au/Co/Au sandwiched material. The numerical convergence is confirmed using the model of atomic chain in the strong metallic regime. For cobalt monoxide, described by ab initio calculations using GGA+U, the MCA energy angular profile reveals the prevailing role of ferromagnetically aligned Co sublattices in forming of the easy axis.</description>

      <title>Ab-initio Van der Waals electrodynamics: polaritons and electron scattering from plasmons and phonons in BN-capped graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmons and polar phonons are elementary electrodynamic excitations of matter. In 2d and at long wavelengths, they couple to light and act as the system polaritons. They also dictate the scattering of charged carriers. Van der Waals heterostructures offer the opportunity to couple excitations from different layers via long-range Coulomb interactions, modifying both their dispersion and their scattering of electrons. Even when the excitations do not couple, they are still influenced by the screening from all layers, leading to complex dynamical interactions between electrons, plasmons and polar phonons. We develop an efficient ab initio model to solve the dynamical electric response of Van der Waals heterostructures, accompanied by a formalism to extract relevant spectroscopic and transport quantities. Notably, we obtain scattering rates for electrons of the heterostructure coupling remotely with electrodynamic excitations. We apply those developments to BN-capped graphene, in which polar phonons from BN couple to plasmons in graphene. We study the nature of the coupled excitations, their dispersion and their coupling to graphene's electrons. Regimes driven by either phonons or plasmons are identified, as well as a truly hybrid regime at long wavelengths. Those are studied as a function of the graphene's Fermi level and the number of BN layers. In contrast with descriptions in terms of surface-optical phonons, we find that the electron-phonon interaction stems from different modes. Moreover, the dynamical screening of the coupling between BN's LO phonons and graphene's electrons crosses over from inefficient to metal-like depending on the relative value of the phonons' frequency and the energetic onset of interband transitions. While the coupling is significant in general, the associated scattering of graphene's carriers is found to be negligible in the context of electronic transport.</description>

      <title>Assessing exchange-correlation functionals for heterogeneous catalysis of nitrogen species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing interest in sustainable synthesis of ammonia, nitrates, and urea has led to an increase in studies of catalytic conversion between nitrogen-containing compounds using heterogeneous catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) is commonly employed to obtain molecular-scale insight into these reactions, but there have been relatively few assessments of the exchange-correlation functionals that are best suited for heterogeneous catalysis of nitrogen compounds. Here, we assess a range of functionals ranging from the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) to the random phase approximation (RPA) for the formation energies of gas-phase nitrogen species, the lattice constants of representative solids from several common classes of catalysts (metals, oxides, and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)), and the adsorption energies of a range of nitrogen-containing intermediates on these materials. The results reveal that the choice of exchange-correlation functional and van der Waals correction can have a surprisingly large effect and that increasing the level of theory does not always improve the accuracy for nitrogen-containing compounds. This suggests that the selection of functionals should be carefully evaluated on the basis of the specific reaction and material being studied.</description>

      <title>Experimental Investigation of an Incremental Contact Model for Hyperelastic Solids Using In-Situ Optical Interferometric Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hyperelastic materials would contribute to the intricacies of rough surface contact, primarily due to the heightened nonlinearity caused by stress concentration. In our previous research, an incremental contact model tailored for hyperelastic materials is proposed and validated by finite element (FEM) simulations. From an experimental perspective, this study employs an in-situ optical interferometric technique to precisely document the actual contact zone between hyperelastic solids and quartz glass. Simultaneously, the contact force is meticulously recorded in sync by a force sensor positioned beneath the hyperelastic samples. Comparing with the predictions of incremental contact model for hyperelastic materials, a significant agreement becomes evident, almost in a range of nearly complete contact. Its significance extends to practical domains such as sealing mechanisms, leakage prevention, and structural integrity, offering valuable insights for these applications.</description>

      <title>Considerations in the use of ML interaction potentials for free energy calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning potentials (MLPs) offer the potential to accurately model the energy and free energy landscapes of molecules with the precision of quantum mechanics and an efficiency similar to classical simulations. This research focuses on using equivariant graph neural networks MLPs due to their proven effectiveness in modeling equilibrium molecular trajectories. A key issue addressed is the capability of MLPs to accurately predict free energies and transition states by considering both the energy and the diversity of molecular configurations. We examined how the distribution of collective variables (CVs) in the training data affects MLP accuracy in determining the free energy surface (FES) of systems, using Metadynamics simulations for butane and alanine dipeptide (ADP). The study involved training forty-three MLPs, half based on classical molecular dynamics data and the rest on ab initio computed energies. The MLPs were trained using different distributions that aim to replicate hypothetical scenarios of sampled CVs obtained if the underlying FES of the system was unknown. Findings for butane revealed that training data coverage of key FES regions ensures model accuracy regardless of CV distribution. However, missing significant FES regions led to correct potential energy predictions but failed free energy reconstruction. For ADP, models trained on classical dynamics data were notably less accurate, while ab initio-based MLPs predicted potential energy well but faltered on free energy predictions. These results emphasize the challenge of assembling an all-encompassing training set for accurate FES prediction and highlight the importance of understanding the FES in preparing training data. The study points out the limitations of MLPs in free energy calculations, stressing the need for comprehensive data that encompasses the system's full FES for effective model training.</description>

      <title>Epitaxially defined Luttinger liquids on MoS$_2$ bicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A mirror twin boundary (MTB) in a transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayer can host one-dimensional electron liquid of a topological nature with tunable interactions. Unfortunately, the electrical characterization of such boundaries has been challenging due to the paucity of samples with large enough size and high quality. Here, we report an epitaxial growth of monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$) bicrystals with well-isolated MTBs that are tens of micrometers long. Conductance measurements of these MTBs exhibit power-law behaviors as a function of temperature and bias voltage up to room temperature, consistent with electrons tunneling into a Luttinger liquid. Transport measurements of two distinct types of MTBs reveal the critical role of the atomic-scale defects. This study demonstrates that MTBs in TMD monolayers provide an exciting new platform for studying the interplay between electronic interactions and topology.</description>

      <title>Evolution of flat band and role of lattice relaxations in twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) exhibits correlated phenomena such as superconductivity and Mott insulating state related to the weakly dispersing flat band near the Fermi energy. Beyond its moir\'e period, such flat band is expected to be sensitive to lattice relaxations. Thus, clarifying the evolution of the electronic structure with twist angle is critical for understanding the physics of MATBG. Here, we combine nanospot angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy to resolve the fine electronic structure of the flat band and remote bands, and their evolution with twist angles from 1.07$^\circ$ to 2.60$^\circ$. Near the magic angle, dispersion is characterized by a flat band near the Fermi energy with a strongly reduced bandwidth. Moreover, near 1.07$^\circ$, we observe a spectral weight transfer between remote bands at higher binding energy and extract the modulated interlayer spacing near the magic angle. Our work provides direct spectroscopic information on flat band physics and highlights the role of lattice relaxations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase transition problems on curved surfaces can lead to a panopticon of fascinating patterns. In this paper we consider finite element approximations of phase field models with a spatially inhomogeneous and anisotropic surface energy density. The problems are either posed in $\mathbb R^3$ or on a two-dimensional hypersurface in $\mathbb R^3$. In the latter case, a fundamental choice regarding the anisotropic energy density has to be made. Our numerical method can be employed both situations, where for the problems on hypersurfaces the algorithm uses parametric finite elements. We prove an unconditional stability result for our schemes and present several numerical experiments, including for the modelling of ice crystal growth on a sphere.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At large commensurate angles, twisted bilayer graphene which holds even parity under sublattice exchange exhibits a tiny gap. Here, we point out a way to tune this tiny gap into a large gap. We start from comprehensive understanding of the physical origin of gap opening by density functional theory calculations. We reveal that the effective inter-layer hopping, intra-layer CDW, or inter-layer charge imbalance favors a gap. Then, on the basis of tight-binding calculations, we suggest that a periodic transverse inhomogeneous pressure, which can tune inter-layer hoppings in specific regions of the moi$\rm\acute{r}$e supercell, may open a gap of over $100$~meV, which is further confirmed by first-principles calculations. Our results provide a theoretical guidance for experiments to open a large gap in twisted bilayer graphene.</description>

Abstract: We report on the investigation of periodic superstructures in twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) van-der-Waals heterostructures, where one of the graphene layers is aligned to hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). Our theoretical simulations reveal that if the ratio of the resulting two moir\'e unit cell areas is a simple fraction, the graphene/hBN moir\'e lattice acts as a staggered potential, breaking the degeneracy between tBLG AA sites. This leads to additional band gaps at energies where a subset of tBLG AA sites is fully occupied. These gaps manifest as Landau fans in magnetotransport, which we experimentally observe in an aligned tBLG/hBN heterostructure. Our study demonstrates the identification of commensurate tBLG/hBN van-der-Waals heterostructures by magnetotransport, highlights the persistence of moir\'e effects on length scales of tens of nanometers, and represents an interesting step forward in the ongoing effort to realise designed quantum materials with tailored properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent experimental study announced the emergence of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure, with the highest observed superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) reaching approximately 80 K beyond 14 GPa. While extensive studies have been devoted to the electronic correlations and potential superconducting pairing mechanisms, there lack investigations into the phonon properties and electron phonon coupling. Using density functional theory in conjunction with Wannier interpolation techniques, we study the phonon properties and electron phonon interactions in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under 29.5 GPa. Our findings reveal that the electron phonon coupling is insufficient to solely explain the observed high superconducting $T_c$ $\sim$ 80 K in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. And the calculated strong Fermi surface nesting may explain the experimental observed charge density wave transition in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Our calculations substantiate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is an unconventional superconductor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling induces a current density in the ground state, which consequently requires a generalization for meta-generalized gradient approximations. That is, the exchange-correlation energy has to be constructed as an explicit functional of the current density and a generalized kinetic energy density has to be formed to satisfy theoretical constraints. Herein, we generalize our previously presented formalism of spin-orbit current density functional theory [Holzer et al., J. Chem. Phys. 157, 204102 (2022)] to non-magnetic and magnetic periodic systems of arbitrary dimension. Besides the ground-state exchange-correlation potential, analytical derivatives such as geometry gradients and stress tensors are implemented. The importance of the current density is assessed for band gaps, lattice constants, magnetic transitions, and Rashba splittings. For the latter, the impact of the current density may be larger than the deviation between different density functional approximations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear hyperpolarization is a known method to enhance the signal in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) by orders of magnitude. The present work addresses the $^{13}$C hyperpolarization in diamond micro- and nanoparticles, using the optically-pumped nitrogen-vacancy center (NV) to polarize $^{13}$C spins at room temperature. Consequences of the small particle size are mitigated by using a combination of surface treatment improving the $^{13}$C relaxation ($T_1$) time, as well as that of NV, and applying a technique for NV illumination based on a microphotonic structure. Monitoring the light-induced redistribution of the NV spin state populations with electron paramagnetic resonance, a strong polarization enhancement for the NV spin state is observed in a narrow spectral region corresponding to about 4\% of these defect centers. By combining adjustments to the `PulsePol' sequence and slow sample rotation, the NV-$^{13}$C polarization transfer rate is improved further. The hyperpolarized $^{13}$C NMR signal is observed in particles of 2 $\mu$m and 100 nm median sizes, with enhancements over the thermal signal (at 0.29 T magnetic field), of 1500 and 940, respectively. The present demonstration of room-temperature hyperpolarization anticipates the development of agents based on nanoparticles for sensitive magnetic resonance applications.</description>

Abstract: In the search for experimental signatures of quantum anomalies, the layered Dirac materials ZrTe$_{5}$ and HfTe$_{5}$ have received much attention for potentially hosting a chiral anomaly. These materials exhibit a negative longitudinal magnetoresistance (NLMR) that is taken as a signature of broken chiral symmetry. The anomalous transport properties of ZrTe$_{5}$ and HfTe$_{5}$ are known to strongly correlate with the presence of Te vacancies, prompting questions as to the microscopic mechanism driving the NLMR. In this work, the effect of Te vacancies on the electronic structure of ZrTe$_{5}$ and HfTe$_{5}$ is investigated via first-principles calculations to garner insight into how they may modulate the transport properties of these materials. While Te vacancies act as a source of effective compressive strain, they also produce local changes to the electronic structure that cannot be explained simply as volume effects. The reorganization of the electronic structure near the Fermi energy indicates that Te vacancies can rationalize both spectroscopic and transport measurements that have remained elusive in prior first-principles studies. These results show that Te vacancies contribute, at least in part, to the anomalous transport properties of ZrTe$_{5}$ and HfTe$_{5}$ and offer a path towards understanding the possibility of a chiral anomaly in these materials.</description>

Generative models have been developed in the last few years that use custom Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and diffusion models. While periodicity and global Euclidian symmetry in three dimensions through translations, rotations and reflections have recently been accounted for, symmetry constraints within allowed space groups have not. This is especially important because the final step involves energy relaxation on the generated crystal structures to find the relaxed crystal structure, typically using Density Functional Theory (DFT). To address this explicitly, we introduce a generative design framework (WyCryst), composed of three pivotal components: 1) a Wyckoff position based inorganic crystal representation, 2) a property-directed VAE model and 3) an automated DFT workflow for structure refinement. Our model selectively generates materials that follow the ground truth of unit cell space group symmetry by encoding the Wyckoff representation for each space group. We successfully reproduce a variety of existing materials: CaTiO3 (space group, SG No. 62 and 221), CsPbI3 (SG No. 221), BaTiO3 (SG No. 160), and CuInS2 (SG No.122) for both ground state as well as polymorphic structure predictions. We also generate several new ternary materials not found in the inorganic materials database (Materials Project), which are proved to be stable, retaining their symmetry, and we also check their phonon stability, using our automated DFT workflow highlighting the validity of our approach. We believe our symmetry-aware WyCryst takes a vital step towards AI-driven inorganic materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Compensated Ferrimagnets with Colossal Spin Splitting in Organic Compounds</title>

Abstract: The study of the magnetic order has recently been invigorated by the discovery of exotic collinear antiferromagnets with time-reversal symmetry breaking. Examples include altermagnetism and compensated ferrimagnets, which show spin splittings of the electronic band structures even at zero net magnetization, leading to several unique transport phenomena, notably spin-current generation. Altermagnets demonstrate anisotropic spin splitting, such as $d$-wave, in momentum space, whereas compensated ferrimagnets exhibit isotropic spin splitting. However, methods to realize compensated ferrimagnets are limited. Here, we demonstrate a method to realize a fully compensated ferrimagnet with isotropic spin splitting utilizing the dimer structures inherent in organic compounds. Moreover, based on $ab$ $initio$ calculations, we find that this ferrimagnet can be realized in the recently discovered organic compound (EDO-TTF-I)$_2$ClO$_4$. Our findings provide an unprecedented strategy for using the dimer degrees of freedom in organic compounds to realize fully compensated ferrimagnets with colossal spin splitting.</description>

      <title>A first-principles thermodynamic model for the Ba$\unicode{x2013}$Zr$\unicode{x2013}$S system in equilibrium with sulfur vapour</title>

Abstract: The chalcogenide perovskite BaZrS$_3$ has strong visible light absorption and high chemical stability, is nontoxic, and is made from earth-abundant elements. As such, it is a promising candidate material for application in optoelectronic technologies. However the synthesis of BaZrS$_3$ thin-films for characterisation and device integration remains a challenge. Here we use density functional theory and lattice dynamics to calculate the vibrational properties of elemental, binary and ternary materials in the Ba-Zr-S system. This is used to build a thermodynamic model for the stability of BaZrS$_3$, BaS$_x$, and ZrS$_x$ in equilibrium with sulfur gas, across a range of temperatures and sulfur partial pressures. We highlight that reaction thermodynamics are highly sensitive to sulfur allotrope and the extent of allotrope mixing. We use our model to predict the synthesis conditions in which BaZrS$_3$ and the intermediate binary compounds can form. At a moderate temperature of 500 {\deg}C we find that BaS$_3$, associated with fast reaction kinetics, is stable at pressures above 3x10$^5$ Pa. We also find BaZrS$_3$ is stable against decomposition into sulfur-rich binaries up to at least 1x10$^7$ Pa. Our work provides insights into the chemistry of this promising material and suggests the experimental conditions required for the successful synthesis of BaZrS$_3$.</description>

      <title>Hidden domain boundary dynamics towards crystalline perfection</title>

Abstract: A central paradigm of non-equilibrium physics concerns the dynamics of heterogeneity and disorder, impacting processes ranging from the behavior of glasses to the emergent functionality of active matter. Understanding these complex mesoscopic systems requires probing the microscopic trajectories associated with irreversible processes, the role of fluctuations and entropy growth, and the timescales on which non-equilibrium responses are ultimately maintained. Approaches that illuminate these processes in model systems may enable a more general understanding of other heterogeneous non-equilibrium phenomena, and potentially define ultimate speed and energy cost limits for information processing technologies. Here, we apply ultrafast single shot x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy to resolve the non-equilibrium, heterogeneous, and irreversible mesoscale dynamics during a light-induced phase transition. This approach defines a new way of capturing the nucleation of the induced phase, the formation of transient mesoscale defects at the boundaries of the nuclei, and the eventual annihilation of these defects, even in systems with complex polarization topologies. A non-equilibrium response spanning &gt;10 orders of magnitude in timescales is observed, with multistep behavior similar to the plateaus observed in supercooled liquids and glasses. We show how the observed time-dependent long-time correlations can be understood in terms of the stochastic dynamics of domain walls, encoded in effective waiting-time distributions with power-law tails. This work defines new possibilities for probing the non-equilibrium and correlated dynamics of disordered and heterogeneous media.</description>

      <title>Systematic assessment of various universal machine-learning interatomic potentials</title>

Abstract: Machine-learning interatomic potentials have revolutionized materials modeling at the atomic scale. Thanks to these, it is now indeed possible to perform simulations of \abinitio quality over very large time and length scales. More recently, various universal machine-learning models have been proposed as an out-of-box approach avoiding the need to train and validate specific potentials for each particular material of interest. In this paper, we review and evaluate five different universal machine-learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs), all based on graph neural network architectures which have demonstrated transferability from one chemical system to another. The evaluation procedure relies on data both from a recent verification study of density-functional-theory implementations and from the Materials Project. Through this comprehensive evaluation, we aim to provide guidance to materials scientists in selecting suitable models for their specific research problems, offer recommendations for model selection and optimization, and stimulate discussion on potential areas for improvement in current machine-learning methodologies in materials science.</description>

      <title>Structural transitions, octahedral rotations, and electronic properties of $A_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ rare-earth nickelates under high pressure</title>

Abstract: Motivated by the recent observation of superconductivity with $T_c \sim 80$ K in pressurized La3Ni2O7 [Nature 621, 493 (2023)], we explore the structural and electronic properties in A3Ni2O7 bilayer nickelates (A=La-Lu, Y, Sc) as a function of hydrostatic pressure (0-150 GPa) from first principles including a Coulomb repulsion term. At $\sim 20$ GPa, we observe an orthorhombic-to-tetragonal transition in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at variance with recent x-ray diffraction data, which points to so-far unresolved complexities at the onset of superconductivity, e.g., charge doping by variations in the oxygen stoichiometry. We compile a structural phase diagram with particular emphasis on the $b/a$ ratio, octahedral anisotropy, and octahedral rotations. Intriguingly, chemical and external pressure emerge as two distinct and counteracting control parameters. We find unexpected correlations between $T_c$ and the in-plane Ni-O-Ni bond angles for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Moreover, two novel structural phases with significant $c^+$ octahedral rotations and in-plane bond disproportionations are uncovered for A=Nd-Lu, Y, Sc that exhibit a surprising pressure-driven electronic reconstruction in the Ni $e_g$ manifold. By disentangling the involvement of basal versus apical oxygen states at the Fermi surface, we identify Tb$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ as an interesting candidate for superconductivity at ambient pressure. These results suggest a profound tunability of the structural and electronic phases in this novel materials class and are key for a fundamental understanding of the superconductivity mechanism.</description>

      <title>Topological magnon-polaron transport in a bilayer van der Waals magnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stacking of intrinsically magnetic van der Waals materials provides a fertile platform to explore tunable transport effects of magnons, presenting significant prospects for spintronic applications. The possibility of having topologically nontrivial magnons in these systems can further expand the scope of exploration. In this work, we consider a bilayer system with intralayer ferromagnetic exchange and a weak interlayer antiferromagnetic exchange, and study the topological magnon-polaron excitations induced by magnetoelastic couplings. Under an applied magnetic field, the system features a metamagnetic transition, where the magnetic ground state changes from antiparallel layers to parallel. We show that the metamagnetic transition is accompanied by a transition of the topological structure of the magnon polarons, which results in discernible changes in the topology induced transport effects. The magnetic-field dependence of the thermal Hall conductivity and spin Nernst coefficient is analyzed with linear response theories.</description>

      <title>Transverse and longitudinal magnons in strongly anisotropic antiferromagnet FePSe3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: FePSe3 is a collinear honeycomb antiferromagnet with an easy-axis anisotropy and large spins S=2. It belongs to a family of magnetic van der Waals materials, which recently attracted a considerable attention. In this work we present an experimental magneto-optical study of the low-energy excitation spectrum in FePSe3, together with its theoretical description. The observed response contains several types of magnon excitations. Two of them are conventional transverse magnons described by a classical theory of antiferromagnetic resonance. Two other modes are identified as multimagnon hexadecapole excitations with an anomalous g factor approximately equal to four times the g factor of a single Fe^2+ ion. These quasiparticles correspond to full reversals of iron spins that coherently propagate in the up-down antiferromagnetic structure. They constitute a novel type of collective excitations in anisotropic magnetic solids, called longitudinal magnons. Comparison between theory and experiment allows us to estimate the microscopic parameters of FePSe3 including exchange coupling constants and the single-ion anisotropy.</description>
