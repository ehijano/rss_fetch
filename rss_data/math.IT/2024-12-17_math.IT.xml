      <title>Study of Iterative Detection and Decoding for Multiuser Systems and MMSE Refinements with Active or Passive RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An iterative detection and decoding (IDD) scheme is proposed for multiuser multiple-antenna systems assisted by an active or a passive Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS). The proposed approach features an IDD strategy that incorporates Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes, RIS processing with refinements of soft information in the form of log likelihood ratios (LLRs) and truncation. Specifically, a minimum mean square error (MMSE) receive filter is used for refinement of LLRs and truncation at the RIS, and for soft interference cancellation at the receiver. An analysis of the proposed MMSE refinement is also devised along with a study of the computational complexity of the proposed and existing schemes. Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements in system capacity and bit error rate in the presence of block-fading channels</description>

      <title>Iterative Detection and Decoding for Clustered Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose an iterative soft interference cancellation scheme for intra-cluster (ICL) and out-of-cluster (OCL) interference mitigation in user-centric clustered cell-free massive multiple-antenna networks. We propose a minimum mean-square error receive filter with a novel modified parallel interference cancellation scheme to mitigate ICL and OCL interference. Unlike prior work, we model the OCL interference and devise a least squares estimator to perform OCL interference estimation. An iterative detection and decoding scheme that adopts low-density parity check codes and incorporates the OCL interference estimate is developed. Simulations assess the proposed scheme against existing techniques in terms of bit error rate performance.</description>

      <title>Identification Over Binary Noisy Permutation Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study message identification over the binary noisy permutation channel. For discrete memoryless channels (DMCs), the number of identifiable messages grows doubly exponentially, and the maximum second-order exponent is the Shannon capacity of the DMC. We consider a binary noisy permutation channel where the transmitted vector is first permuted by a permutation chosen uniformly at random, and then passed through a binary symmetric channel with crossover probability $p$. In an earlier work, it was shown that $2^{c_n n}$ messages can be identified over binary (noiseless) permutation channel if $c_n\rightarrow 0$. For the binary noisy permutation channel, we show that message sizes growing as $2^{\epsilon_n \sqrt{\frac{n}{\log n}}}$ are identifiable for any $\epsilon_n\rightarrow 0$. We also prove a strong converse result showing that for any sequence of identification codes with message size $2^{R_n \sqrt{n}\log n}$, where $R_n \rightarrow \infty$, the sum of Type-I and Type-II error probabilities approaches at least $1$ as $n\rightarrow \infty$. Our proof of the strong converse uses the idea of channel resolvability. The channel of interest turns out to be the ``binary weight-to-weight (BWW) channel'' which captures the effect on the Hamming weight of a vector, when the vector is passed through a binary symmetric channel. We propose a novel deterministic quantization scheme for quantization of a distribution over $\{0,1,\cdots, n\}$ by an $M$-type input distribution when the distortion is measured on the output distribution (over the BWW channel) in total variation distance. This plays a key role in the converse proof.</description>

      <title>Wireless Environmental Information Theory: A New Paradigm towards 6G Online and Proactive Environment Intelligence Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The channel is one of the five critical components of a communication system, and its ergodic capacity is based on all realizations of statistic channel model. This statistical paradigm has successfully guided the design of mobile communication systems from 1G to 5G. However, this approach relies on offline channel measurements in specific environments, and the system passively adapts to new environments, resulting in deviation from the optimal performance. With the pursuit of higher capacity and data rate of 6G, especially facing the ubiquitous environments, there is an urgent need for a new paradigm to combat the randomness of channel, i.e., more proactive and online manner. Motivated by this, we propose an environment intelligence communication (EIC) based on wireless environmental information theory (WEIT) for 6G. The proposed EIC architecture is composed of three steps: Firstly, wireless environmental information (WEI) is acquired using sensing techniques. Then, leveraging WEI and channel data, AI techniques are employed to predict channel fading, thereby mitigating channel uncertainty. Thirdly, the communication system autonomously determines the optimal air-interface transmission strategy based on real-time channel predictions, enabling intelligent interaction with the physical environment. To make this attractive paradigm shift from theory to practice, we answer three key problems to establish WEIT for the first time. How should WEI be defined? Can it be quantified? Does it hold the same properties as statistical communication information? Furthermore, EIC aided by WEI (EIC-WEI) is validated across multiple air-interface tasks, including CSI prediction, beam prediction, and radio resource management. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed EIC-WEI significantly outperforms the statistical paradigm in decreasing overhead and performance optimization.</description>

      <title>Capacity of Hierarchical Secure Coded Gradient Aggregation with Straggling Communication Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing privacy concerns in distributed learning have led to the widespread adoption of secure aggregation techniques in distributed machine learning systems, such as federated learning. Motivated by a coded gradient aggregation problem in a user-helper-master hierarchical network setting with straggling communication links, we formulate a new secure hierarchical coded gradient aggregation problem. In our setting, \( K \) users communicate with the master through an intermediate layer of \( N \) helpers, who can communicate with each other. With a resiliency threshold of \( N_r \) for straggling communication links, and at most \( T \) colluding helpers and any number of colluding users, the master aims to recover the sum of all users' gradients while remaining unaware of any individual gradient that exceeds the expected sum. In addition, helpers cannot infer more about users' gradients than what is already known by the colluding users. We propose an achievable scheme where users' upload messages are based on a globally known Vandermonde matrix, and helper communication is facilitated using an extended Vandermonde matrix with special structural properties. A matching converse bound is also derived, establishing the optimal result for this hierarchical coded gradient aggregation problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $q$ be a prime power. This paper provides a new class of linear codes that arises from the action of the alternating group on $\mathbb F_q[x_1,\dots,x_m]$ combined with the ideas in (M. Datta and T. Johnsen, 2022). Compared with Generalized Reed-Muller codes with similar parameters, our codes have the same asymptotic relative distance but a better rate. Our results follow from combinations of Galois theoretical methods with Weil-type bounds for the number of points of hypersurfaces over finite fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{X}$ be a 3-product space. Let $A: \mathcal{D}(A)\subseteq \mathcal{X}\to \mathcal{X}$, $B: \mathcal{D}(B)\subseteq \mathcal{X}\to \mathcal{X}$ and $C: \mathcal{D}(C)\subseteq \mathcal{X}\to \mathcal{X}$ be possibly unbounded 3-self-adjoint operators. Then for all \begin{align*}
  x \in \mathcal{D}(ABC)\cap\mathcal{D}(ACB) \cap \mathcal{D}(BAC)\cap\mathcal{D}(BCA) \cap \mathcal{D}(CAB)\cap\mathcal{D}(CBA) \end{align*} with $\langle x, x, x \rangle =1$, we show that \begin{align*} (1)\quad \quad \Delta _x(3, A) \Delta _x(3, B) \Delta _x(3, C)\geq |\langle (ABC-a BC-b AC-c AB)x, x, x\rangle +2abc|, \end{align*} where \begin{align*}
  \Delta _x(3, A):= \|Ax-\langle Ax, x, x \rangle x \|, \quad a:= \langle Ax, x, x \rangle, \quad b := \langle Bx, x, x \rangle, \quad c := \langle Cx, x, x \rangle. \end{align*} We call Inequality (1) as 3-Heisenberg-Robertson-Schrodinger uncertainty principle. Classical Heisenberg-Robertson-Schrodinger uncertainty principle (by Schrodinger in 1930) considers two operators whereas Inequality (1) considers three operators.</description>

      <title>Meeting Utility Constraints in Differential Privacy: A Privacy-Boosting Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data engineering often requires accuracy (utility) constraints on results, posing significant challenges in designing differentially private (DP) mechanisms, particularly under stringent privacy parameter $\epsilon$. In this paper, we propose a privacy-boosting framework that is compatible with most noise-adding DP mechanisms. Our framework enhances the likelihood of outputs falling within a preferred subset of the support to meet utility requirements while enlarging the overall variance to reduce privacy leakage. We characterize the privacy loss distribution of our framework and present the privacy profile formulation for $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP and R\'enyi DP (RDP) guarantees. We study special cases involving data-dependent and data-independent utility formulations. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework achieves lower privacy loss than standard DP mechanisms under utility constraints. Notably, our approach is particularly effective in reducing privacy loss with large query sensitivity relative to the true answer, offering a more practical and flexible approach to designing differentially private mechanisms that meet specific utility constraints.</description>

      <title>Shannon information and integrated information: message and meaning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information theory, introduced by Shannon, has been extremely successful and influential as a mathematical theory of communication. Shannon's notion of information does not consider the meaning of the messages being communicated but only their probability. Even so, computational approaches regularly appeal to "information processing" to study how meaning is encoded and decoded in natural and artificial systems. Here, we contrast Shannon information theory with integrated information theory (IIT), which was developed to account for the presence and properties of consciousness. IIT considers meaning as integrated information and characterizes it as a structure, rather than as a message or code. In principle, IIT's axioms and postulates allow one to "unfold" a cause-effect structure from a substrate in a state, a structure that fully defines the intrinsic meaning of an experience and its contents. It follows that, for the communication of meaning, the cause-effect structures of sender and receiver must be similar.</description>

      <title>Structured Sampling for Robust Euclidean Distance Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of estimating the positions of points from distance measurements corrupted by sparse outliers. Specifically, we consider a setting with two types of nodes: anchor nodes, for which exact distances to each other are known, and target nodes, for which complete but corrupted distance measurements to the anchors are available. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel algorithm powered by Nystr\"om method and robust principal component analysis. Our method is computationally efficient as it processes only a localized subset of the distance matrix and does not require distance measurements between target nodes. Empirical evaluations on synthetic datasets, designed to mimic sensor localization, and on molecular experiments, demonstrate that our algorithm achieves accurate recovery with a modest number of anchors, even in the presence of high levels of sparse outliers.</description>

      <title>Quantum search in a dictionary based on fingerprinting-hashing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a quantum query algorithm for searching a word of length $m$ in an unsorted dictionary of size $n$. The algorithm uses $O(\sqrt{n})$ queries (Grover operators), like previously known algorithms.
  What is new is that the algorithm is based on the quantum fingerprinting-hashing technique, which (a) provides a first level of amplitude amplification before applying the sequence of Grover amplitude amplification operators and (b) makes the algorithm more efficient in terms of memory use -- it requires $O(\log n + \log m)$ qubits.
  Note that previously developed algorithms by other researchers without hashing require $O(\log n + m)$ qubits.</description>

      <title>BA-BFL: Barycentric Aggregation for Bayesian Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of aggregation in the context of Bayesian Federated Learning (BFL). Using an information geometric perspective, we interpret the BFL aggregation step as finding the barycenter of the trained posteriors for a pre-specified divergence metric. We study the barycenter problem for the parametric family of $\alpha$-divergences and, focusing on the standard case of independent and Gaussian distributed parameters, we recover the closed-form solution of the reverse Kullback-Leibler barycenter and develop the analytical form of the squared Wasserstein-2 barycenter. Considering a non-IID setup, where clients possess heterogeneous data, we analyze the performance of the developed algorithms against state-of-the-art (SOTA) Bayesian aggregation methods in terms of accuracy, uncertainty quantification (UQ), model calibration (MC), and fairness. Finally, we extend our analysis to the framework of Hybrid Bayesian Deep Learning (HBDL), where we study how the number of Bayesian layers in the architecture impacts the considered performance metrics. Our experimental results show that the proposed methodology presents comparable performance with the SOTA while offering a geometric interpretation of the aggregation phase.</description>

      <title>Block Circulant Codes with Application to Decentralized Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we design a family of $[n,k,d]$ block circulant codes that consist of many $[n_0 \ll n,k_0 \ll k,d_0]$ local codes and that satisfy three properties: (1) the code supports distributed erasure decoding, (2) $d$ can be scaled above $d_0$ by a given parameter, and (3) it is amenable to low complexity verification of code symbols using a cryptographic commitment scheme. These properties make the code ideal for use in protocols that address the data availability problem in blockchain networks. Moreover, the code outperforms the currently used 2D Reed-Solomon (RS) code with a larger relative minimum distance $(d/n)$, as desired in the protocol, for a given rate $(k/n)$ in the high-rate regime.
  The code is designed in two steps. First, we develop the topology, i.e., the structure of linear dependence relations among code symbols, and define it as the block circulant topology $T_{[\mu,\lambda,\omega]}(\rho)$. In this topology, there are $\mu$ local codes, each constrained by $\rho$ parity checks. The set of symbols of a local code intersects with another in a uniform pattern, determined by two parameters, namely the overlap factor $\lambda$ and the overlap width $\omega$. Next, we instantiate the topology, i.e., to specify the coefficients of linear dependence relations, to construct the block circulant codes ${\cal C}_{\text{BC}}[\mu,\lambda,\omega,\rho]$. Every local code is a $[\lambda\omega+\rho,\lambda\omega,\rho+1]$ generalized RS code. The block circulant code has $n=\mu(\rho+\omega)$, $k=\mu\omega$ and we show that $d=\lambda\rho+1$ under certain conditions. For $\lambda=2$, we prove that $d=2\rho+1$ always, and provide an efficient, parallelizable erasure-correcting decoder that fully recovers the codeword when there are $\leq 2\rho$ erasures. The decoder uses a novel decoding mechanism that iteratively recovers erasures from pairs of local codes.</description>

      <title>Optimal Constant-Weight and Mixed-Weight Conflict-Avoiding Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A conflict-avoiding code (CAC) is a deterministic transmission scheme for asynchronous multiple access without feedback. When the number of simultaneously active users is less than or equal to $w$, a CAC of length $L$ with weight $w$ can provide a hard guarantee that each active user has at least one successful transmission within every consecutive $L$ slots. In this paper, we generalize some previously known constructions of constant-weight CACs, and then derive several classes of optimal CACs by the help of Kneser's Theorem and some techniques in Additive Combinatorics. Another spotlight of this paper is to relax the identical-weight constraint in prior studies to study mixed-weight CACs for the first time, for the purpose of increasing the throughput and reducing the access delay of some potential users with higher priority. As applications of those obtained optimal CACs, we derive some classes of optimal mixed-weight CACs.</description>

      <title>What Roles can Spatial Modulation and Space Shift Keying Play in LEO Satellite-Assisted Communication?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17553v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the rapid evolution of satellite communications play a pivotal role in addressing the ever-increasing demand for global connectivity, among which the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites attract a great amount of attention due to their low latency and high data throughput capabilities. Based on this, we explore spatial modulation (SM) and space shift keying (SSK) designs as pivotal techniques to enhance spectral efficiency (SE) and bit-error rate (BER) performance in the LEO satellite-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The various performance analysis of these designs are presented in this paper, revealing insightful findings and conclusions through analytical methods and Monte Carlo simulations with perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) estimation. The results provide a comprehensive analysis of the merits and trade-offs associated with the investigated schemes, particularly in terms of BER, computational complexity, and SE. This analysis underscores the potential of both schemes as viable candidates for future 6G LEO satellite-assisted wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Optimal Top-Two Method for Best Arm Identification and Fluid Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Top-$2$ methods have become popular in solving the best arm identification (BAI) problem. The best arm, or the arm with the largest mean amongst finitely many, is identified through an algorithm that at any sequential step independently pulls the empirical best arm, with a fixed probability $\beta$, and pulls the best challenger arm otherwise. The probability of incorrect selection is guaranteed to lie below a specified $\delta &gt;0$. Information theoretic lower bounds on sample complexity are well known for BAI problem and are matched asymptotically as $\delta \rightarrow 0$ by computationally demanding plug-in methods. The above top 2 algorithm for any $\beta \in (0,1)$ has sample complexity within a constant of the lower bound. However, determining the optimal $\beta$ that matches the lower bound has proven difficult. In this paper, we address this and propose an optimal top-2 type algorithm. We consider a function of allocations anchored at a threshold. If it exceeds the threshold then the algorithm samples the empirical best arm. Otherwise, it samples the challenger arm. We show that the proposed algorithm is optimal as $\delta \rightarrow 0$. Our analysis relies on identifying a limiting fluid dynamics of allocations that satisfy a series of ordinary differential equations pasted together and that describe the asymptotic path followed by our algorithm. We rely on the implicit function theorem to show existence and uniqueness of these fluid ode's and to show that the proposed algorithm remains close to the ode solution.</description>

      <title>Online Optimization for Learning to Communicate over Time-Correlated Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning techniques have garnered great interest in designing communication systems owing to their capacity in tacking with channel uncertainty. To provide theoretical guarantees for learning-based communication systems, some recent works analyze generalization bounds for devised methods based on the assumption of Independently and Identically Distributed (I.I.D.) channels, a condition rarely met in practical scenarios. In this paper, we drop the I.I.D. channel assumption and study an online optimization problem of learning to communicate over time-correlated channels. To address this issue, we further focus on two specific tasks: optimizing channel decoders for time-correlated fading channels and selecting optimal codebooks for time-correlated additive noise channels. For utilizing temporal dependence of considered channels to better learn communication systems, we develop two online optimization algorithms based on the optimistic online mirror descent framework. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees for proposed algorithms via deriving sub-linear regret bound on the expected error probability of learned systems. Extensive simulation experiments have been conducted to validate that our presented approaches can leverage the channel correlation to achieve a lower average symbol error rate compared to baseline methods, consistent with our theoretical findings.</description>
