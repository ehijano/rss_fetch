      <title>Information-theoretic characterization of turbulence intermittency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new characterization of small-scale intermittency of turbulence based on an information-theoretic measure, that inherently segregates turbulence intermittency from kinematic intermittency. Instead of the commonly studied higher-order moments, Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is used to quantify the deviation of turbulence pseudodissipation rate (or dissipation rate/enstrophy) from that of a Gaussian random velocity field as an accurate measure of the small-scale intermittency arising from turbulence dynamics. In addition, Shannon entropy is used to assess the uncertainty of these turbulence small-scale quantities. Analysis of direct numerical simulation data of forced homogeneous isotropic turbulent flow reveals the existence of two critical Taylor Reynolds numbers where the variation of uncertainty changes. The KL-divergence measure reveals two striking results about intermittency: (i) intermittency grows logarithmically with Reynolds number and (ii) dissipation rate and enstrophy are equally intermittent in a turbulent flow of any Reynolds number, if one considers only the intermittency arising from turbulence dynamics.</description>

      <title>A comparative analysis of GNSS-inferred precipitable water vapour at the potential sites for the Africa Millimetre Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is a network of antennas across the globe currently used to image super-massive black holes (SMBHs) at a frequency of 230 GHz. Since the release of the image of M87$^\ast$ in 2019 and, subsequently, that of Sgr A$^\ast$ in 2022 by the EHT collaboration, the focus has shifted to dynamically imaging SMBHs. This has led to a search for potential sites to extend and fill in the gaps within the EHT network. The Gamsberg Mountain and the H.E.S.S. site are both located within the Khomas highlands and have been identified as potential sites for the Africa Millimetre Telescope (AMT). Precipitable water vapour (PWV) in the atmosphere is the main source of opacity and noise from atmospheric emissions when observing at millimetre to sub-millimetre wavelengths. This study aims to establish the PWV content and the atmospheric transmission at 86, 230, and 345 GHz at the AMT potential sites using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) derived PWV data. Results show both sites have potential for observations at 86 and 230 GHz, with 345 GHz possible at the Gamsberg Mountain during winter. The overall median PWV of 14.27 mm and 9.25 mm was calculated at the H.E.S.S. site and the Gamsberg Mountain, respectively. The EHT window had PWV medians of 16.62 mm and 11.20 mm at the H.E.S.S. site and Gamsberg Mountain, respectively. Among the two sites, the Gamsberg Mountain had the lowest PWV conditions, therefore making it the most suitable site for the AMT.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the accuracy of GNSS inferred precipitable water vapour against that from a 210 GHz WVR at the H.E.S.S. site</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05346</link>

Abstract: The High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) site and the Gamsberg Mountain have been identified as potential sites for the Africa Millimetre Telescope (AMT). The AMT is poised to observe at millimetre and possibly at submillimetre wavelengths. At these wavelengths, precipitable water vapour (PWV) in the atmosphere is the main source of opacity during observations and therefore needs to be accurately assessed at the potential sites for the AMT. In order to investigate the PWV conditions for the AMT, identical Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations were installed and used to assess the PWV at the two potential sites. In this study, the accuracy of those PWV measurements by the GNSS stations was assessed by comparing the H.E.S.S. installed GNSS station PWV measurements to that from a 210 GHz Water Vapour Radiometer (WVR) also installed at the H.E.S.S. site. A correlation of 98% and an offset of 0.34 mm was found between the GNSS station and the 210 GHz WVR PWV data when on-site pressure and the Nevada Geodetic Laboratory (NGL) weighted mean temperature ($\mathrm{T_m}$) were used calculate the GNSS station PWV data. In comparison, the offset reduces to 0.15 mm when on-site derived $\mathrm{T_m}$ and pressure were used to calculate the GNSS station PWV. The results show that the GNSS station with on-site meteorological data can be used with high accuracy to reliably determine the PWV conditions at the H.E.S.S. site.</description>

      <title>Modular Debiasing: A Robust Method for Quantum Randomness Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel modular debiasing technique applicable to any discrete random source, addressing the fundamental challenge of reliably extracting high-quality randomness from inherently imperfect physical processes. The method involves summing the outcomes of multiple independent trials from a biased source and reducing the sum modulo the number of possible outcomes, $m$. We provide a rigorous theoretical framework, utilizing probability generating functions and roots of unity, demonstrating that this simple operation guarantees the exponential convergence of the output distribution to the ideal uniform distribution over $\{0, 1, \dots, m-1\}$. A key theoretical result is the method's remarkable robustness: convergence is proven for any initial bias (provided all outcomes have non-zero probability) and, crucially, is maintained even under non-stationary conditions or time-dependent noise, which are common in physical systems. Analytical bounds quantify this exponential rate of convergence, and are empirically validated by numerical simulations. This technique's simplicity, strong theoretical guarantees, robustness, and data efficiency make it particularly well-suited for practical implementation in quantum settings, such as spatial photon-detection-based Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNGs), offering an efficient method for extracting high-quality randomness resilient to experimental imperfections. This work contributes a valuable tool to the field of Quantum Information Science.</description>
