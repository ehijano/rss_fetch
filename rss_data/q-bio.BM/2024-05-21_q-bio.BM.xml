      <title>Can Large Language Models Understand Molecules?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00024v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) from OpenAI and LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) from Meta AI are increasingly recognized for their potential in the field of cheminformatics, particularly in understanding Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES), a standard method for representing chemical structures. These LLMs also have the ability to decode SMILES strings into vector representations.
  Method: We investigate the performance of GPT and LLaMA compared to pre-trained models on SMILES in embedding SMILES strings on downstream tasks, focusing on two key applications: molecular property prediction and drug-drug interaction prediction.
  Results: We find that SMILES embeddings generated using LLaMA outperform those from GPT in both molecular property and DDI prediction tasks. Notably, LLaMA-based SMILES embeddings show results comparable to pre-trained models on SMILES in molecular prediction tasks and outperform the pre-trained models for the DDI prediction tasks.
  Conclusion: The performance of LLMs in generating SMILES embeddings shows great potential for further investigation of these models for molecular embedding. We hope our study bridges the gap between LLMs and molecular embedding, motivating additional research into the potential of LLMs in the molecular representation field.

      <title>Advanced Drug Interaction Event Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11472v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting drug-drug interaction adverse events, so-called DDI events, is increasingly valuable as it facilitates the study of mechanisms underlying drug use or adverse reactions. Existing models often neglect the distinctive characteristics of individual event classes when integrating multi-source features, which contributes to systematic unfairness when dealing with highly imbalanced event samples. Moreover, the limited capacity of these models to abstract the unique attributes of each event subclass considerably hampers their application in predicting rare drug-drug interaction events with a limited sample size. Reducing dataset bias and abstracting event subclass characteristics are two unresolved challenges. Recently, prompt tuning with frozen pre-trained graph models, namely "pre-train, prompt, fine-tune" strategy, has demonstrated impressive performance in few-shot tasks. Motivated by this, we propose DDIPrompt as a solution to address these aforementioned challenges. Specifically, our proposed approach entails a hierarchical pre-training task that aims to capture crucial aspects of drug molecular structure and intermolecular interactions while effectively mitigating implicit dataset bias within the node embeddings. Furthermore, we construct a prototypical graph by strategically sampling data from distinct event types and design subgraph prompts utilizing pre-trained node features. Through comprehensive benchmark experiments, we validate the efficacy of our subgraph prompts in accurately representing event classes and achieve exemplary results in both overall and subclass prediction tasks.</description>

      <title>t-SMILES: A Scalable Fragment-based Molecular Representation Framework for De Novo Molecule Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.01829v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective representation of molecules is a crucial factor affecting the performance of artificial intelligence models. This study introduces a flexible, fragment-based, multiscale molecular representation framework called t-SMILES (tree-based SMILES) with three code algorithms: TSSA, TSDY and TSID. It describes molecules using SMILES-type strings obtained by performing a breadth-first search on a full binary tree formed from a fragmented molecular graph. Systematic evaluations using JTVAE, BRICS, MMPA, and Scaffold show the feasibility of constructing a multi-code molecular description system, where various descriptions complement each other, enhancing the overall performance. In addition, it can avoid overfitting and achieve higher novelty scores while maintaining reasonable similarity on labeled low-resource datasets, regardless of whether the model is original, data-augmented, or pre-trained then fine-tuned. Furthermore, it significantly outperforms classical SMILES, DeepSMILES, SELFIES and baseline models in goal-directed tasks. And it surpasses state-of-the-art fragment, graph and SMILES based approaches on ChEMBL, Zinc, and QM9.</description>
