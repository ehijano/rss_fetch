      <title>Sequential Network Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study dynamic network formation from a centralized perspective. In each period, the social planner builds a single link to connect previously unlinked pairs. The social planner is forward-looking, with instantaneous utility monotonic in the aggregate number of walks of various lengths. We show that, forming a nested split graph at each period is optimal, regardless of the discount function. When the social planner is sufficiently myopic, it is optimal to form a quasi-complete graph at each period, which is unique up to permutation. This finding provides a micro-foundation for the quasi-complete graph, as it is formed under a greedy policy. We also investigate the robustness of these findings under non-linear best response functions and weighted networks.</description>

      <title>Competitive Markets with Imperfectly Discerning Consumers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a market model in which products generate state-dependent potential hidden charges. Firms differ in their ability to realize this potential. Unlike firms, consumers do not observe the state. They try to infer hidden charges from market prices, using idiosyncratic subjective models. We show that an interior competitive equilibrium is uniquely given by what is formally a Bellman equation. We leverage this representation to characterize equilibrium headline prices, add-on charges and welfare. Market responses to shocks display patterns that are impossible under rational expectations. For example, equilibrium prices can be fully revealing and yet vary with consumers' private information.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning to Play Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We train two neural networks adversarially to play normal-form games. At each iteration, a row and column network take a new randomly generated game and output individual mixed strategies. The parameters of each network are independently updated via stochastic gradient descent to minimize expected regret given the opponent's strategy. Our simulations demonstrate that the joint behavior of the networks converges to strategies close to Nash equilibria in almost all games. For all $2 \times 2$ and in 80% of $3 \times 3$ games with multiple equilibria, the networks select the risk-dominant equilibrium. Our results show how Nash equilibrium emerges from learning across heterogeneous games.</description>

      <title>Money as Minimal Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02317</link>
      <description>arXiv:1512.02317v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider mechanisms that provide traders the opportunity to exchange commodity $i$ for commodity $j$, for certain ordered pairs $ij$. Given any connected graph $G$ of opportunities, we show that there is a unique mechanism $M_{G}$ that satisfies some natural conditions of "fairness" and "convenience". Let $\mathfrak{M}(m)$ denote the class of mechanisms $M_{G}$ obtained by varying $G$ on the commodity set $\left\{1,\ldots,m\right\} $. We define the complexity of a mechanism $M$ in $\mathfrak{M(m)}$ to be a certain pair of integers $\tau(M),\pi(M)$ which represent the time required to exchange $i$ for $j$ and the information needed to determine the exchange ratio (each in the worst case scenario, across all $i\neq j$). This induces a quasiorder $\preceq$ on $\mathfrak{M}(m)$ by the rule \[ M\preceq M^{\prime}\text{if}\tau(M)\leq\tau(M^{\prime})\text{and}\pi(M)\leq\pi(M^{\prime}). \] We show that, for $m&gt;3$, there are precisely three $\preceq$-minimal mechanisms $M_{G}$ in $\mathfrak{M}(m)$, where $G$ corresponds to the star, cycle and complete graphs. The star mechanism has a distinguished commodity -- the money -- that serves as the sole medium of exchange and mediates trade between decentralized markets for the other commodities.
  Our main result is that, for any weights $\lambda,\mu&gt;0,$ the star mechanism is the unique minimizer of $\lambda\tau(M)+\mu\pi(M)$ on $\mathfrak{M}(m)$ for large enough $m$.</description>

      <title>Graphical Exchange Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.04637</link>
      <description>arXiv:1512.04637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider an exchange mechanism which accepts diversified offers of various commodities and redistributes everything it receives. We impose certain conditions of fairness and convenience on such a mechanism and show that it admits unique prices, which equalize the value of offers and returns for each individual.
  We next define the complexity of a mechanism in terms of certain integers $\tau_{ij},\pi_{ij}$ and $k_{i}$ that represent the time required to exchange $i$ for $j$, the difficulty in determining the exchange ratio, and the dimension of the message space. We show that there are a finite number of minimally complex mechanisms, in each of which all trade is conducted through markets for commodity pairs.
  Finally we consider minimal mechanisms with smallest worst-case complexities $\tau=\max\tau_{ij}$ and $\pi=\max\pi_{ij}$. For $m&gt;3$ commodities, there are precisely three such mechanisms, one of which has a distinguished commodity -- the money -- that serves as the sole medium of exchange. As $m\rightarrow \infty$ the money mechanism is the only one with bounded $\left( \pi ,\tau\right) $.</description>

      <title>Putting all eggs in one basket: some insights from a correlation inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15957v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give examples of situations -- stochastic production, military tactics, corporate merger -- where it is beneficial to concentrate risk rather than to diversify it, that is, to put all eggs in one basket. Our examples admit a dual interpretation: as optimal strategies of a single player (the `principal') or, alternatively, as dominant strategies in a non-cooperative game with multiple players (the `agents').
  The key mathematical result can be formulated in terms of a convolution structure on the set of increasing functions on a Boolean lattice (the lattice of subsets of a finite set). This generalizes the well-known Harris inequality from statistical physics and discrete mathematics; we give a simple self-contained proof of this result, and prove a further generalization based on the game-theoretic approach.</description>

      <title>Balancing Selection Efficiency and Societal Costs in Selective Contests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Selective contests can impair participants' overall welfare in overcompetitive environments, such as school admissions. This paper models the situation as an optimal contest design problem with binary actions, treating effort costs as societal costs incurred to achieve a desired level of selectivity. We provide a characterization for the feasible set of selection efficiency and societal cost in selective contests by establishing their relationship with feasible equilibrium strategies. We find that selection efficiency and contestants' welfare are complementary, i.e. it is almost impossible to improve one without sacrificing the other. We derive the optimal equilibrium outcome given the feasible set and characterize the corresponding optimal contest design. Our analysis demonstrates that it is always optimal for a contest designer who is sufficiently concerned with societal cost to intentionally introduce randomness into the contest. Furthermore, we show that the designer can optimize any linear payoff function by adjusting a single parameter related to the intensity of randomness, without altering the specific structure of the contest.</description>
