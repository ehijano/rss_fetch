      <title>The Sketchfab 3D Creative Commons Collection (S3D3C)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The technology to capture, create, and use three-dimensional (3D) models has become increasingly accessible in recent years.
  With increasing numbers of use cases for 3D models and collections of rapidly increasing size, better methods to analyze the content of 3D models are required.
  While previously proposed 3D model collections for research purposes exist, these often contain only untextured geometry and are typically designed for a specific application, which limits their use in quantitative evaluations of modern 3D model analysis methods.
  In this paper, we introduce the Sketchfab 3D Creative Commons Collection (S3D3C), a new 3D model research collection consisting of 40,802 creative commons licensed models downloaded from the 3D model platform Sketchfab.
  By including popular freely available models with a wide variety of technical properties, such as textures, materials, and animations, we enable its use in the evaluation of state-of-the-art geometry-based and view-based 3D model analysis and retrieval techniques.</description>

      <title>Revolutionizing Text-to-Image Retrieval as Autoregressive Token-to-Voken Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image retrieval is a fundamental task in multimedia processing, aiming to retrieve semantically relevant cross-modal content. Traditional studies have typically approached this task as a discriminative problem, matching the text and image via the cross-attention mechanism (one-tower framework) or in a common embedding space (two-tower framework). Recently, generative cross-modal retrieval has emerged as a new research line, which assigns images with unique string identifiers and generates the target identifier as the retrieval target. Despite its great potential, existing generative approaches are limited due to the following issues: insufficient visual information in identifiers, misalignment with high-level semantics, and learning gap towards the retrieval target. To address the above issues, we propose an autoregressive voken generation method, named AVG. AVG tokenizes images into vokens, i.e., visual tokens, and innovatively formulates the text-to-image retrieval task as a token-to-voken generation problem. AVG discretizes an image into a sequence of vokens as the identifier of the image, while maintaining the alignment with both the visual information and high-level semantics of the image. Additionally, to bridge the learning gap between generative training and the retrieval target, we incorporate discriminative training to modify the learning direction during token-to-voken training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AVG achieves superior results in both effectiveness and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Selective Vision-Language Subspace Projection for Few-shot CLIP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models such as CLIP are capable of mapping the different modality data into a unified feature space, enabling zero/few-shot inference by measuring the similarity of given images and texts. However, most existing methods overlook modality gaps in CLIP's encoded features, which is shown as the text and image features lie far apart from each other, resulting in limited classification performance. To tackle this issue, we introduce a method called Selective Vision-Language Subspace Projection (SSP), which incorporates local image features and utilizes them as a bridge to enhance the alignment between image-text pairs. Specifically, our SSP framework comprises two parallel modules: a vision projector and a language projector. Both projectors utilize local image features to span the respective subspaces for image and texts, thereby projecting the image and text features into their respective subspaces to achieve alignment. Moreover, our approach entails only training-free matrix calculations and can be seamlessly integrated into advanced CLIP-based few-shot learning frameworks. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets have demonstrated SSP's superior text-image alignment capabilities, outperforming the state-of-the-art alignment methods.

      <title>Enhancing Environmental Monitoring through Multispectral Imaging: The WasteMS Dataset for Semantic Segmentation of Lakeside Waste</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Environmental monitoring of lakeside green areas is crucial for environmental protection. Compared to manual inspections, computer vision technologies offer a more efficient solution when deployed on-site. Multispectral imaging provides diverse information about objects under different spectrums, aiding in the differentiation between waste and lakeside lawn environments. This study introduces WasteMS, the first multispectral dataset established for the semantic segmentation of lakeside waste. WasteMS includes a diverse range of waste types in lawn environments, captured under various lighting conditions. We implemented a rigorous annotation process to label waste in images. Representative semantic segmentation frameworks were used to evaluate segmentation accuracy using WasteMS. Challenges encountered when using WasteMS for segmenting waste on lakeside lawns were discussed. The WasteMS dataset is available at https://github.com/zhuqinfeng1999/WasteMS.</description>

      <title>Safe-CLIP: Removing NSFW Concepts from Vision-and-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16254v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale vision-and-language models, such as CLIP, are typically trained on web-scale data, which can introduce inappropriate content and lead to the development of unsafe and biased behavior. This, in turn, hampers their applicability in sensitive and trustworthy contexts and could raise significant concerns in their adoption. Our research introduces a novel approach to enhancing the safety of vision-and-language models by diminishing their sensitivity to NSFW (not safe for work) inputs. In particular, our methodology seeks to sever "toxic" linguistic and visual concepts, unlearning the linkage between unsafe linguistic or visual items and unsafe regions of the embedding space. We show how this can be done by fine-tuning a CLIP model on synthetic data obtained from a large language model trained to convert between safe and unsafe sentences, and a text-to-image generator. We conduct extensive experiments on the resulting embedding space for cross-modal retrieval, text-to-image, and image-to-text generation, where we show that our model can be remarkably employed with pre-trained generative models. Our source code and trained models are available at: https://github.com/aimagelab/safe-clip.</description>

      <title>A Bounding Box is Worth One Token: Interleaving Layout and Text in a Large Language Model for Document Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, many studies have demonstrated that exclusively incorporating OCR-derived text and spatial layouts with large language models (LLMs) can be highly effective for document understanding tasks. However, existing methods that integrate spatial layouts with text have limitations, such as producing overly long text sequences or failing to fully leverage the autoregressive traits of LLMs. In this work, we introduce Interleaving Layout and Text in a Large Language Model (LayTextLLM)} for document understanding. In particular, LayTextLLM projects each bounding box to a single embedding and interleaves it with text, efficiently avoiding long sequence issues while leveraging autoregressive traits of LLMs. LayTextLLM not only streamlines the interaction of layout and textual data but also shows enhanced performance in Key Information Extraction (KIE) and Visual Question Answering (VQA). Comprehensive benchmark evaluations reveal significant improvements, with a 27.2% increase on KIE tasks and 12.0% on VQA tasks compared to previous state-of-the-art document understanding MLLMs, as well as a 15.1% improvement over other SOTA OCR-based LLMs on KIE tasks.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Graph Guided Multi-modal Network for Livestreaming Product Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid expansion of e-commerce, more consumers have become accustomed to making purchases via livestreaming. Accurately identifying the products being sold by salespeople, i.e., livestreaming product retrieval (LPR), poses a fundamental and daunting challenge. The LPR task encompasses three primary dilemmas in real-world scenarios: 1) the recognition of intended products from distractor products present in the background; 2) the video-image heterogeneity that the appearance of products showcased in live streams often deviates substantially from standardized product images in stores; 3) there are numerous confusing products with subtle visual nuances in the shop. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Spatiotemporal Graphing Multi-modal Network (SGMN). First, we employ a text-guided attention mechanism that leverages the spoken content of salespeople to guide the model to focus toward intended products, emphasizing their salience over cluttered background products. Second, a long-range spatiotemporal graph network is further designed to achieve both instance-level interaction and frame-level matching, solving the misalignment caused by video-image heterogeneity. Third, we propose a multi-modal hard example mining, assisting the model in distinguishing highly similar products with fine-grained features across the video-image-text domain. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed SGMN model, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods by a substantial margin.

      <title>MicroEmo: Time-Sensitive Multimodal Emotion Recognition with Micro-Expression Dynamics in Video Dialogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal emotion recognition capabilities, integrating multimodal cues from visual, acoustic, and linguistic contexts in the video to recognize human emotional states. However, existing methods ignore capturing local facial features of temporal dynamics of micro-expressions and do not leverage the contextual dependencies of the utterance-aware temporal segments in the video, thereby limiting their expected effectiveness to a certain extent. In this work, we propose MicroEmo, a time-sensitive MLLM aimed at directing attention to the local facial micro-expression dynamics and the contextual dependencies of utterance-aware video clips. Our model incorporates two key architectural contributions: (1) a global-local attention visual encoder that integrates global frame-level timestamp-bound image features with local facial features of temporal dynamics of micro-expressions; (2) an utterance-aware video Q-Former that captures multi-scale and contextual dependencies by generating visual token sequences for each utterance segment and for the entire video then combining them. Preliminary qualitative experiments demonstrate that in a new Explainable Multimodal Emotion Recognition (EMER) task that exploits multi-modal and multi-faceted clues to predict emotions in an open-vocabulary (OV) manner, MicroEmo demonstrates its effectiveness compared with the latest methods.</description>
