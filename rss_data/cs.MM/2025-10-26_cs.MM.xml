      <title>Can Current Detectors Catch Face-to-Voice Deepfake Attacks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has enabled the creation of increasingly stealthy synthetic voices, commonly referred to as audio deepfakes. A recent technique, FOICE [USENIX'24], demonstrates a particularly alarming capability: generating a victim's voice from a single facial image, without requiring any voice sample. By exploiting correlations between facial and vocal features, FOICE produces synthetic voices realistic enough to bypass industry-standard authentication systems, including WeChat Voiceprint and Microsoft Azure. This raises serious security concerns, as facial images are far easier for adversaries to obtain than voice samples, dramatically lowering the barrier to large-scale attacks. In this work, we investigate two core research questions: (RQ1) can state-of-the-art audio deepfake detectors reliably detect FOICE-generated speech under clean and noisy conditions, and (RQ2) whether fine-tuning these detectors on FOICE data improves detection without overfitting, thereby preserving robustness to unseen voice generators such as SpeechT5.
  Our study makes three contributions. First, we present the first systematic evaluation of FOICE detection, showing that leading detectors consistently fail under both standard and noisy conditions. Second, we introduce targeted fine-tuning strategies that capture FOICE-specific artifacts, yielding significant accuracy improvements. Third, we assess generalization after fine-tuning, revealing trade-offs between specialization to FOICE and robustness to unseen synthesis pipelines. These findings expose fundamental weaknesses in today's defenses and motivate new architectures and training protocols for next-generation audio deepfake detection.</description>

      <title>Save It for the "Hot" Day: An LLM-Empowered Visual Analytics System for Heat Risk Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03317v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The escalating frequency and intensity of heat-related climate events, particularly heatwaves, emphasize the pressing need for advanced heat risk management strategies. Current approaches, primarily relying on numerical models, face challenges in spatial-temporal resolution and in capturing the dynamic interplay of environmental, social, and behavioral factors affecting heat risks. This has led to difficulties in translating risk assessments into effective mitigation actions. Recognizing these problems, we introduce a novel approach leveraging the burgeoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract rich and contextual insights from news reports. We hence propose an LLM-empowered visual analytics system, Havior, that integrates the precise, data-driven insights of numerical models with nuanced news report information. This hybrid approach enables a more comprehensive assessment of heat risks and better identification, assessment, and mitigation of heat-related threats. The system incorporates novel visualization designs, such as "thermoglyph" and news glyph, enhancing intuitive understanding and analysis of heat risks. The integration of LLM-based techniques also enables advanced information retrieval and semantic knowledge extraction that can be guided by experts' analytics needs. Our case studies on two cities that faced significant heatwave events and interviews with five experts have demonstrated the usefulness of our system in providing in-depth and actionable insights for heat risk management.</description>

      <title>Seeing Sound, Hearing Sight: Uncovering Modality Bias and Conflict of AI models in Sound Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imagine hearing a dog bark and turning toward the sound only to see a parked car, while the real, silent dog sits elsewhere. Such sensory conflicts test perception, yet humans reliably resolve them by prioritizing sound over misleading visuals. Despite advances in multimodal AI integrating vision and audio, little is known about how these systems handle cross-modal conflicts or whether they favor one modality. In this study, we systematically examine modality bias and conflict resolution in AI sound localization. We assess leading multimodal models and benchmark them against human performance in psychophysics experiments across six audiovisual conditions, including congruent, conflicting, and absent cues. Humans consistently outperform AI, demonstrating superior resilience to conflicting or missing visuals by relying on auditory information. In contrast, AI models often default to visual input, degrading performance to near chance levels. To address this, we propose a neuroscience-inspired model, EchoPin, which uses a stereo audio-image dataset generated via 3D simulations. Even with limited training data, EchoPin surpasses existing benchmarks. Notably, it also mirrors human-like horizontal localization bias favoring left-right precision-likely due to the stereo audio structure reflecting human ear placement. These findings underscore how sensory input quality and system architecture shape multimodal representation accuracy.</description>
