      <title>Controlling Behavioral Diversity in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of behavioral diversity in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is a nascent yet promising field. In this context, the present work deals with the question of how to control the diversity of a multi-agent system. With no existing approaches to control diversity to a set value, current solutions focus on blindly promoting it via intrinsic rewards or additional loss functions, effectively changing the learning objective and lacking a principled measure for it. To address this, we introduce Diversity Control (DiCo), a method able to control diversity to an exact value of a given metric by representing policies as the sum of a parameter-shared component and dynamically scaled per-agent components. By applying constraints directly to the policy architecture, DiCo leaves the learning objective unchanged, enabling its applicability to any actor-critic MARL algorithm. We theoretically prove that DiCo achieves the desired diversity, and we provide several experiments, both in cooperative and competitive tasks, that show how DiCo can be employed as a novel paradigm to increase performance and sample efficiency in MARL.

      <title>Finite-time convergence to an $\epsilon$-efficient Nash equilibrium in potential games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the convergence time of log-linear learning to an $\epsilon$-efficient Nash equilibrium (NE) in potential games. In such games, an efficient NE is defined as the maximizer of the potential function. Existing results are limited to potential games with stringent structural assumptions and entail exponential convergence times in $1/\epsilon$. Unaddressed so far, we tackle general potential games and prove the first finite-time convergence to an $\epsilon$-efficient NE. In particular, by using a problem-dependent analysis, our bound depends polynomially on $1/\epsilon$. Furthermore, we provide two extensions of our convergence result: first, we show that a variant of log-linear learning that requires a factor $A$ less feedback on the utility per round enjoys a similar convergence time; second, we demonstrate the robustness of our convergence guarantee if log-linear learning is subject to small perturbations such as alterations in the learning rule or noise-corrupted utilities.</description>

      <title>CulturePark: Boosting Cross-cultural Understanding in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cultural bias is pervasive in many large language models (LLMs), largely due to the deficiency of data representative of different cultures. Typically, cultural datasets and benchmarks are constructed either by extracting subsets of existing datasets or by aggregating from platforms such as Wikipedia and social media. However, these approaches are highly dependent on real-world data and human annotations, making them costly and difficult to scale. Inspired by cognitive theories on social communication, this paper introduces CulturePark, an LLM-powered multi-agent communication framework for cultural data collection. CulturePark simulates cross-cultural human communication with LLM-based agents playing roles in different cultures. It generates high-quality cross-cultural dialogues encapsulating human beliefs, norms, and customs. Using CulturePark, we generated 41,000 cultural samples to fine-tune eight culture-specific LLMs. We evaluated these models across three downstream tasks: content moderation, cultural alignment, and cultural education. Results show that for content moderation, our GPT-3.5-based models either match or outperform GPT-4 on datasets. Regarding cultural alignment, our models surpass GPT-4 on Hofstede's VSM 13 framework. Furthermore, for cultural education of human participants, our models demonstrate superior outcomes in both learning efficacy and user experience compared to GPT-4. CulturePark proves an important step in addressing cultural bias and advancing the democratization of AI, highlighting the critical role of culturally inclusive data in model training.</description>
