      <title>Microwave focusing with temporal interference for non-invasive deep brain stimulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is effective in treating neurological disorders but involves invasive surgery. Non-invasive DBS aims to overcome surgical risks by means of externally applied electromagnetic fields. In this work, we present a method for non-invasive microwave focusing of amplitude-modulated electric fields in the human brain using an external antenna array. The method combines iterative time-reversal (iTR) and genetic-algorithm-based temporal interference (TI) optimization to determine antenna positions, orientations, operating frequency, amplitudes, and phases of each element. Magnetic point dipoles are used as idealized radiative sources, providing a design-independent benchmark for optimization studies. Furthermore, this work incorporates realistic tissue properties from voxelized anatomical head models, accounting for variations in permittivity and conductivity. The iTR algorithm provides an initial antenna configuration that serves as a reliable starting point for the subsequent TI optimization, improving convergence and focusing precision. The results demonstrate that amplitude-modulated electromagnetic fields can be selectively and precisely shaped within predefined focal regions. Thereby, this study demonstrates a proof-of-principle of non-invasive microwave field focusing using iTR and TI in a realistic human head model.</description>

      <title>A novel method for analysis of transient morphological changes in quasiperiodic physiological signals and their neurogenic correlates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequently, transient changes in physiological signals, such as ECG morphology, precede or follow a rate change. Current methods for visualizing morphology allow only the tracking of preselected changes, severely limiting analytical capabilities. We introduce a novel method for visualizing quasiperiodic signals, enabling the transformation of time series containing repetitive patterns into intuitive visual representations. By using segmentation algorithms and color encoding, we generate two-dimensional "carpet plots" that facilitate simultaneous assessment of heart rhythm and signal features, including the morphology of QRS complexes and T waves, as well as transient changes in intervals and amplitudes. Additionally, the method supports the assessment of concomitant changes in morphology and rate.
  Typically, existing visualization methods, such as the standard 12-lead ECG projection, focus either on rhythm variability or on morphological analysis of a few consecutive beats. In contrast, our method integrates both aspects into a single, coherent graphical representation, greatly enhancing the detection of subtle disturbances and a fascinating dynamic interplay between the rhythm and the morphology of the signal.
  We illustrate the effectiveness of this approach using Holter recordings from healthy individuals and patients with arrhythmias, as well as stress test sessions. The results highlight the potential of our visualization technique to support diagnosis and long-term ECG signal analysis. The method may be applied to a broad class of repeatable quasiperiodic patterns - we demonstrate a few examples.</description>

      <title>SHARP: A compact focusing system for medical applications using a diverging plasma lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cancer therapy for deep-seated tumors requires precise irradiation of a small target deep within the patient while minimizing radiation exposure to surrounding tissues. This can be accomplished with a round beam sharply converging towards a single spot, requiring a large beam size in both planes at the exit of the focusing system. Achieving this over a short distance using only quadrupole lenses is challenging; but by using a linear active plasma lens (APL) in defocusing mode, the beam can be quickly and non-destructively enlarged before focusing using quadrupoles. The position of the irradiation spot can also be scanned in three dimensions by changing magnet settings. The SHARP project will develop and test this concept. Such a system can be used with very high energy electrons (hundreds of MeV), creating a Bragg-peak-like spot using novel accelerator technology. This could lead to more compact radiotherapy facilities, not requiring a bulky infrastructure typically associated with proton radiotherapy machines. If successful, SHARP will enable precision conformal radiotherapy, spatial fractionation, and potentially be useful for FLASH radiotherapy.</description>

      <title>Physics-Guided Dual-Domain Network with Attention-Based Fusion for Portable MRI Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Portable low-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems have gained renewed interest owing to their cost effectiveness and point-of-care imaging capabilities. Yet, portable MRI systems suffer from relatively low signal-to-noise ratio and limited hardware capabilities. While previous works have proposed the use of deep learning based reconstruction methods to improve low-field image quality, these operated only in the image-domain. Unlike other imaging modalities, MRI directly acquires data in the Fourier-domain (k-space), and exploiting both k-space and image-domain information can improve reconstruction quality. Here, we introduce DUN-DD, a novel physics-guided 3D network for portable MRI reconstruction, with parallel dual-domain branches whose outputs are combined together via an attention-based fusion network. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, we present \textit{in vivo} reconstructions obtained from both emulated datasets as well as images acquired with a 47mT Halbach-based portable MRI system. Our results show that DUN-DD outperforms state-of-the-art classical, data-driven, and physics-guided methods on both emulated and real portable MRI acquisitions.</description>

      <title>Radio-frequency pulse design in local rotating frame in magnetic resonance imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of spatially selective radio-frequency (RF) pulse design in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is typically stated in the form of determining, analytically or numerically, RF waveforms to be applied in synchrony with one or more predetermined gradient waveforms. In most cases, the dynamics of the nuclear spin magnetization under the RF and gradient fields is described in a global rotating frame that cancels the effect of the static (main) magnetic field B0. In this work, we consider an alternative frame of reference, which can be called a local rotating frame where total longitudinal magnetic field (B0 plus gradient) in every voxel is zero. In this frame, the effect of time-dependent gradient field is integrated out, and the remaining magnetization dynamics, governed by much weaker RF fields, becomes both simpler and slower. We show that recasting existing RF design methods in such a frame provides useful insights and techniques that are not obvious in the conventional description. The methods we consider include (i) two-dimensional spatial RF pulse design in the excitation k-space, (ii) Shinnar-Le Roux RF design, (iii) residual phase calculation in slice-selective excitation, and (iv) iterative and numerical solutions for multi-coil RF pulse design. In particular, we show that the new formalism can substantially reduce the Bloch simulation time which can greatly benefit iterative pulse designs in parallel transmit. In all, the proposed framework provides considerable theoretical insights and practical utility for RF pulse design in MRI.</description>
