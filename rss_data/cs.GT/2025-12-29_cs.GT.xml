      <title>Dynamic Cooperative Strategies in Search Engine Advertising Market: With and Without Retail Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In search engine advertising (SEA) market, where competition among retailers is intense and multifaceted, channel coordination between retailers and manufacturers emerges as a critical factor, which significantly influences the effectiveness of advertising strategies. This research attempts to provide managerial guidelines for cooperative advertising in the SEA context by modeling two cooperative advertising decision scenarios. Scenario I defines a simple cooperative channel consisting of one manufacturer and one retailer. In Scenario II, we consider a more general setting where there is an independent retailer who competes with the Manufacturer-Retailer alliance in Scenario I. We propose a novel cooperative advertising optimization model, wherein a manufacturer can advertise product directly through SEA campaigns and indirectly by subsidizing its retailer. To highlight the distinctive features of SEA, our model incorporates dynamic quality scores and focuses on a finite time horizon. In each scenario, we provide a feasible equilibrium solution of optimal policies for all members. Subsequently, we conduct numerical experiments to perform sensitivity analysis for both the quality score and gross margin. Additionally, we explore the impact of the initial market share of the competing retailer in Scenario II. Finally, we investigate how retail competition affects the cooperative alliance's optimal strategy and channel performance. Our identified properties derived from the equilibrium and numerical analyses offer crucial insights for participants engaged in cooperative advertising within the SEA market.</description>

      <title>EFX Allocations Exist on Triangle-Free Multi-Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fair allocation of indivisible goods among agents, with a focus on limiting envy. A central open question in this area is the existence of EFX allocations-allocations in which any envy of any agent i towards any agent j vanishes upon the removal of any single good from j's bundle. Establishing the existence of such allocations has proven notoriously difficult in general, but progress has been made for restricted valuation classes. Christodoulou et al. [2023] proved existence for graphical valuations, where goods correspond to edges in a graph, agents to nodes, and each agent values only incident edges. The graph was required to be simple, i.e., for any pair of agents, there could be at most one good that both agents value. The problem remained open, however, for multi-graph valuations, where for a pair of agents several goods may have value to both. In this setting, Sgouritsa and Sotiriou [2025] established existence whenever the shortest cycle with non-parallel edges has length at least six, while Afshinmehr et al. [2025] proved existence when the graph contains no odd cycles. In this paper, we strengthen these results by proving that EFX allocations always exist in multi-graphs that contain no cycle of length three. Assuming monotone valuations, we further provide a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm for computing such an allocation, which runs in polynomial time when agents have cancelable valuations, a strict superclass of additive valuation functions. Accordingly, our results stand as one of the only cases where EFX allocations exist for an arbitrary number of agents.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Coalition Structures in Polynomial Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the classical coalition structure generation (CSG) problem and compare the anytime behavior of three algorithmic paradigms: dynamic programming (DP), MILP branch-and-bound, and sparse relaxations based on greedy or $l_1$-type methods. Under a simple random "sparse synergy" model for coalition values, we prove that sparse relaxations recover coalition structures whose welfare is arbitrarily close to optimal in polynomial time with high probability. In contrast, broad classes of DP and MILP algorithms require exponential time before attaining comparable solution quality. This establishes a rigorous probabilistic anytime separation in favor of sparse relaxations, even though exact methods remain ultimately optimal.</description>

      <title>Multi-agent Adaptive Mechanism Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a sequential mechanism design problem in which a principal seeks to elicit truthful reports from multiple rational agents while starting with no prior knowledge of agents' beliefs. We introduce Distributionally Robust Adaptive Mechanism (DRAM), a general framework combining insights from both mechanism design and online learning to jointly address truthfulness and cost-optimality. Throughout the sequential game, the mechanism estimates agents' beliefs and iteratively updates a distributionally robust linear program with shrinking ambiguity sets to reduce payments while preserving truthfulness. Our mechanism guarantees truthful reporting with high probability while achieving $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ cumulative regret, and we establish a matching lower bound showing that no truthful adaptive mechanism can asymptotically do better. The framework generalizes to plug-in estimators, supporting structured priors and delayed feedback. To our knowledge, this is the first adaptive mechanism under general settings that maintains truthfulness and achieves optimal regret when incentive constraints are unknown and must be learned.</description>

      <title>Determining Blockchain Transaction Timing and Fee with Observable Mempools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transaction fee plays an important role in determining the priority of transaction processing in public blockchain systems. Owing to the observability of unconfirmed transactions, a strategic user can postpone his transaction broadcasting time and set a fee as low as possible by prying into his mempool that stores them. However, the stochastic mining interval may cause the delayed transaction to miss the next valid block. Meanwhile, a new feature (i.e. fee bumping) emerges that allows each user to increase his transaction fee before confirmation, making the fee setting more challenging. In this paper, we investigate a novel transaction policy from the perspective of a single strategic user that determines the broadcasting time and the transaction fee simultaneously. Two representative scenarios are considered, in which a number of coexisting ordinary users are mempool-oblivious that set their fees according to certain distribution, and are semi-strategic that check their mempools at a Poisson rate and update their fees. In the former, we compute the optimal broadcasting time and transaction fee that adapts to the arbitrary distribution of mining interval. When the block interval is exponentially distributed in Bitcoin-like PoW systems, the strategic user needs to broadcast his transaction immediately after its creation. And when the block interval is fixed in Ethereum-like PoS systems, he finds it profitable to wait until the last moment before block generation. In the latter, we formulate a continuous-time Markov chain to characterize the dynamics of mempool states, and derive the optimal fee adjusting frequency of the strategic user when the block interval is exponentially distributed. In both theory and simulations, we show that this strategic user should immediately increase his fee whenever it falls behind the minimum fee of being included.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Based Auction Design for Selling Agricultural Produce through Farmer Collectives to Maximize Nash Social Welfare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is motivated by the need to design a robust market mechanism to benefit farmers (producers of agricultural produce) as well as buyers of agricultural produce (consumers). Our proposal is a volume discount auction with a Farmer Collective (FC) as the selling agent and high volume or retail consumers as buying agents. An FC is a cooperative of farmers coming together to harness the power of aggregation and economies of scale. Our auction mechanism seeks to satisfy fundamental properties such as incentive compatibility and individual rationality, and an extremely relevant property for the agriculture setting, namely, Nash social welfare maximization. Besides satisfying these properties, our proposed auction mechanism also ensures that certain practical business constraints are met. Since an auction satisfying all of these properties exactly is a theoretical impossibility, we invoke the idea of designing deep learning networks that learn such an auction with minimal violation of the desired properties. The proposed auction, which we call VDA-SAP (Volume Discount Auction for Selling Agricultural Produce), is superior in many ways to the classical VCG (Vickrey-Clarke-Groves) mechanism in terms of richness of properties satisfied and further outperforms other baseline auctions as well. We demonstrate our results for a realistic setting of an FC selling perishable vegetables to potential buyers.</description>

      <title>Sharing with Frictions: Limited Transfers and Costly Inspections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The radio spectrum suitable for commercial wireless services is limited. A portion of the radio spectrum has been reserved for institutions using it for non-commercial purposes such as federal agencies, defense, public safety bodies and scientific institutions. In order to operate efficiently, these incumbents need clean spectrum access. However, commercial users also want access, and granting them access may materially interfere with the existing activity of the incumbents. Conventional market based mechanisms for allocating scarce resources in this context are problematic. Allowing direct monetary transfers to and from public or scientific institutions risks distorting their non-commercial mission. Moreover, often only the incumbent knows the exact value of the interference it experiences, and, likewise, only commercial users can predict accurately the expected monetary outcome from sharing the resource. Thus, our problem is to determine the efficient allocation of resources in the presence of private information without the use of direct monetary transfers. The problem is not unique to spectrum. Other resources that governments hold in trust share the same feature. We propose a novel mechanism design formulation of the problem, characterize the optimal mechanism and describe some of its qualitative properties.</description>

      <title>Centralization and Stability in Formal Constitutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a social-choice function (SCF) is chosen to decide votes in a formal system, including votes to replace the voting method itself. Agents vote according to their ex-ante preference between the incumbent SCF and the suggested replacement. The existing SCF then aggregates the agents' votes and arrives at a decision of whether it should itself be replaced. An SCF is self-maintaining if it can not be replaced in such fashion by any other SCF. Our focus is on the implications of self-maintenance for centralization. We present results considering optimistic, pessimistic and i.i.d. approaches w.r.t. agent beliefs, and different tie-breaking rules. To highlight two of the results, (i) for the i.i.d. unbiased case with arbitrary tie-breaking, we prove an ``Arrow-Style'' Theorem for Dynamics: We show that only a dictatorship is self-maintaining, and any other SCF has a path of changes that arrives at a dictatorship. (ii) If we take into account wisdom of the crowd effects, for a society with a variable size of ruling elite, we demonstrate how the stable elite size is decreasing in both how extractive the economy is, and the quality of individual decision-making. All in all we provide a basic framework and body of results for centralization dynamics and stability, applicable for institution design, especially in formal ``De-Jure'' systems, such as Blockchain Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs).</description>

      <title>Budget Pacing in Repeated Auctions: Regret and Efficiency without Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.08674v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the aggregate welfare and individual regret guarantees of dynamic \emph{pacing algorithms} in the context of repeated auctions with budgets. Such algorithms are commonly used as bidding agents in Internet advertising platforms, adaptively learning to shade bids by a tunable linear multiplier in order to match a specified budget. We show that when agents simultaneously apply a natural form of gradient-based pacing, the liquid welfare obtained over the course of the learning dynamics is at least half the optimal expected liquid welfare obtainable by any allocation rule. Crucially, this result holds \emph{without requiring convergence of the dynamics}, allowing us to circumvent known complexity-theoretic obstacles of finding equilibria. This result is also robust to the correlation structure between agent valuations and holds for any \emph{core auction}, a broad class of auctions that includes first-price, second-price, and generalized second-price auctions as special cases. For individual guarantees, we further show such pacing algorithms enjoy \emph{dynamic regret} bounds for individual utility- and value-maximization, with respect to the sequence of budget-pacing bids, for any auction satisfying a monotone bang-for-buck property. To complement our theoretical findings, we provide semi-synthetic numerical simulations based on auction data from the Bing Advertising platform.</description>

      <title>Precomputed Dominant Resource Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08846v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although resource allocation is a well studied problem in computer science, until the prevalence of distributed systems, such as computing clouds and data centres, the question had been addressed predominantly for single resource type scenarios. At the beginning of the last decade, with the introuction of Dominant Resource Fairness, the studies of the resource allocation problem has finally extended to the multiple resource type scenarios. Dominant Resource Fairness is a solution, addressing the problem of fair allocation of multiple resource types, among users with heterogeneous demands. Based on Max-min Fairness, which is a well established algorithm in the literature for allocating resources in the single resource type scenarios, Dominant Resource Fairness generalises the scheme to the multiple resource case. It has a number of desirable properties that makes it preferable over alternatives, such as Sharing Incentive, Envy-Freeness, Pareto Efficiency, and Strategy Proofness, and as such, it is widely adopted in distributed systems. In the present study, we revisit the original study, and analyse the structure of the algorithm in closer view, to come up with an alternative algorithm, which approximates the Dominant Resource Fairness allocation in fewer steps. We name the new algorithm Precomputed Dominant Resource Fairness, after its main working principle.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Economic Impact of Decentralization on Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We model the ultimate price paid by users of a decentralized ledger as resulting from a two-stage game where Miners (/Proposers/etc.) first purchase blockspace via a Tullock contest, and then price that space to users. When analyzing our distributed ledger model, we find:
  - A characterization of all possible pure equilibria (although pure equilibria are not guaranteed to exist).
  - A natural sufficient condition, implied by Regularity (a la [Mye81]), for existence of a ''market-clearing'' pure equilibrium where Miners choose to sell all space allocated by the Distributed Ledger Protocol, and that this equilibrium is unique.
  - The market share of the largest miner is the relevant ''measure of decentralization'' to determine whether a market-clearing pure equilibrium exists.
  - Block rewards do not impact users' prices at equilibrium, when pure equilibria exist. But, higher block rewards can cause pure equilibria to exist.
  We also discuss aspects of our model and how they relate to blockchains deployed in practice. For example, only ''patient'' users (who are happy for their transactions to enter the blockchain under any miner) would enjoy the conclusions highlighted by our model, whereas ''impatient'' users (who are interested only for their transaction to be included in the very next block) still face monopoly pricing.</description>
