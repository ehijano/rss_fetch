      <title>Muon Ring and FCC-ee / CEPC Based Antimuon-Electron Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the construction of an antimuon-electron collider at KEK has been proposed. We argue that the construction of a similar muon ring tangential to FCC-ee and CEPC will give an opportunity to realize antimuon-electron collisions at higher center-of-mass energies. Moreover, the same ring may be used later to realize energy-frontier antimuon-proton colliders based on FCC-pp and SppC. Similarly, changing of electron ring in {\mu}TRISTAN project into proton ring will give opportunity to investigate lepton-hadron collisions at ~2 TeV center-of-mass energies. In this paper the main parameters of proposed colliders have been studied. It is shown that sufficiently high luminosities can be achieved for all proposals under consideration.</description>

      <title>Average amplitude and phase detuning near driven 3rd integer resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For resonant slow extraction of accelerated particle beams from synchrotrons, a 3rd order resonance driven by sextupole magnets is commonly used. This note reviews the non-linear particle dynamics under these conditions as described by the Kobayashi Hamiltonian, focussing on the amplitude and phase dependent detuning. Using the Kobayashi Hamiltonian as the invariant, an expression for the action and the average detuning as a function of the Hamiltonian is derived and compared to numerically obtained results.</description>

      <title>Electron Diffusion in Microbunched Electron Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent electron cooling is a novel method to cool dense hadron beams on timescales of a few hours. This method uses a copropagating beam of electrons to pick up the density fluctuations within the hadron beam in one straight section and then provide corrective energy kicks to the hadrons in a downstream straight, cooling the beam. Microbunched electron cooling is an extension of this idea which induces a microbunching instability in the electron beam as it travels between the two straights, amplifying the signal. However, initial noise in the electron bunch will also be amplified, providing random kicks to the hadrons downstream which tend to increase their emittance. In this paper, we develop an analytic estimate of the effect of the electron noise and benchmark it against simulations.</description>

      <title>Emittance preservation in a plasma-wakefield accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio-frequency particle accelerators are engines of discovery, powering high-energy physics and photon science, but are also large and expensive due to their limited accelerating fields. Plasma-wakefield accelerators (PWFAs) provide orders-of-magnitude stronger fields in the charge-density wave behind a particle bunch travelling in a plasma, promising particle accelerators of greatly reduced size and cost. However, PWFAs can easily degrade the beam quality of the bunches they accelerate. Emittance, which determines how tightly beams can be focused, is a critical beam quality in for instance colliders and free-electron lasers, but is particularly prone to degradation. We demonstrate, for the first time, emittance preservation in a high-gradient and high-efficiency PWFA while simultaneously preserving charge and energy spread. This establishes that PWFAs can accelerate without degradation$\unicode{x2014}$essential for energy boosters in photon science and multistage facilities for compact high-energy particle colliders.</description>

      <title>Efficient prediction of attosecond two-colour pulses from an X-ray free-electron laser with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14751v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray free-electron lasers are sources of coherent, high-intensity X-rays with numerous applications in ultra-fast measurements and dynamic structural imaging. Due to the stochastic nature of the self-amplified spontaneous emission process and the difficulty in controlling injection of electrons, output pulses exhibit significant noise and limited temporal coherence. Standard measurement techniques used for characterizing two-coloured X-ray pulses are challenging, as they are either invasive or diagnostically expensive. In this work, we employ machine learning methods such as neural networks and decision trees to predict the central photon energies of pairs of attosecond fundamental and second harmonic pulses using parameters that are easily recorded at the high-repetition rate of a single shot. Using real experimental data, we apply a detailed feature analysis on the input parameters while optimizing the training time of the machine learning methods. Our predictive models are able to make predictions of central photon energy for one of the pulses without measuring the other pulse, thereby leveraging the use of the spectrometer without having to extend its detection window. We anticipate applications in X-ray spectroscopy using XFELs, such as in time-resolved X-ray absorption and photoemission spectroscopy, where improved measurement of input spectra will lead to better experimental outcomes.</description>

      <title>A feasibility study of a thorium fueled molten salt micro modular subcritical reactor using an electron accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12056v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a design for a small subcritical molten salt thorium breeder reactor driven by an electron accelerator. Such a reactor could provide a safe and simple power source fuelled by thorium, without generating long-lived minor actinides. We use both Geant4 and MCNPX simulations to study the production of photons and photoneutrons, the criticality and the breeding in a simple conceptual design. We show that the concept is on the edge of viability.</description>
