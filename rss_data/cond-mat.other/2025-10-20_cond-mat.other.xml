      <title>Chiral polariton transport enabled by optical spin Hall effect in perovskite waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the spin degree of freedom of light at the microscale is crucial for advancing photonic information processing. Spin polarized light propagation, combined with strong optical nonlinearities, unlocks new functionalities in compact photonic circuits and active spin optronic devices. Lead halide perovskite exciton polaritons uniquely combine room temperature operation, pronounced nonlinearities, and versatile microstructuring, making them a powerful platform for spin based photonic technologies. Here, we demonstrate polarized edge emission from polariton condensates in perovskite single crystals predesigned into a microwire, forming natural, DBR free cavity. Above threshold, we observe a distinct waveguiding optical spin Hall effect pattern in both real- and reciprocal-space emission, accompanied by pseudospin phase locking arising from coherence between opposite edges. Beyond static polarization textures, we achieve spin-resolved polariton edge lasing with chirality exceeding 80\% and spin-polarized signal propagation over tens of micrometres. These results establish CsPbBr3 waveguides as a promising easy to fabricate platform for on chip spin coded information transport and nonlinear spin optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy from Correlation Functions of Scalar Fields in and out of Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that odd order R\'enyi entropies $S^{(2q+1)}$ of a system of interacting scalar fields can be calculated as the free energy of $2q+1$ replicas of the system with additional quadratic inter-replica couplings in the subsystem at the time of measurement of the entropy. These couplings replace boundary field matching conditions. This formalism works both in and out of thermal equilibrium, for closed as well as open quantum systems, and provides a general dictionary between measurable correlation functions and entanglement entropy. $S^{(2q+1)}$ can be analytically continued to calculate the von Neumann entropy $S^{\mathrm{vN}}$. We provide an exact formula relating $S^{(2q+1)}$ and $S^{\mathrm{vN}}$ with correlation functions in a non-interacting theory. For interacting theories, we provide rules for constructing all possible Feynman diagrams for $S^{(2q+1)}$. We show that the boundary matching conditions cannot be completely eliminated while calculating R\'enyi entropies of even order due to presence of zero modes in replica space.</description>

      <title>Financial Interactions and Collective States. Investors and Firms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a previous work, we applied a field formalism to analyze capital allocation and accumulation within a network of investors and firms. In that framework, financial agents could invest in firms or in other investors, and banks-introduced as investors with a credit multiplier-could play a stabilizing or destabilizing role. Collective states emerged from these interactions, reflecting different configurations of capital distribution and stability in the financial system. However, these results relied on the assumption that financial connections were exogenous.
  The present paper removes this assumption by modeling financial connections as dynamic endogenous variables. Specifically, we extend the framework by introducing a field representation of the network of financial connections. The collective states previously identified are now embedded in a broader class of states, characterized by the structure of investment stakes among investors. We show that these collective states consist of inter-connected groups of agents, along with their returns and disposable capital. The model reveals the emergence of two investor classes: high- and low-return (and capital) agents. High-return investors, in particular, act as a source of instability within the system, enabling transitions between configurations. In each collective state, some sectors may experience defaults. When the collective state exhibits specific structural conditions, defaults may spread across a significant share of the group.</description>
