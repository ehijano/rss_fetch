      <title>Compatible Forts and Maximum Nullity of a Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider bounds on maximum nullity of a graph via transversal numbers of compatible collections of forts. Results include generalizations of theorems from symmetric to combinatorially symmetric matrices, special bases of matrix nullspaces derived from transversal sets, and examples of issues that arise when considering only minimal forts and how to avoid them. We also show an important difference between constructing symmetric and combinatorially symmetric matrices associated to a graph whose nullspaces are supported on collections of disjoint forts.</description>

      <title>The chromatic number of 4-dimensional lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chromatic number of a lattice in n-dimensional Euclidean space is defined as the chromatic number of its Voronoi graph. The Voronoi graph is the Cayley graph on the lattice having the strict Voronoi vectors as generators. In this paper we determine the chromatic number of all 4-dimensional lattices. To achieve this we use the known classification of 52 parallelohedra in dimension 4. These 52 geometric types yield 16 combinatorial types of relevant Voronoi graphs. We discuss a systematic approach to checking for isomorphism of Cayley graphs of lattices. Lower bounds for the chromatic number are obtained from choosing appropriate small finite induced subgraphs of the Voronoi graphs. Matching upper bounds are derived from periodic colorings. To determine the chromatic numbers of these finite graphs, we employ a SAT solver.</description>

      <title>On a generalized hexagonal dart board problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jung's theorem says that planar sets of diameter $1$ can be covered by a closed circular disc of radius $\frac 1{\sqrt3}$. In this paper we will restrict ourselves to finite point sets and consider a fractional Jung-type problem. Let $\mathcal{P}_n$ be the family of all finite sets of $n$ points of diameter $1$. Let the function value $N_n(r)$ ($0 &lt; r \leq 1$) be the largest integer $k$ so that for every point set $P \in \mathcal{P}_n$ there is a circle of radius $r$ which covers at least $k$ points of $P$. We give many lower and upper bounds for $N_n(r)$ and determine intervals of $(0,1]$ where exact values of $N_n(r)$ can be determined. Among others we show the $n\leq N_{3n}(\frac{1}{2}) \leq n+1$ and $N_n(\frac{1}{4}) = \lceil \frac{n}{7} \rceil$ for all $n\neq 7$.</description>

      <title>Walecki tournaments with an arc that lies in a unique directed triangle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Walecki tournament is any tournament that can be formed by choosing an orientation for each of the Hamilton cycles in the Walecki decomposition of a complete graph on an odd number of vertices. In this paper, we show that if some arc in a Walecki tournament on at least $7$ vertices lies in exactly one directed triangle, then there is a vertex of the tournament (the vertex typically labelled $*$ in the decomposition) that is fixed under every automorphism of the tournament. Furthermore, any isomorphism between such Walecki tournaments maps the vertex labelled $*$ in one to the vertex labelled $*$ in the other.
  We also show that among Walecki tournaments with a signature of even length $2k$, of the $2^{2k}$ possible signatures, at least $2^k$ produce tournaments that have an arc that lies in a unique directed triangle (and therefore to which our result applies).</description>

      <title>Words Avoiding Tangrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A \emph{tangram} is a word in which every letter occurs an even number of times. Such word can be cut into parts that can be arranged into two identical words. The minimum number of cuts needed is called the \emph{cut number} of a tangram. For example, the word $\mathtt{\color{red}{0102}\color{blue}{0102}}$ is a tangram with cut number one, while the word $\mathtt{\color{red}{01}\color{blue}{01023}\color{red}{023}}$ is a tangram with cut number two. Clearly, tangrams with cut number one coincide with the well known family of words, known as \emph{squares}, having the form $UU$ for some nonempty word $U$.
  A word $W$ \emph{avoids} a word $T$ if it is not possible to write $W=ATB$, for any words $A$ and $B$ (possibly empty). The famous 1906 theorem of Thue asserts that there exist arbitrarily long words avoiding squares over alphabet with just \emph{three} letters. Given a fixed number $k\geqslant 1$, how many letters are needed to avoid tangrams with the cut number at most $k$? Let $t(k)$ denote the minimum size of an alphabet needed for that purpose. By Thue's result we have $t(1)=3$, which easily implies $t(2)=3$. Curiously, these are currently the only known exact values of this function.
  In our main result we prove that $t(k)=\Theta(\log_2k)$. The proof uses \emph{entropy compression} argument and \emph{Zimin words}. By using a different method we prove that $t(k)\leqslant k+1$ for all $k\geqslant 4$, which gives more exact estimates for small values of $k$. The proof makes use of \emph{Dejean words} and a curious property of \emph{Gauss words}, which is perhaps of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Exploring Algorithmic Solutions for the Independent Roman Domination Problem in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G=(V,E)$, a function $f:V\to \{0,1,2\}$ is said to be a \emph{Roman Dominating function} if for every $v\in V$ with $f(v)=0$, there exists a vertex $u\in N(v)$ such that $f(u)=2$. A Roman Dominating function $f$ is said to be an \emph{Independent Roman Dominating function} (or IRDF), if $V_1\cup V_2$ forms an independent set, where $V_i=\{v\in V~\vert~f(v)=i\}$, for $i\in \{0,1,2\}$. The total weight of $f$ is equal to $\sum_{v\in V} f(v)$, and is denoted as $w(f)$. The \emph{Independent Roman Domination Number} of $G$, denoted by $i_R(G)$, is defined as min$\{w(f)~\vert~f$ is an IRDF of $G\}$. For a given graph $G$, the problem of computing $i_R(G)$ is defined as the \emph{Minimum Independent Roman Domination problem}. The problem is already known to be NP-hard for bipartite graphs. In this paper, we further study the algorithmic complexity of the problem.
  In this paper, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm to solve the Minimum Independent Roman Domination problem for distance-hereditary graphs, split graphs, and $P_4$-sparse graphs.</description>

      <title>Monochromatic Sumsets in Countable Colourings of Abelian Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fern\'andez-Bret\'on, Sarmiento and Vera showed that whenever a direct sum of sufficiently many copies of ${\mathbb Z}_4$, the cyclic group of order 4, is countably coloured there are arbitrarily large finite sets $X$ whose sumsets $X+X$ are monochromatic. They asked if the elements of order 4 are necessary, in the following strong sense: if $G$ is an abelian group having no elements of order 4, is it always the case there there is a countable colouring of $G$ for which there is not even a monochromatic sumset $X+X$ with $X$ of size 2? Our aim in this short note is to show that this is indeed the case.</description>

      <title>A Consistent Sandpile Torsor Algorithm for Regular Matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Every regular matroid is associated with a sandpile group, which acts simply transitively on the set of bases in various ways. Ganguly and the second author introduced the notion of consistency to describe classes of actions that respect deletion-contraction in a precise sense, and proved the consistency of rotor-routing torsors (and uniqueness thereof) for plane graphs.
  In this work, we prove that the class of actions introduced by Backman, Baker, and the fourth author, is consistent for regular matroids. More precisely, we prove the consistency of its generalization given by Backman, Santos and the fourth author, and independently by the first author. This extends the above existence assertion, as well as makes progress on the goal of classifying all consistent actions.</description>

      <title>Dual Ramsey degrees for some classes of relational structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we show that some natural classes of structures such as graphs, posets and metric spaces have both dual small and dual big Ramsey degrees with respect to some natural classes of morphisms such as quotient maps in case of graphs and posets, or non-expansive surjections in case of metric spaces. The only exception is the class of reflexive tournaments: they have neither dual small nor dual big Ramsey degrees. Our proof strategy is based on the categorical interpretation of structural Ramsey theory. Starting from a category we are interested in, we engineer an synthetic expansion to piggyback on a category where the dual Ramsey property has been established. We then use the additive properties of dual Ramsey degrees to get back to the original category of "natural" objects and morphisms and conclude that it has finite dual Ramsey degrees.</description>

Abstract: In the present note we show, via the connection between chromatic polynomial and Potts model, that the Whitney Broken circuit theorem is in fact a special case of a more general identity relating the chromatic polynomial of a graph G=(V,E) to sums over forests of G associated to some partition scheme in G.</description>

      <title>Spectral Methods for Matrix Product Factorization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is factored into graphs $H$ and $K$ via a matrix product if there exist adjacency matrices $A$, $B$, and $C$ of $G$, $H$, and $K$, respectively, such that $A = BC$. In this paper, we study the spectral aspects of the matrix product of graphs, including regularity, bipartiteness, and connectivity. We show that if a graph $G$ is factored into a connected graph $H$ and a graph $K$ with no isolated vertices, then certain properties hold. If $H$ is non-bipartite, then $G$ is connected. If $H$ is bipartite and $G$ is not connected, then $K$ is a regular bipartite graph, and consequently, $n$ is even. Furthermore, we show that trees are not factorizable, which answers a question posed by Maghsoudi et al.</description>

      <title>Reconfiguration of Independent Transversals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given integers $\Delta\ge 2$ and $t\ge 2\Delta$, suppose there is a graph of maximum degree $\Delta$ and a partition of its vertices into blocks of size at least $t$. By a seminal result of Haxell, there must be some independent set of the graph that is transversal to the blocks, a so-called independent transversal. We show that, if moreover $t\ge2\Delta+1$, then every independent transversal can be transformed within the space of independent transversals to any other through a sequence of one-vertex modifications, showing connectivity of the so-called reconfigurability graph of independent transversals.
  This is sharp in that for $t=2\Delta$ (and $\Delta\ge 2$) the connectivity conclusion can fail. In this case we show furthermore that in an essential sense it can only fail for the disjoint union of copies of the complete bipartite graph $K_{\Delta,\Delta}$. This constitutes a qualitative strengthening of Haxell's theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the combinatorial interpretation of the ordered Bell numbers, which count all the ordered partitions of the set $[n]=\{1,2,\dots,n\}$, we introduce the Fibonacci partition as a Fibonacci permutation of its blocks. Then we define the Fibonacci-Fubini numbers that count the total number of Fibonacci partitions of $[n]$. We study the classical properties of this sequence (generating function, explicit and Dobi\'nski-like formula, etc.), we give combinatorial interpretation, and we extensively examine the Fibonacci-Fubini arithmetic triangle. We give some associate linear recurrence sequences, where in some sequences the Stirling numbers of the first and second kinds appear as well.</description>

      <title>On the number of sets with small sumset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate subsets with small sumset in arbitrary abelian groups. For an abelian group $G$ and an $n$-element subset $Y \subseteq G$ we show that if $m \ll s^2/(\log n)^2$, then the number of subsets $A \subseteq Y$ with $|A| = s$ and $|A + A| \leq m$ is at most \[2^{o(s)}\binom{\frac{m+\beta}{2}}{s},\] where $\beta$ is the size of the largest subgroup of $G$ of size at most $\left(1+o(1)\right)m$. This bound is sharp for $\mathbb{Z}$ and many other groups. Our result improves the one of Campos and nearly bridges the remaining gap in a conjecture of Alon, Balogh, Morris, and Samotij.
  We also explore the behaviour of uniformly chosen random sets $A \subseteq \{1,\ldots,n\}$ with $|A| = s$ and $|A + A| \leq m$. Under the same assumption that $m \ll s^2/(\log n)^2$, we show that with high probability there exists an arithmetic progression $P \subseteq \mathbb{Z}$ of size at most $m/2 + o(m)$ containing all but $o(s)$ elements of $A$. Analogous results are obtained for asymmetric sumsets, improving results by Campos, Coulson, Serra, and W\"otzel. The main tool behind our proofs is a graph container theorem combined with a variant of an asymmetric hypergraph container theorem.</description>

      <title>An identity involving $h$-polynomials of poset associahedra and type B Narayana polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any finite connected poset $P$, Galashin introduced a simple convex $(|P|-2)$-dimensional polytope $\mathscr{A}(P)$ called the poset associahedron. Let $P$ be a poset with a proper autonomous subposet $S$ that is a chain of size $n$. For $1\leq i \leq n$, let $P_i$ be the poset obtained from $P$ by replacing $S$ by an antichain of size $i$. We show that the $h$-polynomial of $\mathscr{A}(P)$ can be written in terms of the $h$-polynomials of $\mathscr{A}(P_i)$ and type B Narayana polynomials. We then use the identity to deduce several identities involving Narayana polynomials, Eulerian polynomials, and stack-sorting preimages.</description>

      <title>A Degree Bound for Planar Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Stickelberger's theorem on Gauss sums, we show that if $F$ is a planar function on a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$, then for all non-zero functions $G : \mathbb{F}_q \to \mathbb{F}_q$, we have \begin{equation*} \mathrm{deg } \ G \circ F - \mathrm{deg } \ G \le \frac{n(p-1)}{2}\,, \end{equation*} where $q = p^n$ with $p$ a prime and $n$ a positive integer, and $\mathrm{deg } \ F$ is the algebraic degree of $F$, i.e., the degree of the corresponding multivariate polynomial over $\mathbb{F}_p$. This bound leads to a simpler proof of the classification of planar polynomials over $\mathbb{F}_p$ and planar monomials over $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$. As a new result, using the same degree bound, we complete the classification of planar monomials for all $n = 2^k$ with $p&gt;5$ and $k$ a non-negative integer. Finally, we state a conjecture on the sum of the base-$p$ digits of integers modulo $q-1$ that implies the complete classification of planar monomials over finite fields of characteristic $p&gt;5$.</description>

      <title>Weak coloring numbers of minor-closed graph classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the growth rate of weak coloring numbers of graphs excluding a fixed graph as a minor. Van den Heuvel et al. (European J. of Combinatorics, 2017) showed that for a fixed graph $X$, the maximum $r$-th weak coloring number of $X$-minor-free graphs is polynomial in $r$. We determine this polynomial up to a factor of $\mathcal{O}(r \log r)$. Moreover, we tie the exponent of the polynomial to a structural property of $X$, namely, $2$-treedepth. As a result, for a fixed graph $X$ and an $X$-minor-free graph $G$, we show that $\mathrm{wcol}_r(G)= \mathcal{O}(r^{\mathrm{td}(X)-1}\mathrm{log}\ r)$, which improves on the bound $\mathrm{wcol}_r(G) = \mathcal{O}(r^{g(\mathrm{td}(X))})$ given by Dujmovi\'c et al. (SODA, 2024), where $g$ is an exponential function. In the case of planar graphs of bounded treewidth, we show that the maximum $r$-th weak coloring number is in $\mathcal{O}(r^2\mathrm{log}\ r$), which is best possible.</description>

      <title>Universal piecewise polynomiality for counting curves in toric surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by piecewise polynomiality results of double Hurwitz numbers, Ardila and Brugall\'e introduced an enumerative problem which they call double Gromov--Witten invariants of Hirzebruch surfaces. These invariants serve as a two-dimensional analogue and satisfy a similar piecewise polynomial structure. More precisely, they introduced the enumeration of curves in Hirzebruch surfaces satisfying point conditions and tangency conditions on the two parallel toric boundaries. These conditions are stored in four partitions and the resulting invariants are piecewise polynomial in their entries. Moreover, they found that these expressions also behave polynomially with respect to the parameter determining the underlying Hirzebruch surfaces. Based on work of Ardila and Block, they proposed that such a polynomiality could also hold while changing between more general toric surfaces corresponding to $h$-transverse polygons. In this work, we answer this question affirmatively. Moreover, we express the resulting invariants for $h$-transverse polygons as matrix elements in the two-dimensional bosonic Fock space.</description>

      <title>Homology of graph burnings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study graph burnings using methods of algebraic topology. We prove that the time function of a burning is a graph map to a path graph. Afterwards, we define a category whose objects are graph burnings and morphisms are graph maps which commute with the time functions of the burnings. In this category we study relations between burnings of different graphs and, in particular, between burnings of a graph and its subgraphs. For every graph, we define a simplicial complex, arising from the set of all the burnings, which we call a configuration space of the burnings. Further, simplicial structure of the configuration space gives burning homology of the graph. We describe properties of the configuration space and the burning homology theory. In particular, we prove that the one-dimensional skeleton of the configuration space of a graph $G$ coincides with the complement graph of $G$. The results are illustrated with numerous examples.</description>

Abstract: The covering number of a non-linear character $\chi$ of a finite group $G$ is the least positive integer $k$ such that every irreducible character of $G$ occurs in $\chi^k$. We determine the covering numbers of irreducible characters of the symmetric group $S_n$ indexed by certain two-row partitions (and their conjugates), namely $(n-2,2)$ and $((n+1)/2, (n-1)/2)$ when $n$ is odd. We also determine the covering numbers of irreducible characters indexed by certain hook-partitions (and their conjugates), namely $(n-2,1^2)$, the almost self-conjugate hooks $(n/2+1, 1^{n/2-1})$ when $n$ is even, and the self-conjugate hooks $((n+1)/2, 1^{(n-1)/2})$ when $n$ is odd.</description>

      <title>Monomial web basis for the SL(N) skein algebra of the twice punctured sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any non-zero complex number $q$, excluding finitely many roots of unity of small order, a linear basis for the $\mathrm{SL}(n)$ skein algebra of the twice punctured sphere is constructed. In particular, the skein algebra is a commutative polynomial algebra in $n-1$ generators, where each generator is represented by an explicit $\mathrm{SL}(n)$ web, without crossings, on the surface. This includes the case $q=1$, where the skein algebra is identified with the coordinate ring of the $\mathrm{SL}(n)$ character variety of the twice punctured sphere. The proof of both the spanning and linear independence properties of the basis depends on the so-called $\mathrm{SL}(n)$ quantum trace map, due originally to Bonahon-Wong in the case $n=2$. A consequence of the proof is that the polynomial algebra sits as a distinguished subalgebra of the L\^{e}-Sikora $\mathrm{SL}(n)$ stated skein algebra of the annulus. We end by discussing the relationship with Fock-Goncharov duality.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial formula for the coefficients of multidimensional resultants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical multidimensional resultant can be defined as the, suitably normalized, generator of a projective elimination ideal in the ring of universal coefficients. This is the approach via the so-called inertia forms or Tr\"{a}gheitsformen. Using clever substitutions, Mertens and Hurwitz gave a criterion, for recognizing such inertia forms, which amounts to a linear system for their numerical coefficients. In this article we explicitly solve this linear system. We do so by identifying a subset of the available equations which forms a unitriangular system. The key notion we use is that of transversal, i.e., a selection of a monomial term in each of the homogeneous polynomials at hand. We need two such transversals which are disjoint and extremal, in the sense that they relate to extremizers of a, possibly new, determinantal inequality for differences of two substochastic matrices. Thanks to this notion of extremal pair of transversals, we derive an explicit formula for the coefficients of general multidimensional resultants, as a sum of terms made of a sign times a product of multinomial coefficients, thereby explicitly showing they are integer-valued.</description>

      <title>Linear causal disentanglement via higher-order cumulants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear causal disentanglement is a recent method in causal representation learning to describe a collection of observed variables via latent variables with causal dependencies between them. It can be viewed as a generalization of both independent component analysis and linear structural equation models. We study the identifiability of linear causal disentanglement, assuming access to data under multiple contexts, each given by an intervention on a latent variable. We show that one perfect intervention on each latent variable is sufficient and in the worst case necessary to recover parameters under perfect interventions, generalizing previous work to allow more latent than observed variables. We give a constructive proof that computes parameters via a coupled tensor decomposition. For soft interventions, we find the equivalence class of latent graphs and parameters that are consistent with observed data, via the study of a system of polynomial equations. Our results hold assuming the existence of non-zero higher-order cumulants, which implies non-Gaussianity of variables.</description>

      <title>Deep sections of the hypercube</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a non-negative number $t$ and a hyperplane $H$ of $\mathbb{R}^d$ whose distance to the center of the hypercube $[0,1]^d$ is $t$. If $t$ is equal to $0$ and $H$ is orthogonal to a diagonal of $[0,1]^d$, it is known that the $(d-1)$-dimensional volume of $H\cap[0,1]^d$ is a strictly increasing function of $d$ when $d$ is at least $3$. The study of the monotonicity of this volume is extended for $t$ up to above $1/2$ and, when $d$ is large enough, for every non-negative $t$. In particular, a range for $t$ is identified such that this volume is a strictly decreasing function of $d$ over the positive integers. The local extremality of the $(d-1)$-dimensional volume of $H\cap[0,1]^d$ when $H$ is orthogonal to a diagonal of either $[0,1]^d$ or a lower dimensional face is also determined for the same values of $t$. It is shown for instance that when $t$ is above an explicit constant and $d$ is large enough, this volume is always strictly locally maximal when $H$ is orthogonal to a diagonal of $[0,1]^d$. A precise estimate for the convergence rate of the Eulerian numbers to their limit Gaussian behavior is provided along the way.</description>

Abstract: We conduct a quantitative analysis on the number of random edges required to be added to a base graph~$H$ to significantly increase natural minor-monotone graph parameters in the resulting graph~$R$. Specifically, we show that if $R$ is obtained from a connected graph $H$ by adding only a few random edges, the tree-width, genus, and Hadwiger number of $R$ become very large, irrespective of the structure of~$H$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.05583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider covering graphs obtained by lifting a tree with a loop at each vertex as a voltage graph over a cyclic group. We generalize a tool of Hell, Nishiyama, and Stacho, known as the billiard strategy, for constructing Hamiltonian cycles in the covering graphs of paths. We show that our extended tool can be used to provide new sufficient conditions for the Hamiltonicity of covering graphs of trees that are similar to those of Batagelj and Pisanski and of Hell, Nishiyama, and Stacho. Next, we focus specifically on covering graphs obtained from trees lifted as voltage graphs over cyclic groups $\mathbb Z_p$ of large prime order $p$. We prove that for a given reflexive tree $T$ whose edge labels are assigned uniformly at random from a finite set, the corresponding lift is almost surely Hamiltonian for a large enough prime-ordered cyclic group $\mathbb Z_p$. Finally, we show that if a reflexive tree $T$ is lifted over a group $\mathbb Z_p$ of a large prime order, then for any assignment of nonzero elements of $\mathbb Z_p$ to the edges of $T$, the corresponding cover of $T$ has a large circumference.</description>

Abstract: A longstanding open problem asks for an aperiodic monotile, also known as an "einstein": a shape that admits tilings of the plane, but never periodic tilings. We answer this problem for topological disk tiles by exhibiting a continuum of combinatorially equivalent aperiodic polygons. We first show that a representative example, the "hat" polykite, can form clusters called "metatiles", for which substitution rules can be defined. Because the metatiles admit tilings of the plane, so too does the hat. We then prove that generic members of our continuum of polygons are aperiodic, through a new kind of geometric incommensurability argument. Separately, we give a combinatorial, computer-assisted proof that the hat must form hierarchical -- and hence aperiodic -- tilings.</description>

      <title>Approximating branchwidth on parametric extensions of planarity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04517v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The branchwidth of a graph has been introduced by Roberson and Seymour as a measure of the tree-decomposability of a graph, alternative to treewidth. Branchwidth is polynomially computable on planar graphs by the celebrated ``Ratcatcher''-algorithm of Seymour and Thomas. We investigate an extension of this algorithm to minor-closed graph classes, further than planar graphs, as follows: Let $H_{1}$ be a graph embeddable in the torus and $H_{2}$ be a graph embeddable in the projective plane. We prove that every $\{H_{1},H_{2}\}$-minor free graph $G$ contains a subgraph $G'$ where the difference between the branchwidth of $G$ and the branchwidth of $G'$ is bounded by some constant, depending only on $H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$. Moreover, the graph $G'$ admits a tree decomposition where all torsos are planar. This decomposition can be used for deriving a constant-additive approximation for branchwidth: For $\{H_{1},H_{2}\}$-minor free graphs, there is a constant $c$ (depending on $H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$) and an $\Ocal(|V(G)|^{3})$-time algorithm that, given a graph $G$, outputs a value $b$ such that the branchwidth of $G$ is between $b$ and $b+c$.</description>

We provide a complete facet description of this polytope, characterize its edges and show that it is Hirsch. We also show that connected blocks polytopes admit a regular unimodular triangulation by constructing a squarefree Gr\"obner basis. In addition, we prove that the polytope is Gorenstein of index $2$ and that its $h^\ast$-vector is unimodal.</description>

Abstract: The 2022 Fibonacci Conference held in Sarajevo introduced the Circuit Array, a two-dimensional array associated with the resistance labels of electrical circuits whose underlying graph when embedded in the Cartesian plane has the form of a triangular n-grid. The presentation used row reduction, a computational method alternative to the traditional method using the Laplacian. The presentation explored reconsidering the Circuit Array in terms of polynomials instead of numbers as a means to facilitate finding patterns. The present paper shows the fruitfulness of this approach. The main result of the current paper states that the characteristic polynomials corresponding to the recursions of single or multi-variable polynomial formulations of the Circuit Array exclusively have powers of 9 as roots. The proof methodology uses the approach of annihilators. Several initial cases and one major sub-case are proven.</description>

Abstract: We introduce coloring groups, which are permutation groups obtained from a proper edge coloring of a graph. These groups generalize the generalized toggle groups of Striker (which themselves generalize the toggle groups introduced by Cameron and Fon-der-Flaass). We present some general results connecting the structure of a coloring group to the structure of its graph coloring, providing graph-theoretic characterizations of the centralizer and primitivity of a coloring group. We apply these results particularly to generalized toggle groups arising from trees as well as coloring groups arising from the independence posets introduced by Thomas and Williams.</description>

      <title>At the end of the spectrum: Chromatic bounds for the largest eigenvalue of the normalized Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09160v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a graph with largest normalized Laplacian eigenvalue $\lambda_N$ and (vertex) coloring number $\chi$, it is known that $\lambda_N\geq \chi/(\chi-1)$. Here we prove properties of graphs for which this bound is sharp, and we study the multiplicity of $\chi/(\chi-1)$. We then describe a family of graphs with largest eigenvalue $\chi/(\chi-1)$. We also study the spectrum of the $1$-sum of two graphs (also known as graph joining or coalescing), with a focus on the maximal eigenvalue. Finally, we give upper bounds on $\lambda_N$ in terms of $\chi$.</description>

      <title>Paintability of $r$-chromatic graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11888v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paintability of a graph is a coloring parameter defined in terms of an online list coloring game. In this paper we ask, what is the paintability of a graph $G$ of maximum degree $\Delta$ and chromatic number $r$? By considering the Alon-Tarsi number of $G$, we prove that the paintability of $G$ is at most $\left(1 - \frac{1}{4r+1} \right ) \Delta + 2$. We also consider the DP-paintability of $G$, which is defined in terms of an online DP-coloring game. By considering the strict type $3$ degeneracy parameter recently introduced by Zhou, Zhu, and Zhu, we show that when $r$ is fixed and $\Delta$ is sufficiently large, the DP-paintability of $G$ is at most $\Delta - \Omega( \sqrt{\Delta \log \Delta})$.</description>

      <title>Maximizing the index of signed complete graphs with spanning trees on $k$ pendant vertices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A signed graph $\Sigma=(G,\sigma)$ consists of an underlying graph $G=(V,E)$ with a sign function $\sigma:E\rightarrow\{-1,1\}$. Let $A(\Sigma)$ be the adjacency matrix of $\Sigma$ and $\lambda_1(\Sigma)$ denote the largest eigenvalue (index) of $\Sigma$.Define $(K_n,H^-)$ as a signed complete graph whose negative edges induce a subgraph $H$. In this paper, we focus on the following problem: which spanning tree $T$ with a given number of pendant vertices makes the $\lambda_1(A(\Sigma))$ of the unbalanced $(K_n,T^-)$ as large as possible? To answer the problem, we characterize the extremal signed graph with maximum $\lambda_1(A(\Sigma))$ among graphs of type $(K_n,T^-)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Erd\H{o}s-Lov\'asz Tihany Conjecture states that any $G$ with chromatic number $\chi(G) = s + t - 1 &gt; \omega(G)$, with $s,t \geq 2$ can be split into two vertex-disjoint subgraphs of chromatic number $s, t$ respectively. We prove this conjecture for pairs $(s, t)$ if $t \leq s + 2$, whenever $G$ has a $K_s$, and for pairs $(s, t)$ if $t \leq 4 s - 3$, whenever $G$ contains a $K_s$ and is claw-free. We also prove the Erd\H{o}s Lov\'asz Tihany Conjecture for the pair $(3, 10)$ for claw-free graphs.</description>

We provide an affirmative answer to this question, showing that there exists a set of $n$ points such that $\lfloor \frac{n}{4}\rfloor$ distances occur more than $n$ times. We also present a generalized version, finding a set of $n$ points where $c_m \cdot n$ distances occurring more than $n+m$ times.</description>

      <title>Finding irrelevant vertices in linear time on bounded-genus graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05940</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.05940v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The irrelevant vertex technique provides a powerful tool for the design of parameterized algorithms for a wide variety of problems on graphs. A common characteristic of these problems, permitting the application of this technique on surface-embedded graphs, is the fact that every graph of large enough treewidth contains a vertex that is irrelevant, in the sense that its removal yields an equivalent instance of the problem. The straightforward application of this technique yields algorithms with running time that is quadratic in the size of the input graph. This running time is due to the fact that it takes linear time to detect one irrelevant vertex and the total number of irrelevant vertices to be detected is linear as well. Using advanced techniques, sub-quadratic algorithms have been designed for particular problems, even in general graphs. However, designing a general framework for linear-time algorithms has been open, even for the bounded-genus case. In this paper we introduce a general framework that enables finding in linear time an entire set of irrelevant vertices whose removal yields a bounded-treewidth graph, provided that the input graph has bounded genus. Our technique consists in decomposing any surface-embeddable graph into a tree-structured collection of bounded-treewidth subgraphs where detecting globally irrelevant vertices can be done locally and independently. Our method is applicable to a wide variety of known graph containment or graph modification problems where the irrelevant vertex technique applies. Examples include the (Induced) Minor Folio problem, the (Induced) Disjoint Paths problem, and the $\mathcal{F}$-Minor-Deletion problem.</description>

      <title>Optimal local identifying and local locating-dominating codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13351v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce two new classes of covering codes in graphs for every positive integer $r$. These new codes are called local $r$-identifying and local $r$-locating-dominating codes and they are derived from $r$-identifying and $r$-locating-dominating codes, respectively. We study the sizes of optimal local 1-identifying codes in binary hypercubes. We obtain lower and upper bounds that are asymptotically tight. Together the bounds show that the cost of changing covering codes into local 1-identifying codes is negligible. For some small $n$ optimal constructions are obtained. Moreover, the upper bound is obtained by a linear code construction. Also, we study the densities of optimal local 1-identifying codes and local 1-locating-dominating codes in the infinite square grid, the hexagonal grid, the triangular grid, and the king grid. We prove that seven out of eight of our constructions have optimal densities.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Animals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00841v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we introduce simple structures for the analysis of complex hypergraphs, hypergraph animals. These structures are designed to describe the local node neighbourhoods of nodes in hypergraphs. We establish their relationships to lattice animals and network motifs, and we develop their combinatorial properties for sparse and uncorrelated hypergraphs. We make use of the tight link of hypergraph animals to partition numbers, which opens up a vast mathematical framework for the analysis of hypergraph animals. We then study their abundances in random hypergraphs. Two transferable insights result from this analysis: (i) it establishes the importance of high-cardinality edges in ensembles of random hypergraphs that are inspired by the classical Erd\"os-Reny\'i random graphs; and (ii) there is a close connection between degree and hyperedge cardinality in random hypergraphs that shapes animal abundances and spectra profoundly. Both findings imply that hypergraph animals can have the potential to affect information flow and processing in complex systems. Our analysis of also suggests that we need to spend more effort on investigating and developing suitable conditional ensembles of random hypergraphs that can capture real-world structures and their complex dependency structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A $3$-dimensional polytope $P$ is $k$-equiprojective when the projection of $P$ along any line that is not parallel to a facet of $P$ is a polygon with $k$ vertices. In 1968, Geoffrey Shephard asked for a description of all equiprojective polytopes. It has been shown recently that the number of combinatorial types of $k$-equiprojective polytopes is at least linear as a function of $k$. Here, it is shown that there are at least $k^{3k/2+o(k)}$ such combinatorial types as $k$ goes to infinity. This relies on the Goodman--Pollack lower bound on the number of order types and on new constructions of equiprojective polytopes via Minkowski sums.</description>

      <title>Gotta match 'em all: Solution diversification in graph matching matched filters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13451v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for finding multiple noisily embedded template graphs in a very large background graph. Our method builds upon the graph-matching-matched-filter technique proposed in Sussman et al., with the discovery of multiple diverse matchings being achieved by iteratively penalizing a suitable node-pair similarity matrix in the matched filter algorithm. In addition, we propose algorithmic speed-ups that greatly enhance the scalability of our matched-filter approach. We present theoretical justification of our methodology in the setting of correlated Erdos-Renyi graphs, showing its ability to sequentially discover multiple templates under mild model conditions. We additionally demonstrate our method's utility via extensive experiments both using simulated models and real-world dataset, include human brain connectomes and a large transactional knowledge base.</description>

      <title>Spanning trees in $\mathbb{Z}$-covers of a finite graph and Mahler measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the special value at $u=1$ of Artin-Ihara $L$-functions, we associate to every $\mathbb{Z}$-cover of a finite connected graph a polynomial which we call the \emph{Ihara polynomial}. We show that the number of spanning trees for the finite intermediate graphs of such a cover can be expressed in terms of the Pierce-Lehmer sequence associated to a factor of the Ihara polynomial. This allows us to express the asymptotic growth of the number of spanning trees in terms of the Mahler measure of this polynomial. Specializing to the situation where the base graph is a bouquet or the dumbbell graph gives us back previous results in the literature for circulant and $I$-graphs (including the generalized Petersen graphs). We also express the $p$-adic valuation of the number of spanning trees of the finite intermediate graphs in terms of the $p$-adic Mahler measure of the Ihara polynomial. When applied to a particular $\mathbb{Z}$-cover, our result gives us back Lengyel's calculation of the $p$-adic valuations of Fibonacci numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to provide an explicit basis of the miniversal deformation of a monomial curve defined by a free semigroup -- these curves make up a notable family of complete intersection monomial curves. First, we dispense a general decomposition result of a basis of the miniversal deformation of any complete intersection monomial curve. As a consequence, we explicitly calculate this basis in the particular case of a monomial curve defined from a free semigroup. This explicit computation yields some estimates for the dimension of the moduli space of these family of curves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the geometric and combinatorial effect of smoothing an intersection point in a collection of arcs or curves on a surface. We prove that all taut arcs with fixed endpoints and all taut 1-manifolds with at least two non-disjoint components on an orientable surface with negative Euler characteristic admit a taut smoothing, and also that all taut arcs with free endpoints admit a smoothing that is either taut or becomes taut after removing at most one intersection. We deduce that for every Riemannian metric on a surface, the shortest properly immersed arcs with at least $k$ self-intersections have exactly $k$ self-intersections when the endpoints of the arc are fixed, and at most $k+1$ self-intersections otherwise, and that the arc length spectrum is "coarsely ordered" by self-intersection number. Along the way, we obtain partial analogous results in the case of curves.</description>

      <title>Positive formula for the product of conjugacy classes on the unitary group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The convolution product of two conjugacy classes of the unitary group $U_n$ is described by a probability distribution on the space of central measures. Relating this convolution to the quantum cohomology of Grassmannians and using recent results describing the structure constants of the latter, we give a manifestly positive formula for the density of the probability distribution for the product of generic conjugacy classes. In the same flavor as the hive model of Knutson and Tao, this formula is given in terms of a subtraction-free sum of volumes of explicit polytopes. As a consequence, this expression also provides a positive and explicit formula for the volume of $SU_n$-valued flat connections on the three-holed two dimensional sphere, which was first given by Witten in terms of an infinite sum of characters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the consequences of the Compactness Principle in structural Ramsey theory is that the small Ramsey degrees cannot exceed the corresponding big Ramsey degrees, thereby justifying the choice of adjectives. However, it is unclear what happens in the realm of dual Ramsey degrees due to the lack of the compactness argument that applies to that setting. In this paper we present a framework within which both "direct" and dual Ramsey statements can be stated and reasoned about in a uniform fashion. We introduce the notion of approximability which yields a general compactness argument powerful enough to prove statements about both "direct" and dual Ramsey phenomena. We conclude the paper with an application of the new strategies by generalizing Voigt's $\star$-version of the Infinite Ramsey Theorem to a large class of relational structures and deriving a Ramsey statement for "loose colorings" of enumerated Fra\"{\i}ss\'{e} limits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If a finite set $A$ tiles the integers by translations, it also admits a tiling whose period $M$ has the same prime factors as $|A|$. We prove that the minimal period of such a tiling is bounded by $\exp(c(\log D)^2/\log\log D)$, where $D$ is the diameter of $A$. In the converse direction, given $\epsilon&gt;0$, we construct tilings whose minimal period has the same prime factors as $|A|$ and is bounded from below by $D^{3/2-\epsilon}$. We also discuss the relationship between minimal tiling period estimates and the Coven-Meyerowitz conjecture.</description>

Abstract: We construct the elliptic Miura transformation and use it to obtain the expression of the currents of elliptic corner VOA. We subsequently prove a novel combinatorial formula that is essential for deriving the quadratic relations of the currents. In addition, we give a conjecture that relates the correlation function of the currents of elliptic corner VOA to a certain family of partially symmetric polynomials. The elliptic Macdonald polynomials, constructed recently by Awata-Kanno-Mironov-Morozov-Zenkevich, and Fukuda-Ohkubo-Shiraishi, can be obtained as a particular case of this family.</description>
