      <title>Effective geometry of Bell-network states on a dipole graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bell-network states are a class of entangled states of the geometry that satisfy an area-law for the entanglement entropy in a limit of large spins and are automorphism-invariant, for arbitrary graphs. We present a comprehensive analysis of the effective geometry of Bell-network states on a dipole graph. Our main goal is to provide a detailed characterization of the quantum geometry of a class of diffeomorphism-invariant, area-law states representing homogeneous and isotropic configurations in loop quantum gravity, which may be explored as boundary states for the dynamics of the theory. We found that the average geometry at each node in the dipole graph does not match that of a flat tetrahedron. Instead, the expected values of the geometric observables satisfy relations that are characteristic of spherical tetrahedra. The mean geometry is accompanied by fluctuations with considerable relative dispersion for the dihedral angle, and perfectly correlated for the two nodes.</description>

      <title>The universe is not a Lie, but actually an Hopf, algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper I would like to show how the Deformed Special Relativity family of models -- developed to approach spacetime quantization -- can actually be applied to the description of classical cosmology. I use the bicrossproduct basis of $\kappa$-Poincar\'{e} algebra to describe photon propagation in deSitter classical General Relativity. I show the Hopf algebraic aspects of deSitter model, and give an explicit physical interpretation of $\kappa$-Poincar\'{e} Hopf algebraic features in spacetime. Such an approach allows to unravel some not yet known General Relativistic relations of deSitter cosmology, and reinterpret many future of Quantum Gravity phenomenology as classical properties of maximally symmetric spacetime models.</description>

      <title>On Pseudo $B$-symmetric spacetimes and $f(\mathcal{R})$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article delivers the characterization of a pseudo $B$ symmetric spacetimes and we illustrate that a pseudo $B$ symmetric spacetime admitting Codazzi type of $B$-tensor represents a perfect fluid spacetime and if this spacetime admits the time-like convergence criterion, then the pseudo $B$ symmetric spacetime fulfills cosmic strong energy criterion and contains pure matter. Besides, we find in a pseudo $B$ symmetric spacetime with Codazzi type of $B$-tensor the electric part of the Weyl tensor vanishes and has Riemann and Weyl compatible vector fields. Furthermore, it is established that the chosen spacetime with Codazzi type of $B$-tensor is conformally flat and represents a Robertson-Walker spacetime. Also, we calculate the scale factor $\varPsi (t)$ for these spacetimes in a spatially flat Robertson-Walker spacetime. Finally, we study the impact of this spacetime under $f(R)$ gravity scenario and deduce several energy conditions by considering a new model $f\left(\mathcal{R}\right)= e^{(\alpha \mathcal{R})}-ln(\beta \mathcal{R})$ in which $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are positive constants.</description>

      <title>Horizon quantum mechanics for coherent quantum black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formalism of the horizon quantum mechanics is applied to electrically neutral and spherically symmetric black hole geometries emerging from coherent quantum states of gravity to compute the probability that the matter source is inside the horizon. We find that quantum corrections to the classical horizon radius become significant if the matter core has a size comparable to the Compton length of the constituents and the system is indeed a black hole with probability very close to one unless the core radius is close to the (classical) gravitational radius.</description>

      <title>Transit time of black holes on generalized free energy landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the thermodynamics and kinetics of black hole phase transitions have garnered attention, particularly with the black hole radius being utilized as an order parameter within a generalized free energy landscape. In this framework, the local minima and maxima of the free energy correspond to stable and unstable states, respectively, while other states on the free energy landscape represent fluctuating black holes. Thermal fluctuations enable transitions between these stable states, and this stochastic kinetic behavior can be effectively described by the probabilistic Fokker-Planck equation.The transit time, defined as the time required for transitions or jumps between states, is a crucial physical quantity in phase transition kinetics, as it helps characterize the switching dynamics. By employing a harmonic transition state approximation, we examine the Hawking-Page phase transition and the Reissner-Nordstr\"om-Anti-de Sitter (RNAdS) black hole phase transition within the context of the generalized free energy landscape. We analytically quantify the transit time and its probability distribution for actual transition events, revealing the relationship between the mean transit time and the prefactor of the classical mean first passage time (MFPT). As the mean transit time decreases, the probability distribution narrows, indicating reduced fluctuations in transit time. These phenomena are connected to the topological structure of the generalized free energy landscape, the curvature of the free energy in both stable and unstable states, and the height of the energy barrier. We conclude that, for black hole phase transitions, the transit time serves as a characteristic timescale that reflects the actual jump time between states or to a transition state. Moreover, its relationship with the prefactor allows for a more precise quantification of the MFPT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The worldlines (in harmonic coordinates) of two gravitationally interacting massive bodies at the second post-Minkowskian order are described in explicit form. Both the conservative case and the radiation-reacted case are considered. We use our results to check the changes, during scattering, of the individual momenta, as well as of the total angular momentum. High post-Newtonian order values of the $O(G^2)$ radiation-reaction acceleration components are provided for checks of future post-Newtonian computations.</description>

      <title>Comparing Inflationary Models in Extended Metric-Affine Theories of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study slow-roll inflation as a common feature in Metric-affine Theories of Gravity. In particular, we take into account extended metric, teleparallel and symmetric-teleparallel theories of gravity, based on different geometric invariants, discussing analogies and differences. The analysis for each model is performed in two approaches. First, we focus on the {\it potential-slow-roll approach} by studying the reconstructed potentials for different forms of the extended models related to the considered gravitational theory in the Einstein frame. Secondly, we investigate the {\it Hubble-slow-roll approach} for some conventional inflationary potentials related to the specific extended model in the Jordan frame. We compare all results with cosmic microwave background anisotropy observations coming from Planck 2018 and BICEP2/Keck array satellites in order to find the observational constraints on the parameters space of the models as well as their prediction from the spectral parameters. Eventually, we attempt to present a qualitative comparison between three classes of considered modified gravities using the obtained inflationary results. The aim is to select, in principle, cosmological signatures capable of discriminating among concurrent models in view to point out the representation of gravity, according with geometric invariants, which better addresses the early universe dynamics.</description>

      <title>Corrections to Hawking radiation from asteroid-mass primordial black holes: Numerical evaluation of dissipative effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are theorized objects that may make up some - or all - of the dark matter in the universe. At the lowest allowed masses, Hawking radiation (in the form of photons or electrons and positrons) is the primary tool to search for PBHs. This paper is part of an ongoing series in which we aim to calculate the $O(\alpha)$ corrections to Hawking radiation from asteroid-mass primordial black holes, based on a perturbative quantum electrodymanics (QED) calculation on Schwarzschild background. Silva et. al. (2023) divided the corrections into dissipative and conservative parts; this work focuses on the numerical computation of the dissipative $O(\alpha)$ corrections to the photon spectrum. We generate spectra for primordial black holes of mass $M=1$-$8 \times 10^{21} m_{\rm planck}$. This calculation confirms the expectation that at low energies, the inner bremsstrahlung radiation is the dominant contribution to the Hawking radiation spectrum. At high energies, the main $O(\alpha)$ effect is a suppression of the photon spectrum due to pair production (emitted $\gamma\rightarrow e^+e^-$), but this is small compared to the overall spectrum. We compare the low-energy tail in our curved spacetime QED calculation to several approximation schemes in the literature, and find deviations that could have important implications for constraints from Hawking radiation on primordial black holes as dark matter.</description>

      <title>The particle content of (scalar curvature)$^2$ metric-affine gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linearizing metric-affine~(scalar curvature)$^2$ gravity -- an ``umbrella'' theory that includes as special cases the metrical, Einstein-Cartan, and Weyl quadratic models -- on top of Minkowski spacetime leads to (numerous) accidental~\emph{gauged}~symmetries. This suggests that the analysis of the spectrum on flat background is hindered by strong coupling effects.
  Such undesirable symmetries are absent already at the leading nontrivial order in perturbations on non-flat backgrounds, e.g. de Sitter spacetime, which are the appropriate ones for studying the particle dynamics of all these theories.</description>

      <title>A neural network emulator of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo selection function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterization of search selection effects comprises a core element of gravitational-wave data analysis. Knowledge of selection effects is needed to predict observational prospects for future surveys and is essential in the statistical inference of astrophysical source populations from observed catalogs of compact binary mergers. Although gravitational-wave selection functions can be directly measured via injection campaigns -- the insertion and attempted recovery of simulated signals added to real instrumental data -- such efforts are computationally expensive. Moreover, the inability to interpolate between discrete injections limits the ability to which we can study narrow or discontinuous features in the compact binary population. For this reason, there is a growing need for alternative representations of gravitational-wave selection functions that are computationally cheap to evaluate and can be computed across a continuous range of compact binary parameters. In this paper, we describe one such representation. Using pipeline injections performed during Advanced LIGO &amp; Advanced Virgo's third observing run (O3), we train a neural network emulator for $P(\mathrm{det}|\theta)$, the probability that given a compact binary with parameters is successfully detected, averaged over the course of O3. The emulator captures the dependence of $P(\mathrm{det}|\theta)$ on binary masses, spins, distance, sky position, and orbital orientation, and it is valid for compact binaries with components masses between $1$--$100\,M_\odot$. We test the emulator's ability to produce accurate distributions of detectable events, and demonstrate its use in hierarchical inference of the binary black hole population.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new method to analytically prove global stability in ghost-ridden dynamical systems. Our proposal encompasses all prior results and consequentially extends them. In particular, we show that stability can follow from a conserved quantity that is unbounded from below, contrary to expectation. Novel examples illustrate all our results. Our findings take root on a careful examination of the literature, here comprehensively reviewed for the first time. This work lays the mathematical basis for ulterior extensions to field theory and quantization, and it constitutes a gateway for inter-disciplinary research in dynamics and integrability.</description>

      <title>Four-point correlators in N=4 SYM from AdS$_5$ bubbling geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Four-point correlation functions are observables of significant interest in holographic field theories. We compute an infinite family of four-point correlation functions of operators in short multiplets of 4D N=4 super Yang-Mills theory in the supergravity regime, by studying the quadratic fluctuations around non-trivial supergravity backgrounds. The supergravity backgrounds are supersymmetric smooth geometries in the family derived by Lin, Lunin and Maldacena. The light probes comprise an infinite sequence of Kaluza-Klein harmonics of the dilaton/axion. For generic parameter values, the supergravity backgrounds are dual to heavy CFT states. However we focus on the limit in which the dual CFT states become light single-particle states. The resulting all-light four-point correlators are related by superconformal Ward identities to previously known four-point correlators of half-BPS chiral primary operators. By verifying that the Ward identities are satisfied, we confirm the validity of the supergravity method.</description>

      <title>From de Sitter to de Sitter: A Thermal Approach to Running Vacuum Cosmology and the Non-Canonical Scalar Field Description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entire classical cosmological history between two extreme de Sitter vacuum solutions is discussed based on Einstein's equations and non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The initial non-singular de Sitter state is characterised by a very high energy scale which is equal or smaller than the reduced Planck mass. It is structurally unstable and all the continuous created matter, energy and entropy of the material component comes from the irreversible flow powered by the primeval vacuum energy density. The analytical expression describing the running vacuum is obtained from the thermal approach. It opens a new perspective to solve the old puzzles and current observational challenges plaguing the cosmic concordance model driven by a rigid vacuum. Such a scenario is also modelled through a non-canonical scalar field. It is demonstrated that the resulting scalar field model is shown to be step by step a faithful analytical representation of the thermal running vacuum cosmology.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave signatures of gravito-electromagnetic couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) can undoubtedly serve as a messenger from the early Universe acting as well as a novel probe of the underlying gravity theory. In this work, motivated by one-loop vacuum-polarization effects on curved spacetime, we investigate a gravitational theory with non-minimal curvature-electromagnetic coupling terms of the form $\xi R F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$, where $R$ is the scalar curvature and $F_{\mu\nu}$ the Faraday tensor, which can be responsible for the generation of primordial electromagnetic fields. We study then the GW signatures of such coupling terms deriving in particular for the first time to the best of our knowledge the modified tensor modes equation of motion. Remarkably, we find a universal infrared (IR) frequency scaling $f^5$ of the electromagnetically induced GW (EMIGW) signal, which, depending on the energy scale of inflation, the duration of inflation and reheating as well as the dynamical behaviour of the gauge coupling function $\xi$, can be well within the detection sensitivity bands of GW experiments such as SKA, LISA, ET and BBO, being thus potentially detectable in the future by GW observatories.</description>

      <title>Scant evidence for thawing quintessence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New constraints on the expansion rate of the Universe seem to favor evolving dark energy in the form of thawing quintessence models, i.e., models for which a canonical, minimally coupled scalar field has, at late times, begun to evolve away from potential energy domination. We scrutinize the evidence for thawing quintessence by exploring what it predicts for the equation of state. We show that, in terms of the usual Chevalier-Polarski-Linder parameters, ($w_0$, $w_a$), thawing quintessence is, in fact, only marginally consistent with a compilation of the current data. Despite this, we embrace the possibility that thawing quintessence is dark energy and find constraints on the microphysics of this scenario. We do so in terms of the effective mass $m^2$ and energy scale $V_0$ of the scalar field potential. We are particularly careful to enforce un-informative, flat priors on these parameters so as to minimize their effect on the final posteriors. While the current data favors a large and negative value of $m^2$, when we compare these models to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model we find that there is scant evidence for thawing quintessence.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamical Casimir effect and Unruh entanglement in waveguide QED with parametrically modulated coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study theoretically an array of two-level qubits moving relative to a one-dimensional waveguide. This motion can be implemented mechanically or simulated via the modulation of the couplings between the qubits and the waveguide. When the frequency of this motion approaches twice the qubit resonance frequency, it induces parametric generation of photons and excitation of the qubits. The proposed quantum optomechanical system offers a plethora of possibilities for exploring various quantum electrodynamics phenomena. However, their theoretical analysis is challenging due to the presence of quantum nonlinearity, a continuum of propagating photonic modes, and the excitation of strongly nonequilibrium qubit states, which make many conventional analytical tools inapplicable. To address these challenges, we develop a comprehensive general theoretical framework that incorporates both perturbative diagrammatic techniques and a rigorous master-equation approach. Our calculations reveal several intriguing effects, including the directional dynamical Casimir effect, where momenta of emitted photon pairs are correlated, and the waveguide-mediated collective Unruh effect, where motion drives the qubits to a nontrivial steady state that can be entangled and exhibit phase transitions. Additionally, we examine the radiation back-action on the qubit motion, which becomes particularly pronounced when subradiant modes in the qubit array are excited. The back-action can significantly alter the mechanical spectra, potentially leading to the formation of hybrid phonon-biphoton modes.</description>

      <title>The Cosmological CPT Theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The CPT theorem states that a unitary and Lorentz-invariant theory must also be invariant under a discrete symmetry $\mathbf{CRT}$ which reverses charge, time, and one spatial direction. In this article, we study a $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry group, in which two of the nontrivial symmetries (``Reflection Reality'' and a 180 degree rotation) are implied by Unitarity and Lorentz Invariance respectively, while the third is $\mathbf{CRT}$. (In cosmology, Scale Invariance plays the role of Lorentz Invariance.) This naturally leads to converses of the CPT theorem, as any two of the discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries will imply the third one. Furthermore, in many field theories, the Reflection Reality $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry is actually sufficient to imply the theory is fully unitary, over a generic range of couplings. Building upon previous work on the Cosmological Optical Theorem, we derive non-perturbative reality conditions associated with bulk Reflection Reality (in all flat FLRW models) and $\mathbf{CRT}$ (in de Sitter spacetime), in arbitrary dimensions. Remarkably, this $\mathbf{CRT}$ constraint suffices to fix the phase of all wavefunction coefficients at future infinity (up to a real sign) -- without requiring any analytic continuation, or comparison to past infinity -- although extra care is required in cases where the bulk theory has logarithmic UV or IR divergences. This result has significant implications for de Sitter holography, as it allows us to determine the phases of arbitrary $n$-point functions in the dual CFT.</description>

      <title>Toward exponentially-convergent simulations of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals: A time-domain solver for the scalar Teukolsky equation with singular source terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01349v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational wave signals from extreme mass ratio inspirals are a key target for space-based gravitational wave detectors. These systems are typically modeled as a distributionally-forced Teukolsky equation, where the smaller black hole is treated as a Dirac delta distribution. Time-domain solvers often use regularization approaches that approximate the Dirac distribution that often introduce small length scales and are a source of systematic error, especially near the smaller black hole. We describe a multi-domain discontinuous Galerkin method for solving the distributionally-forced Teukolsky equation that describes scalar fields evolving on a Kerr spacetime. To handle the Dirac delta, we expand the solution in spherical harmonics and recast the sourced Teukolsky equation as a first-order, one-dimensional symmetric hyperbolic system. This allows us to derive the method's numerical flux to correctly account for the Dirac delta. As a result, our method achieves global spectral accuracy even at the source's location. To connect the near field to future null infinity, we use the hyperboloidal layer method, allowing us to supply outer boundary conditions and providing direct access to the far-field waveform. We document several numerical experiments where we test our method, including convergence tests against exact solutions, energy luminosities for circular orbits, the scheme's superconvergence properties at future null infinity, and the late-time tail behavior of the scalar field. We also compare two systems that arise from different choices of the first-order reduction variables, finding that certain choices are numerically problematic in practice. The methods developed here may be beneficial when computing gravitational self-force effects, where the regularization procedure has been developed for the spherical harmonic modes and high accuracy is needed at the Dirac delta's location.</description>

      <title>Ringdowns for black holes with scalar hair: the large mass case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deviations from General Relativity can alter the quasi-normal mode (QNM) ringdown of perturbed black holes. It is known that a shift-symmetric (hence massless) scalar can only introduce black hole hair if it couples to the Gauss-Bonnet invariant, in which case the scalar charge is fixed with respect to the black hole mass and controlled by the strength of that coupling. The charge per unit mass decreases with the mass and can, therefore, be used as a perturbative parameter for black holes that are sufficiently large with respect to the scale suppressing the deviation from General Relativity or the Standard model. We construct an effective field theory scheme for QNMs using this perturbative parameter to capture deviations from Kerr for both the background and the perturbations. We demonstrate that up to second order in the charge per unit mass, QNMs can be calculated by solving standard linearised perturbation equations for the Kerr metric with sources depending on solutions of the same equations up to first order. It follows that corrections to the QNM frequencies are heavily suppressed for sufficiently massive black holes, meaning that LISA is very unlikely to detect any evidence of scalar hair in ringdown signals.</description>

Abstract: We adopt general relativistic ray-tracing (GRRT) schemes to study images of Kerr-MOG black holes surrounded by geometrically thick magnetized equilibrium tori, which belong to steady-state solutions of thick accretion disks within the framework of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD). The black hole possesses an extra dimensionless MOG parameter described its deviation from usual Kerr one. Our results show that the presence of the MOG parameter leads to smaller disks in size, but enhances the total flux density and peak brightness in their images. Combining with observation data of black hole M87* from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), we make a constraint on parameters of the Kerr-MOG black hole and find that the presence of the MOG parameter broadens the allowable range of black hole spin.</description>

      <title>Effect of the spatial curvature on light bending and time delay in curved Einstein-Straus--de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10436v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A method of general applicability has been developed, whereby the null geodesic equations of the Einstein-Straus-de Sitter metric can be integrated simultaneously in terms of the curvature constant $k$. The purpose is to generalize the computation of light deflection and time delay by a spherical mass distribution. Assuming a flat Universe with most recent measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$ and the cosmological constant $\Lambda$, five time delays between the four bright images of the lensed quasar SDSS J1004+4112 have been forecasted and compared to others in the field. In addition, we have reviewed the question of the possible contribution of a positive $\Lambda$ to reduce the light bending, and concluded that the changes are seemingly too small to be appreciable on cosmological scales. The same conclusion has been reached regarding the time delay. Having addressed the question of the effect of the spatial curvature in both closed and open Universe, we have found that the strong lensing is slightly affected by the expected small curvature density $\Omega_{k0}$ of the current Universe within its error bar $|\Omega_{k0}|\lessapprox 0.001$, in such a way that it may safely be neglected. However, it's only if $\Omega_{k0}$ gets quite larger that the effect being noticeable. While it is only theoretically possible for $\Omega_{k0}$ to be higher, it's worthwhile to stress that this should impact the light bending and time delay, causing them to decrease or increase depending upon whether the spatial curvature is positive or negative. Furthermore, one can infer that the observed light deflection and time delay independently, that are found to be significantly deviated from those of the flat Universe, may serve as a useful means to provide constraints on $\Omega _{k0}$, thus making the approach employed in this work more promising than others.</description>

      <title>Evolution of spherical perturbations in the cosmological environment of the Higgs scalar field and an ideal scalar charged fluid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A mathematical model of the evolution of spherical perturbations in a cosmological ideal scalar-charged fluid with scalar Higgs interaction is constructed. A closed mathematical model of linear spherical perturbations in a cosmological medium of a scalar-charged ideal fluid with scalar Higgs interaction is formulated. It is shown that spherical perturbations of the Friedmann metric are possible only in the presence of an isotropic fluid. At singular points of the background cosmological model, perturbations of the metric do not occur and perturbations are described by a vacuum-field model. Exact ones at singular points of the cosmological system are obtained and it is shown that in the case of a stable singular point of the cosmological system, perturbations of the scalar field represent traveling waves, and in the case of an unstable singular point, perturbations represent exponentially growing standing waves. Using numerical modeling, the formation of a stratified halo in the form of growing standing waves is shown.

Abstract: In this paper we studied quantum tunneling of massless and massive particles pertaining to a Schwarzschild black hole in a quintessence background, and explored the consequences emerging from a generalized uncertainty principle (GUP). For the quintessence scenario, we considered two specific cases of $w$, which is the ratio of the pressure and energy density, namely $w=-1/3$ and $w=-2/3$. For the GUP, we used a modified Schwarzschild metric and employed a unique choice of contour integration to compute the tunneling amplitudes. An analysis and comparative study of the respective temperature profiles have been made.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Analysis of Harmonic Maps With Prescribed Singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.14826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the first in a series of two papers to establish the mass-angular momentum inequality for multiple black holes. We study singular harmonic maps from domains of 3-dimensional Euclidean space to the hyperbolic plane having bounded hyperbolic distance to extreme Kerr harmonic maps. We prove that every such harmonic map admits a unique tangent harmonic map at the extreme black hole horizon. The possible tangent maps are classified and shown to be shifted `extreme Kerr' geodesics in the hyperbolic plane that depend on two parameters, one determined by angular momentum and another by conical singularities. In addition, rates of convergence to the tangent map are established. Similarly, expansions in the asymptotically flat end are presented. These results, together with those of Li-Tian [24, 25] and Weinstein [35,36], provide a complete regularity theory for harmonic maps from $\mathbb R^3\setminus z\text{-axis}$ to $\mathbb H^2$ with these prescribed singularities. The analysis is additionally utilized to prove existence of the so called near horizon limit, and to compute the associated near horizon geometries of extreme black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been shown previously, that the spatial thermal variation of a thermal medium can be recast as a variation in the Euclidean metric. It is now extended to temporal variations in temperature, for a non-relativistic thermal bath, which remains in local thermal equilibrium. This is achieved by examining the thermal field theory in a five-dimensional space-time-temperature. The bulk thermodynamic quantity, namely the energy density, is calculated for a neutral scalar field with a time-dependent Hamiltonian. Furthermore, the concept of recasting thermal variations as a variation in the metric is extended to thermal systems in a gravitational field. The Einstein field equations, in the 5-D space-time-temperature, is determined. It is shown that the resulting Ricci scalar can lead to spontaneous symmetry breaking, leading to the Higgs mechanism. In essence, the asymmetry in the distribution of temperature in space-time can translate to spontaneous symmetry breaking of particle fields, in a very strong gravitational field.</description>

      <title>Two of a Kind: Comparing big and small black holes in binaries with gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When modeling the population of merging binary black holes, analyses have generally focused on characterizing the distribution of primary (i.e. more massive) black holes in the binary, while simplistic prescriptions are used for the distribution of secondary masses. However, the secondary mass distribution and its relationship to the primary mass distribution provide a fundamental observational constraint on the formation history of coalescing binary black holes. If both black holes experience similar stellar evolutionary processes prior to collapse, as might be expected in dynamical formation channels, the primary and secondary mass distributions would show similar features. If they follow distinct evolutionary pathways (for example, due to binary interactions that break symmetry between the initially more massive and less massive star), their mass distributions may differ. We present the first analysis of the binary black hole population that explicitly fits for the secondary mass distribution. We find that the data is consistent with a $\sim30\,M_{\odot}$ peak existing only in the distribution of \emph{secondary} rather than primary masses. This would have major implications for our understanding of the formation of these binaries. Alternatively, the data is consistent with the peak existing in both component mass distributions, a possibility not included in most other previous studies. In either case, the peak is observed at $31.4_{-2.6}^{+2.3}\,M_{\odot}$, which is shifted lower than the value obtained in previous analyses of the marginal primary mass distribution, placing this feature in further tension with expectations from a pulsational pair-instability supernova pileup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09844v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review some recent developments in mathematical aspects of relativistic fluids. The goal is to provide a quick entry point to some research topics of current interest that is accessible to graduate students and researchers from adjacent fields, as well as to researches working on broader aspects of relativistic fluid dynamics interested in its mathematical formalism. Instead of complete proofs, which can be found in the published literature, here we focus on the proofs' main ideas and key concepts. After an introduction to the relativistic Euler equations, we cover the following topics: a new wave-transport formulation of the relativistic Euler equations tailored to applications; the problem of shock formation for relativistic Euler; rough (i.e., low-regularity) solutions to the relativistic Euler equations; the relativistic Euler equations with a physical vacuum boundary; relativistic fluids with viscosity. We finish with a discussion of open problems and future directions of research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantization of gravity is widely believed to result in gravitons -- particles of discrete energy that form gravitational waves. But their detection has so far been considered impossible. Here we show that signatures of single graviton exchange can be observed in laboratory experiments. We show that stimulated and spontaneous single-graviton processes can become relevant for massive quantum acoustic resonators and that stimulated absorption can be resolved through continuous sensing of quantum jumps. We analyze the feasibility of observing the exchange of single energy quanta between matter and gravitational waves. Our results show that single graviton signatures are within reach of experiments. In analogy to the discovery of the photo-electric effect for photons, such signatures can provide the first experimental clue of the quantization of gravity.</description>

      <title>Causality Bounds on Dissipative General-Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which a large class of relativistic generalizations of Braginskii's magnetohydrodynamics with shear, bulk, and heat diffusion effects is causal and strongly hyperbolic in the fully nonlinear regime in curved spacetime. We find that causality severely constrains the size of nonideal effects and the onset of kinetic instabilities. Our results are crucial for assessing the regime of validity of fluid dynamical simulations of plasmas near supermassive black holes.</description>

      <title>New probe of non-Gaussianities with primordial black hole induced gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new probe of primordial non-Gaussianities (NGs) through the observation of gravitational waves (GWs) induced by ultra-light ($M_{\text{PBH}}&lt; 10^{9}\rm{g}$) primordial black holes (PBHs). Interestingly enough, the existence of primordial NG can leave imprints on the clustering properties of PBHs and the spectral shape of induced GW signals. Focusing on a scale-dependent local-type NG, we identify a distinct double-peaked GW energy spectrum that, contingent upon $M_{\text{PBH}}$ and the abundance of PBHs at the time of formation, denoted as $\Omega_\mathrm{PBH,f}$, may fall into the frequency bands of upcoming GW observatories, including LISA, ET, SKA, and BBO. Thus, such a signal can serve as a novel portal for probing primordial NGs. Intriguingly, combining BBN bounds on the GW amplitude, we find for the first time the joint limit on the product of the effective non-linearity parameter for the primordial tri-spectrum, denoted by $\bar{\tau}_\mathrm{NL}$, and the primordial curvature perturbation power spectrum $\mathcal{P}_{\cal R}(k)$, which reads as $\bar{\tau}_\mathrm{NL} \mathcal{P}_{\cal R}(k) &lt; 4\times 10^{-20} \Omega^{-17/9}_\mathrm{PBH,f} \left( \frac{M_{\rm PBH}}{10^4\mathrm{g}} \right)^{-17/9}$.</description>

      <title>The cosmological collider in $R^2$ inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starobinsky's $R^2$ inflation manifests a best-fit scenario for the power spectrum of primordial density fluctuations. Observables derived from the slow-roll picture of the $R^2$ model in the Einstein frame relies on the conformal transformation of the metric, which inevitably induces a unique exponential-type couplings of the rolling scalaron with all matter fields during inflation. The "large-field" nature of the $R^2$ model further invokes non-negligible time and scale dependence to the matter sector through such an exponential coupling, modifying not only the dynamics of matter perturbations on superhorizon scales but also their decay rates. In this work, we identify the simplest observable of the cosmological collider physics built in the background of $R^2$ inflation, focusing on the so-called "quantum primordial clock" signals created by the non-local propagation of massive scalar perturbations. Our numerical formalism based on the unique conformal coupling can have extended applications to (quasi-)single-field inflationary models with non-trivial couplings to gravity or models originated from the $f(R)$ modification of gravity.</description>

      <title>A Radical Solution to the Hubble Tension Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08586v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hubble tension has proven to be stubbornly persistent, despite widespread efforts to relax it. As a possible resolution of this problem we propose a radical alternative to the way in which cosmological models are viewed. Specifically, we consider building cosmological models from spaces that exhibit intrinsic symmetries, rather than as space-times with explicit symmetry. This change in perspective allows statistical homogeneity and isotropy to be maintained, while relaxing some strong mathematical constraints that the standard approach imposes. We show that a Hubble tension arises naturally in our new approach, and that (as a corollary) a prediction can be made for the radial component of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations. Our prediction appears to be consistent with the DESI first-year data release, which has otherwise been interpreted as evidence for dynamical dark energy.</description>

      <title>Schwarzschild metric from Scattering Amplitudes to all orders in $G_N$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply a formulation of Einstein's general relativity with only cubic interactions for deriving the metric of a Schwarzschild black hole to all orders in perturbation theory. This cubic interactions formulation coupled to effective worldline action of a massive point particle allows to derive a recursion relation for the form factors of the off-shell graviton emission current. The unique solution to the recursion relation leads to the Schwarzschild black-hole solution in four dimensions. This provides the first derivation of the black hole metric from a matter source to all orders in perturbation theory from an amplitude approach.</description>

      <title>Particle production and hadronization temperature in the massive Schwinger model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the pair production, string breaking, and hadronization of a receding electron-positron pair using the bosonized version of the massive Schwinger model in quantum electrodynamics in 1+1 space-time dimensions. Specifically, we study the dynamics of the electric field in Bjorken coordinates by splitting it into a coherent field and its Gaussian fluctuations. We find that the electric field shows damped oscillations, reflecting pair production. Interestingly, the computation of the asymptotic total particle density per rapidity interval for large masses can be fitted using a Boltzmann factor, where the temperature can be related to the hadronization temperature in QCD. Lastly, we discuss the possibility of an analog quantum simulation of the massive Schwinger model using ultracold atoms, explicitly matching the potential of the Schwinger model to the effective potential for the relative phase of two linearly coupled Bose-Einstein condensates.</description>

      <title>Diversity in Fermi/GBM Gamma Ray Bursts: New insights from Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classification of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has been a long-standing puzzle in high-energy astrophysics. Recent observations challenge the traditional short vs. long viewpoint, where long GRBs are thought to originate from the collapse of massive stars and short GRBs from compact binary mergers. Machine learning (ML) algorithms have been instrumental in addressing this problem, revealing five distinct GRB groups within the Swift/BAT light curve data, two of which are associated with kilonovae (KNe). In this work, we extend our analysis to the Fermi/GBM catalog and identify five clusters using unsupervised ML techniques, consistent with the Swift/BAT results. These five clusters are well separated in fluence-duration plane, hinting at a potential link between fluence, duration and complexities (or structures) in the light curves of GRBs. Further, we confirm two distinct classes of KN-associated GRBs. The presence of GRB 170817A in one of the two KNe-associated clusters lends evidence to the hypothesis that this class of GRBs could potentially be produced by binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. The second KN-associated GRB cluster could potentially originate from NS-BH mergers. Future multimessenger observations of compact binaries in gravitational waves (GWs) and electromagnetic waves can be paramount in understanding these clusters better.</description>

      <title>2D BAO vs 3D BAO: solving the Hubble tension with alternative cosmological models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ordinary 3D Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data are model-dependent, requiring the assumption of a cosmological model to calculate comoving distances during data reduction. Throughout the present-day literature, the assumed model is $\Lambda$CDM. However, this assumption can be inadequate when analyzing alternative cosmologies, potentially biasing the Hubble constant ($H_0$) low, thus contributing to the Hubble tension. To address this issue, we use model-independent 2D BAO data and compare the results to those obtained using 3D BAO data. As a concrete example, we investigate the cosmological models provided by bimetric gravity, a modified theory of gravity that transitions from a negative cosmological constant in the early universe to a positive one in the late universe. By combining 2D BAO data with cosmic microwave background and type Ia supernovae data, we find that the inverse distance ladder in this theory yields a Hubble constant of $H_0 = (71.0 \pm 0.9) \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, consistent with the SH0ES local distance ladder measurement of $H_0 = (73.0 \pm 1.0) \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$. Replacing 2D BAO with 3D BAO results in $H_0 = (68.6 \pm 0.5) \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$ from the inverse distance ladder. We conclude that the choice of BAO data significantly impacts the Hubble tension, with ordinary 3D BAO data exacerbating the tension, while 2D BAO data provides results consistent with the local distance ladder.</description>

      <title>Pulsar timing array sensitivity to anisotropies in the gravitational wave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) observations have recently gathered substantial evidence for the existence of a gravitational wave background in the nHz frequency band. Searching for anisotropies in this signal is key to determining its origin, and in particular to distinguish possible astrophysical from cosmological sources. In this work, we assess the sensitivity of current and future pulsar timing arrays to such anisotropies using the full covariance matrix of pulsar timing delays. While current day pulsar timing arrays can only set mildly informative constraints on the dipole and quadrupole, we show that percent level accuracy for several low multipoles can be achieved in the near future. Moreover, we demonstrate that anisotropies in the gravitational wave background and the Hellings-Downs angular correlation, indicating the presence of GWs, are approximately uncorrelated, and can hence be reconstructed independently. These results can be reproduced with \href{https://github.com/Mauropieroni/fastPTA}{\texttt{fastPTA}}, a publicly available Python code to forecast the constraining power of PTA configurations.</description>
