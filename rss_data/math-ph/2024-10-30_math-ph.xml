      <title>Sharp palindromic criterion for semi-uniform dynamical localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a sharp palindromic argument for general 1D operators, that proves absence of semi-uniform localization in the regime of exponential symmetry-based resonances. This provides the first examples of operators with dynamical localization but no SULE/SUDL, as well as with nearly uniform distribution of centers of localization in absence of SULE. For the almost Mathieu operators, this also leads to a sharp arithmetic criterion for semi-uniformity of dynamical localization in the Diophantine case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss Laplacian spectrum on a finite metric graph with vertex couplings violating the time-reversal invariance. For the class of star graphs we determine, under the condition of a fixed total edge length, the configurations for which the ground state eigenvalue is maximized. Furthermore, for general finite metric graphs we provide upper bounds for all eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Integrability properties and multi-kink solutions of a generalised Fokker-Planck equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse a generalised Fokker-Planck equation by making essential use of its linearisability through a Cole-Hopf transformation. We determine solutions of travelling wave and multi-kink type by resorting to a geometric construction in the regime of small viscosity. The resulting asymptotic solutions are time-dependent Heaviside step functions representing classical (viscous) shock waves. As a result, line segments in the space of independent variables arise as resonance conditions of exponentials and represent shock trajectories. We then discuss fusion and fission dynamics exhibited by the multi-kinks by drawing parallels in terms of shock collisions and scattering processes between particles, which preserve total mass and momentum. Finally, we propose B\"acklund transformations and examine their action on the solutions to the equation under study.</description>

      <title>A spectral localizer approach to strong topological invariants in the mobility gap regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological phases of gapped one-particle Hamiltonians with (anti)-unitary symmetries are classified by strong topological invariants according to the Altland-Zirnbauer table. Those indices are still well-defined in the regime of strong disorder when the spectral gap is replaced by a mobility gap, however, many questions regarding their robustness and existence of topological boundary states are wide open. We apply the recently developed spectral localizer method to prove results on the stability of strong topological invariants under a notion of continuous homotopy that preserves a mobility gap condition. Using the local computability afforded by the spectral localizer we show that for parametrized random families that satisfy a fractional moments bound the probability distribution of the strong topological invariant changes continuously. In particular, for ergodic families the almost sure index must be constant on any path which preserves the mobility gap. Using similar methods, we also prove a result on the delocalization of interface states between two mobility-gapped systems which have differing strong invariants.</description>

      <title>Superintegrability in the interaction of two particles with spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate a research program for the systematic investigation of quantum superintegrable systems involving the interaction of two non-relativistic particles with spin $1/2$ moving in the three-dimensional Euclidean space. In this paper, we focus specifically on such superintegrable systems that allow additional scalar integrals of motion, linear in the momenta. We first identify specific potentials appearing in the Hamiltonian that should be excluded from the analysis, as they can be immediately derived through gauge transformations of the natural Hamiltonian. Next, we construct the most general symmetric scalar operator and derive the determining equations from its commutation with the Hamiltonian. Solving these equations, we obtain 12 new superintegrable systems with spin, along with their corresponding first-order scalar integrals of motion.</description>

      <title>Superselection sectors for posets of von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a commutant-closed collection of von Neumann algebras acting on a common Hilbert space indexed by a poset with an order-reversing involution. We give simple geometric axioms for the poset which allow us to construct a braided tensor category of superselection sectors analogous to the construction of Gabbiani and Fr\"ohlich for conformal nets. For cones in $\mathbb{R}^2$, we weaken our conditions to a bounded spread version of Haag duality and obtain similar results. We show that intertwined nets of algebras have isomorphic braided tensor categories of superselection sectors. Finally, we show that the categories constructed here are equivalent to those constructed by Naaijkens and Ogata for certain 2D quantum spin systems.</description>

      <title>On the stability of solutions to random optimization problems under small perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the Euclidean traveling salesman problem with $n$ random points on the plane. Suppose that one of the points is shifted to a new random location. This gives us a new optimal path. Consider such shifts for each of the $n$ points. Do we get $n$ very different optimal paths? In this article, we show that this is not the case - in fact, the number of truly different paths can be at most $\mathcal{O}(1)$ as $n\to \infty$. The proof is based on a general argument which allows us to prove similar stability results in a number of other settings, such as branching random walk, the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model of mean-field spin glasses, the Edwards-Anderson model of short-range spin glasses, and the Wigner ensemble of random matrices.</description>

      <title>Scaled-up prediction of steady Navier-Stokes equation with component reduced order modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling up new scientific technologies from laboratory to industry often involves demonstrating performance on a larger scale. Computer simulations can accelerate design and predictions in the deployment process, though traditional numerical methods are computationally intractable even for intermediate pilot plant scales. Recently, component reduced order modeling method is developed to tackle this challenge by combining projection reduced order modeling and discontinuous Galerkin domain decomposition. However, while many scientific or engineering applications involve nonlinear physics, this method has been only demonstrated for various linear systems. In this work, the component reduced order modeling method is extended to steady Navier-Stokes flow, with application to general nonlinear physics in view. Large-scale, global domain is decomposed into combination of small-scale unit component. Linear subspaces for flow velocity and pressure are identified via proper orthogonal decomposition over sample snapshots collected at small scale unit component. Velocity bases are augmented with pressure supremizer, in order to satisfy inf-sup condition for stable pressure prediction. Two different nonlinear reduced order modeling methods are employed and compared for efficient evaluation of nonlinear advection: 3rd-order tensor projection operator and empirical quadrature procedure. The proposed method is demonstrated on flow over arrays of five different unit objects, achieving $23$ times faster prediction with less than $4\%$ relative error up to $256$ times larger scale domain than unit components. Furthermore, a numerical experiment with pressure supremizer strongly indicates the need of supremizer for stable pressure prediction. A comparison between tensorial approach and empirical quadrature procedure is performed, which suggests a slight advantage for empirical quadrature procedure.</description>

      <title>Multiple Radial SLE(0) and Classical Calogero-Sutherland System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the multiple radial SLE(0) systems as the deterministic limit of multiple radial SLE($\kappa$) systems.
  As a consequence of domain Markov property and conformal invariance, we derive that a multiple radial SLE($\kappa$) system is characterized by a conformally covariant partition function satisfying the null vector equations--a second-order PDE system. On the other hand, using the Coulomb gas method inspired by conformal field theory, we construct conformally covariant solutions to the null vector equations, which can be classified according to topological link patterns.
  We construct the multiple radial SLE(0) systems from stationary relations by heuristically taking the classical limit of partition functions as $\kappa \rightarrow 0$. By constructing the field integrals of motion for the Loewner dynamics, we show that the traces of multiple radial SLE(0) systems are the horizontal trajectories of an equivalence class of quadratic differentials. These trajectories have limiting ends at the growth points and form a radial link pattern.
  The stationary relations connect the classification of multiple radial SLE(0) systems to the enumeration of critical points of the master function of trigonometric Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ) equations.
  For $\kappa &gt; 0$, the partition functions of multiple radial SLE($\kappa$) systems correspond to eigenstates of the quantum Calogero-Sutherland (CS) Hamiltonian beyond the fermionic states. In the deterministic case of $\kappa=0$, we show that the Loewner dynamics with a common parametrization of capacity, form a special class of classical CS systems, restricted to a submanifold of phase space defined by the Lax matrix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a universal framework for boundary transfer matrices, inspired by Sklyanin's two-row transfer matrix approach for quantum integrable systems with boundary conditions. The main examples arise from quantum symmetric pairs of finite and affine type. As a special case we recover a construction by Kolb in finite type. We review recent work on universal solutions to the reflection equation and highlight several open problems in this field.</description>

      <title>Presentations for the ghost algebra and the label algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ghost algebra is a two-boundary extension of the Temperley-Lieb algebra, constructed recently via a diagrammatic presentation. The existing two-boundary Temperley-Lieb algebra has a basis of two-boundary string diagrams, where the number of strings connected to each boundary must be even. The ghost algebra is similar, but allows this number to be odd, using bookkeeping dots called ghosts to assign a consistent parity to each string endpoint on each boundary. Equivalently, one can discard the ghosts and label each string endpoint with its parity; the resulting algebra is readily generalised to allow any number of possible labels, instead of just odd or even. We call the generalisation the label algebra, and establish a non-diagrammatic presentation for it. A similar presentation for the ghost algebra follows from this.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-body Scars through the Lens of Correlation Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) -- rare eigenstates that evade thermalization -- are typically characterized by their low entanglement entropies compared to surrounding thermal eigenstates. However, due to finite-size effects in systems accessible via exact diagonalization, this measure can be ambiguous. To address this limitation, we propose using the correlation matrix spectrum as an alternative probe to identify QMBS. In cases of exact QMBS with either known analytic expressions or can be captured by various frameworks of QMBS, we find the dimensionality of the null space of the correlation matrix -- an integer value, and thus immune to finite-size effects -- can qualitatively isolate QMBS. Beyond serving as a diagnostic tool, the correlation matrix method enables easy manipulation of the QMBS subspace. For approximate QMBS, such as those in the PXP model, we observe that the correlation matrix spectrum features numerous approximate zero eigenvalues, distinguishing these states. We demonstrate the effectiveness and utility of this method with several paradigmatic QMBS examples.</description>

      <title>A continuous symmetry breaking measure for finite clusters using Jensen-Shannon divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantitative measure of symmetry breaking is introduced that allows the quantification of which symmetries are most strongly broken due to the introduction of some kind of defect in a perfect structure. The method uses a statistical approach based on the Jensen-Shannon divergence. The measure is calculated by comparing the transformed atomic density function with its original. Software code is presented that carries the calculations out numerically using Monte Carlo methods. The behavior of this symmetry breaking measure is tested for various cases including finite size crystallites (where the surfaces break the crystallographic symmetry), atomic displacements from high symmetry positions, and collective motions of atoms due to rotations of rigid octahedra. The approach provides a powerful tool for assessing local symmetry breaking and offers new insights that can help researchers understand how different structural distortions affect different symmetry operations.</description>

Abstract: We study consequences of applying formalism of symplectic geometry to quantum mechanics.

Abstract: We consider the graphical representations of the Ising model on tree-like graphs. We construct a class of graphs on which the loop $\mathrm{O}(1)$ model and then single random current exhibit a non-unique phase transition with respect to the inverse temperature, highlighting the non-monotonicity of both models. It follows from the construction that there exist infinite graphs $\mathbb{G}\subseteq \mathbb{G}'$ such that the uniform even subgraph of $\mathbb{G}'$ percolates and the uniform even subgraph of $\mathbb{G}$ does not. We also show that on the wired $d$-regular tree, the phase transitions of the loop $\mathrm{O}(1)$, the single random current, and the random-cluster models are all unique and coincide.</description>

      <title>Percolation of thick points of the log-correlated Gaussian field in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the set of thick points of the log-correlated Gaussian field contains an unbounded path in sufficiently high dimensions. This contrasts with the two-dimensional case, where Aru, Papon, and Powell (2023) showed that the set of thick points is totally disconnected. This result has an interesting implication for the exponential metric of the log-correlated Gaussian field: in sufficiently high dimensions, when the parameter $\xi$ is large, the set-to-set distance exponent (if it exists) is negative. This suggests that a new phase may emerge for the exponential metric, which does not appear in two dimensions. In addition, we establish similar results for the set of thick points of the branching random walk. As an intermediate result, we also prove that the critical probability for fractal percolation converges to 0 as $d \to \infty$.</description>

      <title>Generalized arcsine laws for a sluggish random walker with subdiffusive growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a simple one dimensional sluggish random walk model with subdiffusive growth. In the continuum hydrodynamic limit, the model corresponds to a particle diffusing on a line with a space dependent diffusion constant D(x)= |x|^{-\alpha} and a drift potential U(x)=|x|^{-\alpha}, where \alpha\geq 0 parametrizes the model. For \alpha=0 it reduces to the standard diffusion, while for \alpha&gt;0 it leads to a slow subdiffusive dynamics with the distance scaling as x\sim t^{\mu} at late times with \mu= 1/(\alpha+2)\leq 1/2. In this paper, we compute exactly, for all \alpha\ge 0, the full probability distributions of three observables for a sluggish walker of duration T starting at the origin: (i) the occupation time t_+ denoting the time spent on the positive side of the origin, (ii) the last passage time t_{\rm l} through the origin before T, and (iii) the time t_M at which the walker is maximally displaced on the positive side of the origin. We show that while for \alpha=0 all three distributions are identical and exhibit the celebrated arcsine laws of L\'evy, they become different from each other for any \alpha&gt;0 and have nontrivial shapes dependent on \alpha. This generalizes the L\'evy's three arcsine laws for normal diffusion (\alpha=0) to the subdiffusive sluggish walker model with a general \alpha\geq 0. Numerical simulations are in excellent agreement with our analytical predictions.</description>

      <title>Modulational Stability of Wave Trains in the Camassa-Holm Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the nonlinear wave modulation of arbitrary amplitude periodic traveling wave solutions of the Camassa-Holm (CH) equation. Slow modulations of wave trains is often described through Whitham's theory of modulations, which at leading order models the slow evolution of the fundamental wave characteristics (such as the wave's frequency, mass and momentum) through a disperionless system of quasi-linear partial differential equations. The modulational stability or instability of such a slowly modulated wave is considered to be determined by the hyperbolicity or ellipticity of this Whitham modulation system of equations. In work by Abenda \&amp; Grava, the Whitham modulation system for the CH equation was derived through averaged Lagrangian methods and was further shown to always be hyperbolic (although strict hyperbolicity may fail). In this work, we provide an independent derivation of the Whitham modulation system for the CH equation through nonlinear WKB / multiple scales expansions. We further provide a rigorous connection between the Whitham modulation equations for the CH equation and the spectral stability of the underlying periodic wave train to localized (i.e. integrable on the line) perturbations. In particular, we prove that the strict hyperbolicity of the Whitham system implies spectral stability in a neighborhood of the origin in the spectral plane, i.e. spectral modulational stability. As an illustration of our theory, we examine the Whitham modulation system for wave trains with asymptotically small oscillations about their total mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove two-term spectral asymptotics for the Riesz means of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian on a Lipschitz domain with Robin boundary conditions. The second term is the same as in the case of Neumann boundary conditions. This is valid for Riesz means of arbitrary positive order. For orders at least one and under additional assumptions on the function determining the boundary conditions we derive leading order asymptotics for the difference between Riesz means of Robin and Neumann eigenvalues.</description>

Abstract: Topologically protected states can be found in physical systems, that show singularities in some energy contour diagram. These singularities can be characterized by winding numbers, defined on a classification surface, which maps physical state parameters. We have found a classification surface, which applies for three-band hamiltonian systems in the same way than standard Bloch surface does for two-band ones. This generalized Bloch surface is universal in the sense that it classifies a very large class of three-band systems, which we have exhaustively studied, finding specific classification surfaces, applying for each one.</description>

      <title>Kinetic derivation of a compressible Leslie--Ericksen equation for rarified calamitic gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nematic ordering describes the phenomenon where anisotropic molecules tend to locally align, like matches in a matchbox. This ordering can arise in solids (as nematic elastomers), liquids (as liquid crystals), and in gases. In the 1940s, Onsager described how nematic ordering can arise in dilute colloidal suspensions from the molecular point of view. However, the kinetic theory of nonspherical molecules has not, thus far, accounted for phenomena relating to the presence of nematic ordering.
  In this work we develop a kinetic theory for the behavior of rarified calamitic (rodlike) gases in the presence of nematic ordering. Building on previous work by Curtiss, we derive from kinetic theory the rate of work hypothesis that forms the starting point for Leslie--Ericksen theory. We incorporate ideas from the variational theory of nematic liquid crystals to create a moment closure that preserves the coupling between the laws of linear and angular momentum. The coupling between these laws is a key feature of our theory, in contrast to the kinetic theory proposed by {Curtiss \&amp; Dahler}, where the couple stress tensor is assumed to be zero. This coupling allows the characterization of anisotropic phenomena arising from the nematic ordering. Furthermore, the theory leads to an energy functional that is a compressible variant of the classical Oseen--Frank energy (with a pressure-dependent Frank constant) and to a compressible analogue of the Leslie--Ericksen equations. The emergence of compressible aspects in the theory for nematic fluids enhances our understanding of these complex systems.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of the finite-temperature sine kernel determinant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06722v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper, we study the asymptotics of the Fredholm determinant $D(x,s)$ of the finite-temperature deformation of the sine kernel, which represents the probability that there is no particles on the interval $(-x/\pi,x/\pi)$ in the bulk scaling limit of the finite-temperature fermion system. The variable $s$ in $D(x,s)$ is related to the temperature. The determinant also corresponds to the finite-temperature correlation function of one dimensional Bose gas. We derive the asymptotics of $D(x,s)$ in several different regimes in the $(x,s)$-plane. A third-order phase transition is observed in the asymptotic expansions as both $x$ and $s$ tend to positive infinity at certain related speed. The phase transition is then shown to be described by an integral involving the Hastings-McLeod solution of the second Painlev\'e equation.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that a pair consisting of a second-order homogeneous Hamiltonian structure in $N$ components and its associated system of conservation laws is in bijective correspondence with an alternating three-form on a $N+2$-dimensional vector space. Additionally, we show that the three-form offers $N+2$ linear equations in the Pl\"ucker coordinates that define the associated line congruence. We utilize these results to characterize systems of conservation laws with second-order structure for $N\leq 4$. We finally comment how to extend this result for $N=6$.</description>

Abstract: It is well-known that two-dimensional Coulomb gases at a special inverse temperature $\beta = 2$ can be analyzed by using the orthogonal polynomial method borrowed from the theory of random matrices. In this paper, such Coulomb gas molecules are studied when they are distributed on an elliptic annulus, and the asymptotic forms of the molecule correlation functions in the thermodynamic limit are evaluated. For that purpose, two-dimensional orthogonality relations of the Chebyshev polynomials on an elliptic annulus are utilized.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The alternating sign matrices-descending plane partitions (ASM-DPP) bijection problem is one of the most intriguing open problems in bijective combinatorics, which is also relevant to integrable combinatorics. The notion of a signed set and a signed bijection is used in [Fischer, I. \&amp; Konvalinka, M., Electron. J. Comb., 27 (2020) 3-35.] to construct a bijection between $\text{ASM}_n \times \text{DPP}_{n-1}$ and $\text{DPP}_n \times \text{ASM}_{n-1}$. Here, we shall construct a more natural alternative to a signed bijection between alternating sign matrices and shifted Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns which is presented in that paper, based on the notion of compatibility which we introduce to measure the naturalness of a signed bijection. In addition, we give a bijective proof for the refined enumeration of an extension of alternating sign matrices with $n+3$ statistics, first proved in [Fischer, I. \&amp; Schreier-Aigner, F., Advances in Mathematics 413 (2023) 108831.].</description>

      <title>Are nonrelativistic ground state $\ell$-boson stars only stable for $\ell=0$ and $\ell=1$?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In previous work we analyzed the linear stability of non-relativistic $\ell$-boson stars with respect to radial modes and showed that ground state configurations are stable with respect to these modes, whereas excited states are unstable. In this work we extend the analysis to non-spherical linear mode perturbations. To this purpose, we expand the wave function in terms of tensor spherical harmonics which allows us to decouple the perturbation equations into a family of radial problems. By using a combination of analytic and numerical methods, we show that ground state configurations with $\ell &gt; 1$ possess exponentially in time growing non-radial modes, whereas only oscillating modes are found for $\ell=0$ and $\ell=1$. This leads us to conjecture that nonrelativistic $\ell$-boson stars in their ground state are stable for $\ell=1$ as well as $\ell=0$, while ground state and excited configurations with $\ell &gt; 1$ are unstable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While extensive studies have been conducted on purely elastic ribbons, in this paper we explore the influence of magnetisation on the deformation of planar ferromagnetic elastic ribbons. We begin the investigation by deriving the leading-order magnetic energy associated with a curved planar ferromagnetic elastic ribbon. The sum of the magnetic and the elastic energy is the total energy of the ribbon. We derive the equilibrium equations by taking the first variation of the total energy. We then systematically determine and analyse solutions to these equilibrium equations under various canonical boundary conditions. We also analyse the stability of the equilibrium solutions. Comparing our findings with the well-studied Euler's Elastica provides insights into the magnetic effects on the deformation behaviour of elastic ribbons. Our analysis contributes to a deeper understanding of the interplay between magnetisation and the mechanical response of planar ferromagnetic structures, and offers valuable insights for both theoretical and practical applications.</description>

Abstract: Q-exchangeable ergodic distributions on the infinite symmetric group were classified by Gnedin-Olshanski (2012). In this paper, we study a specific linear combination of the ergodic measures and call it the Mallows product measure. From a particle system perspective, the Mallows product measure is a reversible stationary blocking measure of the infinite-species ASEP and it is a natural multi-species extension of the Bernoulli product blocking measures of the one-species ASEP. Moreover, the Mallows product measure can be viewed as the universal product blocking measure of interacting particle systems coming from random walks on Hecke algebras.
  For the random infinite permutation distributed according to the Mallows product measure we have computed the joint distribution of its neighboring displacements, as well as several other observables. The key feature of the obtained formulas is their remarkably simple product structure. We project these formulas to ASEP with finitely many species, which in particular recovers a recent result of Adams-Balazs-Jay, and also to ASEP(q,M).
  Our main tools are results of Gnedin-Olshanski about ergodic Mallows measures and shift-invariance symmetries of the stochastic colored six vertex model discovered by Borodin-Gorin-Wheeler and Galashin.</description>

      <title>Critical spin chains and loop models with $U(n)$ symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting with the Ising model, statistical models with global symmetries provide fruitful approaches to interesting physical systems, for example percolation or polymers. These include the $O(n)$ model (symmetry group $O(n)$) and the Potts model (symmetry group $S_Q$). Both models make sense for $n,Q\in \mathbb{C}$ and not just $n,Q\in \mathbb{N}$, and both give rise to a conformal field theory in the critical limit.
  Here, we study similar models based on the unitary group $U(n)$. We focus on the two-dimensional case, where the models can be described either as gases of non-intersecting orientable loops, or as alternating spin chains. This allows us to determine their spectra either by computing a twisted torus partition function, or by studying representations of the walled Brauer algebra.
  In the critical limit, our models give rise to a CFT with global $U(n)$ symmetry, which exists for any $n\in\mathbb{C}$. Its spectrum is similar to those of the $O(n)$ and Potts CFTs, but a bit simpler. We conjecture that the $O(n)$ CFT is a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold of the $U(n)$ CFT, where $\mathbb{Z}_2$ acts as complex conjugation.</description>

      <title>Some Lower Dimensional Quantum Field Theories Reduced from Chern-Simons Gauge Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09473v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study symmetry reductions in the context of Euclidean Chern-Simons gauge theories to obtain lower dimensional field theories. Symmetry reduction in certain gauge theories is a common tool for obtaining explicit soliton solutions. Although pure Chern-Simons theories do not admit solitonic solutions, symmetry reduction still leads to interesting results. We establish relations at the semiclassical regime between pure Chern-Simons theories on $S^3$ and the reduced Quantum Field Theories, based on actions obtained by the symmetry reduction of the Chern-Simons action, spherical symmetry being the prominent one. We also discuss symmetry reductions of Chern-Simons theories on the disk, yielding $BF$-theory in two dimensions, which signals a curious relationship between symmetry reductions and the boundary conformal field theories. Finally, we study the Chern-Simons-Higgs instantons and show that under certain circumstances, the reduced action can formally be viewed as the action of a supersymmetric quantum mechanical model. We discuss the extent to which the reduced actions have a fermionic nature at the level of the partition function.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we investigate estimates about the Laplace operator in heat flows of harmonic maps, focusing outside the singularities through spherical coordinates. These estimates can be used in the general Ericksen--Leslie system to obtain higher-order estimates. We consider the problem subject to the $\mathbb{T}^2$ and $\mathbb{T}^3$ boundary conditions.</description>
