      <title>Multiphase buffering by ammonia sustains sulfate production in atmospheric aerosols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiphase oxidation of sulfur dioxide (SO2) is an important source of sulfate in the atmosphere. There are, however, concerns that protons produced during SO2 oxidation may cause rapid acidification of aerosol water and thereby quickly shut down the fast reactions favored at high pH. Here, we show that the sustainability of sulfate production is controlled by the competing effects of multiphase buffering and acidification, which can be well described by a characteristic buffering time, {\tau}buff. We find that globally, {\tau}buff is long enough (days) to sustain sulfate production over most populated regions, where the acidification of aerosol water is counteracted by the strong buffering effect of NH4+/NH3. Our results highlight the importance of anthropogenic ammonia emissions and pervasive human influences in shaping the chemical environment of the atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference for Stochastic Predictions of Non-Gaussian Systems with Applications in Climate Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Climate change poses significant challenges for accurate climate modeling due to the complexity and variability of non-Gaussian climate systems. To address the complexities of non-Gaussian systems in climate modeling, this thesis proposes a Bayesian framework utilizing the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), and Unscented Particle Filter (UPF) for one-dimensional and two-dimensional stochastic climate models, evaluated with real-world temperature and sea level data. We study these methods under varying conditions, including measurement noise, sample sizes, and observed and hidden variables, to highlight their respective advantages and limitations. Our findings reveal that merely increasing data is insufficient for accurate predictions; instead, selecting appropriate methods is crucial. This research provides insights into issues related to information barrier, curse of dimensionality, prediction variability, and measurement noise quantification, thereby enhancing the application of these techniques in real-world climate scenarios.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Ray Navigation System (CRoNS) for Autonomous Navigation in GPS-Denied Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an era where Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) systems are integral to our technological infrastructure, the increasing prevalence of severe space weather events and the advent of deliberate disruptions such as GPS jamming and spoofing pose significant risks. These challenges are underscored by recent military operations in Ukraine, highlighting the vulnerability of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). In response, we introduce the Cosmic Ray Navigation System (CRoNS). This innovative and resilient alternative utilizes cosmic muon showers for precise location pinpointing, especially in environments where GNSS is compromised or unavailable. CRoNS capitalizes on an economical, distributed network of compact muon sensors deployed across urban landscapes and potentially integrated into mobile devices. These sensors are tasked with continuously monitoring muon flux resulting from extensive air showers (EASs) triggered by the consistent high-energy particle flux entering Earth's atmosphere. A central AI unit synthesizes the collected data, determining EAS parameters to establish a dynamic reference coordinate system that could span cities and even nations. A notable advantage of CRoNS lies in its capability for reliable operation beneath the Earth's surface and in aquatic environments.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Full-scale Riser Responses in Field Conditions Based on Gaussian Mixture Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Offshore slender marine structures experience complex and combined load conditions from waves, current and vessel motions that may result in both wave frequency and vortex shedding response patterns. Field measurements often consist of records of environmental conditions and riser responses, typically with 30-minute intervals. These data can be represented in a high-dimensional parameter space. However, it is difficult to visualize and understand the structural responses, as they are affected by many of these parameters. It becomes easier to identify trends and key parameters if the measurements with the same characteristics can be grouped together. Cluster analysis is an unsupervised learning method, which groups the data based on their relative distance, density of the data space, intervals, or statistical distributions. In the present study, a Gaussian mixture model guided by domain knowledge has been applied to analyze field measurements. Using the 242 measurement events of the Helland-Hansen riser, it is demonstrated that riser responses can be grouped into 12 clusters by the identification of key environmental parameters. This results in an improved understanding of complex structure responses. Furthermore, the cluster results are valuable for evaluating the riser response prediction accuracy.</description>

      <title>Advancing operational PM2.5 forecasting with dual deep neural networks (D-DNet)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PM2.5 forecasting is crucial for public health, air quality management, and policy development. Traditional physics-based models are computationally demanding and slow to adapt to real-time conditions. Deep learning models show potential in efficiency but still suffer from accuracy loss over time due to error accumulation. To address these challenges, we propose a dual deep neural network (D-DNet) prediction and data assimilation system that efficiently integrates real-time observations, ensuring reliable operational forecasting. D-DNet excels in global operational forecasting for PM2.5 and AOD550, maintaining consistent accuracy throughout the entire year of 2019. It demonstrates notably higher efficiency than the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) 4D-Var operational forecasting system while maintaining comparable accuracy. This efficiency benefits ensemble forecasting, uncertainty analysis, and large-scale tasks.</description>
