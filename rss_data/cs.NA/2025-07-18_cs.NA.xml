      <title>Keep the beat going: Automatic drum transcription with momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple, interpretable way to perform automatic drum transcription is by factoring the magnitude spectrogram of a recorded musical piece using a partially fixed nonnegative matrix factorization. There are two natural ways to optimize the nonnegative matrix factorization, including a multiplicative update rule and projected gradient descent with momentum. The methods differ in their empirical accuracies and theoretical convergence guarantees. This paper summarizes the methods and their time complexities, and it applies the methods to the ENST-Drums data set and an original recording from the author's band, evaluating the empirical accuracy with respect to ground-truth drum annotations. The results indicate that projected gradient descent with momentum leads to higher accuracy for a fixed runtime, and it satisfies stronger convergence guarantees.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Efficient Kernel and Polynomial Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified interpolation scheme that combines compactly-supported positive-definite kernels and multivariate polynomials. This unified framework generalizes interpolation with compactly-supported kernels and also classical polynomial least squares approximation. To facilitate the efficient use of this unified interpolation scheme, we present specialized numerical linear algebra procedures that leverage standard matrix factorizations. These procedures allow for efficient computation and storage of the unified interpolant. We also present a modification to the numerical linear algebra that allows us to generalize the application of the unified framework to target functions on manifolds with and without boundary. Our numerical experiments on both Euclidean domains and manifolds indicate that the unified interpolant is superior to polynomial least</description>

      <title>Partitioned Conservative, Variable Step, Second-Order Method for Magneto-hydrodynamics In Els\"asser Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) describes the interaction between electrically conducting fluids and electromagnetic fields. We propose and analyze a symplectic, second-order algorithm for the evolutionary MHD system in Els\"asser variables. We reduce the computational cost of the iterative non-linear solver, at each time step, by partitioning the coupled system into two subproblems of half size, solved in parallel. We prove that the iterations converge linearly, under a time step restriction similar to the one required in the full space-time error analysis. The variable step algorithm unconditionally conserves the energy, cross-helicity and magnetic helicity, and numerical solutions are second-order accurate in the $L^{2}$ and $H^{1}$-norms. The time adaptive mechanism, based on a local truncation error criterion, helps the variable step algorithm balance accuracy and time efficiency. Several numerical tests support the theoretical findings and verify the advantage of time adaptivity.</description>

      <title>DPNO: A Dual Path Architecture For Neural Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as a powerful tool for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) and other complex scientific computing tasks. However, the performance of single operator block is often limited, thus often requiring composition of basic operator blocks to achieve better per-formance. The traditional way of composition is staking those blocks like feedforward neural networks, which may not be very economic considering parameter-efficiency tradeoff. In this pa-per, we propose a novel dual path architecture that significantly enhances the capabilities of basic neural operators. The basic operator block is organized in parallel two paths which are similar with ResNet and DenseNet. By introducing this parallel processing mechanism, our architecture shows a more powerful feature extraction and solution approximation ability compared with the original model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive numerical experi-ments on a variety of PDE problems, including the Burgers' equation, Darcy Flow Equation and the 2d Navier-Stokes equation. The experimental results indicate that on certain standard test cas-es, our model achieves a relative improvement of over 30% compared to the basic model. We also apply this structure on two standard neural operators (DeepONet and FNO) selected from different paradigms, which suggests that the proposed architecture has excellent versatility and offering a promising direction for neural operator structure design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We verify quasi-optimality of the Crouzeix-Raviart FEM for nonlinear problems of $p$-Laplace type. More precisely, we show that the error of the Crouzeix-Raviart FEM with respect to a quasi-norm is bounded from above by a uniformly bounded constant times the best-approximation error plus a data oscillation term. As a byproduct, we verify a novel more localized a priori error estimate for the conforming lowest-order Lagrange FEM.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Langevin midpoint methods using an anticipative Girsanov theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new method for analyzing midpoint discretizations of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), which are frequently used in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for sampling from a target measure $\pi \propto \exp(-V)$. Borrowing techniques from Malliavin calculus, we compute estimates for the Radon-Nikodym derivative for processes on $L^2([0, T); \mathbb{R}^d)$ which may anticipate the Brownian motion, in the sense that they may not be adapted to the filtration at the same time. Applying these to various popular midpoint discretizations, we are able to improve the regularity and cross-regularity results in the literature on sampling methods. We also obtain a query complexity bound of $\widetilde{O}(\frac{\kappa^{5/4} d^{1/4}}{\varepsilon^{1/2}})$ for obtaining a $\varepsilon^2$-accurate sample in $\mathsf{KL}$ divergence, under log-concavity and strong smoothness assumptions for $\nabla^2 V$.</description>

      <title>Adaptive feature capture method for solving partial differential equations with low regularity solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) with low-regularity solutions pose significant challenges for traditional numerical methods, particularly in complex geometries where mesh generation and adaptive refinement become computationally expensive. While deep-learning-based approaches, such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and the Random Feature Method (RFM), offer mesh-free alternatives, they often lack adaptive resolution in critical regions, limiting their accuracy for solutions with steep gradients or singularities. In this work, we propose the Adaptive Feature Capture Method (AFCM), a novel machine learning framework that adaptively redistributes neurons and collocation points in high-gradient regions to enhance local expressive power. Inspired by adaptive moving mesh techniques, AFCM employs the gradient norm of an approximate solution as a monitor function to guide the reinitialization of feature function parameters. This ensures that partition hyperplanes and collocation points cluster where they are most needed, achieving higher resolution without increasing computational overhead. The AFCM extends the capabilities of RFM to handle PDEs with near-singular solutions while preserving its mesh-free efficiency. Numerical experiments demonstrate the method's effectiveness in accurately resolving low-regularity problems, even in complex geometries. By bridging the gap between adaptive mesh refinement and randomized neural networks, AFCM offers a robust and scalable approach for solving challenging PDEs in scientific and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>High Performance Parallel Solvers for the time-harmonic Maxwell Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the numerical solution of large scale time-harmonic Maxwell equations. To this day, this problem remains difficult, in particular because the equations are neither Hermitian nor semi-definite. Our approach is to compare different strategies for solving this set of equations with preconditioners that are available either in PETSc, MUMPS, or in hypre. Four different preconditioners are considered. The first is the sparse approximate inverse, which is often applied to electromagnetic problems. The second is Restricted Additive Schwarz, a domain decomposition preconditioner. The third is the Hiptmair-Xu preconditioner which is tailored to the positive Maxwell equations, a nearby problem. The final preconditioner is MUMPS's Block Low-Rank method, a compressed block procedure. We also compare the performance of this method to the standard LU factorization technique, which is a direct solver. Performance with respect to the mesh size, the number of CPU cores, the wavelength and the physical size of the domain are considered. This work in progress yields temporary conclusions in favour of the Hiptmair-Xu and the Block Low-Rank preconditioners.</description>

      <title>Stability of lattice Boltzmann schemes for initial boundary value problems in raw formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stability of one-dimensional linear scalar lattice Boltzmann schemes for hyperbolic equations with respect to boundary data. Our approach is based on the original raw algorithm on several unknowns, thereby avoiding the need for a transformation into an equivalent scalar formulation-a challenging process in presence of boundaries. To address different behaviors exhibited by the numerical scheme, we introduce appropriate notions of strong stability. They account for the potential absence of a continuous extension of the stable vector bundle associated with the bulk scheme on the unit circle for certain components. Rather than developing a general theory, complicated by the fact that discrete boundaries in lattice Boltzmann schemes are inherently characteristic, we focus on strong stability-instability for methods whose characteristic equations have stencils of breadth one to the left. In this context, we study three representative schemes. These are endowed with various boundary conditions drawn from the literature, and our theoretical results are supported by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Generalized Scattering Matrix Framework for Modeling Implantable Antennas in Multilayered Spherical Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified and efficient framework for analyzing antennas embedded in spherically stratified media -- a model broadly applicable to implantable antennas in biomedical systems and radome-enclosed antennas in engineering applications. The proposed method decouples the modeling of the antenna and its surrounding medium by combining the antenna's free-space generalized scattering matrix (GSM) with a set of extended spherical scattering operators (SSOs) that rigorously capture the electromagnetic interactions with multilayered spherical environments. This decoupling enables rapid reevaluation under arbitrary material variations without re-simulating the antenna, offering substantial computational advantages over traditional dyadic Green's function (DGF)-based MoM approaches. The framework supports a wide range of spherical media, including radially inhomogeneous and uniaxially anisotropic layers. Extensive case studies demonstrate excellent agreement with full-wave and DGF-based solutions, confirming the method's accuracy, generality, and scalability. Code implementations are provided to facilitate adoption and future development.</description>

      <title>On the efficiency of a posteriori error estimators for parabolic partial differential equations in the energy norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the model problem of the heat equation discretized by an implicit Euler method in time and a conforming finite element method in space, we prove the efficiency of a posteriori error estimators with respect to the energy norm of the error, when considering the numerical solution as the average between the usual continuous piecewise affine-in-time and piecewise constant-in-time reconstructions. This illustrates how the efficiency of the estimators is not only possibly dependent on the choice of norm, but also on the choice of notion of numerical solution.</description>

      <title>Well-balanced path-conservative discontinuous Galerkin methods with equilibrium preserving space for shallow water linearized moment equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents high-order, well-balanced, path-conservative discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for the shallow water linearized moment equations (SWLME), designed to preserve both still and moving water equilibrium states. Unlike the multi-layer shallow water equations, which model vertical velocity variations using multiple distinct layers, the SWLME employs a polynomial expansion of velocity profiles with up to $N$ moments. This approach enables a more detailed representation of vertical momentum transfer and complex velocity profiles while retaining hyperbolicity. However, the presence of non-conservative terms and complex steady-state structures introduces significant numerical challenges. Addressing these challenges, we develop path-conservative DG schemes grounded in the Dal Maso-LeFloch-Murat (DLM) theory for non-conservative products. Our method balances flux gradients, non-conservative terms, and source terms through equilibrium-preserving spaces. For the still water equilibrium, we reformulate the equations into a quasilinear form that eliminates source terms, inherently preserving steady states. For the moving water equilibrium, we extend the DG method by transforming conservative variables into equilibrium variables and employing linear segment paths. Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve exact equilibrium preservation while maintaining high-order accuracy, even in scenarios with vertical velocity variations and complex topographies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present work revisits and provides a new approach on a result by Charles Ballantine, on the factorization of a square matrix with positive determinant into a product of positive definite factors. {\em Ballantine-type} factorizations, that bound the number of positive definite factors, proved central in solving a basic, yet elusive control problem--the strong controllability of a linear system via control in the form of state feedback. Ballantine's result transcends control engineering, and highlights the little appreciated fact that rotations can be realized by the successive application of irrotational motions. Our approach is constructive and is based on the theory of optimal mass transport, specifically, it relates successive rotations of Gaussian distributions to corresponding optimal transport maps that constitute the sought factors.</description>

      <title>Improving physics-informed neural network extrapolation via transfer learning and adaptive activation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are deep learning models that incorporate the governing physical laws of a system into the learning process, making them well-suited for solving complex scientific and engineering problems. Recently, PINNs have gained widespread attention as a powerful framework for combining physical principles with data-driven modeling to improve prediction accuracy. Despite their successes, however, PINNs often exhibit poor extrapolation performance outside the training domain and are highly sensitive to the choice of activation functions (AFs). In this paper, we introduce a transfer learning (TL) method to improve the extrapolation capability of PINNs. Our approach applies transfer learning (TL) within an extended training domain, using only a small number of carefully selected collocation points. Additionally, we propose an adaptive AF that takes the form of a linear combination of standard AFs, which improves both the robustness and accuracy of the model. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that our method achieves an average of 40% reduction in relative L2 error and an average of 50% reduction in mean absolute error in the extrapolation domain, all without a significant increase in computational cost.

      <description>arXiv:2507.12729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\star_M$-family of tensor-tensor products is a framework which generalizes many properties from linear algebra to third order tensors. Here, we investigate positive semidefiniteness and semidefinite programming under the $\star_M$-product. Critical to our investigation is a connection between the choice of matrix M in the $\star_M$-product and the representation theory of an underlying group action. Using this framework, third order tensors equipped with the $\star_M$-product are a natural setting for the study of invariant semidefinite programs. As applications of the M-SDP framework, we provide a characterization of certain nonnegative quadratic forms and solve low-rank tensor completion problems.</description>

      <title>RONOM: Reduced-Order Neural Operator Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-dependent partial differential equations are ubiquitous in physics-based modeling, but they remain computationally intensive in many-query scenarios, such as real-time forecasting, optimal control, and uncertainty quantification. Reduced-order modeling (ROM) addresses these challenges by constructing a low-dimensional surrogate model but relies on a fixed discretization, which limits flexibility across varying meshes during evaluation. Operator learning approaches, such as neural operators, offer an alternative by parameterizing mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces, enabling adaptation to data across different resolutions. Whereas ROM provides rigorous numerical error estimates, neural operator learning largely focuses on discretization convergence and invariance without quantifying the error between the infinite-dimensional and the discretized operators. This work introduces the reduced-order neural operator modeling (RONOM) framework, which bridges concepts from ROM and operator learning. We establish a discretization error bound analogous to those in ROM, and get insights into RONOM's discretization convergence and discretization robustness. Moreover, two numerical examples are presented that compare RONOM to existing neural operators for solving partial differential equations. The results demonstrate that RONOM using standard vector-to-vector neural networks achieves comparable performance in input generalization and superior performance in both spatial super-resolution and discretization robustness, while also offering novel insights into temporal super-resolution scenarios.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Ground Metric Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data classification without access to labeled samples remains a challenging problem. It usually depends on an appropriately chosen distance between features, a topic addressed in metric learning. Recently, Huizing, Cantini and Peyr\'e proposed to simultaneously learn optimal transport (OT) cost matrices between samples and features of the dataset. This leads to the task of finding positive eigenvectors of a certain nonlinear function that maps cost matrices to OT distances. Having this basic idea in mind, we consider both the algorithmic and the modeling part of unsupervised metric learning. First, we examine appropriate algorithms and their convergence. In particular, we propose to use the stochastic random function iteration algorithm and prove that it converges linearly for our setting, although our operators are not paracontractive as it was required for convergence so far. Second, we ask the natural question if the OT distance can be replaced by other distances. We show how Mahalanobis-like distances fit into our considerations. Further, we examine an approach via graph Laplacians. In contrast to the previous settings, we have just to deal with linear functions in the wanted matrices here, so that simple algorithms from linear algebra can be applied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use machine learning to search for examples of Z/2 eigenfunctions on the 2-sphere. For this we created a multivalued version of a feedforward deep neural network, and we implemented it using the JAX library. We found Z/2 eigenfunctions for three cases: In the first two cases we fixed the branch points at the vertices of a tetrahedron and at a cube respectively. In a third case, we allowed the AI to move the branch points around and, in the end, it positioned the branch points at the vertices of a squashed tetrahedron.</description>

      <title>N Bugs on a Circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe and analyze a generalization of the classic ``Four Bugs on a Square'' cyclic pursuit problem. Instead of allowing the bugs to spiral towards one another, we constrain $N$ bugs to the perimeter of the unit circle. Depending on their configuration, each bug moves either clockwise or counterclockwise with a constant angular speed, or remains stationary. Unlike the original problem where bugs always coalesce, this generalization produces three possible steady states: all bugs coalescing to a single point, clusters of bugs located at two antipodal points, or bugs entering a stable infinite chase cycle where they never meet. We analyze the stability of these steady states and calculate the probability that randomly initialized bugs reach each state. For $N \leq 4$, we derive exact analytical expressions for these probabilities. For larger values, we employ Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the probability of coalescing, finding it approximately follows an inverse square root relationship with the number of bugs. This generalization reveals rich dynamical behaviors that are absent in the classic problem. Our analysis provides insight into how restricting the bugs to the circle's perimeter fundamentally alters the long-term behavior of pursuing agents compared to unrestricted pursuit problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13189v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixed methods for linear elasticity with strongly symmetric stresses of lowest order are studied in this paper. On each simplex, the stress space has piecewise linear components with respect to its Alfeld split (which connects the vertices to barycenter), generalizing the Johnson--Mercier two-dimensional element to higher dimensions. Further reductions in the stress space in the three-dimensional case (to 24 degrees of freedom per tetrahedron) are possible when the displacement space is reduced to local rigid displacements. Proofs of optimal error estimates of numerical solutions and improved error estimates via postprocessing and the duality argument are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces linear approximants tailored to handle point-valued noisy data. A key innovation lies in determining the approximant coefficients by solving an optimization problem aimed at minimizing the noise variance. The study addresses the general case, allowing for noise correlation among data with a non-uniform distribution. In fact, we show that the subdivision rules proposed in [S. L\'opez-Ure\~na and D. F. Y\'a\~nez, J. Sci. Comput., 100(1) (2024)] are optimal for uncorrelated noise with non-uniform variance. Numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of these optimal approximants compared to other ones.</description>

      <title>A variational approach to the analysis of the continuous space-time FEM for the wave equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a stability and convergence analysis of the space-time continuous finite element method for the Hamiltonian formulation of the wave equation. More precisely, we prove a continuous dependence of the discrete solution on the data in a $C^0([0, T]; X)$-type energy norm, which does not require any restriction on the meshsize or the time steps. Such stability estimates are then used to derive a priori error estimates with quasi-optimal convergence rates, where a suitable treatment of possible nonhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions is pivotal to avoid loss of accuracy. Moreover, based on the properties of a postprocessed approximation, we derive a constant-free, reliable a posteriori error estimate in the $C^0([0, T]; L^2(\Omega))$ norm for the semidiscrete-in-time formulation. Several numerical experiments are presented to validate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>The Multiphase Cubic MARS method for Fourth- and Higher-order Interface Tracking of Two or More Materials with Arbitrarily Complex Topology and Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For interface tracking of an arbitrary number of materials in two dimensions, we propose a multiphase cubic MARS method that
  (a) accurately and efficiently represents the topology and geometry of the interface via graphs, cycles, and cubic splines,
  (b) maintains an $(r,h)$-regularity condition of the interface so that the distance between any pair of adjacent markers is within a user-specified range that may vary according to the local curvature,
  (c) applies to multiple materials with arbitrarily complex topology and geometry, and
  (d) achieves fourth-, sixth-, and eighth-order accuracy both in time and in space. In particular, all possible types of junctions, which pose challenges to VOF methods and level-set methods, are handled with ease.
  The fourth- and higher-order convergence rates of the proposed method are proven under the MARS framework. Results of classic benchmark tests confirm the analysis and demonstrate the superior accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>High-order Gauss-Legendre methods admit a composition representation and a conjugate-symplectic counterpart</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most classical pairs of symplectic and conjugate-symplectic schemes is given by the Midpoint method (the Gauss-Runge-Kutta method of order 2) and the Trapezoidal rule. These can be interpreted as compositions of the Implicit and Explicit Euler methods, taken in direct and reverse order, respectively. This naturally raises the question of whether a similar composition structure exists for higher-order Gauss-Legendre methods. In this paper, we provide a positive answer by first examining the fourth-order case and then outlining a generalization to higher orders.</description>

      <title>A Novel Homotopy Perturbation Sumudu Transform Method for Nonlinear Fractional PDEs: Applications and Comparative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces the Homotopy Perturbation Sumudu Transform Method (HPSTM), a novel hybrid approach combining the Sumudu transform with homotopy perturbation to solve nonlinear fractional partial differential equations (FPDEs), including fractional porous medium, heat transfer, and Fisher equations, using the Caputo fractional derivative. HPSTM leverages the linearity-preserving properties of the Sumudu transform and the flexibility of homotopy perturbation, achieving faster convergence than Laplace-HPM or Elzaki-HPM for strongly nonlinear FPDEs. Series solutions yield absolute errors as low as $3.12 \times 10^{-3}$ for $\alpha = 0.9$, with computational times averaging 0.5 seconds per example using 5 series terms on standard hardware. Solutions are validated against exact solutions, Adomian Decomposition Method (ADM), radial basis function (RBF) meshless method, Variational Iteration Method (VIM), Finite Difference Method (FDM), and a spectral method. Numerical examples, sensitivity analysis, and graphical representations for $\alpha = 1.0, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7$ confirm HPSTM's accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. Limitations include challenges with high-order nonlinearities and multi-dimensional domains. HPSTM shows promise for applications in modeling fluid flow in porous media, heat conduction in complex materials, and biological population dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We propose and study a Particle-In-Cell (PIC) method based on the Crank-Nicolson time discretization for the Vlasov-Poisson system with a strong and inhomogeneous external magnetic field with fixed direction, where we focus on the motion of particles in the plane orthogonal to the magnetic field (so-called poloidal directions). In this regime, the time step can be subject to stability constraints related to the smallness of Larmor radius and plasma frequency [21]. To avoid this limitation, our approach is based on numerical schemes [9, 10, 12], providing a consistent PIC discretization of the guiding-center system taking into account variations of the magnetic field. We carry out some theoretical proofs and perform several numerical experiments to validate the method and its underlying concepts</description>

These constants are crucial in analyzing interpolation errors, particularly those associated with the Finite Element Method. In this study, we proved boundness via the numerical verification method and asymptotic analysis.

      <title>Approximation Rates for Shallow ReLU$^k$ Neural Networks on Sobolev Spaces via the Radon Transform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ be a bounded domain. We consider the problem of how efficiently shallow neural networks with the ReLU$^k$ activation function can approximate functions from Sobolev spaces $W^s(L_p(\Omega))$ with error measured in the $L_q(\Omega)$-norm. Utilizing the Radon transform and recent results from discrepancy theory, we provide a simple proof of nearly optimal approximation rates in a variety of cases, including when $q\leq p$, $p\geq 2$, and $s \leq k + (d+1)/2$. The rates we derive are optimal up to logarithmic factors, and significantly generalize existing results. An interesting consequence is that the adaptivity of shallow ReLU$^k$ neural networks enables them to obtain optimal approximation rates for smoothness up to order $s = k + (d+1)/2$, even though they represent piecewise polynomials of fixed degree $k$.</description>

      <title>Multiple solutions to the static forward free-boundary Grad-Shafranov problem on MAST-U</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05674v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Grad-Shafranov (GS) equation is a nonlinear elliptic partial differential equation that governs the ideal magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium of a tokamak plasma. Previous studies have demonstrated the existence of multiple solutions to the GS equation when solved in idealistic geometries with simplified plasma current density profiles and boundary conditions. Until now, the question of whether multiple equilibria might exist in real-world tokamak geometries with more complex current density profiles and integral free-boundary conditions (commonly used in production-level equilibrium codes) has remained unanswered. In this work, we discover multiple solutions to the static forward free-boundary GS problem in the MAST-U tokamak geometry using the validated evolutive equilibrium solver FreeGSNKE and the deflated continuation algorithm. By varying the plasma current, current density profile coefficients, or coil currents in the GS equation, we identify and characterise distinct equilibrium solutions, including both deeply and more shallowly confined plasma states. We suggest that the existence of even more equilibria is likely prohibited by the restrictive nature of the integral free-boundary condition, which globally couples poloidal fluxes on the computational boundary with those on the interior. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for wider equilibrium modelling and emphasise the need to explore whether multiple solutions are present in other equilibrium codes and tokamaks, as well as their potential impact on downstream simulations that rely on GS equilibria.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce just-in-time (JIT) compilation to the integral kernels for Gaussian-type orbitals (GTOs) to enhance the efficiency of electron repulsion integral computations. For Coulomb and exchange (JK) matrices, JIT-based algorithms yield a 2x speedup for the small 6-31G* basis set over GPU4PySCF v1.4 on an NVIDIA A100-80G GPU. By incorporating a novel algorithm designed for orbitals with high angular momentum, the efficiency of JK evaluations with the large def2-TZVPP basis set is improved by up to 4x. The core CUDA implementation is compact, comprising only ~1,000 lines of code, including support for single-precision arithmetic. Furthermore, the single-precision implementation achieves a 3x speedup over the previous state-of-the-art.</description>
