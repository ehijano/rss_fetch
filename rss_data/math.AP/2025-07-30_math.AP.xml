      <title>Comparison principle for Singular Fractional $ g- $Laplacian Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a novel comparison principle of independent interest and prove the uniqueness of weak solutions within the local Orlicz--Sobolev space framework, for the following class of fractional elliptic problems:
  \begin{equation*}
  (-\Delta)^{s}_{g} u = f(x) u^{-\alpha} + k(x) u^{\beta}, \quad u &gt; 0 \quad \text{in } \Omega; \quad u = 0 \quad \text{in } \mathbb{R}^{N} \setminus \Omega,
  \end{equation*}
  where \( \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{N} \) is a smooth bounded domain, \( \alpha &gt; 0 \), and \( \beta &gt; 0 \) satisfies a suitable upper bound. Here, \( (-\Delta)^{s}_{g} \) denotes the fractional \( g \)-Laplacian, with \( g \) being the derivative of a Young function \( G \). The function \( f \) is assumed to be nontrivial, while \( k \) is a positive function, and both \( f \) and \( k \) are assumed to lie in suitable Orlicz spaces. Our analysis relies on a refined variational approach that incorporates a \( G \)-fractional version of the D\'iaz--Saa inequality together with a \( G \)-fractional analogue of Picone's identity. These tools, which are of independent interest, also play a key role in the study of simplicity of eigenvalues, Sturmian-type comparison results, Hardy-type inequalities, and related topics.</description>

      <title>Reiterated $\Sigma$-Convergence In Orlicz Setting and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of reiterated $\Sigma$-convergence (and more generally of multiscale $\Sigma$-convergence) is extended to framework of Orlicz-Sobolev spaces, in order to deals with homogenization of multiscales problems in general deterministic setting and whose solutions leads in this type of spaces. This concept relies on the notion of reiterated homogenization supralgebra that we will assumed being ergodic. An application to the deterministic reiterated homogenization of nonlinear degenerate elliptic operators with nonstandard growth is given and some concrete homogenization problems following varied structure hypothesis are deduce from this latter.</description>

      <title>Mean field limit for interacting systems on co-evolving networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interacting particle systems are in frequent use to model collective behaviour in various situations and applications. For many systems, the interaction between the agents is restricted to an underlying network structure and often, the latter also evolves in time with its dynamics coupled to the evolution of the particles. Due to their relevance for applications such systems on adaptive or co-evolutionary networks have received increasing interest in recent years. In particular, a fundamental question concerns the behaviour of the system in the infinite particle limit. In this work we provide a mean-field description for a general particle system which exhibits non-locality in time (memory). The result applies particularly to a large class of systems on co-evolving networks including non-linear weight dynamics.</description>

      <title>Stability of Large-Amplitude Viscous Shock Under Periodic Perturbation for 1-d Viscoelasticity with Non-Convex Constitutive Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the large-time behavior of the viscous shock profile for the one-dimensional system of viscoelasticity, subject to initial perturbations that approach space-periodic functions at far fields. We specifically address the case with non-convex constitutive stress relations and non-degenerate Lax's shock. Under the assumptions of suitably small initial perturbations satisfying a zero-mass type condition, we prove that the solution of the system converges to a viscous shock profile with a shift, which is partially determined by the space-periodic perturbation. Notably, our result imposes no amplitude restrictions on the viscous shock waves. This work extends the result of Kawashima-Matsumura (\textit{Commun. Pure Appl. Math.} \textbf{47}, 1994) by simultaneously handling both large-amplitude shocks and space-periodic perturbations, while also generalizing the result of Huang-Yuan (\textit{Commun. Math. Phys.} \textbf{387}, 2021) by allowing for a non-convex constitutive relation. The key ingredient of proof is decomposing the large-amplitude shock wave into small-amplitude shocks and, for each, introducing suitable transform and weight functions to counteract the adverse effects of non-convex constitutive relations encountered during weighted energy estimates on the system in effective velocity and deformation gradient variables.</description>

      <title>The parabolic Harnack inequality on non-local Dirichlet spaces in the view of pure analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides the general theory on parabolic Harnack inequalities (PHI, for short) for regular Dirichlet forms without killing part. We prove PHI by pure analytic methods, using both Nash and Moser approaches, and yield some important properties contained in PHI. Combining our recent result on weak Harnack inequalities, we greatly enlarge the list of equivalent characterizations of PHI.</description>

      <title>Existence analysis of a three-species memristor drift-diffusion system coupled to electric networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of global weak solutions to a partial-differential-algebraic system is proved. The system consists of the drift-diffusion equations for the electron, hole, and oxide vacancy densities in a memristor device, the Poisson equation for the electric potential, and the differential-algebraic equations for an electric network. The memristor device is modeled by a two-dimensional bounded domain, and mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions for the electron and hole densities as well as the potential are imposed. The coupling is realized via the total current through the memristor terminal and the network node potentials at the terminals. The network equations are decomposed in a differential and an algebraic part. The existence proof is based on the Leray-Schauder fixed-point theorem, a priori estimates coming from the free energy inequality, and a logarithmic-type Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality. It is shown, under suitable assumptions, that the solutions are bounded and strictly positive.</description>

      <title>The conformal logarithmic Laplacian on the sphere: Yamabe-type problems and Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the conformal logarithmic Laplacian on the sphere, an explicit singular integral operator that arises as the derivative (with respect to the order parameter) of the conformal fractional Laplacian at zero. Our analysis provides a detailed investigation of its spectral properties, its conformal invariance, and the associated \(Q\)-curvature problem. Furthermore, we establish a precise connection between this operator on the sphere and the logarithmic Laplacian in \(\mathbb{R}^N\) via stereographic projection. This correspondence bridges classification results for two Yamabe-type problems previously studied in the literature, extending one of them to the weak setting. To this end, we introduce a Hilbert space that serves as the logarithmic counterpart of the homogeneous fractional Sobolev space, offering a natural functional framework for the variational study of logarithmic-type equations in unbounded domains.</description>

      <title>Travelling front solutions in a spatially heterogeneous reaction-diffusion system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a two-component reaction-diffusion system with a slow-fast structure and spatially varying coefficients $ f_1 $ and $ f_2 $ appearing in the slow equation. Under mild boundedness and regularity conditions on $ f_1 $ and $ f_2 $ the system is shown to exhibit bi-stability in the form of two stable stationary heterogeneous background states. These background states can be connected by stationary and travelling front solutions. Travelling fronts feature an interface that moves with a non-uniform speed through the motionless spatially varying background states it connects. As a result, unlike classical travelling waves, these fronts are not stationary in any co-moving frame. We construct both the background states and stationary fronts using an extension of Fenichel theory to the non-compact case. Additionally, we establish the existence of travelling front solutions and derive a leading-order expression for the dynamic position of the moving interface through a non-autonomous spatial dynamics approach. This expression takes the form of a delay-differential equation, and its accuracy is validated through numerical simulations. A key contribution of our work lies in the general treatment of $ f_1 $ and $ f_2 $, which are neither (necessarily) asymptotically small nor restricted to specific forms such as periodic or localised structures. Furthermore, our derivation of the front position formula circumvents the traditional reliance on spectral analysis, enabling us to describe front dynamics beyond bifurcations from stationary fronts. This approach has the potential to be extended to other settings in which spectral properties at onset preclude conventional reduction techniques.</description>

      <title>Weak solutions of a viscous model for fluid-bubbles interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a system of Navier-Stokes type that describes the dynamics of several spherical bubbles of gas in a liquid. It is derived from a more complete model, where the bubbles are seen as inclusions of gas of homogeneous barotropic pressure with free surfaces. The usual condition of continuity of the stress is relaxed in order to preserve the sphericity of the bubbles through time. We construct weak solutions \`a la Leray for this relaxed system, up to collision between the bubbles. Although these solutions are reminiscent of weak solutions for fluid-solid interaction systems, accounting for the compression/dilation of the bubbles creates new and significant mathematical difficulties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the asymptotic behavior of the spreading speeds of Fisher-KPP equations in rapidly and slowly varying almost periodic settings respectively. Thanks to the variational formula for the spreading speeds involving generalized principal eigenvalue, we are able to concentrate on the homogenization problem of certain Hamilton-Jacobi equations. We will present also the limits and the convergence rate of the spreading speeds. At last, we will consider the effect on the spreading speeds after adding a fixed reaction term.</description>

Abstract: We establish a new integration by parts formula for the regional fractional laplacian $(-\Delta)^s_\Omega$ in bounded open sets of class $C^2$. As a direct application, we prove that weak solutions to the corresponding Dirichlet problem satisfy a Pohozaev-like identity with an explicit remainder term. We apply the later to eigenvalue problems in the unit ball and discuss its potential use in establishing boundary-type unique continuation properties.</description>

      <title>Elastic rigid rod in an expanding universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the motion of a rigid elastic rod, initially set in its relaxed state along a spacelike geodesic, in an expanding Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker universe. This leads to an initial boundary value problem (IBVP) for a nonlinear wave equation whose nonlinearity depends on a parameter $\kappa \geq 0$, related to the ratio between the rod's length and the cosmological scale. We show that if $\kappa$ is small enough then the solution to the IBVP is global in time and bounded, meaning that the rod's length oscillates around its initial value. For greater values of $\kappa$, however, the solution to the IBVP blows up in finite coordinate time, indicating that the rod is infinitely stretched by the cosmological expansion. This supports the widely held belief that sufficiently small bound systems do not follow the Hubble flow, whereas larger systems may do so. Similar conclusions apply to the tethered galaxy version of this problem, where the rod is used to connect two point masses (which results in nonlinear boundary conditions for the IBVP).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21305v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a passive scalar which is advected by an incompressible flow $u$ and has small molecular diffusivity $\kappa$. Previous results show that if $u$ is exponentially mixing and $C^1$, then the dissipation time is $O(|\log \kappa|^2)$. We produce a family of incompressible flows which are $C^0$ and exponentially mixing, uniformly in $\kappa$; however have a dissipation time of order $1/\kappa$ (i.e. exhibits no enhanced dissipation). We also estimate the dissipation time of mixing flows, and obtain improved bounds in terms of the mixing rate with explicit constants, and allow for a time inhomogeneous mixing rate which is typical for random constructions of mixing flows.</description>

      <title>Excess-continuous prox-regular sweeping processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the Moreau's sweeping processes driven by a time dependent prox-regular set $C(t)$ which is continuous in time with respect to the asymmetric distance $e$ called the excess, defined by $e(A,B) := \sup_{x \in A} d(x,B)$ for every pair of sets $A$, $B$ in a Hilbert space. As observed by J.J. Moreau in his pioneering works, the excess provides the natural topological framework for sweeping process. Assuming a uniform interior cone condition for $C(t)$, we prove that the associated sweeping process has a unique solution, thereby improving the existing result on continuous prox-regular sweeping processes in two directions: indeed, in the previous literature $C(t)$ was supposed to be continuous in time with respect to the symmetric Hausdorff distance instead of the excess and also its boundary $\partial C(t)$ was required to be continuous in time, an assumption which we completely drop. Therefore our result allows to consider a much wider class of continuously moving constraints.</description>

Abstract: This paper proves that the 3-D Navier-Stokes system has a unique global solution under an assumpution on the initial data. That allow the data to be arbitrarily large in the scale invariant space \dot{B}_{\infty,\infty}^{-1}, which contains all the known spaces in which there is a global solution for small data. In particular, this work extends the result of global well-posedness for the "ill-prepared" case in [6] to the full space \mathbb{R}^{3}(in [6] the fluid evolves in domain \mathbb{T}^{2}\times\mathbb{R})</description>

      <title>Attractors for weak and strong solutions of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations with damping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we obtain the existence of global attractors for the dynamical systems generated by weak solution of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations with damping. We consider two cases, depending on the values of the parameters \b{eta},{\alpha} controlling the damping term and the viscosity {\mu}. First, for \b{eta} we define a multivalued dynamical systems and prove the existence of the global attractor as well. Second, for either \b{eta}&gt;3 or \b{eta}=3, 4{\alpha}{\mu}&gt;1 the weak solutions are unique and we prove that the global attractor for the corresponding semigroup is more regular. Also, we prove in this case that it is the global attractor for the semigroup generated by the strong solutions. Finally, some numerical simulations are performed.</description>

      <title>Scale invariant bounds for the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14557v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive robust long-time a-priori estimates for the Navier-Stokes equation in a two-dimensional infinite strip which are uniform in the Reynolds number. These estimates provide several new scale invariant upper bounds for the size of the mixing layer in the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability.</description>

      <title>Universality of renormalisable mappings in two dimensions: the case of polar convex integrands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish universality of the renormalised energy for mappings from a planar domain to a compact manifold, by approximating subquadratic polar convex functionals of the form $\int_\Omega f(|\mathrm{D} u|)\,\mathrm{d} x$. The analysis relies on the condition that the vortex map ${x}/{\lvert x\rvert}$ has finite energy and that $t\mapsto f (\sqrt{t})$ is concave. We derive the leading order asymptotics and provide a detailed description of the convergence of $\mathrm{W}^{1,1}$-almost minimisers, leading to a characterization of second-order asymptotics. At the core of the method, we prove a ball merging construction (following Jerrard and Sandier's approach) for a general class of convex integrands. We therefore generalize the approximation by $p$-harmonic mappings when $p\nearrow 2$ and can also cover linearly growing functionals, including those of area-type.</description>

      <title>Slicing method for nonlinear integral inequalities related to critical nonlinear wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to a simple and short proof on the sharp upper bound of lifespan of classical solutions to wave equations with the critical power nonlinearities of spatial derivatives of the unknown function. Such a proof is so-called "slicing method", which may help us to extend the result for various equations and systems.</description>

      <title>Stability of oppositely-propagating pair of Hill's spherical vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the stability of a pair of Hill's spherical vortices moving away from each other in 3D incompressible axisymmetric Euler equations without swirl. Each vortex in the pair propagates away from its odd-symmetric counterpart, while keeping its vortex profile close to Hill's vortex. This is achieved by analyzing the evolution of the interaction energy of the pair and combining it with the compactness of energy-maximizing sequences in the variational problem concerning Hill's vortex. The key strategy is to confirm that, if the interaction energy is initially small enough, the kinetic energy of each vortex in the pair remains so close to that of a single Hill's vortex for all time that each vortex profile stays close to the energy maximizer: Hill's vortex. An estimate of the propagating speed of each vortex in the pair is also obtained by tracking the center of mass of each vortex. The estimate can be understood as optimal in the sense that the power exponent of the $\varepsilon$--the small perturbation measured in the ($L^1\cap L^2$+impulse) norm--appearing in the error bound cannot be improved.</description>

      <title>Strichartz estimate for discrete Schr\"odinger equation on layered King's grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the sharp \( l^1 \to l^{\infty} \) decay estimate for the discrete Schr\"odinger equation (DS) on the Layered King's Grid (LKG), with a dispersive decay rate of \( \langle t \rangle^{-13/12} \), which is faster than that for $3$-dimensional lattice (\( \langle t \rangle^{-1} \), see \cite{SK05}). This decay estimate enables us to derive the corresponding Strichartz estimate via the standard Keel--Tao argument. Our approach relies on using techniques from Newton polyhedra to analyze singularities.</description>

      <title>Sharp local smoothing estimates for curve averages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove sharp local smoothing estimates for curve averages in all dimensions. As a corollary, we prove the sharp $L^p$ boundedness of the helical maximal operator in $\mathbb{R}^4$, which was previously known only for $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^3$. We also improve previously known results in higher dimensions. There are new ingredients in the proof: Fourier decay estimates and wave envelope estimates for nondegenerate curves in $\mathbb{R}^n$. As a byproduct, we prove Bochner-Riesz estimates for nondegenerate curves in all dimensions.</description>

      <title>Existence of Solutions for Multivalued Mckean-Vlasov SDEs with Non-Lipschitz Coefficients Driven by Jump Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14546v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we first establish the existence and uniqueness of strong solutions for multivalued McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (MMVSDEs) driven by L\'evy noise with non-Lipschitz coefficients. It is important to note that these findings are based upon the well-posedness of strong solutions for MMVSDEs under Lipschitz conditions, which will be stated briefly. Secondly, we study the existence of weak solutions under linear growth condition. Finally, we prove the existence of martingale solutions.</description>
