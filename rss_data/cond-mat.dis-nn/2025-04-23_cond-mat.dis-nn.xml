      <title>Spin and energy diffusion vs. subdiffusion in disordered spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the high-temperature spin diffusion in spin chains with random local fields has been the subject of numerous studies concerning the phenomenon of many-body localization (MBL), the energy diffusion in the same models has been much less explored. We show that energy diffusion is faster at weak random fields but becomes essentially equal at strong fields; hence, both diffusions determine the slowest relaxation time scale (Thouless time) in the system. Numerically reachable finite-size systems reveal the anomalously large distribution of diffusion constants with respect to actual field configurations. Despite the exponential-like dependence of diffusion on field strength, results for the sensitivity to twisted boundary conditions are incompatible with the Thouless criterion for localization and the presumable transition to MBL, at least for numerically reachable sizes. In contrast, we find indications for the scenario of subdiffusive transport, in particular in the dynamical diffusivity response.</description>

      <title>Defects, Sound Damping, and the Boson Peak in Amorphous Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two nearly universal and anomalous properties of glasses, the peak in the specific heat and plateau of the thermal conductivity, occur around the same temperature. This coincidence suggests that the two phenomena are related. Both effects can be rationalized by assuming Rayleigh scaling of sound attenuation and this scaling leads one to consider scattering from defects. Identifying defects in glasses, which are inherently disordered, is a long-standing problem that was approached in several ways. We examine candidates for defects in glasses that represent areas of strong sound damping. We show that some defects are associated with quasi-localized excitations, which may be associated with modes in excess of the Debye theory. We also examine generalized Debye relations, which relate sound damping and the speed of sound to excess modes. We derive a generalized Debye relation that does not resort to an approximation used by previous authors. We find that our relation and the relation given by previous authors are almost identical at small frequencies and also reproduce the independently determined density of states. However, the different generalized Debye relations do not agree around the boson peak. While generalized Debye relations accurately predict the boson peak in two-dimensional glasses, they under estimate the boson peak in three-dimensional glasses.</description>

      <title>Locally Machine-Learnability of Density of Electronic States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electronic density of states (DOS) plays a crucial role in determining the properties of materials. In this study, we investigate the machine learnability of additive atomic contributions to the electronic DOS. Our approach focuses on atom-projected DOS rather than structural DOS. This method for structure-property mapping is both scalable and transferable, achieving high prediction accuracy for pure and compound silicon and carbon structures of varying sizes and configurations. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the complex Sn-S-Se compound structures. By employing locally trained DOS, we significantly enhance the accuracy in predicting secondary material properties, such as band energy, Fermi level, heat capacity, and magnetic susceptibility. Our findings indicate that directly learning atomic DOS, rather than structural DOS, improves the efficiency, accuracy, and interpretability of machine learning in structure-property mapping. This streamlined approach reduces computational complexity, paving the way for the examination of electronic structures in materials without the need for computationally expensive ab initio calculations.</description>

      <title>The Cavity Approach to Parallel Dynamics of Ising Spins on a Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/0905.3260</link>
      <description>arXiv:0905.3260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the cavity method to study parallel dynamics of disordered Ising models on a graph. In particular, we derive a set of recursive equations in single site probabilities of paths propagating along the edges of the graph. These equations are analogous to the cavity equations for equilibrium models and are exact on a tree. On graphs with exclusively directed edges we find an exact expression for the stationary distribution of the spins. We present the phase diagrams for an Ising model on an asymmetric Bethe lattice and for a neural network with Hebbian interactions on an asymmetric scale-free graph. For graphs with a nonzero fraction of symmetric edges the equations can be solved for a finite number of time steps. Theoretical predictions are confirmed by simulation results. Using a heuristic method, the cavity equations are extended to a set of equations that determine the marginals of the stationary distribution of Ising models on graphs with a nonzero fraction of symmetric edges. The results of this method are discussed and compared with simulations.</description>

      <title>The Origin of Sound Damping in Amorphous Solids: Defects and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Comprehending sound damping is integral to understanding the anomalous low temperature properties of glasses. After decades of theoretical and experimental studies, Rayleigh scattering scaling of the sound attenuation coefficient with frequency, $\Gamma \sim \omega^{d+1}$, became generally accepted when quantum and finite temperature effects can be neglected. Rayleigh scaling invokes a picture of scattering from defects. However, it is unclear how to define glass defects, or even if defects are necessary for Rayleigh scaling. Here we determine a particle level contribution to sound damping in the Rayleigh scaling regime. We find that there are areas in the glass that contribute more to sound damping than other areas over a range of frequencies, which allows us to define defects. We show that over a range of glass stability, sound damping scales linearly with the fraction of particles in the defects. However, sound is still attenuated in ultra-stable glasses where no defects are identified. We show that sound damping in these glasses is due to nearly uniformly distributed non-affine, microscopic forces that arise after macroscopic deformations of non-centrosymetric structures. To fully understand sound attenuation in glasses one has to consider contributions from defects and a defect-free background, which represents a new paradigm of sound damping in glasses.</description>

      <title>Nearest-Neighbours Neural Network architecture for efficient sampling of statistical physics models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The task of sampling efficiently the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution of disordered systems is important both for the theoretical understanding of these models and for the solution of practical optimization problems. Unfortunately, this task is known to be hard, especially for spin glasses at low temperatures. Recently, many attempts have been made to tackle the problem by mixing classical Monte Carlo schemes with newly devised Neural Networks that learn to propose smart moves. In this article we introduce the Nearest-Neighbours Neural Network (4N) architecture, a physically-interpretable deep architecture whose number of parameters scales linearly with the size of the system and that can be applied to a large variety of topologies. We show that the 4N architecture can accurately learn the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution for the two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model, and specifically for some of its most difficult instances. In particular, it captures properties such as the energy, the correlation function and the overlap probability distribution. Finally, we show that the 4N performance increases with the number of layers, in a way that clearly connects to the correlation length of the system, thus providing a simple and interpretable criterion to choose the optimal depth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the capacity of the Ising perceptron is with high probability upper bounded by the constant $\alpha_\star \approx 0.833$ conjectured by Krauth and M\'ezard, under the condition that an explicit two-variable function $\mathscr{S}_*(\lambda_1,\lambda_2)$ is maximized at $(1,0)$. The earlier work of Ding and Sun proves the matching lower bound subject to a similar numerical condition, and together these results give a conditional proof of the conjecture of Krauth and M\'ezard.</description>

      <title>When resampling/reweighting improves feature learning in imbalanced classification?: A toy-model study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A toy model of binary classification is studied with the aim of clarifying the class-wise resampling/reweighting effect on the feature learning performance under the presence of class imbalance. In the analysis, a high-dimensional limit of the input space is taken while keeping the ratio of the dataset size against the input dimension finite and the non-rigorous replica method from statistical mechanics is employed. The result shows that there exists a case in which the no resampling/reweighting situation gives the best feature learning performance irrespectively of the choice of losses or classifiers, supporting recent findings in Cao et al. (2019); Kang et al. (2019). It is also revealed that the key of the result is the symmetry of the loss and the problem setting. Inspired by this, we propose a further simplified model exhibiting the same property in the multiclass setting. These clarify when the class-wise resampling/reweighting becomes effective in imbalanced classification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Amorphous graphene or amorphous monolayer carbon (AMC) is a family of carbon films that exhibit a surprising sensitivity of electronic conductance to morphology. We combine deep learning-enhanced simulation techniques with percolation theory to analyze three morphologically distinct mesoscale AMCs. Our approach avoids the pitfalls of applying periodic boundary conditions to these fundamentally aperiodic systems or equating crystalline inclusions with conducting sites. We reproduce the previously reported dependence of charge conductance on morphology and explore the limitations of partial morphology descriptors in witnessing conductance properties. Finally, we perform crystallinity analysis of conductance networks along the electronic energy spectrum and show that they metamorphose from being localized on crystallites at band edges to localized on defects around the Fermi energy opening the possibility of control through gate voltage.</description>

      <title>Decoding the Competing Effects of Dynamic Solvation Structures on Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Chemical Shifts of Battery Electrolytes via Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the solvation structure of electrolytes is critical for optimizing the electrochemical performance of rechargeable batteries, as it directly influences properties such as ionic conductivity, viscosity, and electrochemical stability. The highly complex structures and strong interactions in high-concentration electrolytes make accurate modeling and interpretation of their ``structure-property" relationships even more challenging with spectroscopic methods. In this study, we present a machine learning-based approach to predict dynamic $^7$Li NMR chemical shifts in LiFSI/DME electrolyte solutions. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive structural analysis to interpret the observed chemical shift behavior in our experiments, particularly the abrupt changes in $^7$Li chemical shifts at high concentrations. Using advanced modeling techniques, we quantitatively establish the relationship between molecular structure and NMR spectra, offering critical insights into solvation structure assignments. Our findings reveal the coexistence of two competing local solvation structures that shift in dominance as electrolyte concentration approaches the concentrated limit, leading to anomalous reverse of $^7$Li NMR chemical shift in our experiment. This work provides a detailed molecular-level understanding of the intricate solvation structures probed by NMR spectroscopy, leading the way for enhanced electrolyte design.</description>

      <title>Quantum fluctuations can enhance or reduce positional uncertainty at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The uncertainty principle guarantees a non-zero value for the positional uncertainty, $\left\langle\Delta x^2\right\rangle &gt; 0$, even without thermal fluctuations. This implies that quantum fluctuations inherently enhance positional uncertainty at zero temperature. A natural question then arises: what happens at finite temperatures, where the interplay between quantum and thermal fluctuations may give rise to complex and intriguing behaviors? To address this question, we systematically investigate the positional uncertainty, $\left\langle\Delta x^2\right\rangle$, of a particle in equilibrium confined within a nonlinear potential of the form $V(x) \propto x^a$, where $a = 2, 4, 6, \dots$ represents an even exponent. Using path integral Monte Carlo simulations, we calculate $\left\langle\Delta x^2\right\rangle$ in equilibrium as a function of the thermal de Broglie wavelength $\Lambda$. Interestingly, for large values of $a$, $\left\langle\Delta x^2\right\rangle$ exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on $\Lambda$: it initially decreases with increasing $\Lambda$ at small $\Lambda$ but increases at larger $\Lambda$. To further understand this behavior, we employ a semiclassical approximation, which reveals that quantum fluctuations can reduce positional uncertainty for small $\Lambda$ when the nonlinearity of the potential is sufficiently strong. Finally, we discuss the potential implications of this result for many-body phenomena driven by strong nonlinear interactions, such as glass transitions, where the transition densities exhibit a similar non-monotonic dependence on $\Lambda$.</description>
