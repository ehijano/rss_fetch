      <title>On Unitary 2-Group Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global internal symmetries act unitarily on local observables or states of a quantum system. In this note, we aim to generalise this statement to extended observables by considering unitary actions of finite global 2-group symmetries $\mathcal{G}$ on line operators. We propose that the latter transform in unitary 2-representations of $\mathcal{G}$, which we classify up to unitary equivalence. Our results recover the known classification of ordinary 2-representations of finite 2-groups, but provide additional data interpreted as a type of reflection anomaly for $\mathcal{G}$.</description>

      <title>Duality, asymptotic charges and algebraic topology in p-form gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [1] the asymptotic charges of p-form gauge theories in any dimension are studied. Here we prove an existence and uniqueness theorem for the duality map linking asymptotic electric-like charges of the dual descriptions and we give it an algebraic topology interpretation. As a result the duality map has a topological nature and ensures the charge of a description has information of the dual description. The result of the theorem could be generalized to more generic gauge theories where the gauge field is a mixed symmetry tensor leading to a deeper understanding of gauge theories, of the non-trivial charges associated to them and of the duality of their observable.</description>

      <title>Neural Hamilton: Can A.I. Understand Hamiltonian Mechanics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework based on neural network that reformulates classical mechanics as an operator learning problem. A machine directly maps a potential function to its corresponding trajectory in phase space without solving the Hamilton equations. Most notably, while conventional methods tend to accumulate errors over time through iterative time integration, our approach prevents error propagation. Two newly developed neural network architectures, namely VaRONet and MambONet, are introduced to adapt the Variational LSTM sequence-to-sequence model and leverage the Mamba model for efficient temporal dynamics processing. We tested our approach with various 1D physics problems: harmonic oscillation, double-well potentials, Morse potential, and other potential models outside the training data. Compared to traditional numerical methods based on the fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) algorithm, our model demonstrates improved computational efficiency and accuracy.

      <title>Quantum groupoids from moduli spaces of $G$-bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a previous work, we have constructed the Yangian $Y_\hbar (\mathfrak{d})$ of the cotangent Lie algebra $\mathfrak{d}=T^*\mathfrak{g}$ for a simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, from the geometry of the equivariant affine Grassmanian associated to $G$ with $\mathfrak{g}=\mathrm{Lie}(G)$. In this paper, we construct a quantum groupoid $\Upsilon_\hbar^\sigma (\mathfrak{d})$ associated to $\mathfrak{d}$ over a formal neighbourhood of the moduli space of $G$-bundles and show that it is a dynamical twist of $Y_\hbar(\mathfrak{d})$. Using this dynamical twist, we construct a dynamical quantum spectral $R$-matrix, which essentially controls the meromorphic braiding of $\Upsilon_\hbar^\sigma (\mathfrak{d})$.
  This construction is motivated by the Hecke action of the equivariant affine Grassmanian on the moduli space of $G$-bundles in the setting of coherent sheaves. Heuristically speaking, the quantum groupoid $\Upsilon_\hbar^\sigma (\mathfrak{d})$ controls this action at a formal neighbourhood of a regularly stable $G$-bundle. From the work of Costello-Witten-Yamazaki, it is expected that this Hecke action should give rise to a dynamical integrable system. Our result gives a mathematical confirmation of this and an explicit $R$-matrix underlying the integrability.</description>

      <title>On the Computational Complexity of Schr\"odinger Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study computational problems related to the Schr\"odinger operator $H = -\Delta + V$ in the real space under the condition that (i) the potential function $V$ is smooth and has its value and derivative bounded within some polynomial of $n$ and (ii) $V$ only consists of $O(1)$-body interactions. We prove that (i) simulating the dynamics generated by the Schr\"odinger operator implements universal quantum computation, i.e., it is BQP-hard, and (ii) estimating the ground energy of the Schr\"odinger operator is as hard as estimating that of local Hamiltonians with no sign problem (a.k.a. stoquastic Hamiltonians), i.e., it is StoqMA-complete. This result is particularly intriguing because the ground energy problem for general bosonic Hamiltonians is known to be QMA-hard and it is widely believed that $\texttt{StoqMA}\varsubsetneq \texttt{QMA}$.</description>

      <title>Decay properties for massive Vlasov fields on Schwarzschild spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain pointwise decay estimates in time for massive Vlasov fields on the exterior of Schwarzschild spacetime. We consider massive Vlasov fields supported on the closure of the largest domain of the mass-shell where timelike geodesics either cross $\mathcal{H}^+$, or escape to infinity. For this class of Vlasov fields, we prove that the components of the energy-momentum tensor decay like $v^{-\frac{1}{3}}$ in the bounded region $\{r\leq R\}$, and like $u^{-\frac{1}{3}}r^{-2}$ in the far-away region $\{r\geq R\}$, where $R&gt;2M$ is sufficiently large. Here, $(u,v)$ denotes the standard Eddington--Finkelstein double null coordinate pair.</description>

      <title>A High-Order Analytical Extension of the Corrected Smagorinsky Model for Non-Equilibrium Turbulent Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents an extension of the corrected Smagorinsky model, incorporating advanced techniques for error estimation and regularity analysis of far-from-equilibrium turbulent flows. A new formulation that increases the model's ability to explain complex dissipative processes in turbulence is presented, using higher-order Sobolev spaces to address incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes equations. Specifically, a refined energy dissipation mechanism that provides a more accurate representation of turbulence is introduced, particularly in the context of multifractal flow regimes. Furthermore, we derive new theoretical results on energy regularization in multifractal turbulence, contributing to the understanding of anomalous dissipation and vortex stretching in turbulent flows. The work also explores the numerical implementation of the model in the presence of challenging boundary conditions, particularly in dynamically evolving domains, where traditional methods struggle to maintain accuracy and stability. Theoretical demonstrations and analytical results are provided to validate the proposed framework, with implications for theoretical advances and practical applications in computational fluid dynamics. This approach provides a basis for more accurate simulations of turbulence, with potential applications ranging from atmospheric modeling to industrial fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Exact Non-Local Hydrodynamics Predict Rarefaction Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine the theory of slow spectral closure for linearized Boltzmann equations with Maxwell's kinetic boundary conditions to derive non-local hydrodynamics with arbitrary accommodation. Focusing on shear-mode dynamics, we obtain explicit steady state solutions in terms of Fourier integrals and closed-form expressions for the mean flow and the stress. We demonstrate that the exact non-local fluid model correctly predicts several rarefaction effects with accommodation, including the Couette flow and thermal creep in a plane channel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the nonlinear inverse source problem of detecting, localizing and identifying unknown accidental disturbances on forced and damped transmission networks. A first result is that strategic observation sets are enough to guarantee detection of disturbances. To localize and identify them, we additionally need the observation set to be absorbent. If this set is dominantly absorbent, then detection, localization and identification can be done in "quasi real-time". We illustrate these results with numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the concept of noncommuting common causes; refute two objections raised against them, the triviality objection and the lack of causal explanatory force; and explore how their existence modifies the EPR argument. More specifically, we show that 1) product states screening off all quantum correlations do not compromise noncommuting common causal explanations; 2) noncommuting common causes can satisfy the law of total probability; 3) perfect correlations can have indeterministic noncommuting common causes; and, as a combination of the above claims, 4) perfect correlations can have noncommuting common causes which are both nontrivial and satisfy the law of total probability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for $n = 2$ the gaskets of critical rigid O(n) loop-decorated random planar maps are $3/2$-stable maps. The case $n = 2$ thus corresponds to the critical case in random planar maps. The proof relies on the Wiener-Hopf factorisation for random walks. Our techniques also provide a characterisation of weight sequences of critical $O(2)$ loop-decorated maps.</description>

      <title>Suppressing parametric resonance of a Hyperloop vehicle using a parametric force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the stability of a simple model of a Hyperloop vehicle resulting from the interaction between electromagnetic and aeroelastic forces for both constant and periodically varying coefficients (i.e., parametric excitation). For the constant coefficients, through linear stability analysis, we analytically identify three distinct regions for the physically significant equilibrium point. Further inspection reveals that the system exhibits limit-cycle vibrations in one of these regions. Using the harmonic balance method, we determine the properties of the limit cycle, thereby unravelling the frequency and amplitude that characterize the periodic oscillations of the system's variables. For the varying coefficients case, the stability is studied using Floquet analysis and Hills determinant method. The part of the stability boundary related to parametric resonance has an elliptical shape, while the remaining part remains unchanged. One of the major findings is that a linear parametric force, can suppress or amplify the parametric resonance induced by another parametric force depending on the amplitude of the former. In the context of the Hyperloop system, this means that parametric resonance caused by base excitation-in other words by the linearized parametric electromagnetic force can be suppressed by modulating the coefficient of the aeroelastic force in the same frequency. The effectiveness is highly dependent on the phase difference between the modulation and the base excitation. The origin of the suppression is attributed to the stabilizing character of the parametric aeroelastic force as revealed through energy analysis. We provide analytical expressions for the stability boundaries and for the stability's dependence on the phase shift of the modulation.</description>

      <title>Identifying spatially-localized instability mechanisms using sparse optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent investigations have established the physical relevance of spatially-localized instability mechanisms in fluid dynamics and their potential for technological innovations in flow control. In this letter, we show that the mathematical problem of identifying spatially-localized optimal perturbations that maximize perturbation-energy amplification can be cast as a sparse (cardinality-constrained) optimization problem. Unfortunately, cardinality constrained optimization problems are non-convex and combinatorially hard to solve in general. To make the analysis viable within the context of fluid dynamics problems, we propose an efficient iterative method for computing sub-optimal spatially-localized perturbations. Our approach is based on a generalized Rayleigh quotient iteration algorithm followed by a variational renormalization procedure that reduces the optimality gap in the resulting solution. The approach is demonstrated on a sub-critical plane Poiseuille flow at Re = 4000, which has been a benchmark problem studied in prior investigations on identifying spatially-localized flow structures. Remarkably, we find that a subset of the perturbations identified by our method yield a comparable degree of energy amplification as their global counterparts. We anticipate our proposed analysis tools will facilitate further investigations into spatially-localized flow instabilities, including within the resolvent and input-output analysis frameworks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schmidt decomposition is a powerful tool in quantum information. While Schmidt decomposition is universal for bipartite states, its not for multipartite states. In this article, we review properties of bipartite Schmidt decompositions and study which of them extend to multipartite states. In particular, Schmidt number (the number of non-zero terms in Schmidt decomposition) define an equivalence class using separable unitary transforms. We show that it is NP-complete to partition a multipartite state that attains the highest Schmidt number. In addition, we observe that purifications of a density matrix of a composite system preserves Schmidt decomposability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discrete time Vicsek model confined by a harmonic potential explains many aspects of swarm formation in insects. We have found exact solutions of this model without alignment noise in two or three dimensions. They are periodic or quasiperiodic (invariant circle) solutions with positions on a circular orbit or on several concentric orbits and exist for quantized values of the confinement. There are period 2 and period 4 solutions on a line for a range of confinement strengths and period 4 solutions on a rhombus. These solutions may have polarization one, although there are partially ordered period 4 solutions and totally disordered (zero polarization) period 2 solutions. We have explored the linear stability of the exact solutions in two dimensions using the Floquet theorem and verified the stability assignements by direct numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>From orbital magnetism to bulk-edge correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.13456v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By extending the gauge covariant magnetic perturbation theory to operators defined on half-planes, we prove that for $2d$ random ergodic magnetic Schr\"odinger operators, the zero-temperature bulk-edge correspondence can be obtained from a general bulk-edge duality at positive temperature involving the bulk magnetization and the total edge current.
  Our main result is encapsulated in a formula, which states that the derivative of a large class of bulk partition functions with respect to the external constant magnetic field, equals the expectation of a corresponding edge distribution function of the velocity component which is parallel to the edge. Neither spectral gaps, nor mobility gaps, nor topological arguments are required.
  The equality between the bulk and edge indices, as stated by the conventional bulk-edge correspondence, is obtained as a corollary of our purely analytical arguments by imposing a gap condition and by taking a ``zero-temperature" limit.</description>

      <title>Typical Macroscopic Long-Time Behavior for Random Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a closed macroscopic quantum system in a pure state $\psi_t$ evolving unitarily and take for granted that different macro states correspond to mutually orthogonal subspaces $\mathcal{H}_\nu$ (macro spaces) of Hilbert space, each of which has large dimension. We extend previous work on the question what the evolution of $\psi_t$ looks like macroscopically, specifically on how much of $\psi_t$ lies in each $\mathcal{H}_\nu$. Previous bounds concerned the \emph{absolute} error for typical $\psi_0$ and/or $t$ and are valid for arbitrary Hamiltonians $H$; now, we provide bounds on the \emph{relative} error, which means much tighter bounds, with probability close to 1 by modeling $H$ as a random matrix, more precisely as a random band matrix (i.e., where only entries near the main diagonal are significantly nonzero) in a basis aligned with the macro spaces. We exploit particularly that the eigenvectors of $H$ are delocalized in this basis. Our main mathematical results confirm the two phenomena of generalized normal typicality (a type of long-time behavior) and dynamical typicality (a type of similarity within the ensemble of $\psi_0$ from an initial macro space). They are based on an extension we prove of a no-gaps delocalization result for random matrices by Rudelson and Vershynin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In discrete schemes, weak KAM solutions may be interpreted as approximations of correctors for some Hamilton-Jacobi equations in the periodic setting. It is known that correctors may not exist in the almost periodic setting. We show the existence of discrete weak KAM solutions for non-degenerate and weakly twist interactions in general. Furthermore, assuming equivariance with respect to a linearly repetitive quasi-periodic set, we completely classify all possible types of weak KAM solutions.</description>

      <title>Radiative transport in a periodic structure with band crossings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the Wigner transformation and asymptotic analysis to systematically derive the semi-classical model for the Schr\"{o}dinger equation in arbitrary spatial dimensions, with any periodic structure. Our particular emphasis lies in addressing the \textit{diabatic} effect, i.e., the impact of Bloch band crossings. We consider both deterministic and random scenarios. In the former case, we derive a coupled Liouville system, revealing lower-order interactions among different Bloch bands. In the latter case, a coupled system of radiative transport equations emerges, with the scattering cross-section induced by the random inhomogeneities. As a specific application, we deduce the effective dynamics of a wave packet in graphene with randomness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15460v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a full classification of general affine connections on Galilei manifolds in terms of independently specifiable tensor fields. This generalises the well-known case of (torsional) Galilei connections, i.e. connections compatible with the metric structure of the Galilei manifold. Similarly to the well-known pseudo-Riemannian case, the additional freedom for connections that are not metric-compatible lies in the covariant derivatives of the two tensors defining the metric structure (the clock form and the space metric), which however are not fully independent of each other.</description>

Abstract: We provide a second order energy expansion for a gas of $N$ bosonic particles with three-body interactions in the Gross-Pitaevskii regime. We especially confirm a conjecture by Nam, Ricaud and Triay in [22], where they predict the subleading term in the asymptotic expansion of the ground state energy to be of the order $\sqrt{N}$. In addition, we show that the ground state satisfies Bose-Einstein condensation with a rate of the order $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the Ruijsenaars' action-angle duality in classical many-body integrable systems through the spectral duality transformation relating the classical spin chains and Gaudin models. For this purpose, the Lax matrices of many-body systems are represented in the multi-pole (Gaudin-like) form by introducing a fictitious spectral parameter. This form of Lax matrices is also interpreted as classical-classical version of quantum-classical duality.</description>

      <title>Control of probability flow in Markov chain Monte Carlo -- Nonreversibility and lifting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0258</link>
      <description>arXiv:1207.0258v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is widely used in various fields as a powerful numerical integration technique for systems with many degrees of freedom. In MCMC methods, probabilistic state transitions can be considered as a random walk in state space, and random walks allow for sampling from complex distributions. However, paradoxically, it is necessary to carefully suppress the randomness of the random walk to improve computational efficiency. By breaking detailed balance, we can create a probability flow in the state space and perform more efficient sampling along this flow. Motivated by this idea, practical and efficient nonreversible MCMC methods have been developed over the past ten years. In particular, the lifting technique, which introduces probability flows in an extended state space, has been applied to various systems and has proven more efficient than conventional reversible updates. We review and discuss several practical approaches to implementing nonreversible MCMC methods, including the shift method in the cumulative distribution and the directed-worm algorithm.</description>

      <title>Pre-Calabi-Yau algebras and topological quantum field theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.14667v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a notion generalizing Calabi-Yau structures on A-infinity algebras and categories, which we call pre-Calabi-Yau structures. This notion does not need either one of the finiteness conditions (smoothness or compactness) which are required for Calabi-Yau structures to exist. In terms of noncommutative geometry, a pre-CY structure is as a polyvector field satisfying an integrability condition with respect to a noncommutative analogue of the Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket. We show that a pre-CY structure defines an action of a certain PROP of chains on decorated Riemann surfaces. In the language of the cobordism perspective on TQFTs, this gives a partially defined extended 2-dimensional TQFT, whose 2-dimensional cobordisms are generated only by handles of index one. We present some examples of pre-CY structures appearing naturally in geometric and topological contexts.</description>

      <title>Smooth Calabi-Yau structures and the noncommutative Legendre transform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.01567v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We elucidate the relation between smooth Calabi-Yau structures and pre-Calabi-Yau structures. We show that, from a smooth Calabi-Yau structure on an $A_\infty$-category $A$, one can produce a pre-Calabi-Yau structure on $A$; as defined in our previous work, this is a shifted noncommutative version of an integrable polyvector field. We explain how this relation is an analogue of the Legendre transform, and how it defines a one-to-one mapping, in a certain homological sense. For concreteness, we apply this formalism to chains on based loop spaces of (possibly non-simply connected) Poincar\'e duality spaces, and fully calculate the case of the circle.</description>

      <title>Operadic approach to Markov processes with boundaries on the square lattice in dimension 2 and larger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Markov processes are omnipresent in any dimension, especially in statistical mechanics; however their algebraic description is complete only in dimension 1 (which is often interpreted as "time"), for which linear algebra provides many tools complementary to the probabilistic approach: in particular, invariant measures are eigenvectors of the generator. In larger dimension, such algebraic tools are absent due to the more involved structure of boundaries. One of the consequences is the difficulty of the construction of infinite-volume Gibbs measures on the whole lattice for such Markov processes. Such constructions are usually handled in an analytical way, with the DLR approach, guesses of approximate boundary conditions and Riesz theorem. We introduce in the present document new operadic tools to describe in a fully algebraic way Markov processes in any dimension on the square lattice. The main consequence is a natural description of probabilistic boundary weights in terms of matrix product representations, for which we generalize the eigenvector property of 1D invariant measures. This approach leads to new algebraic objects, with a local-to-global perspective, that are suitable for the use of Kolmogorov's extension theorem. Moreover, finite size Markov processes on the square lattice can also be seen as a toy case of statistical Euclidean field theory: our algebraic tools are related to other categorical approaches to field theory, with the advantage of providing concrete computational tools.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the mixing time of systematic scan Glauber dynamics Ising model on the complete graph. On the complete graph $K_n$, at each time, $k \leq n$ vertices are chosen uniformly random and are updated one by one according to the uniformly randomly chosen permutations over the $k$ vertices. We show that if $k = o(n^{1/3})$, the high temperature regime $\beta &lt; 1$ exhibits cutoff phenomena. For critical temperature regime $\beta = 1$, We prove that the mixing time is of order $n^{3/2}k^{-1}$. For $\beta &gt; 1$, we prove the mixing time is of order $nk^{-1}\log n$ under the restricted dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14174v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An exact closure for hydrodynamic variables is rigorously derived from the linear Boltzmann kinetic equation. Our approach, based on spectral theory, structural properties of eigenvectors and the theory of slow manifolds, allows us to define a unique, optimal reduction in phase space close to equilibrium. The hydrodynamically constrained system induces a modification of entropy that ensures pure viscous dissipation on the hydrodynamic manifold, which is interpreted as a non-local variant of Korteweg's theory of viscosity-capillarity balance. The rigorous hydrodynamic equations are exemplified on the Knudsen minimum paradox in a channel flow.</description>

      <title>The scaling limit of the volume of loop O(n) quadrangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the volume of rigid loop-$O(n)$ quadrangulations with a boundary of length $2p$ in the non-generic critical regime. We prove that, as the half-perimeter $p$ goes to infinity, the volume scales in distribution to an explicit random variable. This limiting random variable is described in terms of the multiplicative cascades of Chen, Curien and Maillard arXiv:1702.06916, or alternatively (in the dilute case) as the law of the area of a unit-boundary $\gamma$-quantum disc, as determined by Ang and Gwynne arXiv:1903.09120, for suitable $\gamma$. Our arguments go through a classification of the map into several regions, where we rule out the contribution of bad regions to be left with a tractable portion of the map. One key observable for this classification is a Markov chain which explores the nested loops around a size-biased vertex pick in the map, making explicit the spinal structure of the discrete multiplicative cascade. We stress that our techniques enable us to include the boundary case $n=2$, that we define rigorously, and where the nested cascade structure is that of a critical branching random walk. In that case the scaling limit is given by the limit of the derivative martingale and is inverse-exponentially distributed, which answers a conjecture of arXiv:2005.06372v2.</description>

Abstract: We consider $n\times n$ non-Hermitian random matrices with independent entries and a variance profile, as well as an additive deterministic diagonal deformation. We show that their empirical eigenvalue distribution converges to a limiting density as $n$ tends to infinity and that the support of this density in the complex plane exactly coincides with the $\varepsilon$-pseudospectrum in the consecutive limits $n \to \infty$ and $\varepsilon \to 0$. The limiting spectral measure is identified as the Brown measure of a deformed operator-valued circular element with the help of [arXiv:2409.15405].</description>

      <title>Towards $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal higher-spin theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21573v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three years ago, we proposed free off-shell models for ${\mathcal N}=2$ superconformal higher-spin multiplets in arbitrary conformally flat backgrounds, constructed conserved conformal higher-spin supercurrents for a massless hypermultiplet, and sketched the Noether procedure to generate its cubic couplings to the superconformal higher-spin multiplets. This paper is devoted to completing the Noether procedure. Specifically, we: (i) describe the unique off-shell primary extensions of the conformal higher-spin supercurrents; (ii) embed the off-shell superconformal prepotentials into primary unconstrained isotwistor multiplets; and (iii) present the unique gauge transformations of the hypermultiplet and the isotwistor prepotentials. An extension of the Noether procedure beyond the cubic level is also sketched, following the earlier ${\mathcal N}=1$ superconformal approach developed by the authors and Ponds in 2022. Our construction is based on making use of the polar hypermultiplet within the projective-superspace setting.</description>

Abstract: We study properties of boundary conditions (BCs) in theories with categorical (or non-invertible) symmetries. We describe how the transformation properties, or (generalized) charges, of BCs are captured by topological BCs of Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), which is a topological field theory in one higher spacetime dimension. As an application of the SymTFT chracterization, we discuss the symmetry properties of boundary conditions for (1+1)d gapped and gapless phases. We provide a number of concrete examples in spacetime dimensions $d=2,3$. We furthermore expand the lattice description for (1+1)d anyon chains with categorical symmetries to include boundary conditions carrying arbitrary 1-charges under the symmetry.</description>

      <title>Brown measures of deformed $L^\infty$-valued circular elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Brown measure of $a+\mathfrak{c}$, where $a$ lies in a commutative tracial von Neumann algebra $\mathcal{B}$ and $\mathfrak{c}$ is a $\cal{B}$-valued circular element. Under certain regularity conditions on $a$ and the covariance of $\mathfrak{c}$ this Brown measure has a density with respect to the Lebesgue measure on the complex plane which is real analytic apart from jump discontinuities at the boundary of its support. With the exception of finitely many singularities this one-dimensional spectral edge is real analytic. We provide a full description of all possible edge singularities as well as all points in the interior, where the density vanishes. The edge singularities are classified in terms of their local edge shape while internal zeros of the density are classified in terms of the shape of the density locally around these points. We also show that each of these countably infinitely many singularity types occurs for an appropriate choice of $a$ when $\mathfrak{c}$ is a standard circular element. The Brown measure of $a+\mathfrak{c}$ arises as the empirical spectral distribution of a diagonally deformed non-Hermitian random matrix with independent entries when its dimension tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Riemannian-geometric generalizations of quantum fidelities and Bures-Wasserstein distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a family of fidelities, termed generalized fidelity, which are based on the Riemannian geometry of the Bures-Wasserstein manifold. We show that this family of fidelities generalizes standard quantum fidelities such as Uhlmann-, Holevo-, and Matsumoto-fidelity and demonstrate that it satisfies analogous celebrated properties. The generalized fidelity naturally arises from a generalized Bures distance, the natural distance obtained by linearizing the Bures-Wasserstein manifold. We prove various invariance and covariance properties of generalized fidelity as the point of linearization moves along geodesic-related paths. We also provide a Block-matrix characterization and prove an Uhlmann-like theorem, as well as provide further extensions to the multivariate setting and to quantum R\'enyi divergences, generalizing Petz-, Sandwich-, Reverse sandwich-, and Geometric-R\'enyi divergences of order $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>The exact travelling wave solutions of a KPP equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12873v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain the exact analytical traveling wave solutions of the Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piskunov equation with the reaction term belonging to the class of functions, which includes that of the (generalized) Fisher equation, for the particular values of the waves speed. Additionally we obtain the the exact analytical traveling wave solutions of the generalized Burgers-Huxley equation.</description>
