      <title>Who Wins Ethereum Block Building Auctions and Why?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MEV-Boost block auction contributes approximately 90% of all Ethereum blocks. Between October 2023 and March 2024, only three builders produced 80% of them, highlighting the concentration of power within the block builder market. To foster competition and preserve Ethereum's decentralized ethos and censorship-resistance properties, understanding the dominant players' competitive edges is essential.
  In this paper, we identify features that play a significant role in builders' ability to win blocks and earn profits by conducting a comprehensive empirical analysis of MEV-Boost auctions over a six-month period. We reveal that block market share positively correlates with order flow diversity, while profitability correlates with access to order flow from Exclusive Providers, such as integrated searchers and external providers with exclusivity deals. Additionally, we show a positive correlation between market share and profit margin among the top ten builders, with features such as exclusive signal, non-atomic arbitrages, and Telegram bot flow strongly correlating with both metrics. This highlights a "chicken-and-egg" problem where builders need differentiated order flow to profit, but only receive such flow if they have a significant market share. Overall, this work provides an in-depth analysis of the key features driving the builder market towards centralization and offers valuable insights for designing further iterations of Ethereum block auctions, preserving Ethereum's censorship resistance properties.</description>

      <title>Empirical Voronoi Wavelets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the construction of 2D empirical wavelets based on partitioning the Fourier domain with the watershed transform has been proposed. If such approach can build partitions of completely arbitrary shapes, for some applications, it is desirable to keep a certain level of regularity in the geometry of the obtained partitions. In this paper, we propose to build such partition using Voronoi diagrams. This solution allows us to keep a high level of adaptability while guaranteeing a minimum level of geometric regularity in the detected partition.</description>

      <title>Explainable Post hoc Portfolio Management Financial Policy of a Deep Reinforcement Learning agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial portfolio management investment policies computed quantitatively by modern portfolio theory techniques like the Markowitz model rely on a set on assumptions that are not supported by data in high volatility markets. Hence, quantitative researchers are looking for alternative models to tackle this problem. Concretely, portfolio management is a problem that has been successfully addressed recently by Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approaches. In particular, DRL algorithms train an agent by estimating the distribution of the expected reward of every action performed by an agent given any financial state in a simulator. However, these methods rely on Deep Neural Networks model to represent such a distribution, that although they are universal approximator models, they cannot explain its behaviour, given by a set of parameters that are not interpretable. Critically, financial investors policies require predictions to be interpretable, so DRL agents are not suited to follow a particular policy or explain their actions. In this work, we developed a novel Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning (XDRL) approach for portfolio management, integrating the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with the model agnostic explainable techniques of feature importance, SHAP and LIME to enhance transparency in prediction time. By executing our methodology, we can interpret in prediction time the actions of the agent to assess whether they follow the requisites of an investment policy or to assess the risk of following the agent suggestions. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed approach is the first explainable post hoc portfolio management financial policy of a DRL agent. We empirically illustrate our methodology by successfully identifying key features influencing investment decisions, which demonstrate the ability to explain the agent actions in prediction time.</description>

      <title>Modified-Improved Fitness Dependent Optimizer for Complex and Engineering Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fitness dependent optimizer (FDO) is considered one of the novel swarm intelligent algorithms. Recently, FDO has been enhanced several times to improve its capability. One of the improvements is called improved FDO (IFDO). However, according to the research findings, the variants of FDO are constrained by two primary limitations that have been identified. Firstly, if the number of agents employed falls below five, it significantly diminishes the algorithm's precision. Secondly, the efficacy of FDO is intricately tied to the quantity of search agents utilized. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a modified version of IFDO, called M-IFDO. The enhancement is conducted by updating the location of the scout bee to the IFDO to move the scout bees to achieve better performance and optimal solutions. More specifically, two parameters in IFDO, which are alignment and cohesion, are removed. Instead, the Lambda parameter is replaced in the place of alignment and cohesion. To verify the performance of the newly introduced algorithm, M-IFDO is tested on 19 basic benchmark functions, 10 IEEE Congress of Evolutionary Computation (CEC-C06 2019), and five real-world problems. M-IFDO is compared against five state-of-the-art algorithms: Improved Fitness Dependent Optimizer (IFDO), Improving Multi-Objective Differential Evolution algorithm (IMODE), Hybrid Sampling Evolution Strategy (HSES), Linear Success-History based Parameter Adaptation for Differential Evolution (LSHADE) and CMA-ES Integrated with an Occasional Restart Strategy and Increasing Population Size and An Iterative Local Search (NBIPOP-aCMAES). The verification criteria are based on how well the algorithm reaches convergence, memory usage, and statistical results. The results show that M-IFDO surpasses its competitors in several cases on the benchmark functions and five real-world problems.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Modeling and Analysis of Thermal Radiation in Conventional, Microwave-assisted, and Hybrid Freeze Drying for Biopharmaceutical Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02104v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In freeze drying, thermal radiation has a significant effect on the drying process of vials located near the corner and edge of the trays, resulting in non-uniformity of the products. Understanding and being able to predict the impact of thermal radiation are therefore critical to accurate determination of the drying process endpoint given the variation in heat transfer of each vial. This article presents a new mechanistic model that describes complex thermal radiation during primary drying in conventional, microwave-assisted, and hybrid freeze drying. Modeling of thermal radiation employs the diffuse gray surface model and radiation network approach, which systematically and accurately incorporates simultaneous radiation exchange between every surface including the chamber wall and vials, allowing the framework to be seamlessly applied for analyzing various freeze-dryer designs. Model validation with data from the literature shows accurate prediction of the drying times for all vials, including inner, edge, and corner vials. The validated model is demonstrated for thermal radiation analysis and parametric studies to guide the design and optimization of freeze dryers.</description>

      <title>Projection-based model-order reduction for unstructured meshes with graph autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a graph autoencoder architecture capable of performing projection-based model-order reduction (PMOR) on advection-dominated flows modeled by unstructured meshes. The autoencoder is coupled with the time integration scheme from a traditional deep least-squares Petrov-Galerkin projection and provides the first deployment of a graph autoencoder into a PMOR framework. The presented graph autoencoder is constructed with a two-part process that consists of (1) generating a hierarchy of reduced graphs to emulate the compressive abilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and (2) training a message passing operation at each step in the hierarchy of reduced graphs to emulate the filtering process of a CNN. The resulting framework provides improved flexibility over traditional CNN-based autoencoders because it is extendable to unstructured meshes. To highlight the capabilities of the proposed framework, which is named geometric deep least-squares Petrov-Galerkin (GD-LSPG), we benchmark the method on a one-dimensional Burgers' equation problem with a structured mesh and demonstrate the flexibility of GD-LSPG by deploying it to a two-dimensional Euler equations model that uses an unstructured mesh. The proposed framework provides considerable improvement in accuracy for very low-dimensional latent spaces in comparison with traditional affine projections.</description>
