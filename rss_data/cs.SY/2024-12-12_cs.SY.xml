      <title>Utility-Scale Bifacial Solar Photovoltaic System: Optimum Sizing and Techno-Economic Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical monofacial solar photovoltaic systems have gained prevalence and are widely reported in the literature because they have a lower initial cost compared with bifacial systems. However, limited investigation of both systems has been done on a utility scale with different performance indicators. This paper introduces a multifaceted comparative analysis including various aspects like energy generation, reliability, environmental effect, economic viability, and footprint area. Real measured data, including ambient temperature, solar irradiance, and a utility-scale load, were used for studying both systems in the City of Detroit. The optimal system sizing and energy management strategy are attained using the Whale optimization algorithm. Minimizing the loss of power supply probability and sizing the number of photovoltaic panels (NPV) are carried out for both cases. Results revealed that the bifacial solar system generates more power with a lower NPV, a smaller installation area, and hence a lower levelized cost of energy for the entire project lifetime compared to the monofacial system. Accordingly, the bifacial system outlined in this paper is recommended and can be implemented in various locations to establish a sustainable solar energy system that is economically feasible with clean energy production for the entire project's lifespan.</description>

      <title>Distributed Intrusion Detection System using Semantic-based Rules for SCADA in Smart Grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyber-physical system (CPS) security for the smart grid enables secure communication for the SCADA and wide-area measurement system data. Power utilities world-wide use various SCADA protocols, namely DNP3, Modbus, and IEC 61850, for the data exchanges across substation field devices, remote terminal units (RTUs), and control center applications. Adversaries may exploit compromised SCADA protocols for the reconnaissance, data exfiltration, vulnerability assessment, and injection of stealthy cyberattacks to affect power system operation. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm to generate robust rule sets. We integrate the rule sets into an intrusion detection system (IDS), which continuously monitors the DNP3 data traffic at a substation network and detects intrusions and anomalies in real-time. To enable CPS-aware wide-area situational awareness, we integrated the methodology into an open-source distributed-IDS (D-IDS) framework. The D-IDS facilitates central monitoring of the detected anomalies from the geographically distributed substations and to the control center. The proposed algorithm provides an optimal solution to detect network intrusions and abnormal behavior. Different types of IDS rules based on packet payload, packet flow, and time threshold are generated. Further, IDS testing and evaluation is performed with a set of rules in different sequences. The detection time is measured for different IDS rules, and the results are plotted. All the experiments are conducted at Power Cyber Lab, Iowa State University, for multiple power grid models. After successful testing and evaluation, knowledge and implementation are transferred to field deployment.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Assessment of Vehicle-to-Grid Capabilities in Supporting Grid During Emergencies: Case Study of Travis County, TX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As extreme weather events become more common and threaten power grids, the continuing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) introduces a growing opportunity for their use as a distributed energy storage resource. This energy storage can be used as backup generation through the use of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, where electricity is sent back from EV batteries to the grid. With enough participation from EV owners, V2G can mitigate outages during grid emergencies. In order to investigate a practical application of V2G, this study leverages a vast array of real-world data, such as survey results on V2G participation willingness, historical outage data within ERCOT, current EV registrations, and demographic data. This data informs realistic emergency grid scenarios with V2G support using a synthetic transmission grid for Travis County. The results find that as EV ownership rises in the coming years, the simultaneous facilitation of bidirectional charging availability would allow for V2G to play a substantial role in preventing involuntary load shed as a result of emergencies like winter storms.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The capabilities of automated vehicles are advancing rapidly, yet achieving full autonomy remains a significant challenge, requiring ongoing human cognition in decision-making processes. Incorporating human cognition into control algorithms has become increasingly important, as researchers work to develop strategies that minimize conflicts between human drivers and AI systems. Despite notable progress, many challenges persist, underscoring the need for further innovation and refinement in this field. This review covers recent progress in human-vehicle interaction (HVI) and AI collaboration for vehicle control. First, we start by looking at how HVI has evolved, pointing out key developments and identifying persistent problems. Second, we discuss the existing techniques, including methods for integrating human intuition and cognition into decision-making processes and developing systems that can mimic human behavior to enable optimal driving strategies and achieve safer and more efficient transportation. This review aims to contribute to the development of more effective and adaptive automated driving systems by enhancing human-AI collaboration.</description>

      <title>Offset-free model predictive control: stability under plant-model mismatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first general stability results for nonlinear offset-free model predictive control (MPC). Despite over twenty years of active research, the offset-free MPC literature has not shaken the assumption of closed-loop stability for establishing offset-free performance. In this paper, we present a nonlinear offset-free MPC design that is robustly stable with respect to the tracking errors, and thus achieves offset-free performance, despite plant-model mismatch and persistent disturbances. Key features and assumptions of this design include quadratic costs, differentiability of the plant and model functions, constraint backoffs at steady state, and a robustly stable state and disturbance estimator. We first establish nominal stability and offset-free performance. Then, robustness to state and disturbance estimate errors and setpoint and disturbance changes is demonstrated. Finally, the results are extended to sufficiently small plant-model mismatch. The results are illustrated by numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Rigid Communication Topologies: Impact on Stability, Safety, Energy Consumption, Passenger Comfort, and Robustness of Vehicular Platoons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of rigid communication topologies (RCTs) on the performance of vehicular platoons, aiming to identify beneficial features in RCTs that enhance vehicles behavior. We introduce four performance metrics, focusing on safety, energy consumption, passenger comfort, and robustness of vehicular platoons. The safety metric is based on momentary distances between neighboring vehicles, their relative velocities, and relative accelerations. Thus, to have access to these relative values, we formulate the coupled dynamics between pairs of neighboring vehicles, considering initial conditions (position, velocity, acceleration), leader vehicle's velocity/acceleration trajectory, deployed RCT, and vehicles' parity/disparity. By decoupling the dynamics using a mapping matrix structured on deployed RCT, vehicles' features, and control gains, precise formulations for distance errors, relative velocities, and relative accelerations between all neighboring vehicles, over the travel time, are obtained. Comparing performance metric results across RCTs highlights that downstream information transmission-from vehicles ahead, particularly the leader vehicle, to vehicles behind-significantly enhances platoon stability, safety, energy consumption, and passenger comfort metrics. Conversely, receiving state information from vehicles behind degrades metrics, compromising safety, increasing energy consumption, and reducing passenger comfort. These findings underscore that forward-looking, leader-centric communications between vehicles markedly enhance platoon efficiency and safety.</description>

      <title>SRFS: Parallel Processing Fault-tolerant ROS2-based Flight Software for the Space Ranger Cubesat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional real-time operating systems (RTOS) often exhibit poor parallel performance, while thread monitoring in Linux-based systems presents significant challenges. To address these issues, this paper proposes a satellite flight software system design based on the Robot Operating System (ROS), leveraging ROS's built-in reliable publish-subscribe messaging mechanism for inter-application communication. Considering the complex functional requirements of modern small satellites, the design incorporates both hardware and software architecture, alongside system scheduling and error-correction mechanisms. This approach ensures efficient parallel data processing and system reliability, while also reducing the development cycle through code reuse. Comprehensive testing, including system time delay, system management, fault tolerance, and system maintenance, was conducted to validate the system's capabilities in telemetry, remote control, new feature integration, and autonomous error correction. The results demonstrate the high reliability and ease of maintenance of the satellite flight software offering a reference framework for the rapid development of high-performance small satellite operations systems.</description>

      <title>Neural Operator Feedback for a First-Order PIDE with Spatially-Varying State Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A transport PDE with a spatial integral and recirculation with constant delay has been a benchmark for neural operator approximations of PDE backstepping controllers. Introducing a spatially-varying delay into the model gives rise to a gain operator defined through integral equations which the operator's input -- the varying delay function -- enters in previously unencountered manners, including in the limits of integration and as the inverse of the `delayED time' function. This, in turn, introduces novel mathematical challenges in estimating the operator's Lipschitz constant. The backstepping kernel function having two branches endows the feedback law with a two-branch structure, where only one of the two feedback branches depends on both of the kernel branches. For this rich feedback structure, we propose a neural operator approximation of such a two-branch feedback law and prove the approximator to be semiglobally practically stabilizing. With numerical results we illustrate the training of the neural operator and its stabilizing capability.</description>

      <title>Toward Near-Globally Optimal Nonlinear Model Predictive Control via Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving global optimality in nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) is challenging due to the non-convex nature of the underlying optimization problem. Since commonly employed local optimization techniques depend on carefully chosen initial guesses, this non-convexity often leads to suboptimal performance resulting from local optima. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel diffusion model-based approach for near-globally optimal NMPC consisting of an offline and an online phase. The offline phase employs a local optimizer to sample from the distribution of optimal NMPC control sequences along generated system trajectories through random initial guesses. Subsequently, the generated diverse data set is used to train a diffusion model to reflect the multi-modal distribution of optima. In the online phase, the trained model is leveraged to efficiently perform a variant of random shooting optimization to obtain near-globally optimal control sequences without relying on any initial guesses or online NMPC solving. The effectiveness of our approach is illustrated in a numerical simulation indicating high performance benefits compared to direct neural network approximations of NMPC and significantly lower computation times than online solving NMPC using global optimizers.</description>

      <title>TGOSPA Metric Parameters Selection and Evaluation for Visual Multi-object Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-object tracking algorithms are deployed in various applications, each with unique performance requirements. For example, track switches pose significant challenges for offline scene understanding, as they hinder the accuracy of data interpretation. Conversely, in online surveillance applications, their impact is often minimal. This disparity underscores the need for application-specific performance evaluations that are both simple and mathematically sound. The trajectory generalized optimal sub-pattern assignment (TGOSPA) metric offers a principled approach to evaluate multi-object tracking performance. It accounts for localization errors, the number of missed and false objects, and the number of track switches, providing a comprehensive assessment framework. This paper illustrates the effective use of the TGOSPA metric in computer vision tasks, addressing challenges posed by the need for application-specific scoring methodologies. By exploring the TGOSPA parameter selection, we enable users to compare, comprehend, and optimize the performance of algorithms tailored for specific tasks, such as target tracking and training of detector or re-ID modules.</description>

      <title>Th\'evenin Equivalent Parameters Identification Based on Statistical Characteristics of System Ambient Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method for identifying Th\'evenin equivalent parameters (TEP) in power system, based on the statistical characteristics of the system's stochastic response. The method leverages stochastic fluctuation data under steady-state grid conditions and applies sliding window techniques to compute sensitivity parameters between voltage magnitude, current magnitude and power. This enables high-accuracy and robust TEP identification. In contrast to traditional methods, the proposed approach does not rely on large disturbances or probing signals but instead utilizes the natural fluctuation behavior of the system. Additionally, the method supports distributed implementation using local measurements of voltage magnitude, current magnitude, and power, offering significant practical value for engineering applications. The theoretical analysis demonstrates the method's robustness in the presence of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), asynchronous measurements, and data collinearity issues. Simulation results further confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method in diverse practical scenarios, demonstrating its ability to consistently provide accurate and reliable identification of TEP using system ambient data.</description>

      <title>First Principles based High-precision Modelling and Identification of Piezoelectric Fast Steering Mirror</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a high-precision composite model for a piezoelectric fast steering mirror (PFSM) using a Hammerstein structure. A novel asymmetric Bouc-Wen model is proposed to describe the nonlinear rate-independent hysteresis, while a dynamic model is derived to represent the linear rate-dependent component. By analyzing the physical process from the displacement of the piezoelectric actuator to the angle of the PFSM, cross-axis coupling is modeled based on first principles. Given the dynamic isolation of each module on different frequency scales, a step-by-step method for model parameter identification is carried out. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the identified parameters can accurately represent the hysteresis, creep, and mechanical dynamic characteristics of the PFSM. Furthermore, by comparing the outputs of the identified model with the real PFSM under different excitation signals, the effectiveness of the proposed dual-input dual-output composite model is validated.</description>

      <title>Open-Loop and Model Predictive Control for Electric Vehicle Charging to Manage Excess Renewable Energy Supply in Texas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern power grids are evolving to become more interconnected, include more electric vehicles (EVs), and utilize more renewable energy sources (RES). Increased interconnectivity provides an opportunity to manage EVs and RES by using price signaling to shift EV loads towards periods of high RES output. This work uses ERCOT's 2035 RES installation plans and projections for Texas's EV fleet to examine and compare how both open-loop control and model predictive control (MPC) schemes can leverage time varying rates for EV charging to utilize excess RES supply that may otherwise be underutilized in a highly weather-dependent grid. The results show that while open-loop control increases RES usage, MPC increases RES usage even further by responding to RES outputs that differ from forecasts due to the inherent uncertainty of weather predictions. If MPC is used with time steps that are too frequent, however, difficulties arise; EV owners may find it too onerous to keep up with changing price structures, and frequent over-corrections to charging profiles can lead to a ``rebound peak" phenomenon. Therefore, control schemes should balance maximizing RES usage with ensuring customer participation.</description>

Abstract: Accurate and reliable electricity price forecasting has significant practical implications for grid management, renewable energy integration, power system planning, and price volatility management. This study focuses on enhancing electricity price forecasting in California's grid, addressing challenges from complex generation data and heteroskedasticity. Utilizing principal component analysis (PCA), we analyze CAISO's hourly electricity prices and demand from 2016-2021 to improve day-ahead forecasting accuracy. Initially, we apply traditional outlier analysis with the interquartile range method, followed by robust PCA (RPCA) for more effective outlier elimination. This approach improves data symmetry and reduces skewness. We then construct multiple linear regression models using both raw and PCA-transformed features. The model with transformed features, refined through traditional and SAS Sparse Matrix outlier removal methods, shows superior forecasting performance. The SAS Sparse Matrix method, in particular, significantly enhances model accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that PCA-based methods are key in advancing electricity price forecasting, supporting renewable integration and grid management in day-ahead markets.
  Keywords: Electricity price forecasting, principal component analysis (PCA), power system planning, heteroskedasticity, renewable energy integration.</description>

      <title>SINERGYM -- A virtual testbed for building energy optimization with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulation has become a crucial tool for Building Energy Optimization (BEO) as it enables the evaluation of different design and control strategies at a low cost. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can leverage large-scale simulations to learn optimal control from vast amounts of data without supervision, particularly under the Reinforcement Learning (RL) paradigm. Unfortunately, the lack of open and standardized tools has hindered the widespread application of ML and RL to BEO. To address this issue, this paper presents Sinergym, an open-source Python-based virtual testbed for large-scale building simulation, data collection, continuous control, and experiment monitoring. Sinergym provides a consistent interface for training and running controllers, predefined benchmarks, experiment visualization and replication support, and comprehensive documentation in a ready-to-use software library. This paper 1) highlights the main features of Sinergym in comparison to other existing frameworks, 2) describes its basic usage, and 3) demonstrates its applicability for RL-based BEO through several representative examples. By integrating simulation, data, and control, Sinergym supports the development of intelligent, data-driven applications for more efficient and responsive building operations, aligning with the objectives of digital twin technology.</description>

      <title>Noise-Aware Bayesian Optimization Approach for Capacity Planning of the Distributed Energy Resources in an Active Distribution Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing penetration of renewable energy sources (RESs) in active distribution networks (ADNs) leads to complex and uncertain operation scenarios, resulting in significant deviations and risks for the ADN operation. In this study, a collaborative capacity planning of the distributed energy resources in an ADN is proposed to enhance the RES accommodation capability. The variability of RESs, characteristics of adjustable demand response resources, ADN bi-directional power flow, and security operation limitations are considered in the proposed model. To address the noise term caused by the inevitable deviation between the operation simulation and real-world environments, an improved noise-aware Bayesian optimization algorithm with the probabilistic surrogate model is proposed to overcome the interference from the environmental noise and sample-efficiently optimize the capacity planning model under noisy circumstances. Numerical simulation results verify the superiority of the proposed approach in coping with environmental noise and achieving lower annual cost and higher computation efficiency.</description>

      <title>SwarmGPT-Primitive: A Language-Driven Choreographer for Drone Swarms Using Safe Motion Primitive Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Catalyzed by advancements in hardware and software, drone performances are increasingly making their mark in the entertainment industry. However, designing smooth and safe choreographies for drone swarms is complex and often requires expert domain knowledge. In this work, we introduce SwarmGPT-Primitive, a language-based choreographer that integrates the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with safe motion planning to facilitate deployable drone swarm choreographies. The LLM composes choreographies for a given piece of music by utilizing a library of motion primitives; the language-based choreographer is augmented with an optimization-based safety filter, which certifies the choreography for real-world deployment by making minimal adjustments when feasibility and safety constraints are violated. The overall SwarmGPT-Primitive framework decouples choreographic design from safe motion planning, which allows non-expert users to re-prompt and refine compositions without concerns about compliance with constraints such as avoiding collisions or downwash effects or satisfying actuation limits. We demonstrate our approach through simulations and experiments with swarms of up to 20 drones performing choreographies designed based on various songs, highlighting the system's ability to generate effective and synchronized drone choreographies for real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Local Identifiability of Networks with Nonlinear Node Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the identifiability of nonlinear network systems with partial excitation and partial measurement when the network dynamics is linear on the edges and nonlinear on the nodes. We assume that the graph topology and the nonlinear functions at the node level are known, and we aim to identify the weight matrix of the graph. Our main result is to prove that fully-connected layered feed-forward networks are generically locally identifiable by exciting sources and measuring sinks in the class of analytic functions that cross the origin. This holds even when all other nodes remain unexcited and unmeasured and stands in sharp contrast to most findings on network identifiability requiring measurement and/or excitation of each node. The result applies in particular to feed-forward artificial neural networks with no offsets and generalizes previous literature by considering a broader class of functions and topologies.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Trajectory Generation for Soft Robot Manipulators Using Differential Flatness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft robots have the potential to interact with sensitive environments and perform complex tasks effectively. However, motion plans and trajectories for soft manipulators are challenging to calculate due to their deformable nature and nonlinear dynamics. This article introduces a fast real-time trajectory generation approach for soft robot manipulators, which creates dynamically-feasible motions for arbitrary kinematically-feasible paths of the robot's end effector. Our insight is that piecewise constant curvature (PCC) dynamics models of soft robots can be differentially flat, therefore control inputs can be calculated algebraically rather than through a nonlinear differential equation. We prove this flatness under certain conditions, with the curvatures of the robot as the flat outputs. Our two-step trajectory generation approach uses an inverse kinematics procedure to calculate a motion plan of robot curvatures per end-effector position, then, our flatness diffeomorphism generates corresponding control inputs that respect velocity. We validate our approach through simulations of our representative soft robot manipulator along three different trajectories, demonstrating a margin of 23x faster than real-time at a frequency of 100 Hz. This approach could allow fast verifiable replanning of soft robots' motions in safety-critical physical environments, crucial for deployment in the real world.</description>

Abstract: Automated vehicle (AV) platooning has the potential to improve the safety, operational, and energy efficiency of surface transportation systems by limiting or eliminating human involvement in the driving tasks. The theoretical validity of the AV platooning strategies has been established and practical applications are being tested under real-world conditions. The emergence of sensors, communication, and control strategies has resulted in rapid and constant evolution of AV platooning strategies. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art knowledge in AV longitudinal platoon formation using a five-component platooning framework, which includes vehicle model, information-receiving process, information flow topology, spacing policy, and controller and discuss the advantages and limitations of the components. Based on the discussion about existing strategies and associated limitations, potential future research directions are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11076v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In adaptive control theory, the dynamic regressor extension and mixing (DREM) procedure has become widespread as it allows one to describe major of adaptive control problems in unified terms of the parameter estimation problem of a regression equation with a scalar regressor. However, when the system/parameterization is affected by perturbations, the estimation laws, which are designed on the basis of such equation, asymptotically provides only biased estimates. In this paper, based on the bias-eliminated least-squares (BELS) approach, a modification of DREM procedure is proposed to annihilate perturbations asymptotically and, consequently, asymptotically obtain unbiased estimates. The theoretical results are supported with mathematical modelling and can be used to design adaptive observers and control systems.</description>

      <title>Meta-Learning for Adaptive Control with Automated Mirror Descent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adaptive control achieves concurrent parameter learning and stable control under uncertainties that are linearly parameterized with known nonlinear features. Nonetheless, it is often difficult to obtain such nonlinear features. To address this difficulty, recent progress has been made in integrating meta-learning with adaptive control to learn such nonlinear features from data. However, these meta-learning-based control methods rely on classical adaptation laws using gradient descent, which is confined to the Euclidean geometry. In this paper, we propose a novel method that combines meta-learning and adaptation laws based on mirror descent, a popular generalization of gradient descent, which takes advantage of the potentially non-Euclidean geometry of the parameter space. In our approach, meta-learning not only learns the nonlinear features but also searches for a suitable mirror-descent potential function that optimizes control performance. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in learning efficient representations and real-time tracking control performance under uncertain dynamics.</description>

      <title>Practical Challenges for Reliable RIS Deployment in Heterogeneous Multi-Operator Multi-Band Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have been introduced as arrays of nearly passive elements with software-tunable electromagnetic properties to dynamically manipulate the reflection/transmission of radio signals. Research works in this area are focused on two applications, namely {\it user-assist} RIS aiming at tuning the RIS to enhance the quality-of-service (QoS) of target users, and the {\it malicious} RIS aiming for an attacker to degrade the QoS at victim receivers through generating {\it intended} destructive interference. While both user-assist and malicious RIS applications have been explored extensively, the impact of RIS deployments on imposing {\it unintended} interference on various wireless user-equipments (EUs) remains underexplored. This paper investigates the challenges of integrating RISs into multi-carrier, multi-user, and multi-operator networks. We discuss how RIS deployments intended to benefit specific users can negatively impact other users served at various carrier frequencies through different network operators. While not an ideal solution, we discuss how ultra-narrowband metasurfaces can be incorporated into the manufacturing of RISs to mitigate some challenges of RIS deployment in wireless networks. We also present a simulation scenario to illuminate some practical challenges associated with the deployment of RISs in shared public environments.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Bayesian Filtering with Natural Gradient Gaussian Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15832v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Practical Bayes filters often assume the state distribution of each time step to be Gaussian for computational tractability, resulting in the so-called Gaussian filters. When facing nonlinear systems, Gaussian filters such as extended Kalman filter (EKF) or unscented Kalman filter (UKF) typically rely on certain linearization techniques, which can introduce large estimation errors. To address this issue, this paper reconstructs the prediction and update steps of Gaussian filtering as solutions to two distinct optimization problems, whose optimal conditions are found to have analytical forms from Stein's lemma. It is observed that the stationary point for the prediction step requires calculating the first two moments of the prior distribution, which is equivalent to that step in existing moment-matching filters. In the update step, instead of linearizing the model to approximate the stationary points, we propose an iterative approach to directly minimize the update step's objective to avoid linearization errors. For the purpose of performing the steepest descent on the Gaussian manifold, we derive its natural gradient that leverages Fisher information matrix to adjust the gradient direction, accounting for the curvature of the parameter space. Combining this update step with moment matching in the prediction step, we introduce a new iterative filter for nonlinear systems called \textit{N}atural Gr\textit{a}dient Gaussia\textit{n} Appr\textit{o}ximation filter, or NANO filter for short. We prove that NANO filter locally converges to the optimal Gaussian approximation at each time step. Furthermore, the estimation error is proven exponentially bounded for nearly linear measurement equation and low noise levels through constructing a supermartingale-like property across consecutive time steps.</description>

      <title>Space-Time Decoupled Metasurface Integrating Reflective Mixer and Phase Shifter Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01863v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electromagnetic (EM) information metasurface represents a class of 2D metamaterials that can swiftly manipulate their EM characteristics to convey specific information. Past researches present various strategies for embedding information within ambient EM waves through the superposition of time-varying quantized properties for each unit. Despite their capabilities, these approaches alone are insufficient for concurrently but independently realizing the creation of information and the allocation of spatial energy. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive approach named the space-time decoupled metasurface (STD-Metasurface), facilitating the simultaneous and independent control of information modulation and passive beamforming by incorporating reflective mixer and phase shifter functionalities into each unit. As a proof of concept, we present a minimalist design of single-diode unit where the ingenious utilization of analog switch bonds the digital signal and analog signal together. By inputting baseband analogue signals in a specific level range, STD-Metasurface prototype is capable of modulating them onto the envelopes of reflected EM waves without distortion meanwhile controlling the reflected radiation patterns by digital signals, even waveform superposition and spatial multiplexing. To demonstrate the superior capabilities of the STD-Metasurface, we have developed an experimental platform to highlight its practicality and potential applications as a reconfigurable backscatter transmitter and a dynamic Doppler-spoofing reflector array.</description>

      <title>A switching Kalman filter approach to online mitigation and correction of sensor corruption for inertial navigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to detect and address faulty or corrupted external sensors in the context of inertial navigation by leveraging a switching Kalman Filter combined with parameter augmentation. Instead of discarding the corrupted data, the proposed method retains and processes it, running multiple observation models simultaneously and evaluating their likelihoods to accurately identify the true state of the system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach to both identify the moment that a sensor becomes faulty and to correct for the resulting sensor behavior to maintain accurate estimates. We demonstrate our approach on an application of balloon navigation in the atmosphere and shuttle reentry. The results show that our method can accurately recover the true system state even in the presence of significant sensor bias, thereby improving the robustness and reliability of state estimation systems under challenging conditions. We also provide a statistical analysis of problem settings to determine when and where our method is most accurate and where it fails.</description>

      <title>MARec: Metadata Alignment for cold-start Recommendation</title>

Abstract: For many recommender systems, the primary data source is a historical record of user clicks. The associated click matrix is often very sparse, as the number of users x products can be far larger than the number of clicks. Such sparsity is accentuated in cold-start settings, which makes the efficient use of metadata information of paramount importance. In this work, we propose a simple approach to address cold-start recommendations by leveraging content metadata, Metadata Alignment for cold-start Recommendation. We show that this approach can readily augment existing matrix factorization and autoencoder approaches, enabling a smooth transition to top performing algorithms in warmer set-ups. Our experimental results indicate three separate contributions: first, we show that our proposed framework largely beats SOTA results on 4 cold-start datasets with different sparsity and scale characteristics, with gains ranging from +8.4% to +53.8% on reported ranking metrics; second, we provide an ablation study on the utility of semantic features, and proves the additional gain obtained by leveraging such features ranges between +46.8% and +105.5%; and third, our approach is by construction highly competitive in warm set-ups, and we propose a closed-form solution outperformed by SOTA results by only 0.8% on average.</description>

      <title>Large width penalization for neural network-based prediction interval estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Forecasting accuracy in highly uncertain environments is challenging due to the stochastic nature of systems. Deterministic forecasting provides only point estimates and cannot capture potential outcomes. Therefore, probabilistic forecasting has gained significant attention due to its ability to quantify uncertainty, where one of the approaches is to express it as a prediction interval (PI), that explicitly shows upper and lower bounds of predictions associated with a confidence level. High-quality PI is characterized by a high PI coverage probability (PICP) and a narrow PI width. In many real-world applications, the PI width is generally used in risk management to prepare resources that improve reliability and effectively manage uncertainty. A wider PI width results in higher costs for backup resources as decision-making processes often focus on the worst-case scenarios arising with large PI widths under extreme conditions. This study aims to reduce the large PI width from the PI estimation method by proposing a new PI loss function that penalizes the average of the large PI widths more heavily. The proposed formulation is compatible with gradient-based algorithms, the standard approach to training neural networks (NNs), and integrating state-of-the-art NNs and existing deep learning techniques. Experiments with the synthetic dataset reveal that our formulation significantly reduces the large PI width while effectively maintaining the PICP to achieve the desired probability. The practical implementation of our proposed loss function is demonstrated in solar irradiance forecasting, highlighting its effectiveness in minimizing the large PI width in data with high uncertainty and showcasing its compatibility with more complex neural network models. Therefore, reducing large PI widths from our method can lead to significant cost savings by over-allocation of reserve resources.</description>
