      <title>Karhunen-Lo\`eve Expansion-Based Residual Anomaly Map for Resource-Efficient Glioma MRI Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11833v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of brain tumors is essential for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. Deep learning is currently the state-of-the-art for brain tumor segmentation, yet it requires either large datasets or extensive computational resources that are inaccessible in most areas. This makes the problem increasingly difficult: state-of-the-art models use thousands of training cases and vast computational power, where performance drops sharply when either is limited. The top performer in the Brats GLI 2023 competition relied on supercomputers trained on over 92,000 augmented MRI scans using an AMD EPYC 7402 CPU, six NVIDIA RTX 6000 GPUs (48GB VRAM each), and 1024GB of RAM over multiple weeks. To address this, the Karhunen--Lo\`eve Expansion (KLE) was implemented as a feature extraction step on downsampled, z-score normalized MRI volumes. Each 240$\times$240$\times$155 multi-modal scan is reduced to four $48^3$ channels and compressed into 32 KL coefficients. The resulting approximate reconstruction enables a residual-based anomaly map, which is upsampled and added as a fifth channel to a compact 3D U-Net. All experiments were run on a consumer workstation (AMD Ryzen 5 7600X CPU, RTX 4060Ti (8GB VRAM), and 64GB RAM while using far fewer training cases. This model achieves post-processed Dice scores of 0.929 (WT), 0.856 (TC), and 0.821 (ET), with HD95 distances of 2.93, 6.78, and 10.35 voxels. These results are significantly better than the winning BraTS 2023 methodology for HD95 distances and WT dice scores. This demonstrates that a KLE-based residual anomaly map can dramatically reduce computational cost and data requirements while retaining state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Chargaff's second parity rule and the kinetics of DNA replication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A model of DNA replication is investigated, which is based on the biochemical kinetics of DNA polymerases, copying a DNA strand into its complement, except for rare point-like mutations due to nucleotide substitutions. Numerical simulations of many successive replications starting from an initial DNA sequence show that the fractions of mono- and oligonucleotides converge toward compliance with Chargaff's second parity rule. The theory of this multireplication process reveals that the approximate equalities between the fractions of complementary nucleotides are the consequence of (1) the dominant role of complementarity in the DNA replication kinetic process and (2) the smallness of the polymerase error probability. These two features lead to a robust mechanism underlying Chargaff's second parity rule.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Spatial Omics: From Data Acquisition to Computational Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in spatial omics technologies have enabled the generation of high dimensional molecular data, such as transcriptomes, proteomes, and epigenomes, within their spatial tissue context, either through coprofiling on the same slice or through serial tissue sections. These datasets, which are often complemented by images, have given rise to multimodal frameworks that capture both the cellular and architectural complexity of tissues across multiple molecular layers. Integration in such multimodal data poses significant computational challenges due to differences in scale, resolution, and data modality. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of computational methods developed to integrate multimodal spatial omics and imaging datasets. We highlight key algorithmic principles underlying these methods, ranging from probabilistic to the latest deep learning approaches.</description>

      <title>Identifying Therapeutic Targets for Triple-Negative Breast Cancer using a Novel Mathematical Model of the Tumor Microenvironment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive disease with high mortality and limited treatment options, due to its lack of receptors that have targeted therapies available. The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a critical role in TNBC progression and therapeutic resistance. In this work, we developed a novel mathematical model to describe key cellular interactions within the TNBC TME, informed by current literature and expert input. Our model consists of a system of ordinary differential equations representing five interacting cell populations: M2 macrophages, cancer-associated fibroblasts, TNBC tumor cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and regulatory T cells. We performed global sensitivity analysis to determine which model parameters most strongly influence tumor burden over a clinically-relevant treatment timeframe. The pathways associated with the most-influential parameters correspond to biological mechanisms that are consistent with known and emerging therapeutic strategies in TNBC, including stromal-mediated tumor support. These results highlight key regulatory interactions within the TNBC TME and provide a quantitative framework for hypothesis generation and future investigation of combination treatment strategies.</description>

      <title>Pollutant-induced changes in fish pigmentation and spatial patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pigmentation abnormalities, ranging from hypo- to hyperpigmentation, can serve as biomarkers of developmental disruption in fish exposed to environmental contaminants. However, the mechanistic pathways underlying these alterations remain poorly understood. Studies have shown that pattern formation in fish development requires specific pigment cell interactions. Motivated by experimental observations of pigmentation alterations following contaminant exposure, we investigate how pollutants influence pigment cell self-organization using a continuum reaction-diffusion-advection framework. The model incorporates nonlocal Morse-type kernels to describe short- and long-range interactions among melanophores and xanthophores. Our results show that perturbations to the strengths of adhesion or repulsion can drive transitions between stripes, spots, and mixed patterns, reproducing phenotypes characteristic of fish pigmentation mutants. In particular, homotypic interactions are sensitive to contamination, leading to pronounced changes in melanophore density and resulting pigmentation patterns. Time-dependent simulations indicate that pigment changes from early short-term contaminant exposure may be recoverable, whereas prolonged exposure can lead to sustained pigment loss. In a growing fish, contaminant-induced changes in cell-cell interactions directly influence stripe formation rate, stripe number, and pigmentation levels. Overall, our study provides insight into the mechanistic link between experimentally observed pigmentation alterations and the changes in spatial patterns of adult fish.</description>

      <title>A tropical geometry for bounded biochemical state spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many biochemical measurements define state spaces that are bounded, absorbing, and physically irreversible, yet are routinely analysed using linear and Euclidean frameworks that assume global invertibility, symmetry, and translation invariance. This mismatch can irretrievably obscure biological structure, independent of data quality, scale, or preprocessing. This work formalises the structure of bounded biochemical state spaces using cysteine redox regulation as a representative example and identify the minimal algebraic properties required for categorically correct representation. Hard boundaries, absorbing states, and irreversible ensemble dynamics render linear algebra incompatible with these objects. This work demonstrates that tropical algebra provides a natural realisation of the required properties by replacing additive linear structure with order-based, piecewise-linear operations that encode dominance, saturation, and path dependence without contradiction. By making non-invertibility and absorption explicit rather than implicit, this framework resolves a fundamental algebraic mismatch and establishes a principled foundation for the representation and analysis of bounded biochemical data.</description>

      <title>A First Step for Expansion X-Ray Microscopy: Achieving Contrast in Expanded Tissues Sufficient to Reveal Cell Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing methods in nanoscale connectomics are at present too slow to map entire mammalian brains. As an emerging approach, expansion microscopy (ExM) has enormous promise, yet it still suffers from throughput limitations. Mapping the human brain and even mapping nonhuman primate brains therefore remain distant goals. While ExM increases effective resolution linearly, it enlarges tissue volume cubically, which dramatically increases imaging time. As a rapid tomographic technique, X-ray microscopy has potential for drastically speeding up large-volume connectomics. But to the best of my knowledge, no group has so far imaged cellular features within expanded tissue using X-ray microscopy. I herein present an early-stage report featuring the first demonstration of X-ray microscopy reconstruction of cell bodies within expanded tissue. This was achieved by combining a modified enzymatic Unclearing technique with a metallic gold stain and imaging using a laboratory X-ray microscope. I emphasize that a great deal of work remains to develop "expansion X-ray microscopy" (ExXRM) to the point where it can be useful for connectomics since the current iteration of ExXRM only resolves cell bodies and not neurites due to extensive off-target staining. Additionally, the current method must be modified to accommodate for the challenges of synchrotron X-ray microscopy, a vastly speedier approach than laboratory X-ray microscopy. Nonetheless, achieving X-ray contrast in expanded tissues represents a significant first step towards realizing ExXRM as a connectomics imaging modality.</description>

      <title>A Joint Survival Modeling and Therapy Knowledge Graph Framework to Characterize Opioid Use Disorder Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivation: Opioid use disorder (OUD) often arises after prescription opioid exposure and follows transitions among onset, remission, and relapse. Linked EHR-survey resources such as the All of Us Research Program enable stage-specific risk modeling and connection to intervention options. Results: We built a multi-stage framework to model time-to-onset, time-to-remission, and time-to-relapse after remission using All of Us EHR and survey data. For each participant we derived longitudinal predictors from clinical conditions and survey concepts, including recent (1/3/12-month) event counts, cumulative exposures, and time since last event. We fit regularized Cox models for each transition and aggregated selection frequencies and hazard ratios to identify a compact set of high-confidence predictors. Pain, mental health, and polysubstance use contributed across stages: chronic pain syndromes, tobacco/nicotine dependence, anxiety and depressive disorders, and cannabis dependence prominently predicted onset and relapse, whereas tobacco dependence during remission and other remission-coded conditions were strongly associated with transition to remission. To support therapeutic prioritization, we constructed a therapy knowledge graph integrating genetic targets, biological pathways, and published evidence to map identified risk factors to candidate treatments in recent OUD studies and clinical guidelines.</description>

      <title>SCG With Your Phone: Diagnosis of Rhythmic Spectrum Disorders in Field Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aortic valve opening (AO) events are crucial for detecting frequency and rhythm disorders, especially in real-world settings where seismocardiography (SCG) signals collected via consumer smartphones are subject to noise, motion artifacts, and variability caused by device heterogeneity. In this work, we present a robust deep-learning framework for SCG segmentation and rhythm analysis using accelerometer recordings obtained with consumer smartphones. We develop an enhanced U-Net v3 architecture that integrates multi-scale convolutions, residual connections, and attention gates, enabling reliable segmentation of noisy SCG signals. A dedicated post-processing pipeline converts probability masks into precise AO timestamps, whereas a novel adaptive 3D-to-1D projection method ensures robustness to arbitrary smartphone orientation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves consistently high accuracy and robustness across various device types and unsupervised data-collection conditions. Our approach enables practical, low-cost, and automated cardiac-rhythm monitoring using everyday mobile devices, paving the way for scalable, field-deployable cardiovascular assessment and future multimodal diagnostic systems.</description>

      <title>Explainable histomorphology-based survival prediction of glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype (GBM-IDHwt) is the most common malignant brain tumor. Histomorphology is a crucial component of the integrated diagnosis of GBM-IDHwt. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods have shown promise to extract additional prognostic information from histological whole-slide images (WSI) of hematoxylin and eosin-stained glioblastoma tissue. Here, we present an explainable AI-based method to support systematic interpretation of histomorphological features associated with survival. It combines an explainable multiple instance learning (MIL) architecture with a sparse autoencoder (SAE) to relate human-interpretable visual patterns of tissue to survival. The MIL architecture directly identifies prognosis-relevant image tiles and the SAE maps these tiles post-hoc to visual patterns. The MIL method was trained and evaluated using a new real-world dataset that comprised 720 GBM-IDHwt cases from three hospitals and four cancer registries in Germany. The SAE was trained using 1878 WSIs of glioblastoma from five independent public data collections. Despite the many factors influencing survival time, our method showed some ability to discriminate between patients living less than 180 days or more than 360 days solely based on histomorphology (AUC: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.63-0.72). Cox proportional hazards regression confirmed a significant difference in survival time between the predicted groups after adjustment for established prognostic factors (hazard ratio: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.26-1.72). Our method identified multiple interpretable visual patterns associated with survival. Three neuropathologists separately found that 21 of the 24 most strongly associated patterns could be clearly attributed to seven histomorphological categories. Necrosis and hemorrhage appeared to be associated with shorter survival while highly cellular tumor areas were associated with longer survival.</description>

      <title>Accelerated MR Elastography Using Learned Neural Network Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To develop a deep-learning method for achieving fast high-resolution MR elastography from highly undersampled data without the need of high-quality training dataset. We first framed the deep neural network representation as a nonlinear extension of the linear subspace model, then used it to represent and reconstruct MRE image repetitions from undersampled k-space data. The network weights were learned using a multi-level k-space consistent loss in a self-supervised manner. To further enhance reconstruction quality, phase-contrast specific magnitude and phase priors were incorporated, including the similarity of anatomical structures and smoothness of wave-induced harmonic displacement. Experiments were conducted using both 3D gradient-echo spiral and multi-slice spin-echo spiral MRE datasets. Compared to the conventional linear subspace-based approaches, the nonlinear network representation method was able to produce superior image reconstruction with suppressed noise and artifacts from a single in-plane spiral arm per MRE repetition (e.g., total R=10), yielding comparable stiffness estimation to the fully sampled data. This work demonstrated the feasibility of using deep network representations to model and reconstruct MRE images from highly-undersampled data, a nonlinear extension of the subspace-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Persistent Sheaf Laplacian Analysis of Protein Stability and Solubility Changes upon Mutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Genetic mutations frequently disrupt protein structure, stability, and solubility, acting as primary drivers for a wide spectrum of diseases. Despite the critical importance of these molecular alterations, existing computational models often lack interpretability, and fail to integrate essential physicochemical interaction. To overcome these limitations, we propose SheafLapNet, a unified predictive framework grounded in the mathematical theory of Topological Deep Learning (TDL) and Persistent Sheaf Laplacian (PSL). Unlike standard Topological Data Analysis (TDA) tools such as persistent homology, which are often insensitive to heterogeneous information, PSL explicitly encodes specific physical and chemical information such as partial charges directly into the topological analysis. SheafLapNet synergizes these sheaf-theoretic invariants with advanced protein transformer features and auxiliary physical descriptors to capture intrinsic molecular interactions in a multiscale and mechanistic manner. To validate our framework, we employ rigorous benchmarks for both regression and classification tasks. For stability prediction, we utilize the comprehensive S2648 and S350 datasets. For solubility prediction, we employ the PON-Sol2 dataset, which provides annotations for increased, decreased, or neutral solubility changes. By integrating these multi-perspective features, SheafLapNet achieves state-of-the-art performance across these diverse benchmarks, demonstrating that sheaf-theoretic modeling significantly enhances both interpretability and generalizability in predicting mutation-induced structural and functional changes.</description>

      <title>Topology-Aware Multiscale Mixture of Experts for Efficient Molecular Property Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many molecular properties depend on 3D geometry, where non-covalent interactions, stereochemical effects, and medium- to long-range forces are determined by spatial distances and angles that cannot be uniquely captured by a 2D bond graph. Yet most 3D molecular graph neural networks still rely on globally fixed neighborhood heuristics, typically defined by distance cutoffs and maximum neighbor limits, to define local message-passing neighborhoods, leading to rigid, data-agnostic interaction budgets. We propose Multiscale Interaction Mixture of Experts (MI-MoE) to adapt interaction modeling across geometric regimes. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce a distance-cutoff expert ensemble that explicitly captures short-, mid-, and long-range interactions without committing to a single cutoff; (2) we design a topological gating encoder that routes inputs to experts using filtration-based descriptors, including persistent homology features, summarizing how connectivity evolves across radii; and (3) we show that MI-MoE is a plug-in module that consistently improves multiple strong 3D molecular backbones across diverse molecular and polymer property prediction benchmark datasets, covering both regression and classification tasks. These results highlight topology-aware multiscale routing as an effective principle for 3D molecular graph learning.</description>

Abstract: Sickle cell disease causes erythrocytes to become sickle-shaped, affecting their movement in the bloodstream and reducing oxygen delivery. It has a high global prevalence and places a significant burden on healthcare systems, especially in resource-limited regions. Automated classification of sickle cells in blood images is crucial, allowing the specialist to reduce the effort required and avoid errors when quantifying the deformed cells and assessing the severity of a crisis. Recent studies have proposed various erythrocyte representation and classification methods. Since classification depends solely on cell shape, a suitable approach models erythrocytes as closed planar curves in shape space. This approach employs elastic distances between shapes, which are invariant under rotations, translations, scaling, and reparameterizations, ensuring consistent distance measurements regardless of the curves' position, starting point, or traversal speed. While previous methods exploiting shape space distances had achieved high accuracy, we refined the model by considering the geometric characteristics of healthy and sickled erythrocytes. Our method proposes (1) to employ a fixed parameterization based on the major axis of each cell to compute distances and (2) to align each cell with two templates using this parameterization before computing distances. Aligning shapes to templates before distance computation, a concept successfully applied in areas such as molecular dynamics, and using a fixed parameterization, instead of minimizing distances across all possible parameterizations, simplifies calculations. This strategy achieves 96.03\% accuracy rate in both supervised classification and unsupervised clustering. Our method ensures efficient erythrocyte classification, maintaining or improving accuracy over shape space models while significantly reducing computational costs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic kinetic models describe systems across biology, chemistry, and physics where discrete events and small populations render deterministic approximations inadequate. Parameter inference and inverse design in these systems require optimizing over trajectories generated by the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm, but the discrete reaction events involved are inherently non-differentiable. We present an approach based on straight-through Gumbel-Softmax estimation that maintains exact stochastic simulations in the forward pass while approximating gradients through a continuous relaxation applied only in the backward pass. We demonstrate robust performance on parameter inference in stochastic gene expression, accurately recovering kinetic rates of telegraph promoter models from both moment statistics and full steady-state distributions across diverse and challenging parameter regimes. We further demonstrate the method's applicability to inverse design problems in stochastic thermodynamics, characterizing Pareto-optimal trade-offs between non-equilibrium currents and entropy production. The ability to efficiently differentiate through exact stochastic simulations provides a foundation for systematic inference and rational design across the many domains governed by continuous-time Markov dynamics.</description>

Abstract: This study presents a robust methodology for the 3D volumetric reconstruction of native Chileanpollen grains, specifically Gevuina avellana (hazel),Conium maculatum (hemloc) and Anthemis cotula (chamomile). Using a lens-free Digital In-line Holographic Microscopy (DLHM) system, we capture complex interference patterns that are numerically reconstructed using the Kirchhoff-Helmholtz transform. Our results demonstrate that this label-free approach provides high-fidelity morphological characterization and nanometric precision in biophysical parameter extraction, offering a scalable alternative for automated melissopalynology and environmental monitoring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article introduces a computational method, called "Recapture of Diffusive Agents &amp; Particle Swarm Optimization" (RDA-PSO), designed to estimate the dispersal parameter of diffusive insects in mark-release-recapture (MRR) field experiments. In addition to describing the method, its properties are discussed, with particular focus on robustness in estimating the observed diffusion coefficient in the presence of uncertainty. It is shown that RDA-PSO provides a simple and reliable approach to quantify insect dispersal that can handle low recapture rates and uneven capture site distributions without the need for area corrections. Tests on synthetic data, for which the actual diffusion coefficient is known, show the method outperforms three techniques based on the solution of the diffusion equation, which are also introduced in this work. Examples of application to real field data for the yellow fever mosquito are provided.</description>

      <title>ProtSAE: Disentangling and Interpreting Protein Language Models via Semantically-Guided Sparse Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) has emerged as a powerful tool for mechanistic interpretability of large language models. Recent works apply SAE to protein language models (PLMs), aiming to extract and analyze biologically meaningful features from their latent spaces. However, SAE suffers from semantic entanglement, where individual neurons often mix multiple nonlinear concepts, making it difficult to reliably interpret or manipulate model behaviors. In this paper, we propose a semantically-guided SAE, called ProtSAE. Unlike existing SAE which requires annotation datasets to filter and interpret activations, we guide semantic disentanglement during training using both annotation datasets and domain knowledge to mitigate the effects of entangled attributes. We design interpretability experiments showing that ProtSAE learns more biologically relevant and interpretable hidden features compared to previous methods. Performance analyses further demonstrate that ProtSAE maintains high reconstruction fidelity while achieving better results in interpretable probing. We also show the potential of ProtSAE in steering PLMs for downstream generation tasks.</description>

      <title>scMRDR: A scalable and flexible framework for unpaired single-cell multi-omics data integration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in single-cell sequencing have enabled high-resolution profiling of diverse molecular modalities, while integrating unpaired multi-omics single-cell data remains challenging. Existing approaches either rely on pair information or prior correspondences, or require computing a global pairwise coupling matrix, limiting their scalability and flexibility. In this paper, we introduce a scalable and flexible generative framework called single-cell Multi-omics Regularized Disentangled Representations (scMRDR) for unpaired multi-omics integration. Specifically, we disentangle each cell's latent representations into modality-shared and modality-specific components using a well-designed $\beta$-VAE architecture, which are augmented with isometric regularization to preserve intra-omics biological heterogeneity, adversarial objective to encourage cross-modal alignment, and masked reconstruction loss strategy to address the issue of missing features across modalities. Our method achieves excellent performance on benchmark datasets in terms of batch correction, modality alignment, and biological signal preservation. Crucially, it scales effectively to large-scale datasets and supports integration of more than two omics, offering a powerful and flexible solution for large-scale multi-omics data integration and downstream biological discovery.</description>

      <title>friends.test: rank-based method for feature selection in interaction matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The analysis of the interaction matrix between two distinct sets is essential across diverse fields, from pharmacovigilance to transcriptomics. Not all interactions are equally informative: a marker gene associated with a few specific biological processes is more informative than a highly expressed non-specific gene associated with most observed processes. Identifying these interactions is challenging due to background connections. Furthermore, data heterogeneity across sources precludes universal identification criteria.
  To address this challenge, we introduce \textsf{friends.test}, a method for identifying specificity by detecting structural breaks in entity interactions. Rank-based representation of the interaction matrix ensures invariance to heterogeneous data and allows for integrating data from diverse sources. To automatically locate the boundary between specific interactions and background activity, we employ model fitting. We demonstrate the applicability of \textsf{friends.test} on the GSE112026 -- transnational data from head and neck cancer. A computationally efficient \textsf{R} implementation is available at https://github.com/favorov/friends.test.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Epigenetic aging clocks play a pivotal role in estimating an individual's biological age through the examination of DNA methylation patterns at numerous CpG (Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine) sites within their genome. However, making valid inferences on predicted epigenetic ages, or more broadly, on predictions derived from high-dimensional inputs, presents challenges. We introduce a novel U-learning approach via combinatory multi-subsampling for making ensemble predictions and constructing confidence intervals for predictions of continuous outcomes when traditional asymptotic methods are not applicable. More specifically, our approach conceptualizes the ensemble estimators within the framework of generalized U-statistics and invokes the H\'ajek projection for deriving the variances of predictions and constructing confidence intervals with valid conditional coverage probabilities. We apply our approach to two commonly used predictive algorithms, Lasso and deep neural networks (DNNs), and illustrate the validity of inferences with extensive numerical studies. We have applied these methods to predict the DNA methylation age (DNAmAge) of patients with various health conditions, aiming to accurately characterize the aging process and potentially guide anti-aging interventions.</description>

      <title>Robust Inference for Non-Linear Regression Models with Applications in Enzyme Kinetics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite linear regression being the most popular statistical modelling technique, in real-life we often need to deal with situations where the true relationship between the response and the covariates is nonlinear in parameters. In such cases one needs to adopt appropriate non-linear regression (NLR) analysis, having wider applications in biochemical and medical studies among many others. In this paper we propose a new improved robust estimation and testing methodologies for general NLR models based on the minimum density power divergence approach and apply our proposal to analyze the widely popular Michaelis-Menten (MM) model in enzyme kinetics. We establish the asymptotic properties of our proposed estimator and tests, along with their theoretical robustness characteristics through influence function analysis. For the particular MM model, we have further empirically justified the robustness and the efficiency of our proposed estimator and the testing procedure through extensive simulation studies and several interesting real data examples of enzyme-catalyzed (biochemical) reactions.</description>

      <title>The 4D Human Embryonic Brain Atlas: spatiotemporal atlas generation for rapid anatomical changes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Early brain development is crucial for lifelong neurodevelopmental health. However, current clinical practice offers limited knowledge of normal embryonic brain anatomy on ultrasound, despite the brain undergoing rapid changes within the time-span of days. To provide detailed insights into normal brain development and identify deviations, we created the 4D Human Embryonic Brain Atlas using a deep learning-based approach for groupwise registration and spatiotemporal atlas generation. Our method introduced a time-dependent initial atlas and penalized deviations from it, ensuring age-specific anatomy was maintained throughout rapid development. The atlas was generated and validated using 831 3D ultrasound images from 402 subjects in the Rotterdam Periconceptional Cohort, acquired between gestational weeks 8 and 12. We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach with an ablation study, which demonstrated that incorporating a time-dependent initial atlas and penalization produced anatomically accurate results. In contrast, omitting these adaptations led to anatomically incorrect atlas. Visual comparisons with an existing ex-vivo embryo atlas further confirmed the anatomical accuracy of our atlas. In conclusion, the proposed method successfully captures the rapid anotomical development of the embryonic brain. The resulting 4D Human Embryonic Brain Atlas provides a unique insights into this crucial early life period and holds the potential for improving the detection, prevention, and treatment of prenatal neurodevelopmental disorders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plant developmental plasticity, particularly in root system architecture, is fundamental to understanding adaptability and agricultural sustainability. ChronoRoot 2.0 builds upon established low-cost hardware while significantly enhancing software capabilities and usability. The system employs nnUNet architecture for multi-class segmentation, demonstrating significant accuracy improvements while simultaneously tracking six distinct plant structures encompassing root, shoot, and seed components: main root, lateral roots, seed, hypocotyl, leaves, and petiole. This architecture enables easy retraining and incorporation of additional training data without requiring machine learning expertise. The platform introduces dual specialized graphical interfaces: a Standard Interface for detailed architectural analysis with novel gravitropic response parameters, and a Screening Interface enabling high-throughput analysis of multiple plants through automated tracking. Functional Principal Component Analysis integration enables discovery of novel phenotypic parameters through temporal pattern comparison. We demonstrate multi-species analysis, with Arabidopsis thaliana and Solanum lycopersicum, both morphologically distinct plant species. Three use cases in Arabidopsis thaliana and validation with tomato seedlings demonstrate enhanced capabilities: circadian growth pattern characterization, gravitropic response analysis in transgenic plants, and high-throughput etiolation screening across multiple genotypes.ChronoRoot 2.0 maintains the low-cost, modular hardware advantages of its predecessor while dramatically improving accessibility through intuitive graphical interfaces and expanded analytical capabilities. The open-source platform makes sophisticated temporal plant phenotyping more accessible to researchers without computational expertise.</description>

      <title>A predictive modular approach to constraint satisfaction under uncertainty -- with application to glycosylation in continuous monoclonal antibody biosimilar production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16803v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper proposes a modular-based approach to constraint handling in process optimization and control. This is partly motivated by the recent interest in learning-based methods, e.g., within bioproduction, for which constraint handling under uncertainty is a challenge. The proposed constraint handler, called predictive filter, is combined with an adaptive constraint margin and a constraint violation cost monitor to minimize the cost of violating soft constraints due to model uncertainty and disturbances. The module can be combined with any controller and is based on minimally modifying the controller output, in a least squares sense, such that constraints are satisfied within the considered horizon. The proposed method is computationally efficient and suitable for real-time applications. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated through a realistic case study of glycosylation constraint satisfaction in continuous monoclonal antibody biosimilar production using Chinese hamster ovary cells, employing a metabolic network model consisting of 23 extracellular metabolites and 126 reactions. In the case study, the average constraint-violation cost is reduced by more than 60% compared to the case without the proposed constraint-handling method.</description>

      <title>Resting-State EEG Network Profiles Associated with Creative Engagement and Creative Self-Efficacy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Creativity is a core cognitive capacity underlying innovation and adaptive problem solving, yet how it is represented in the brain's intrinsic functional architecture is not fully understood. While resting-state fMRI studies have identified large-scale network correlates associated with differences in creativity, EEG provides the temporal resolution for examining oscillatory dynamics contributing to intrinsic network organization. We examined whether resting-state EEG connectivity patterns are associated with individual differences across multiple creativity-related measures. Thirty healthy young adults completed a multidimensional creativity battery comprising the Inventory of Creative Activities and Achievements (ICAA), the Divergent Association Task (DAT), the Matchstick Arithmetic Puzzles Task (MAPT) and a Self-rating (SR) of creative ability. Graph-theoretical analyses of alpha-band functional connectivity revealed two participant groups, each with distinct patterns of neural activity: Cluster 1 showed reduced global connectivity with relatively preserved left frontal connectivity and greater network modularity; Cluster 0 exhibited stronger overall connectivity strength, reduced modularity and higher local clustering. Notably, Cluster 1 reported higher self-rated creative ability and more frequent engagement in real-world creative activities. These findings suggest that resting-state EEG connectivity patterns are associated with variation in creative self-efficacy and creative engagement, highlighting characteristic patterns of alpha-band network organization observed at rest.</description>

      <title>Geometric Stability: The Missing Axis of Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analysis of learned representations has a blind spot: it focuses on $similarity$, measuring how closely embeddings align with external references, but similarity reveals only what is represented, not whether that structure is robust. We introduce $geometric$ $stability$, a distinct dimension that quantifies how reliably representational geometry holds under perturbation, and present $Shesha$, a framework for measuring it. Across 2,463 configurations in seven domains, we show that stability and similarity are empirically uncorrelated ($\rho \approx 0.01$) and mechanistically distinct: similarity metrics collapse after removing the top principal components, while stability retains sensitivity to fine-grained manifold structure. This distinction yields actionable insights: for safety monitoring, stability acts as a functional geometric canary, detecting structural drift nearly 2$\times$ more sensitively than CKA while filtering out the non-functional noise that triggers false alarms in rigid distance metrics; for controllability, supervised stability predicts linear steerability ($\rho = 0.89$-$0.96$); for model selection, stability dissociates from transferability, revealing a geometric tax that transfer optimization incurs. Beyond machine learning, stability predicts CRISPR perturbation coherence and neural-behavioral coupling. By quantifying $how$ $reliably$ systems maintain structure, geometric stability provides a necessary complement to similarity for auditing representations across biological and computational systems.</description>
