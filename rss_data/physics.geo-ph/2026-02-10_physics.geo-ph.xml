      <title>Machine learning enhanced data assimilation framework for multiscale carbonate rock characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbonate reservoirs offer significant capacity for subsurface carbon storage, oil production, and underground hydrogen storage. X-ray computed tomography (X-ray CT) coupled with numerical simulations is commonly used to investigate the multiphase flow behaviors in carbonate rocks. Carbonates exhibit pore size distribution across scales, hindering the comprehensive investigation with conventional X-ray CT images. Imaging samples at both macro and micro-scales (multi-scale imaging) proved to be a viable option in this context. However, multi-scale imaging faces two key limitations: the trade-off between field of view and voxel size necessitates resource-intensive imaging, while multi-scale multi-physics numerical simulations on resulting digital models incur prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose a machine learning-enhanced data assimilation framework that leverages experimental drainage relative permeability measurements to achieve efficient characterization of micro-scale structures, delivering a data-driven solution toward a high-fidelity multiscale digital rock modeling. We train a dense neural network (DNN) as a proxy to a multi-scale pore network simulator and couple it with an ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation (ESMDA) algorithm. DNN-ESMDA framework simultaneously infers the CO2-brine drainage relative permeability of microporosity phases with associated uncertainty estimation, revealing the relative importance of each rock phase and guiding future characterization. Our DNN-ESMDA framework achieves a computational speedup, reducing inference time from thousands of hours to seconds compared with the usage of conventional multiscale numerical simulation. Given this computational efficiency and applicability, the machine learning-enhanced ESMDA framework presents a generalizable approach for characterizing multiscale carbonate rocks.</description>

      <title>Wavelet Packet-Based Diffusion Model for Ground Motion Generation with Multi-Conditional Energy and Spectral Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal energy distribution strongly affects nonlinear structural response and cumulative damage. We propose a multi-conditional diffusion framework for ground motion synthesis that simultaneously matches temporal energy evolution and target response spectra. Wavelet packet decomposition provides the signal representation and enables direct waveform reconstruction via orthogonal filter banks. A Transformer-based conditional encoder with cross-attention integrates heterogeneous conditions, including spectral ordinates, Arias intensity, temporal parameters, and Husid curves. The framework adopts the Elucidating Diffusion Model (EDM) with second-order Heun sampling to improve inference efficiency without sacrificing quality. Tests on the NGA-West2 database show that explicit temporal-energy constraints markedly improve control of energy onset and significant duration while preserving spectrum matching and maintaining stable diversity sampling. The framework yields spectrum-compatible motions with realistic energy evolution and supports uncertainty quantification via conditional diversity sampling.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Free-Surface Ghosts as Mirror Observations in Marine Seismic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free-surface ghosts in marine seismic data are traditionally treated as artifacts that degrade bandwidth and temporal resolution and are mitigated through acquisition design or inverse filtering. This study proposes a processing-driven framework that reinterprets free-surface ghosts as coherent mirror observations rather than unwanted noise. The proposed approach exploits the deterministic relationship between primary and ghost wavefields. After decomposing the recorded data into primary and ghost components, the wavefields are physically realigned through wavefield backpropagation and survey sinking and then coherently summed. This strategy enhances signal quality without explicit inversion of the ghost operator, thereby avoiding the numerical instability inherent in inverse ghost deconvolution. Synthetic examples demonstrate that the framework improves wavelet compactness and partially recovers ghost-affected frequency content while maintaining numerical stability. The method is applicable to both source- and receiver-side ghosts and does not require modification of acquisition geometry or specialized hardware, making it particularly well suited to legacy marine seismic datasets. By shifting ghost mitigation from acquisition design to post-acquisition processing, the proposed framework provides a unifying physical interpretation of free-surface ghosts and offers a flexible pathway for broadband signal enhancement and improved signal-to-noise ratio in marine seismic data, consistent with previous field-scale observations.</description>

      <title>Radial gradient of superionic hydrogen in Earth's inner core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrogen is considered a major light element in Earth's core, yet the thermodynamics of its superionic phase and its distribution in the inner core remain unclear. Here, we compute ab initio Gibbs free energies for liquid and superionic hcp and bcc Fe-H phases and construct the superionic-liquid phase diagram over pressure-temperature conditions relevant to the Earth's inner core. We find that phase diagrams at different inner-core pressures collapse when temperatures are scaled by the melting temperature of pure iron, indicating that solid-liquid partitioning is controlled primarily by a reduced temperature relative to iron melting and is weakly sensitive to pressure. This scaling relation further reconciles previously reported discrepancies in partition coefficients among theoretical studies and yields good agreement with available experimental data at low pressures. By applying thermochemical constraints, our free-energy results reveal a radial hydrogen gradient within the inner core. These results demonstrate that compositional gradients of superionic hydrogen in the inner core emerge naturally from equilibrium thermodynamics and suggest a general mechanism governing the depth-dependent distribution of light elements within Earth's inner core.</description>

      <title>Structural barriers to complete homogenization and wormholing in dissolving porous and fractured rocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dissolution in porous media and fractured rocks alters both the chemical composition of the fluid and the physical properties of the solid. Depending on system conditions, reactive flow may enlarge pores uniformly, widen pre-existing channels, or trigger instabilities that form wormholes. The resulting pattern reflects feedbacks among advection, diffusion, surface reaction, and the initial heterogeneity of the medium. Porous and fractured media can exhibit distinct characteristics -- for example, the presence of large fractures can significantly alter the network topology and overall connectivity of the system. We quantify these differences with three network models -- a regular pore network, a disordered pore network, and a discrete fracture network -- evaluated with a unified metric: the flow focusing profile. This metric effectively captures evolution of flow paths across all systems: it reveals a focusing front that propagates from the inlet in the wormholing regime, a system-wide decrease in focusing during uniform dissolution, and the progressive enlargement of pre-existing flow paths in the channeling regime. The metric shows that uniform dissolution cannot eliminate heterogeneity resulting from the network topology. This structural heterogeneity -- rather than just pore-diameter or fracture-aperture variance -- sets a fundamental limit on flow homogenization and must be accounted for when upscaling dissolution kinetics from pore or fracture scale to the reservoir level.</description>

      <title>Waves drive large-scale 2D flows in rotating turbulence and cause their demise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulence follows a few well-known organizational principles, rooted in conservation laws. One such principle states that a system conserving two sign-definite invariants self-organizes into large-scale structures. Ordinary three-dimensional turbulence does not fall within this paradigm. However, when subject to rotation, 3D turbulence is profoundly altered: rotation produces 3D inertial waves, while also sustaining emergent two-dimensional structures and favoring domain-scale flows called condensates. This interplay raises a fundamental question: why and when are 2D flows sustained even when only 3D waves are excited? Using extensive numerical simulations of the rotating 3D Navier-Stokes equations together with a quasi-linear wave-kinetic theory, we show that near-resonant interactions between 3D waves and a large-scale 2D flow impose an additional conservation law: waves must conserve their helicity separately for each helicity sign. This emergent sign-definite invariant constrains the waves to transfer their energy to large-scale 2D motions. However, as rotation increases, resonance conditions become more restrictive and the energy transfer from the waves to the 2D flow progressively vanishes, leading to a transition between distinct classes of turbulence, from 2D-dominated to 3D-dominated wave turbulence. We derive analytical expressions for this 3D-2D energy transfer as a function of rotation, Reynolds number and domain geometry, which show a good agreement with numerical simulations. Together, these results establish a mechanism underlying two-dimensionalization in rotating turbulence, and, more broadly, illustrate how non-linear systems sustaining waves can self-organize into anisotropic, zero-frequency structures.</description>

      <title>Role of partial stable stratification on the onset of rotating magnetoconvection with a uniform horizontal field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To explore the combined effects of partial thermal stable stratification and magnetic back-reaction within Earth's tangent cylinder, we study the onset of magnetoconvection in an infinite plane layer subject to horizontal magnetic field imposed perpendicular to the rotation axis. Three stratification models-fully unstable, weakly stable, and strongly stable-are considered to examine their influence on convective onset. A broad range of rotation rates and diffusivity ratios captures the effects of rotation and thermal-to-magnetic diffusivity contrast, while magnetic back-reaction is analyzed by varying the imposed magnetic field strength. To assess the impact of stratification on convection threshold and flow structure, we derive local scaling laws for critical onset parameters and compute penetration percentages to quantify convective intrusion into the stable layer. Results show that stable stratification promotes earlier onset and smaller-scale flows, with stronger effects in rotation-dominated regimes-hallmarks of penetrative convection. In weak magnetic fields, faster rotation enhances columnarity and intensifies stratification effects while delaying onset. Under strong magnetic fields, thicker rolls persist even at rapid rotation, with limited but noticeable penetration into the stable layer. Magnetic stabilization is more effective at low to moderate diffusivity ratios but weakens at high diffusivity ratio. Penetration decreases with stronger magnetic fields and rotation, especially under strong stratification, but varies non-monotonically with rotation in weak stratification and magnetic regimes. These findings highlight the complex interplay among stratification, rotation, and magnetic field strength in setting the onset and structure of rotating convection relevant to planetary interiors.</description>
