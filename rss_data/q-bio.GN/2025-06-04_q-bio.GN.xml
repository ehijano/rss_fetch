      <title>Leveraging Natural Language Processing to Unravel the Mystery of Life: A Review of NLP Approaches in Genomics, Transcriptomics, and Proteomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02212</link>

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) has transformed various fields beyond linguistics by applying techniques originally developed for human language to the analysis of biological sequences. This review explores the application of NLP methods to biological sequence data, focusing on genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. We examine how various NLP methods, from classic approaches like word2vec to advanced models employing transformers and hyena operators, are being adapted to analyze DNA, RNA, protein sequences, and entire genomes. The review also examines tokenization strategies and model architectures, evaluating their strengths, limitations, and suitability for different biological tasks. We further cover recent advances in NLP applications for biological data, such as structure prediction, gene expression, and evolutionary analysis, highlighting the potential of these methods for extracting meaningful insights from large-scale genomic data. As language models continue to advance, their integration into bioinformatics holds immense promise for advancing our understanding of biological processes in all domains of life.</description>

      <title>Quantum Ensembling Methods for Healthcare and Life Science</title>

Abstract: Learning on small data is a challenge frequently encountered in many real-world applications. In this work we study how effective quantum ensemble models are when trained on small data problems in healthcare and life sciences. We constructed multiple types of quantum ensembles for binary classification using up to 26 qubits in simulation and 56 qubits on quantum hardware. Our ensemble designs use minimal trainable parameters but require long-range connections between qubits. We tested these quantum ensembles on synthetic datasets and gene expression data from renal cell carcinoma patients with the task of predicting patient response to immunotherapy. From the performance observed in simulation and initial hardware experiments, we demonstrate how quantum embedding structure affects performance and discuss how to extract informative features and build models that can learn and generalize effectively. We present these exploratory results in order to assist other researchers in the design of effective learning on small data using ensembles. Incorporating quantum computing in these data constrained problems offers hope for a wide range of studies in healthcare and life sciences where biological samples are relatively scarce given the feature space to be explored.</description>

      <title>Controllable Sequence Editing for Biological and Clinical Trajectories</title>

Abstract: Conditional generation models for longitudinal sequences can generate new or modified trajectories given a conditioning input. While effective at generating entire sequences, these models typically lack control over the timing and scope of the edits. Most existing approaches either operate on univariate sequences or assume that the condition affects all variables and time steps. However, many scientific and clinical applications require more precise interventions, where a condition takes effect only after a specific time and influences only a subset of variables. We introduce CLEF, a controllable sequence editing model for conditional generation of immediate and delayed effects in multivariate longitudinal sequences. CLEF learns temporal concepts that encode how and when a condition alters future sequence evolution. These concepts allow CLEF to apply targeted edits to the affected time steps and variables while preserving the rest of the sequence. We evaluate CLEF on 6 datasets spanning cellular reprogramming and patient health trajectories, comparing against 9 state-of-the-art baselines. CLEF improves immediate sequence editing accuracy by up to 36.01% (MAE). Unlike prior models, CLEF enables one-step conditional generation at arbitrary future times, outperforming them in delayed sequence editing by up to 65.71% (MAE). We test CLEF under counterfactual inference assumptions and show up to 63.19% (MAE) improvement on zero-shot conditional generation of counterfactual trajectories. In a case study of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, CLEF identifies clinical interventions that generate realistic counterfactual trajectories shifted toward healthier outcomes.</description>

      <title>JanusDNA: A Powerful Bi-directional Hybrid DNA Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17257</link>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing and are increasingly applied to other sequential data types, including genetic sequences. However, adapting LLMs to genomics presents significant challenges. Capturing complex genomic interactions requires modeling long-range dependencies within DNA sequences, where interactions often span over 10,000 base pairs, even within a single gene, posing substantial computational burdens under conventional model architectures and training paradigms. Moreover, standard LLM training approaches are suboptimal for DNA: autoregressive training, while efficient, supports only unidirectional understanding. However, DNA is inherently bidirectional, e.g., bidirectional promoters regulate transcription in both directions and account for nearly 11% of human gene expression. Masked language models (MLMs) allow bidirectional understanding but are inefficient, as only masked tokens contribute to the loss per step. To address these limitations, we introduce JanusDNA, the first bidirectional DNA foundation model built upon a novel pretraining paradigm that combines the optimization efficiency of autoregressive modeling with the bidirectional comprehension of masked modeling. JanusDNA adopts a hybrid Mamba, Attention and Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, combining long-range modeling of Attention with efficient sequential learning of Mamba. MoE layers further scale model capacity via sparse activation while keeping computational cost low. Notably, JanusDNA processes up to 1 million base pairs at single nucleotide resolution on a single 80GB GPU. Extensive experiments and ablations show JanusDNA achieves new SOTA results on three genomic representation benchmarks, outperforming models with 250x more activated parameters.
