      <title>Supervised and unsupervised learning with numerical computation for the Wolfram cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The local rules of Wolfram cellular automata with one-dimensional three-cell neighborhoods are represented by eight-bit binary that encode deterministic update rules. These automata are widely utilized to investigate self-organization phenomena and the dynamics of complex systems. In this work, we employ numerical simulations and computational methods to investigate the asymptotic density and dynamical evolution mechanisms in Wolfram automata. We apply both supervised and unsupervised learning methods to identify the configurations associated with different Wolfram rules. Furthermore, we explore alternative initial conditions under which certain Wolfram rules generate similar fractal patterns over time, even when starting from a single active site. Our results reveal the relationship between the asymptotic density and the initial density of selected rules. The supervised learning methods effectively identify the configurations of various Wolfram rules, while unsupervised methods like principal component analysis and autoencoders can approximately cluster configurations of different Wolfram rules into distinct groups, yielding results that align well with simulated density outputs.</description>

      <title>Physical embedding machine learning force fields for organic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning force fields possess unprecedented potential in achieving both accuracy and efficiency in molecular simulations. Nevertheless, their application in organic systems is often hindered by structural collapse during simulation and significant deviations in the prediction of macroscopic properties. Here, two physics-embedded strategies are introduced to overcome these limitations. First, a physics-inspired self-adaptive bond-length sampling method achieves long-timescale stable simulations by requiring only several tens of single-molecule data sets, and has been validated across molecular systems, including engineering fluids, polypeptides, and pharmaceuticals. Second, a top-down intermolecular correction strategy based on a physical equation is introduced. This strategy requires only a small amount of simulation data and completes the optimization of tunable parameters within a few hours on a single RTX 4090 GPU, significantly reducing errors in density and viscosity, as validated in systems including ethylene carbonate, ethyl acetate, and dimethyl carbonate. Together, these approaches directly integrate physical insights into the machine learning models, thereby enhancing robustness and generalizability, and providing a scalable pathway for physics-embedded machine learning force fields.</description>

      <title>Composing $\alpha$-Gauss and logistic maps: Gradual and sudden transitions to chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15709v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the $\alpha$-Gauss-Logistic map, a new nonlinear dynamics constructed by composing the logistic and $\alpha$-Gauss maps. Explicitly, our model is given by $x_{t+1} = f_L(x_t)x_t^{-\alpha} - \lfloor f_L(x_t)x_t^{-\alpha} \rfloor $ where $f_L(x_t) = r x_t (1-x_t)$ is the logistic map and $ \lfloor \ldots \rfloor $ is the integer part function. Our investigation reveals a rich phenomenology depending solely on two parameters, $r$ and $\alpha$. For $\alpha &lt; 1$, the system exhibits multiple period-doubling cascades to chaos as the parameter $r$ is increased, interspersed with stability windows within the chaotic attractor. In contrast, for $1 \leq \alpha &lt; 2$, the onset of chaos is abrupt, occurring without any prior bifurcations, and the resulting chaotic attractors emerge without stability windows. For $\alpha \geq 2$, the regular behavior is absent. The special case of $\alpha = 1$ allows an analytical treatment, yielding a closed-form formula for the Lyapunov exponent and conditions for an exact uniform invariant density, using the Perron-Frobenius equation. Chaotic regimes for $\alpha = 1$ can exhibit gaps or be gapless. Surprisingly, the golden ratio $\Phi$ marks the threshold for the disappearance of the largest gap in the regime diagram. Additionally, at the edge of chaos in the abrupt transition regime, the invariant density approaches a $q$-Gaussian with $q=2$, which corresponds to a Cauchy distribution.</description>

      <title>Deep Neural Networks can eliminate Spiral-wave Turbulence in Cardiac Tissue Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ventricular arrhythmias, like ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF), precipitate sudden cardiac death (SCD), which is the leading cause of mortality in the industrialised world. Thus, the elimination of VT and VF is a problem of paramount importance, which is studied experimentally, theoretically, and numerically. Numerical studies use partial-differential-equation models, for cardiac tissue, which admit solutions with spiral- or broken-spiral-wave solutions that are the mathematical counterparts of VT and VF. In silico investigations of such mathematical models of cardiac tissue allow us not only to explore the properties of such spiral-wave turbulence, but also to develop mathematical analogues of low-amplitude defibrillation by the application of currents that can eliminate spiral waves. We develop an efficient deep-neural-network U-Net-based method for the control of spiral-wave turbulence in mathematical models of cardiac tissue. Specifically, we use the simple, two-variable Aliev-Panfilov and the ionically realistic TP06 mathematical models to show that the lower the correlation length {\xi} for spiral-turbulence patterns, the easier it is to eliminate them by the application of control currents on a mesh electrode. We then use spiral-turbulence patterns from the TP06 model to train a U-Net to predict the sodium current, which is most prominent along thin lines that track the propagating front of a spiral wave. We apply currents, in the vicinities of the predicted sodium-current lines to eliminate spiral waves efficiently. The amplitudes of these currents are adjusted automatically, so that they are small when {\xi} is large and vice versa. We show that our U-Net-aided elimination of spiral-wave turbulence is superior to earlier methods.</description>

      <title>The growth of magnetic energy during the nonlinear phase of the subsonic and supersonic small-scale dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small-scale dynamos (SSDs) amplify magnetic fields in turbulent plasmas. Theory predicts nonlinear magnetic energy growth $E_\mathrm{mag} \propto t^{p_\mathrm{nl}}$, but this scaling has not been tested across flow regimes. Using a large ensemble of SSD simulations spanning sub- to supersonic turbulence, we find linear growth ($p_\mathrm{nl} = 1$) in subsonic flows and quadratic growth ($p_\mathrm{nl} = 2$) in supersonic flows. In all cases, we find a dynamo efficiency of $\sim 1/100$ and a duration $\Delta t \approx 20\,t_0$, with $t_0$ the turnover time, establishing the universal timescales and efficiencies of the nonlinear SSD across astrophysical and laboratory plasmas.</description>

      <title>A three-dimensional numerical scheme for modeling three-phase contact line pinning using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In several capillary dynamics experiments, the liquid domain is confined by pinning the three-phase contact line along a sharp edge or a discontinuity on the substrate. Simulating the dynamics of pinned droplets can offer valuable insights into capillary flow phenomena involving wetting of inhomogeneous substrates. However, Eulerian multi-phase flow solvers are usually not able to directly implement pinning of three-phase contact lines. We present the implementation of a model for pinning the contact line of a liquid along an arbitrary pinning curve on the substrate, in an updated Lagrangian, meshless flow solver based on the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method. We develop the pinning model for a continuum surface force scheme and assume a free surface for the liquid-gas interface. We validate the model against several capillary dynamics experiments involving pinned three phase contact lines with fixed and dynamic substrates to demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the solver.</description>

      <title>Novel 3D Pentagraphene Allotropes: Stability, Electronic, Mechanical, and Optical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbon-based materials have attracted great attention due to their exceptional structural diversity and wide-ranging applications. Recently, a new two-dimensional carbon allotrope, named pentagraphene (PG), was proposed. In this study, we proposed three novel three-dimensional (3D) PG allotropes, named 3D-PG-$\alpha$, -$\beta$, and -$\gamma$, engineered through biaxial strain and controlled compression of 2D PG layers. Comprehensive stability analyses, including phonon dispersion and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations (AIMD), confirm their thermodynamic stability under room and high-temperature conditions. 3D-PG-$\alpha$ is the most stable, exhibiting a cohesive energy 0.5 eV/atom lower than the least stable structure, 3D-PG-$\gamma$. Electronic property characterization reveals semiconducting behavior for all structures, with indirect electronic band gaps ranging from 0.91 to 2.67 eV. The analyses of the mechanical properties showed significant anisotropy, with higher stiffness along the in-plane ($xy$-plane) direction. Optical properties highlight strong absorption along a wide range and a pronounced anisotropic response. Additionally, the absorption spectra exhibit activity in the visible region, and the refractive index and reflectivity indicate potential use in ultraviolet-blocking devices.</description>

      <title>Magnetism Induced by Azanide and Ammonia Adsorption in Defective Molybdenum Disulfide and Diselenide: A First-Principles Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted considerable attention due to their tunable structural, electronic, and spin-related properties, particularly in the presence of point defects and molecular adsorbates. Motivated by these aspects, we have investigated using first-principles methods the magnetic properties induced by azanide (NH$_2$) and ammonia (NH$_3$) adsorption on defective monolayers of Molybdenum Disulfide (MoS$_2$) and Diselenide(MoSe$_2$). Spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) was employed to investigate the impact of mono- and di-vacancies on the local spin environment and the role of molecular adsorption in modifying magnetic behavior. The results show that pristine chalcogen vacancies do not generate magnetism, whereas the adsorption of NH$_2$ and NH$_3$ creates localized magnetic moments in Mo-based dichalcogenides. A notable case occurs for MoSe$_2$, where NH$_3$ dissociation into NH$_2$ and H fragments on the same side of the surface produces a net magnetic moment of 2.0 $\mu_B$. Tests performed on W-based dichalcogenides under equivalent conditions showed no magnetic response, and are reported here only for comparison. These findings demonstrate that molecular adsorption combined with defect engineering can be a practical approach to tune magnetism in 2D materials, with potential relevance for spintronic and sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Morphogenetic mechanical metamaterials: Emerging tensor properties from self-organized structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how living organisms spontaneously develop complex functional structures inspires innovative approaches in engineering design. Here, we introduce a decentralized generative model based on morphogenesis to autonomously grow mechanical structures with controlled tensorial properties. By adapting Turing's reaction-diffusion concept through anisotropic diffusion, our approach enables the local emergence of microstructures exhibiting tailored stiffness and anisotropy, achieving target orthotropic tensors without adjoint or topology optimization loops. The synthesis of these structures relies on a database linking morphogenetic parameters to effective elastic tensors obtained through homogenization techniques. We experimentally demonstrate this concept through a mechanical cloaking example, validating our method's capability to independently control local anisotropy and rigidity, and effectively conceal structural defects from mechanical fields. This approach not only addresses key limitations of traditional topology optimization methods but also opens new bio-inspired pathways for scalable and robust mechanical metamaterial design.</description>

      <title>Structure-Preserving High-Order Methods for the Compressible Euler Equations in Potential Temperature Formulation for Atmospheric Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop structure-preserving numerical methods for the compressible Euler equations, employing potential temperature as a prognostic variable.We construct three numerical fluxes designed to ensure the conservation of entropy and total energy within the discontinuous Galerkin framework on general curvilinear meshes.Furthermore, we introduce a generalization for the kinetic energy preservation property and total energy conservation in the presence of a gravitational potential term. To this end, we adopt a flux-differencing approach for the discretization of the source term, treated as non-conservative product. We present well-balanced schemes for different constant background states for both formulations (total energy and potential temperature) on curvilinear meshes. Finally, we validate the methods by comparing the potential temperature formulation with the traditional Euler equations formulation across a range of classical atmospheric scenarios.</description>

      <title>The merger of spinning, accreting supermassive black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Because they are likely to accrete substantial amounts of interstellar gas, merging supermassive binary black holes are expected to be strong multimessenger sources, radiating gravitational waves, photons from thermal gas, and photons from relativistic electrons energized by relativistic jets. Here we report on a numerical simulation that covers the late inspiral, merger, and initial postmerger phase of such a system where both black holes have the same mass and spin, and both spin axes are parallel to the orbital angular momentum. The simulation incorporates both 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and numerical relativity. The thermal photon power during the late inspiral, merger, and immediate postmerger phases is drawn from strong shocks rather than dissipation of turbulence inside a smoothly structured accretion disk as typically found around accreting single black holes. We find that the thermal photon and jet Poynting flux outputs are closely related in time, and we posit a mechanism that enforces this relation. The power radiated in both photons and jets diminishes gradually as merger is approached, but jumps sharply at merger to a noisy plateau. Such a distinct lightcurve should aid efforts to identify supermassive black hole mergers, with or without accompanying gravitational wave detections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When light propagates through a randomly correlated, slowly varying medium, it generates optical branched flow. Previous studies have demonstrated that the self-focusing effect in optical media can accelerate the appearance of the first branching points and sharpen the filaments of branched flow. In this study, we investigate the influence of the nonlocality of the nonlinear response on branched flow. We find that, due to its averaging effect, as the range of nonlocality increases, the first branching point shifts to a greater distance, and the flow structures broaden, thus nonlocality ultimately restores the branched flow to its linear condition. We have developed a semi-analytical formula and confirmed the screening of the self-focusing effect on branching flow by nonlocality.</description>

      <title>Large-scale semi-discrete optimal transport with distributed Voronoi diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a numerical method to solve semi-discrete optimal transport problems for gigantic pointsets (108 points and more). By pushing the limits by several orders of magnitude, it opens the path to new applications in cosmology, fluid simulation and data science to name but a few. The method is based on a new algorithm that computes (generalized) Voronoi diagrams in parallel and in a distributed way. First we make the simple observation that the cells defined by a subgraph of the Delaunay graph contain the Voronoi cells, and that one can deduce the missing edges from the intersections between those cells. Based on this observation, we introduce the Distributed Voronoi Diagram algorithm (DVD) that can be used on a cluster and that exchanges vertices between the nodes as need be. We also report early experimental results, demonstrating that the DVD algorithm has the potential to solve some giga-scale semi-discrete optimal transport problems encountered in computational cosmology.</description>

      <title>Faster Random Walk-based Capacitance Extraction with Generalized Antithetic Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20586v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Floating random walk-based capacitance extraction has emerged in recent years as a tried and true approach for extracting parasitic capacitance in very large scale integrated circuits. Being a Monte Carlo method, its performance is dependent on the variance of sampled quantities and variance reduction methods are crucial for the challenges posed by ever denser process technologies and layout-dependent effects. In this work, we present a novel, universal variance reduction method for floating random walk-based capacitance extraction, which is conceptually simple, highly efficient and provably reduces variance in all extractions, especially when layout-dependent effects are present. It is complementary to existing mathematical formulations for variance reduction and its performance gains are experienced on top of theirs. Numerical experiments demonstrate substantial such gains of up to 50% in number of walks necessary as well as in actual extraction times compared to the best previously proposed variance reduction approaches for the floating random-walk.</description>

      <title>PCGBandit: One-shot acceleration of transient PDE solvers via online-learned preconditioners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-driven acceleration of scientific computing workflows has been a high-profile aim of machine learning (ML) for science, with numerical simulation of transient partial differential equations (PDEs) being one of the main applications. The focus thus far has been on methods that require classical simulations to train, which when combined with the data-hungriness and optimization challenges of neural networks has caused difficulties in demonstrating a convincing advantage against strong classical baselines. We consider an alternative paradigm in which the learner uses a classical solver's own data to accelerate it, enabling a one-shot speedup of the simulation. Concretely, since transient PDEs often require solving a sequence of related linear systems, the feedback from repeated calls to a linear solver such as preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) can be used by a bandit algorithm to online-learn an adaptive sequence of solver configurations (e.g. preconditioners). The method we develop, PCGBandit, is implemented directly on top of the popular open source software OpenFOAM, which we use to show its effectiveness on a set of fluid and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) problems.</description>

      <title>Space Group Informed Transformer for Crystalline Materials Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15734v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce CrystalFormer, a transformer-based autoregressive model specifically designed for space group-controlled generation of crystalline materials. By explicitly incorporating space group symmetry, CrystalFormer greatly reduces the effective complexity of crystal space, which is essential for data-and compute-efficient generative modeling of crystalline materials. Leveraging the prominent discrete and sequential nature of the Wyckoff positions, CrystalFormer learns to generate crystals by directly predicting the species and coordinates of symmetry-inequivalent atoms in the unit cell. We demonstrate the advantages of CrystalFormer in standard tasks such as symmetric structure initialization and element substitution over widely used conventional approaches. Furthermore, we showcase its plug-and-play application to property-guided materials design, highlighting its flexibility. Our analysis reveals that CrystalFormer ingests sensible solid-state chemistry knowledge and heuristics by compressing the material dataset, thus enabling systematic exploration of crystalline materials space. The simplicity, generality, and adaptability of CrystalFormer position it as a promising architecture to be the foundational model of the entire crystalline materials space, heralding a new era in materials discovery and design.</description>

      <title>TorchGDM: A GPU-Accelerated Python Toolkit for Multi-Scale Electromagnetic Scattering with Automatic Differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09545v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present "torchGDM", a numerical framework for nano-optical simulations based on the Green's Dyadic Method (GDM). This toolkit combines a hybrid approach, allowing for both fully discretized nano-structures and structures approximated by sets of effective electric and magnetic dipoles. It supports simulations in three dimensions and for infinitely long, two-dimensional structures. This capability is particularly suited for multi-scale modeling, enabling accurate near-field calculations within or around a discretized structure embedded in a complex environment of scatterers represented by effective models. Importantly, torchGDM is entirely implemented in PyTorch, a well-optimized and GPU-enabled automatic differentiation framework. This allows for the efficient calculation of exact derivatives of any simulated observable with respect to various inputs, including positions, wavelengths or permittivity, but also intermediate parameters like Green's tensor components, which can be interesting for physics informed deep learning applications. We anticipate that this toolkit will be valuable for applications merging nano-photonics and machine learning, as well as for solving nano-photonic optimization and inverse problems, such as the global design and characterization of metasurfaces, where optical interactions between structures are critical.</description>

      <title>Orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects transform minima in molecular ionization probabilities into maxima</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04096v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the tunneling regime and at sufficiently low field amplitudes, the shape of orientation-dependent molecular ionization rate curves usually resembles the shape of the ionized orbital. As the ionizing field strength increases, the shape of the ionization rate can deviate from this pattern. The oft-cited explanation is that the increasing contribution of excited states relative to the ground state modifies the distribution. In this paper, we show that orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects, which are independent of excited-state effects, can also significantly modify the angular dependence of the yields of widely studied molecules where excited state effects are negligible. For example, we find that in CH$_3$Br, the interplay between orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects transforms a local minimum in the orientation-dependent ionization rate to a local maximum as the ionizing field strength increases. To simulate orbital distortion and parabolic channel effects, we use the one-electron weak-field asymptotic theory including the first-order correction (OE-WFAT(1)) in the integral representation. Since OE-WFAT(1) incurs expensive computations when the number of orientation angles is large, we also reformulate the original OE-WFAT(1) algorithm into a partial-wave expansion form, which greatly enhances the efficiency of the method.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic Shastry-Sutherland fullerene networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between quantum magnetism and many-body physics is of fundamental importance in condensed matter physics. %Magnetic exchange interactions in frustrated lattices give rise to rich phase diagrams. Molecular building blocks provide a versatile platform for exploring the exotic quantum phases arising from complex orderings in frustrated lattices. Here we demonstrate a showcase system based on altermagnetic Shastry-Sutherland fullerene networks, which can be constructed from a C$_{40}$ molecular synthon with two effective spin-1/2 sites due to the resonance structures. The charge-neutral, pure-carbon systems exhibit an altermagnetic ground state with fully compensated spins arranged in alternating C$_{40}$ units in a 2D rutile-like lattice, leading to $d$-wave splitting of the spin-polarised electronic band structure and strong chiral-split magnons. We report a rich phase diagram including altermagentic, quantum spin liquid, plaquette, and dimer phases, which can be accessed via moderate strains. Our findings open a new avenue for exploring quantum many-body physics based on scalable, chemically-feasible, molecular quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Neural Transformer Backflow for Solving Momentum-Resolved Ground States of Strongly Correlated Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strongly correlated materials, such as twisted transition-metal dichalcogenide homobilayers, host a variety of exotic quantum phases but remain notoriously difficult to solve due to strong interactions. We introduce a powerful neural network ansatz, Neural Transformer Backflow (NTB), formulated within a multi-band projection framework. It naturally enforces momentum conservation and enables efficient calculations of momentum-resolved ground states. NTB attains high accuracy on small systems and scales to higher bands and larger system sizes far beyond the reach of exact diagonalization. By evaluating observables such as the structure factor and momentum distribution, we show that NTB captures diverse correlated states in tMoTe$_2$, including charge density waves, fractional Chern insulators, and anomalous Hall Fermi liquids, within a unified framework. Our approach paves the way for understanding and discovering novel phases of matter in strongly correlated materials.</description>
