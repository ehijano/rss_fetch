      <title>The QCD axion, colour-mediated neutrino masses, and $B^+\to K^+ + E_{\text{miss}}$ anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent Belle II result indicating a $2.7\,\sigma$ excess of $B^+\to K^+ + E_{\text{miss}}$ events compared to the Standard Model (SM) prediction for $B^+ \to K^+ \nu\bar{\nu}$, we explore an explanation to this anomaly based on a KSVZ-type QCD axion model featuring a Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry breaking at high-scale, that can provide a solution to the strong CP problem with dark matter relic abundance. The model contains a PQ-charged scalar} leptoquark which can interact with the SM quarks only via mass-mixing of the latter with vector-like quarks. The mixing between SM and vector-like quarks is determined by the PQ mass scales and can explain the excess $B^+\to K^+ + E_{\text{miss}}$ events while respecting other flavour constraints. The same PQ-charged scalar leptoquarks and vector-like quarks also mediate the two-loop radiative neutrino masses.</description>

      <title>Exchange contribution to the variance of the excitation energy of the electron shell of the daughter atom in double-$\beta$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The excitation of electron shell of a daughter atom in a neutrinoless double $\beta$-decay causes change in shape of the total energy peak of $\beta$ electrons at the end of the energy spectrum. The main parameters of the modified distribution are the average energy and variance of the excitation energy of the electron shell. We derive an expression for the variance taking into account exchange effects and make numerical estimates of the average excitation energy and variance based on the non-relativistic Roothaan-Hartree-Fock method and the relativistic Dirac-Hartree-Fock method implemented in the General Relativistic Atomic Structure Package (Grasp2018). Estimates are made for eleven isotopes, two-neutrino double-$\beta$ decay of which is observed experimentally. The results are determined by the first two negative moments of the electron radii in the parent atom. The values obtained for change in the peak shape can be used to parameterize the energy distribution of $\beta$ electrons, taking into account the excitation of the electron shell of the daughter atom.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative Origin of Electroweak Scale via Higgs-portal: Dyson-Schwinger in Conformally Invariant Scalar Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate conformally extended Standard Model with a hidden scalar $\phi$. It is shown that due to non-perturbative dynamics in the hidden sector, $\phi$ develops a vacuum expectation value (vev) in the form of a mass gap which triggers the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) and dynamically generates the SM Higgs boson mass. For estimating the non-perturbatively generated mass scale, we solve the hierarchy of Dyson-Schwinger Equations in form of partial differential equations using the exact solution known via a novel technique developed by Bender, Milton and Savage. We employ Jacobi Elliptic function as exact background solution and show that the mass gap that arises in the hidden sector can be transmuted to the EW sector, expressed in terms of Higgs-portal mixed quartic coupling $\beta$ and self interaction quartic coupling $\lambda_{\phi}$ of $\phi$. We identify the suitable parameter space where the observed SM Higgs boson can be successfully generated . Finally, we discuss how this idea of non-perturbative EW scale generation can serve as a new starting point for better realistic model building in the context of resolving the hierarchy problem in the Standard Model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In overview of the recent activity of the newly funded EXCLusives with AI and Machine learning (EXCLAIM) collaboration is presented. The main goal of the collaboration is to develop a framework to implement AI and machine learning techniques in problems emerging from the phenomenology of high energy exclusive scattering processes from nucleons and nuclei, maximizing the information that can be extracted from various sets of experimental data, while implementing theoretical constraints from lattice QCD. A specific perspective embraced by EXCLAIM is to use the methods of theoretical physics to understand the working of ML, beyond its standardized applications to physics analyses which most often rely on industrially provided tools, in an automated way.</description>

      <title>Exploring Optimal Sensitivity of Lepton Flavor Violating Effective Couplings at the $e^+e^-$ Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze lepton flavor violation (LFV) using the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) framework at the future lepton colliders. Our focus is on the associated production of tau lepton with electron/muon at the electron-positron ($e^+e^-$) colliders, related to four-Fermi SMEFT effective operators. To respect the upper limits on effective couplings from lepton flavor violating tau decays, we conduct a cut-based analysis to achieve sufficient signal significance. We utilize the optimal observable technique (OOT) to estimate the optimal sensitivity of the effective couplings. The impact of electron beam polarization and the interplay of signal and background in enhancing the optimal sensitivity of the effective couplings are discussed in detail. We find that the sensitivity of flavor-violating effective couplings is enhanced by order of one for 3 TeV center of mass (CM) energy and 1000 $\rm{fb}^{-1}$ integrated luminosity at the $e^+e^-$ colliders.</description>

      <title>Non-thermal baryogenesis from MSSM flat direction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an inflection point inflation scenario where a flat direction of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) is identified with the inflaton. We focus on the case where the flat direction (inflaton) has non-zero baryon number, and consider a non-thermal baryogenesis scenario where the decay of the inflaton at the reheating directly generates baryon asymmetry of the Universe. Specifically, we consider a udd flat direction that is lifted by a superpotential operator of dimension 6, and show that inflection point inflation with the udd flat direction can be compatible with cosmological observations and can account for the baryon asymmetry of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Mass mixing between QCD axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel level crossing in the mass mixing between two QCD axions, one canonical QCD axion and one $Z_{\mathcal N}$ QCD axion. The level crossing can take place at the QCD phase transition critical temperature or slightly before it, depending on the ratio of the axion decay constants $\sim1.69$. The cosmological evolution of the mass eigenvalues in these two cases is similar, however, the transition of axion energy density is completely different. Finally, we estimate the relic density of the QCD axion dark matter. This level crossing may also have some cosmological implications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we have investigated the radiative and semileptonic decay of doubly heavy baryons. Our focus is to determine the static and dynamic properties such as ground state masses, magnetic moment, transition magnetic moment, radiative decay and heavy-to-heavy semileptonic decay rates including their corresponding branching fractions. The ground state masses are calculated by solving the six-dimensional hyperradial Schr\"{o}dinger equation. The magnetic moments and transition magnetic moments for $J^P=\frac{1}{2}^+$ and $J^P=\frac{3}{2}^+$ baryons are also calculated. In addition, radiative M1 decay widths are computed from the transition magnetic moment. We have employed the Isgur-Wise function(IWF) to analyse the semileptonic decay widths of the doubly heavy baryons. The obtained results are compared with other theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>An alternative way to decipher the nature of the doubly charmed tetraquark $T_{cc}(3875)^+$: its antiparticle $T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-$ photoproduction off nuclei near threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the inclusive photoproduction of $T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-$ mesons (which are the antiparticles of the doubly charmed tetraquarks $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ discovered recently by the LHCb Collaboration) from nuclei in the near-threshold energy region within the nuclear spectral function approach by considering incoherent direct (${\gamma}p(n) \to D^+(D^0){T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-}\Lambda^+_c$) photon--nucleon $T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-$ creation processes as well as five possible different scenarios for their internal structure with the main goal of clarifying the possibility to decipher this structure (and, hence, that of $T_{cc}(3875)^+$) in photoproduction via integral and differential observables. We calculate the absolute and relative excitation functions for $T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-$ production off $^{12}$C and $^{184}$W target nuclei at near-threshold photon beam energies of 30--38 GeV, the absolute differential cross sections for their production off these target nuclei at laboratory polar angles of 0$^{\circ}$--10$^{\circ}$ as well as the A and momentum dependences of the relative (transparency ratios) cross sections for $T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-$ production at photon energy of 35 GeV within the adopted scenarios for the $T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-$ meson intrinsic structure. We demonstrate that the absolute and relative observables considered show a certain sensitivity to these scenarios. Therefore, the measurement of such observables in future experiments at the proposed high-luminosity electron-ion colliders EIC and EicC in the US and China in the near-threshold energy region might shed light on the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ internal structure.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of CKM matrix elements and implications of unitarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hierarchy amongst the CKM matrix elements, highlighted recently by Luo and Xing, has been rigorously revisited using the PDG parameterization incorporating unitarity constraints. Further, we have explored the evaluation of the CP violating parameter \epsilon_k for the 9 possible unitarity ensured equivalent independent parametrizations of CKM matrix. Interestingly, we find that not all of these reproduce the value of parameter \epsilon_k, this being presumably due to the hierarchical nature of the CKM matrix elements. This situation is echoing similar conclusions regarding the evaluation of Jarlskog's rephasing invariant parameter J through unitarity ensured equivalent possibilities.</description>

      <title>The Holographic QCD Running Coupling Constant from the Ricci Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through a holographic model of QCD, we present a phenomenological approach to study the running of the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$ in both non-perturbative and perturbative regimes. The renormalization of the metric tensor, driven by the Ricci Flow, and the breaking of conformal and chiral symmetries -- thanks to introducing a double dilaton model and large-$N_c$ corrections -- allow us to relate the existence of an infrared fixed point in the coupling constant with a smooth matching to pQCD well above 2 GeV. The proposed dilaton model yields linear Regge trajectories and vector decay constants similar to their experimental counterparts.</description>

      <title>Probing effective operators in single top quark production in association with a lepton-neutrino pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study single top quark production in association with a lepton-neutrino pair at the LHC within the framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). We focus on relevant two-quark-two-lepton operators ($O^{3}_{lq}$, $O^{1}_{lequ}$, and $O^{3}_{lequ}$). It is known that these operators have tiny effects on the inclusive cross section of standard model tW production and are thus typically ignored in the SMEFT searches. However, we show that by employing smart observables, such as $m_{T2}$, the pp$\rightarrow$t$\ell\nu$ process is significantly sensitive to these operators. We set the most stringent limit on the coupling strength of the $O^{3}_{lq}$ operator by reinterpreting the results of a search for new phenomena with two opposite-charge leptons, jets and missing transverse momentum at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV performed by the ATLAS collaboration. The limits derived on the $O^{1}_{lequ}$ and $O^{3}_{lequ}$ operators are comparable to those obtained from probing EFT effects in pp$\rightarrow$t$\bar{\rm t}\ell\nu$ and pp$\rightarrow$t$\bar{\rm t}\ell\ell$ processes at the LHC. Consequently, we propose to include the effects of these three operators on the pp$\rightarrow$t$\ell\nu$ process in future global SMEFT analyses to increase the sensitivity and to reduce possible degeneracies.</description>

      <title>Fully strange tetraquark resonant states as the cousins of $X(6900)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct systematic calculations of the S-wave fully strange systems with ``normal" $\left(J^{P C}=0^{++}, 1^{+-}, 2^{++}\right)$ and ``exotic" $\left(J^{P C}=0^{+-}, 1^{++}, 2^{+-}\right)$ C-parities, which are the strange analogue of the fully charmed tetraquark state $X(6900)$. Within a constituent quark potential model, we employ the Gaussian expansion method to solve the four-body Schr\"odinger equation and the complex scaling method to identify resonant states. We obtain a series of resonant states and zero-width states in the mass range of 2.7 to 3.3 GeV, with their widths ranging from less than 1 MeV to about 50 MeV. Their rms radii strongly indicate that they are compact tetraquark states. Among these states, the $T_{4s,2^{++}}(2714)$ may be the most likely one to be observed experimentally. We urge the experimental exploration of the $2^{++}$ $s s \bar{s} \bar{s}$ state around 2.7 GeV in the $\phi\phi$ channel. Since the lowest S-wave $s s \bar{s} \bar{s}$ state is around 2.7 GeV, the compact P-wave $s s \bar{s} \bar{s}$ states are expected to be heavier. Hence, $\phi(2170)$ and $X(2370)$ are unlikely to be compact tetraquark states.</description>

      <title>Hot and Dense QCD Shear Viscosity at (almost) NLO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next-to-leading order weak-coupling shear viscosity of QCD was computed 6 years ago.
  However, these results have never been applied at finite baryon chemical potential $\mu$, even though intermediate-energy heavy ion collisions and merging neutron stars may explore the Quark-Gluon Plasma in a regime where baryon chemical potentials are large.
  Here, we extend the next-to-leading order shear viscosity calculations to finite $\mu$, and we show that, while the convergence of the weak-coupling expansion is questionable for achievable plasmas, it is somewhat better at $\mu &gt; T$ than at $\mu=0$.</description>

      <title>Perturbative results of matrix elements of the axial current and their relation with the axial anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Standard Model of particle physics, the axial current is not conserved, due both to fermion masses and to the axial anomaly. Using perturbative quantum chromodynamics, we calculate matrix elements of the local and non-local axial current for a gluon target, clarifying their connection with the axial anomaly. In so doing, we also reconsider classic results obtained in the context of the nucleon spin sum rule as well as recent results for off-forward kinematics. An important role is played by the infrared regulator, for which we put a special emphasis on the nonzero quark mass. We highlight cancellations that take place between contributions from the axial anomaly and the quark mass, and we elaborate on the relation of those cancellations with the conservation of angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Linear power corrections to single top production and decay at the LHC in the narrow width approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider top quark production and decay in the narrow width approximation and study if the polarisation effects, that manifest themselves in correlations of angular distributions of particles from top quark decays and final state jets in the production sub-process, are affected by linear power corrections. We find that, in general, the answer to this question is affirmative. We also discuss how these non-perturbative corrections affect polarisation observables used to study single top production at the LHC. Finally, we point out that generic kinematic distributions of leptons from top quark decays are affected by linear power corrections, which may have implications for proposals to extract the top quark mass from such leptonic observables. On the other hand, we demonstrate that the distribution of the ``out-of-collision-plane'' component of the positron momentum is free from linear power corrections, making it an interesting candidate for the top quark mass measurement.</description>

      <title>The Inevitable Quark Three-Body Force and its Implications for Exotic States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-body nuclear forces are essential for explaining the properties of light nuclei with a nucleon number greater than three. Building on insights from nuclear physics, we extract the form of quark three-body interactions and demonstrate that these terms are crucial for extending the quark model fit of the meson spectrum to include baryons using the same parameter set. We then discuss the implications of our findings for exotic configurations involving more than three quarks, such as the $T_{cc}$ and $\chi_{c1}(3872)$. We find that the quark three-body interactions provide additional repulsion on the order of 10 MeV for the compact configurations of both the $T_{cc}$ and $\chi_{c1}(3872)$. This result, combined with previous calculations, strongly suggests that these tetraquark states are molecular rather than compact states.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing Universal Thermalization Dynamics in a (2+1)D Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating non-equilibrium phenomena in strongly-interacting quantum many-body systems, including thermalization, is a promising application of near-term and future quantum computation. By performing experiments on a digital quantum computer consisting of fully-connected optically-controlled trapped ions, we study the role of entanglement in the thermalization dynamics of a $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory in 2+1 spacetime dimensions. Using randomized-measurement protocols, we efficiently learn a classical approximation of non-equilibrium states that yields the gap-ratio distribution and the spectral form factor of the entanglement Hamiltonian. These observables exhibit universal early-time signals for quantum chaos, a prerequisite for thermalization. Our work, therefore, establishes quantum computers as robust tools for studying universal features of thermalization in complex many-body systems, including in gauge theories.</description>

Abstract: These notes are based on lectures I gave at TASI 2024 on Physics for Machine Learning. The focus is on neural network theory, organized according to network expressivity, statistics, and dynamics. I present classic results such as the universal approximation theorem and neural network / Gaussian process correspondence, and also more recent results such as the neural tangent kernel, feature learning with the maximal update parameterization, and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks. The exposition on neural network theory emphasizes a field theoretic perspective familiar to theoretical physicists. I elaborate on connections between the two, including a neural network approach to field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is possible to make a detector which clicks after absorbing a single graviton. Similarly, it is possible to make a gravitational wave detector which can see the quantum noise induced by certain highly squeezed states of the graviton. However, contrary to some recent arguments in the literature, observation of either or both of these signals would not constitute proof or even evidence that the gravitational field is quantized. This is a simple technical statement: a classical gravitational wave can produce the same output data in a detector. Here we explain this result, presented earlier in arXiv:2308.12988, which is a straightforward extension of an ancient argument in quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Cosmological Research with the FAST Array: 21-cm Intensity Mapping Survey Observation Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise cosmological measurements are essential for understanding the evolution of the universe and the nature of dark energy. The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), the most sensitive single-dish radio telescope, has the potential to provide the precise cosmological measurements through neutral hydrogen 21-cm intensity mapping sky survey. This paper primarily explores the potential of technological upgrades for FAST in cosmology. The most crucial upgrade begins with equipping FAST with a wide-band receiver ($0 &lt; z &lt; 2.5$). This upgrade can enable FAST to achieve higher precision in cosmological parameter estimation than the Square Kilometre Array Phase-1 Mid frequency. On this basis, expanding to a FAST array (FASTA) consisting of six identical FAST would offer significant improvements in precision compared to FAST. Additionally, compared with the current results from the data combination of cosmic microwave background, baryon acoustic oscillations (optical galaxy surveys), and type Ia supernovae, FASTA can provide comparable constraints. Specifically, for the dark-energy equation-of-state parameters, FASTA can achieve $\sigma(w_0) = 0.09$ and $\sigma(w_a) = 0.33$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new Newtonian limit of general relativity is established for stationary axisymmetric gravitationally bound differentially rotating matter distributions with internal pressure. The self-consistent coupling of quasilocal gravitational energy and angular momentum leads to a modified Poisson equation. The coupled equations of motion of the effective fluid elements are also modified, with quasilocal angular momentum and frame-dragging leading to novel dynamics. The solutions of the full system reproduce the phenonomenology of collisionless dark matter for disc galaxies, offering an explanation for their observed rotation curves. Halos of abundant cold dark matter particles are not required.</description>

Abstract: In recent works, we have shown how $n$-point correlation functions in perturbative QFT can be computed without running into intermediate divergences. Here we want to illustrate explicitly that one can calculate the quantum effective potential by the same method. As a main example, we consider a theory with two fields having large and small vacuum expectation values (vev). We show that no fine-tuning between the {\it physical quantities} is needed to keep the hierarchy between the vevs of different fields.</description>

      <title>The impact of the phase transition on Quark-Gluon Plasma with an extremely strong magnetic field in holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phase transition within an extremely strong magnetic background field, employing a holographic Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) model with a focus on entropy and pressure properties. At relatively modest magnetic field strengths, our study discerns a crossover transition between the normal phase and the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) phase as the temperature rises. In contrast, under the influence of an extremely strong magnetic field, a first-order phase transition is observed. A critical point is identified at $ (eB_c, T_c) \approx (2.8623 \, \text{GeV}^2, 0.1191 \, \text{GeV}) $, which corresponds to a second-order phase transition. This phase structure is found to be in qualitative agreement with lattice simulation predictions reported in [Phys. Rev. D \textbf{105}, 034511 (2022)]. Furthermore, we explore the impact of the magnetic field on the jet quenching parameter across various phases. At zero magnetic field ($ eB = 0$ ), the normalized jet quenching parameter $ \hat{q} / T^3 $ exhibits a monotonic increase with temperature. However, in the presence of a magnetic background field, the normalized jet quenching parameters not only display directional anisotropy but also experience a universal enhancement, particularly in the vicinity of the critical temperature region. This observation suggests that the jet quenching parameter could potentially act as an indicator of phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a Bayesian inference study for relativistic heavy-ion collisions in the Beam Energy Scan program at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider. The theoretical model simulates event-by-event (3+1)D collision dynamics using hydrodynamics and hadronic transport theory. We analyze the model's 20-dimensional posterior distributions obtained using three model emulators with different accuracy and demonstrate the essential role of training an accurate model emulator in the Bayesian analysis. Our analysis provides robust constraints on the Quark-Gluon Plasma's transport properties and various aspects of (3+1)D relativistic nuclear dynamics. By running full model simulations with 100 parameter sets sampled from the posterior distribution, we make predictions for $p_{\rm T}$-differential observables and estimate their systematic theory uncertainty. A sensitivity analysis is performed to elucidate how individual experimental observables respond to different model parameters, providing useful physics insights into the phenomenological model for heavy-ion collisions.</description>

Abstract: We explore the multi-scatter capturing of the massive dark matter (DM) particle inside the neutron star via a momentum-dependent dark matter-nucleon scattering cross-section. We find that the capturing enhanced for the positive velocity and momentum transfer dependent DM-nucleon scattering in comparison with the constant cross-section case. Further, a large capture of the DM particles can be thermalized and lead to black hole formation and, therefore, destroy the neutron star. Using the observation of the old neutron star in the DM-dominated region, we obtain strong constraints on massive DM parameters.</description>

      <title>Nanohertz gravitational waves from a quasar-based supermassive black hole binary population model as dark sirens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, several pulsar timing array (PTA) projects have detected evidence of the existence of a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) in the nanohertz frequency band, providing confidence in detecting individual supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) in the future. Nanohertz GWs emitted by inspiraling SMBHBs encode the luminosity distances of SMBHBs. They can serve as dark sirens to explore the cosmic expansion history via a statistical method to obtain the redshift information of GW sources' host galaxies using galaxy catalogs. The theoretical analysis of the dark siren method relies on the modeling of the population of SMBHBs. Using a population model consistent with the latest SGWB observations is essential, as the SGWB provides significant information about the distribution of SMBHBs. In this work, we employ a quasar-based model, which can self-consistently account for the SGWB amplitude, to estimate the population of SMBHBs. We constrain the Hubble constant using the mock GW data from different detection cases of PTAs in the future. Our results show that a PTA consisting of 100 pulsars with a white noise level of 20 ns could measure the Hubble constant with a precision close to $1\%$ over a 10-year observation period, and a PTA with 200 pulsars may achieve this goal over a 5-year observation period. The results indicate that modeling the SMBHB population significantly influences the analysis of dark sirens, and SMBHB dark sirens have the potential to be developed as a valuable cosmological probe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multireference density functional theory (MR-DFT) has been a pivotal method for studying nuclear spectroscopy and neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay. However, quantifying their theoretical uncertainties has been a significant challenge due to the computational demands. This study introduces a subspace-projected covariant density functional theory (SP-CDFT), which efficiently emulates MR-CDFT calculations for nuclear low-lying states. This approach leverages the eigenvector continuation method combined with the quantum-number projected generator coordinate method, based on a relativistic energy density functional (EDF). We apply SP-CDFT to investigate the correlations among the physical quantities of nuclear matter, nuclear low-lying spectroscopy, and the nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay in the two heaviest candidate nuclei. Our findings reveal generally strong correlations between the NMEs of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay and the excitation energy of the $2_1^+$ state, as well as the $E2$ transition strength, although these correlations vary significantly among nuclei. The Bayesian analysis, which integrates the properties of nuclear matter and low-lying states, yields mean values and statistical uncertainties for the NMEs 4.33(5) for $^{136}$Xe and 5.51(14) for $^{150}$Nd. This work also paves the way for refining nuclear EDF parameters using spectroscopic data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Baryons in finite nuclei, nuclear matter and dense compact-star matter are described in terms of Cheshire Cat for QCD. A potential conceptual link, admittedly short in mathematical rigor, between their manifestations is made by what's called Cheshire Cat Principle. Put in terms taken ``dual" to QCD variables, going to very high density exposes quantum Hall droplets -- or pancakes -- at which the dilaton-limit fixed point with $g_A\to 1$, $f_\pi\to f_\chi$ -- where $f_\pi$ and $f_\chi$ are respectively the pion and dilaton decay constants -- and the baryon parity-doubling are reached. This scenario suggests a thus-far totally unexplored structure of dual baryonic matter at high density which does neither require nor rule out (rapid) first-order phase transitions from hadrons to quarks in the core of compact stars on the verge of gravitational collapse.</description>

Abstract: The free energy, or equivalently the ground state energy in finite volume, may be calculated from forward scattering amplitudes using a formula due to Dashen, Ma, and Bernstein. However a naive treatment leads to singularities when considering the scattering of three or more particles. It is shown in detail how the approach can be applied to multi-particle scattering in various massive scalar theories in 1+1d, with or without integrability. The results for the sinh-Gordon, Lieb-Liniger, and $O(N)$ non-linear sigma models are compared to exact results. It is shown how bound states can be considered in this approach by considering the attractive Lieb-Liniger model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare the dark matter(DM) production processes and its parameters space in the background of reheating obtained from two chief systems in the early Universe: the inflaton $\phi$ and the primordial black holes (PBHs). We concentrated on the mechanism where DMs are universally produced only from the PBH decay and the generation of the standard model plasma from both inflton and PBHs. Whereas the distribution of Primordial Black Holes behaves like dust, the inflaton phenomenology depends strongly on its equation of state after the inflationary phase, which in turn is conditioned by the nature of the potential $V(\phi)$. Depending upon the initial mass and population of PBHs, a large range of DM mass is shown to be viable if reheating is controlled by PBHs itself. Inflaton-dominated reheating is observed to further widen such possibilities depending on the initial population of black holes and its mass as well as the coupling of the inflaton to the standard model sector.</description>

Abstract: We compare the QCD axion phase-space distribution from unitarized next-to-leading order chiral perturbation theory with the one extracted from pion-scattering data. We derive a robust bound by confronting momentum-dependent Boltzmann equations against up-to-date observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background, of the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations and of primordial abundances. These datasets imply $m_{a} \leq \, 0.16 $~eV for the 95% credible interval, i.e. $\sim$30% stronger bound than what previously found. We present forecasts using dedicated likelihoods for future cosmological surveys and the sphaleron rate from unquenched lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>Radiative Corrections to Aid the Direct Detection of the Higgsino-like Neutralino Dark Matter: Spin-Independent Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The lightest neutralino ($\tilde{\chi}_1^0$) is a good Dark Matter (DM) candidate in the R-parity conserving Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). In this work, we consider the light higgsino-like neutralino as the Lightest Stable Particle (LSP), thanks to rather small higgsino mass parameter $\mu$. We then estimate the prominent radiative corrections to the neutralino-neutralino-Higgs boson vertices. We show that for higgsino-like $\tilde{\chi}_1^0$, these corrections can significantly influence the spin-independent direct detection cross-section, even contributing close to 100\% in certain regions of the parameter space. These corrections, therefore, play an important role in deducing constraints on the mass of the higgsino-like lightest neutralino DM, and thus the $\mu$ parameter.</description>

      <title>GeV-scale dark matter with $p$-wave Breit-Wigner enhanced annihilation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a light scalar dark matter candidate with mass in the GeV range whose $p$-wave annihilation is enhanced through a Breit-Wigner resonance. The annihilation actually proceeds in the $s$-channel via a dark photon mediator whose mass is nearly equal to the masses of the incoming particles. We compute the temperature at which kinetic decoupling between dark matter and the primordial plasma occurs and show that including the effect of kinetic decoupling can reduce the dark matter relic density by orders of magnitude. For typical scalar masses ranging from 200 MeV to 5 GeV, we determine the range of values allowed for the dark photon couplings to the scalar and to the standard model particles after requiring the relic density to be in agreement with the value extracted from cosmological observations. We then show that $\mu$ and $y$-distortions of the CMB spectrum and X-ray data from XMM-Newton strongly constrain the model and rule out the region where the dark matter annihilation cross-section is strongly enhanced at small dispersion velocities. Constraints from direct detection searches and from accelerator searches for dark photons offer complementary probes of the model.</description>

      <title>Leptogenesis, primordial gravitational waves, and PBH-induced reheating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of producing the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe uniquely from the evaporation of primordial black holes (PBH) that are formed in an inflaton-dominated background. Considering the inflaton $(\phi)$ to oscillate in a monomial potential $V(\phi)\propto\phi^n$, we show, it is possible to obtain the desired baryon asymmetry via vanilla leptogenesis from evaporating PBHs of initial mass $\lesssim 10$ g. We find that the allowed parameter space is heavily dependent on the shape of the inflaton potential during reheating (determined by the exponent of the potential $n$), the energy density of PBHs (determined by $\beta$), and the nature of the coupling between the inflaton and the Standard Model (SM). To complete the minimal gravitational framework, we also include in our analysis the gravitational leptogenesis set-up through inflaton scattering via exchange of graviton, which opens up an even larger window for PBH mass, depending on the background equation of state. We finally illustrate that such gravitational leptogenesis scenarios can be tested with upcoming gravitational wave (GW) detectors, courtesy of the blue-tilted primordial GW with inflationary origin, thus paving a way to probe a PBH-induced reheating together with leptogenesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The near-threshold clustering phenomenon is well understood by the low-energy universality, for shallow bound states below the threshold. Nevertheless, the characteristics of resonances slightly above the threshold still lack thorough elucidation. We introduce a novel probabilistic interpretation scheme for complex compositeness of resonances, in which resonances with unphysically large decay widths are inherently excluded. Employing this scheme to analyze resonances via the effective range expansion, we demonstrate that near-threshold resonances have small composite fraction, in sharp contrast to shallow bound states below the threshold.</description>

      <title>Measuring differential particle correlations in relativistic nuclear collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the transverse momentum ($p_T$) dependencies of Symmetric and Asymmetric Correlations (SC and ASC) with one and two particles of interest in Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV. Leveraging the AMPT model, the investigation delves into the sensitivity of these correlations to the final state effects, providing valuable insights into their potential for constraining the final state effects' $p_T$ dependencies. The HIJING model is employed as a benchmark for non-flow correlations, shedding light on their impact on interpreting SC and ASC data. Moreover, the study points out that differential SC and ASC with one and two particles of interest (POIs) typically incorporate contributions from event-plane angle fluctuations. Consequently, this work highlights the significance of SC and ASC with one and two POIs as valuable tools for investigating the $p_T$ nature of the final state effects and advocates for comprehensive experimental measurements across various beam energies and system sizes to enhance our understanding and provide additional constraints for theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Constraining pseudo-Diracness with astrophysical neutrino flavors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The three Standard Model neutrinos can have Majorana mass or strictly Dirac mass, but both scenarios are practically indistinguishable in neutrino oscillation experiments. If they are pseudo-Dirac, however, there will be new mass splittings among the pseudo-Dirac pairs, potentially leaving traces in neutrino oscillation phenomena. In this work, we use flavor ratios of astrophysical neutrinos to discriminate different possible mass spectra of pseudo-Dirac neutrinos. We show that it will be possible to impose robust bounds of order $\delta m^2_3 \lesssim 10^{-12}$ $\text{eV}^2$ on the new mass squared splitting involving the third pseudo-Dirac mass eigenstates (those with the least electron flavor composition) with the future experiment IceCube-Gen2. The derived sensitivity is robust because it only assumes an extragalactic origin for the astrophysical neutrinos and hierarchical pseudo-Dirac mass spectrum. In case the neutrino sources are known in the future, such bounds can potentially improve by up to five orders of magnitude, reaching $\delta m^2_3 \lesssim 10^{-17}$ $\text{eV}^2$.</description>

      <title>Standard Model anomalies and vacuum stability for lepton portals with extra $U(1)$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the experimental values of the muon $(g-2)_\mu$ and of the $W$ boson mass $m_{_W}$ have both indicated significant deviations from the SM predictions, motivating the exploration of extensions with extra particles and symmetries. We revisit a lepton portal model with $U(1)'$ gauge symmetry where an extra Higgs doublet, a scalar singlet and one $SU(2)_L$ singlet vector-like fermion are introduced. In this model, $(g-2)_\mu$ can be explained by extra one-loop contributions from the vector-like lepton and the $Z'$ boson, whereas $m_{_W}$ can be increased by a tree-level mixing between the $Z$ and $Z'$. Setting the $Z'$ and lepton couplings at low energies to account for the SM anomalies, we perform a Renormalization Group analysis to investigate on the high-energy behaviour of the model, in particular on the issue of vacuum stability. We find that in the alignment limit for the two Higgs doublets, the Landau pole and the scale where perturbativity is lost are of order $10-100\,{\rm TeV}$, not far from the scales experimentally reached so far, and sensibly lower than the stability scale. We show how the Landau pole can be increased up to $\sim10^9\,{\rm GeV}$ in a misaligned scenario where the experimental anomalies are still accommodated and a positive shift of the Higgs quartic coupling to improve stability can be achieved.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic $|G_E/G_M|$ ratios of hyperons at large timelike $q^2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, it has become possible to measure not only the magnitude of the electric ($G_E$) and magnetic ($G_M$) form factors of spin $\frac{1}{2}$ baryons, but also to measure the relative phases of those quantities in the timelike kinematic region. Aiming to interpret present $|G_E/G_M|$ data on hyperons of the baryon octet, as well as to predict future data, we present model calculations of that ratio for large invariant 4-momentum square $q^2$ in the timelike region ($q^2&gt;0$). Without any further parameter fitting, we extend to the timelike region a covariant quark model previously developed to describe the kinematic spacelike region ($q^2 \le 0$) of the baryon octet form factors. The model takes into account both the effects of valence quarks and the excitations of the meson cloud which dresses the baryons. We report here that our results are in good agreement with very recent data from BESIII, within the uncertainty limits of our model. We also make new predictions which may be tested in the near future, when the range of the present measurements is expanded to the 20--50 GeV$^2$ region.</description>

      <title>Ultra-High-Resolution Detector Simulation with Intra-Event Aware GAN and Self-Supervised Relational Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating high-resolution detector responses is a computationally intensive process that has long been challenging in Particle Physics. Despite the ability of generative models to streamline it, full ultra-high-granularity detector simulation still proves to be difficult as it contains correlated and fine-grained information. To overcome these limitations, we propose Intra-Event Aware Generative Adversarial Network (IEA-GAN). IEA-GAN presents a Relational Reasoning Module that approximates an event in detector simulation, generating contextualized high-resolution full detector responses with a proper relational inductive bias. IEA-GAN also introduces a Self-Supervised intra-event aware loss and Uniformity loss, significantly enhancing sample fidelity and diversity. We demonstrate IEA-GAN's application in generating sensor-dependent images for the ultra-high-granularity Pixel Vertex Detector (PXD), with more than 7.5 M information channels at the Belle II Experiment. Applications of this work span from Foundation Models for high-granularity detector simulation, such as at the HL-LHC (High Luminosity LHC), to simulation-based inference and fine-grained density estimation. To our knowledge, IEA-GAN is the first algorithm for faithful ultra-high-granularity full detector simulation with event-based reasoning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous breaking of symmetries leads to universal phenomena. We extend this notion to $(-1)$-form U(1) symmetries. The spontaneous breaking is diagnosed by a dependence of the vacuum energy on a constant background field $\theta$, which can be probed by the topological susceptibility. This leads to a reinterpretation of the Strong CP problem as arising from a spontaneously broken instantonic symmetry in QCD. We discuss how known solutions to the problem are unified in this framework and explore some, so far unsuccessful, attempts to find new solutions.</description>

      <title>Observation and differential cross section measurement of neutral current DIS events with an empty hemisphere in the Breit frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Breit frame provides a natural frame to analyze lepton-proton scattering events. In this reference frame, the parton model hard interactions between a quark and an exchanged boson defines the coordinate system such that the struck quark is back-scattered along the virtual photon momentum direction. In Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), higher order perturbative or non-perturbative effects can change this picture drastically. As Bjorken-$x$ decreases below one half, a rather peculiar event signature is predicted with increasing probability, where no radiation is present in one of the two Breit-frame hemispheres and all emissions are to be found in the other hemisphere. At higher orders in $\alpha_s$ or in the presence of soft QCD effects, predictions of the rate of these events are far from trivial, and that motivates measurements with real data. We report on the first observation of the empty current hemisphere events in electron-proton collisions at the HERA collider using data recorded with the H1 detector at a center-of-mass energy of 319 GeV. The fraction of inclusive neutral-current DIS events with an empty hemisphere is found to be $0.0112 \pm 3.9\,\%_\text{stat} \pm 4.5\,\%_\text{syst} \pm 1.6\,\%_\text{mod}$ in the selected kinematic region of $150&lt; Q^2&lt;1500$ GeV$^2$ and inelasticity $0.14&lt; y&lt;0.7$. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 351.1 pb$^{-1}$, sufficient to enable differential cross section measurements of these events. The results show an enhanced discriminating power at lower Bjorken-$x$ among different Monte Carlo event generator predictions.</description>

      <title>Measurement of groomed event shape observables in deep-inelastic electron-proton scattering at HERA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The H1 Collaboration at HERA reports the first measurement of groomed event shape observables in deep inelastic electron-proton scattering (DIS) at $\sqrt{s}=319$ GeV, using data recorded between the years 2003 and 2007 with an integrated luminosity of $351$ pb$^{-1}$. Event shapes provide incisive probes of perturbative and non-perturbative QCD. Grooming techniques have been used for jet measurements in hadronic collisions; this paper presents the first application of grooming to DIS data. The analysis is carried out in the Breit frame, utilizing the novel Centauro jet clustering algorithm that is designed for DIS event topologies. Events are required to have squared momentum-transfer $Q^2 &gt; 150$ GeV$^2$ and inelasticity $ 0.2 &lt; y &lt; 0.7$. We report measurements of the production cross section of groomed event 1-jettiness and groomed invariant mass for several choices of grooming parameter. Monte Carlo model calculations and analytic calculations based on Soft Collinear Effective Theory are compared to the measurements.</description>

      <title>Statistical divergences in high-dimensional hypothesis testing and a modern technique for estimating them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06397v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypothesis testing in high dimensional data is a notoriously difficult problem without direct access to competing models' likelihood functions. This paper argues that statistical divergences can be used to quantify the difference between the population distributions of observed data and competing models, justifying their use as the basis of a hypothesis test. We go on to point out how modern techniques for functional optimization let us estimate many divergences, without the need for population likelihood functions, using samples from two distributions alone. We use a physics-based example to show how the proposed two-sample test can be implemented in practice, and discuss the necessary steps required to mature the ideas presented into an experimental framework. The code used has been made available for others to use.</description>
