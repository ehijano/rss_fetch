      <title>Tilted dipolar bosons in the quasi-2D regime: from liquid stripes to droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize a system of tilted dipoles in a quasi two-dimensional (flattened) geometry and in the thermodynamic limit. We consider a finite trapping in the z-axis achievable in current experiments. We compute the phase diagram of the system at its equilibrium density for high tilting angles, where it becomes self-bound, and a striped liquid state emerges. To characterize the system, we perform a variational calculation, which is benchmarked with the solution of the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We connect the phenomenology in the thermodynamic limit to the physics of the finite-size system, provide parameters for the realization of potentially supersolid striped states and study the critical number for dipolar droplet formation. Our results are helpful to guide potential experiments in the study of dipolar atoms in quasi two-dimensional geometries in the dipole-dominated regime.</description>

      <title>Quasi-periodic moir\'{e} patterns and dimensional localization in three-dimensional quasi-moir\'{e} crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in spin-dependent optical lattices [Meng et al., Nature \textbf{615}, 231 (2023)] have enabled the experimental implementation of two superimposed three-dimensional lattices, presenting new opportunities to investigate \textit{three-dimensional moir\'{e} physics} in ultracold atomic gases. This work studies the moir\'{e} physics of atoms within a spin-dependent cubic lattice with relative twists along different directions. It is discovered that dimensionality significantly influences the low-energy moir\'{e} physics. From a geometric perspective, this manifests in the observation that moir\'{e} patterns, generated by rotating lattices along different axes, can exhibit either periodic or quasi-periodic behavior--a feature not present in two-dimensional systems. We develop a low-energy effective theory applicable to systems with arbitrary rotation axes and small rotation angles. This theory elucidates the emergence of quasi-periodicity in three dimensions and demonstrates its correlation with the arithmetic properties of the rotation axes. Numerical analyses reveal that these quasi-periodic moir\'{e} potentials can lead to distinctive dimensional localization behaviors of atoms, manifesting as localized wave functions in planar or linear configurations.</description>

      <title>Self-bound monolayer crystals of ultracold polar molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the physics of ultracold dipolar molecules using path-integral quantum Monte Carlo simulations, and construct the complete phase diagram extending from weak to strong interactions and from small to mesoscopic particle numbers. Our calculations predict the formation of self-bound quantum droplets at interaction strengths lower than previously anticipated. For stronger interactions, the droplet continuously loses superfluidity as correlations develop, and is eventually found to undergo a transition to a crystalline monolayer that remains self-bound without external confinement. The spontaneous formation of such two-dimensional phases from a three-dimensional quantum gas is traced back to the peculiar anisotropic form of the dipole-dipole interaction generated by microwave-dressing of rotational molecular states. For sufficiently large particle numbers, crystallization takes place for comparably low interaction strengths that do not promote two-body bound states and should thus be observable in ongoing experiments without limitations from three-body recombination.</description>

      <title>Bubbles in a box: Eliminating edge nucleation in cold-atom simulators of vacuum decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decay of metastable 'false vacuum' states via bubble nucleation plays a crucial role in many cosmological scenarios. Cold-atom analog experiments will soon provide the first empirical probes of this process, with potentially far-reaching implications for early-Universe cosmology and high-energy physics. However, an inevitable difference between these analog systems and the early Universe is that the former have a boundary. We show, using a combination of Euclidean calculations and real-time lattice simulations, that these boundaries generically cause rapid bubble nucleation on the edge of the experiment, obscuring the bulk nucleation that is relevant for cosmology. We demonstrate that implementing a high-density 'trench' region at the boundary completely eliminates this problem, and recovers the desired cosmological behavior. Our findings are relevant for ongoing efforts to probe vacuum decay in the laboratory, providing a practical solution to a key experimental obstacle.</description>

      <title>Universal efficiency boost in prethermal quantum heat engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heat engines near the adiabatic limit typically assume a working medium at thermal equilibrium. However, quantum many-body systems often showcase conservation laws that hinder thermalization, leading to prethermalization in exotic stationary phases. This work explores whether prethermalization enhances or reduces engine efficiency. We investigate Otto cycles in quantum systems with varying numbers of conserved quantities. We find that additional conservation laws reduce efficiency at positive temperatures, but enhance it in regimes of negative temperatures. Our findings stem from general thermodynamic inequalities for infinitesimal cycles, and we provide evidence for integrable models undergoing finite cycles using the theoretical framework of Generalized Hydrodynamics. The relevance of our results for quantum simulators is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Topological Phase Transition in the Two-Leg Hubbard Model: Emergence of the Haldane Phase via Diagonal Hopping and Strong Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the two-leg Hubbard model with diagonal hopping to explore the interplay between geometrical frustration and strong electron-electron interactions. Using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method, we demonstrate the emergence of a topological Haldane phase, which results explicitly from the complementary effects of diagonal hopping-induced frustration and strong on-site Coulomb repulsion. The topological phase transition from a trivial insulator to the nontrivial Haldane phase is characterized by significant changes in magnetic properties, edge correlations, and the appearance of a nonzero string order parameter. Furthermore, we confirm the topological nature of this phase through a detailed analysis of the spin gap and entanglement spectrum, demonstrating clear signatures of symmetry-protected topological order.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic entanglement lightcone from eigenstate correlations in the many-body localised phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the operator entanglement of the time-evolution operator through the framework of eigenstate correlations. Focusing on strongly disordered quantum many-body systems in the many-body localised (MBL) regime, we analyse the operator entanglement across various spatiotemporal cuts, revealing the logarithmic lightcone of entanglement spreading. We demonstrate that this logarithmic lightcone arises directly from a hierarchy of energyscales and lengthscales encoded in eigenstate correlations. By characterising the statistics of these hierarchical scales, we develop a microscopic theory for the spatiotemporal structure of entanglement spreading in MBL systems -- without invoking phenomenological constructs such as $\ell$-bits. This approach reveals the fundamental connection between eigenstate correlations and the emergent entanglement structure in MBL systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum many-body thermal machines enabled by atom-atom correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05266v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle-particle correlations, characterized by Glauber's second-order correlation function,play an important role in the understanding of various phenomena in radio and optical astronomy, quantum and atom optics, particle physics, condensed matter physics, and quantum many-body theory. However, the relevance of such correlations to quantum thermodynamics has so far remained illusive. Here, we propose and investigate a class of quantum many-body thermal machines whose operation is directly enabled by second-order atom-atom correlations in an ultracold atomic gas. More specifically, we study quantum thermal machines that operate in a sudden interaction-quench Otto cycle and utilize a one-dimensional Lieb-Liniger gas of repulsively interacting bosons as the working fluid. The atom-atom correlations in such a gas are different to those of a classical ideal gas, and are a result of the interplay between interparticle interactions, quantum statistics, and thermal fluctuations. We show that operating these thermal machines in the intended regimes, such as a heat engine, refrigerator, thermal accelerator, or heater, would be impossible without such atom-atom correlations. Our results constitute a step forward in the design of conceptually new quantum thermodynamic devices which take advantage of uniquely quantum resources such as quantum coherence, correlations, and entanglement.</description>

      <title>Collapse of a quantum vortex in an attractive two-dimensional Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We experimentally and numerically study the collapse dynamics of a quantum vortex in a two-dimensional atomic superfluid following a fast interaction ramp from repulsion to attraction. We find the conditions and time scales for a superfluid vortex to radially converge into a quasi-stationary density profile, demonstrating the spontaneous formation of a vortex soliton-like structure in an atomic Bose gas. We record an emergent self-similar dynamics caused by an azimuthal modulational instability, which amplifies initial density perturbations and leads to the eventual splitting of a solitonic ring profile or direct fragmentation of a superfluid into disordered, but roughly circular arrays of Townes soliton-like wavepackets. These dynamics are qualitatively reproduced by simulations based on the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. However, a discrepancy in the magnitude of amplified density fluctuations predicted by our mean-field analysis suggests the presence of effects beyond the mean-field approximation. Our study sets the stage for exploring out-of-equilibrium dynamics of vortex quantum matter quenched to attractive interactions and their universal characteristics.</description>

      <title>The odd-even effect of mosaic modulation period of quasi-periodic hopping on the Anderson localization in a one-dimensional lattice model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.10715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate Anderson localization in a one-dimensional lattice with a mosaic off-diagonal quasiperiodic hopping. Our findings reveal that the localization behavior of zero-energy states is highly dependent on the parity of the mosaic modulation period, denoted as $\kappa$. Specifically, when $\kappa$ is an odd integer, there is no Anderson localization transition even for large quasiperiodic hopping strengths, and the zero-energy state remains in a critical state. On the other hand, for an even $\kappa$ and a generic quasiperiodic hopping, the zero-energy state becomes a localized edge state at either the left or right end of the system. Additionally, we observe that the geometric mean value of the energy spectrum is equal to the constant hopping for an even $\kappa$, while for an odd $\kappa$, it is equal to the geometric mean value of the hopping. This odd-even effect of the mosaic period also extends to other eigenstates near zero energy. More specifically, for an odd $\kappa$, there exists an energy window in which the eigenstates remain critical even for strong quasiperiodic hopping. In contrast, for an even $\kappa$, an Anderson localization transition occurs as the hopping strength increases. Furthermore, we are able to accurately determine the Lyapunov exponent $\gamma(E)$ and the mobility edges $E_c$. By analyzing the Lyapunov exponent, we identify critical regions in the hopping-energy parameter planes. Additionally, as the energy approaches the mobility edges, we observe a critical index of localization length of $\nu=1$. Finally, we demonstrate that different systems can be characterized by their Lyapunov exponent $\gamma(E)$ and Avila's acceleration $\omega(E)$.</description>

      <title>Quantum vorticity: a not so effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a comprehensive picture for the formulation of the perfect fluid in the modern effective field theory formalism at both the classical and quantum level. Due to the necessity of decomposing the hydrodynamical variables $(\rho, p, u^\mu)$ into other internal degrees of freedom, the procedure is inherently not unique. We discuss and compare the different inequivalent formulations. These theories possess a peculiarity: the presence of an infinite dimensional symmetry implying a vanishing dispersion relation $\omega = 0$ for the transverse modes. This sets the stage for UV-IR mixing in the quantum theory, which we study in the different formulations focussing on the incompressible limit. We observe that the dispersion relation gets modified by quantum effects to become $\omega \propto \mathbf{k}^2$, where the fundamental excitations can be viewed as vortex-anti-vortex pairs. The spectrum exhibits infinitely many types of degenerate quanta. The unusual sensitivity to UV quantum fluctuations renders the implementation of the defining infinite symmetry somewhat subtle. However we present a lattice regularization that preserves a deformed version of such symmetry.</description>
