      <title>Organisational justice moderates the link between leadership, work engagement and innovation work behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regional civil servants in Indonesia, especially in the eastern regions, are now required to exhibit innovative work behavior (IWB) as mandated by national regulations. While transformational leadership (TFL) and work engagement (WE) are believed to foster such behavior, the impact and the moderating role of organizational justice (OJ) remain underexplored. This study addresses that gap by examining how TFL and WE contribute to IWB development within the context of public sector work, with OJ potentially moderating these relationships. This study aimed to determine the direct influence of TFL, WE, and OJ on IWB and to analyze the role of OJ as a moderating variable. This research was conducted in the eastern region of Indonesia, especially North Maluku Province, in various regional apparatus organizations. and a random sample of 500 people was taken. This study used Structural Equation Modeling-Partial Least Squares (SEM-PLS) regression analysis as a data analysis method to test the causal relationship and moderation effects of each hypothesis. The study findings reveal that while TFL and WE directly influence IWB, OJ neither has a direct effect nor serves as a moderating variable. These findings offer theoretical and practical contributions to local government organizations in Indonesia, emphasizing the importance of leadership and engagement in enhancing innovative behavior at work. This study extends and enhances the development of social exchange theory based on civil servants' IWB. Furthermore, this study expands the theoretical perspective by examining how TFL, WE, and OJ influence innovative work behavior practices to improve employee innovative behaviour. Finally, this study empirically examines the moderating impact of organizational justice on the relationship between TFL and WE on IWB.</description>

      <title>How Big Data Dilutes Cognitive Resources, Interferes with Rational Decision-making and Affects Wealth Distribution ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Big data has exponentially dilated consumption demand and speed, but can they all convert to utility? We argue about the measures of consumption and utility acquisition in CARR utility function under the condition of big data interaction, we indicate its weakness, i.e., irrational consumption does not lead to the acquisition of utility. We consider that big data, which is different from macro and micro economic signals, formed by general information entropy, affects agents' rational cognition, which makes a part of their consumption ineffective. We preliminarily propose the theory that how dilution mechanism driven by big data will affect agents' cognitive resources. Based on theoretical and empirical analysis, we construct the Consumption Adjustment Weight Function (CAWF) of agents interacting with big data and further apply it to a model of firm wealth distribution with financial frictions, we get analytical solutions according to the Mean Field Game (MFG) and find: Lower financial friction increases the average wealth of firms but also leads to greater wealth inequality. When agents convert effective consumption into utility, which is a weight of total consumption, the average wealth of firms increases with the weight increasing. Meanwhile, wealth inequality follows a U-shaped trend, and it will be the lowest level when the weight approaches to 0.5. In conclusion, we try to provide a new complementary hypothesis to refine the 'Lucas Critique' according to the cognitive resources as endowments involved in the decision-making of agents.</description>

      <title>Patent citations and patent importance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article reviews the empirical evidence on the use of patent citations as a proxy for invention importance. It distinguishes between technical merit, private economic value, and social value, and surveys validation studies using expert ratings, market data, renewal records, and compensation reports. The findings confirm that while the count of citations is positively associated with various dimensions of value, it remains a noisy indicator -- correlated but far from definitive.</description>

      <title>The Trouble with Rational Expectations in Heterogeneous Agent Models: A Challenge for Macroeconomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thesis of this essay is that, in heterogeneous agent macroeconomics, the assumption of rational expectations about equilibrium prices is unrealistic and should be replaced. Rational expectations imply that decision makers forecast equilibrium prices like interest rates by forecasting cross-sectional distributions. This leads to an extreme version of the curse of dimensionality: dynamic programming problems in which the entire distribution is a state variable ("Master equation" a.k.a. "Monster equation"). Frontier computational methods struggle with these infinite-dimensional Bellman equations, making it implausible that real-world agents solve the associated decision problems. These difficulties also limit the applicability of the heterogeneous-agent approach to central questions in macroeconomics -- those involving aggregate risk and non-linearities such as financial crises. This troublesome feature of the rational expectations assumption poses a challenge: what should replace it? I outline three criteria for alternative approaches: (1) computational tractability, (2) consistency with empirical evidence, and (3) (some) immunity to the Lucas critique. I then discuss several promising directions, including temporary equilibrium approaches, incorporating survey expectations, least-squares learning, and reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>The Aftermath of Peace: The Impact of the FARC's Ceasefire on Forced Displacement in Colombia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colombia's prolonged conflict has made the country one of the most affected by forced internal displacement (FID) in the world. This study examines the impact of the FARC's 2014 unilateral and permanent ceasefire on FID. We use a difference-in-differences strategy that exploits the timing of the ceasefire and the pre-conflict distribution of FARC presence across municipalities. Results show a substantial reduction in severe displacement episodes in affected areas, with effects that emerged gradually and persisted over time. These findings highlight the importance of stability and the effective implementation of peace agreements in mitigating FID and its far-reaching consequences.</description>

      <title>Renormalizable Graph Embeddings For Multi-Scale Network Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In machine learning, graph embedding algorithms seek low-dimensional representations of the input network data, thereby allowing for downstream tasks on compressed encodings. Recently, within the framework of network renormalization, multi-scale embeddings that remain consistent under an arbitrary aggregation of nodes onto block-nodes, and consequently under an arbitrary change of resolution of the input network data, have been proposed. Here we investigate such multi-scale graph embeddings in the modified context where the input network is not entirely observable, due to data limitations or privacy constraints. This situation is typical for financial and economic networks, where connections between individual banks or firms are hidden due to confidentiality, and one has to probabilistically reconstruct the underlying network from aggregate information. We first consider state-of-the-art network reconstruction techniques based on the maximum-entropy principle, which is designed to operate optimally at a fixed resolution level. We then discuss the limitations of these methods when they are used as graph embeddings to yield predictions across different resolution levels. Finally, we propose their natural 'renormalizable' counterparts derived from the distinct principle of scale invariance, yielding consistent graph embeddings for multi-scale network reconstruction. We illustrate these methods on national economic input-output networks and on international trade networks, which can be naturally represented at multiple levels of industrial and geographic resolution, respectively.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Measurement Error in the German Socio-Economic Panel Using Linked Survey and Administrative Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper exploits the linkage of German administrative social security data (German: Integrierte Erwerbsbiografien) and survey data from the socio-economic panel (Sozio-\"okonomisches Panel, SOEP) for the characterization of measurement error in metrics quantifying individual-specific labor earnings in Germany. We find that survey participants' decision whether to consent to linkage is non-random based on observables. In that sense, the studied sample does not constitute a random sample of SOEP. Further, measurement error is not classical and differential: We observe underreporting of income on average, autocorrelation, and non-zero correlation with the true signal and other observable characteristics. In levels, calculated reliability ratios above 0.94 hint at a relatively small attenuation bias in simple linear univariate regressions with earnings as the explanatory variable. For one-period changes in income the bias from measurement error is exacerbated.</description>

      <title>The Theory of Economic Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18829v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Economic complexity methods have become popular tools in economic development, economic geography, and innovation. Yet, despite their widespread adoption, we lack a mechanistic model that provides these methods with a solid mathematical foundation. Here, we analytically derive the economic complexity eigenvector associated with a mechanistic model where the output of an economy in an activity (e.g. of a country in a product) depends on the combined presence of the factors required by the activity. Using analytical and numerical derivations we show that the economic complexity index (or ECI) is a monotonic function of the probability that an economy is endowed with many factors, validating the idea that it is an agnostic estimate of the presence of multiple factors of production. We then generalize this result to other production functions and to a short-run equilibrium framework with prices, wages, and consumption, showing that the derived wage function is consistent with economies converging to an income that is compatible with their complexity. Finally, we use this model to explain differences in the networks of related activities, such as the product space and the research space, showing that the shape of these networks can be explained by different factor distributions. These findings solve long standing puzzles in the economic complexity literature and validate commonly used metrics of economic complexity as estimates of the combined presence of multiple factors.</description>

      <title>The Walras-Bowley Lecture: Fragmentation of Matching Markets and How Economics Can Help Integrate Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fragmentation of matching markets is a ubiquitous problem across countries and across applications. In order to study the implications of fragmentation and possibilities for integration, we first document and discuss a variety of fragmentation cases in practice such as school choice, medical residency matching, and so forth. Using the real-life dataset of daycare matching markets in Japan, we then empirically evaluate the impact of interregional transfer of students by estimating student utility functions under a variety of specifications and then using them for counterfactual simulation. Our simulation compares a fully integrated market and a partially integrated one with a "balancedness" constraint -- for each region, the inflow of students from the other regions must be equal to the outflow to the other areas. We find that partial integration achieves 39.2 to 59.6% of the increase in the child welfare that can be attained under full integration, which is equivalent to a 3.3 to 4.9% reduction of travel time. The percentage decrease in the unmatch rate is 40.0 to 52.8% under partial integration compared to the case of full integration. The results suggest that even in environments where full integration is not a realistic option, partial integration, i.e., integration that respects the balancedness constraint, has a potential to recover a nontrivial portion of the loss from fragmentation.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Improvement of Accessibility achieved via Shared Mobility on Demand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shared Mobility Services (SMS), e.g., demand-responsive transport or ride-sharing, can improve mobility in low-density areas, which are often poorly served by conventional Public Transport (PT). Such improvement is generally measured via basic performance indicators, such as waiting or travel time. However, such basic indicators do not account for the most important contribution that SMS can provide to territories, i.e., increasing the potential, for users, to reach surrounding opportunities, such as jobs, schools, businesses, etc. Such potential can be measured by isochrone-based accessibility indicators, which count the number of opportunities reachable in a limited time, and are thus easy for the public to understand. % The potential impact of SMS on accessibility has been qualitatively discussed and implications on equity have been empirically studied. However, to date, there are no quantitative methods to compute isochrone-based indicators of the accessibility achieved via SMS.
  This work fills this gap by proposing a first method to compute isochrone accessibility of PT systems composed of conventional PT and SMS, acting as a feeder for access and egress trips to/from PT hubs. This method is grounded on spatial-temporal statistical analysis, performed via Kriging. It takes as input observed trips of SMS and summarizes them in a graph. On such a graph, isochrone accessibility indicators are computed. We apply the proposed method to a MATSim simulation study concerning demand-responsive transport integrated into PT, in the suburban area of Paris-Saclay.</description>
