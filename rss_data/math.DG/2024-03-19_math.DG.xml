      <title>Non-existence of certain lightlike hypersurfaces of an indefinite Sasakian manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we consider a lightlike hypersurface, tangent to the structure vector field, of an indefinite Sasakian manifold. We prove that no such a hypersurface can either have parallel or recurrent second fundamental forms. In addition to the above, we also prove that no such a hypersurface may have parallel or recurrent induced structural tensors.</description>

      <title>A solution of the problem of standard compact Clifford-Klein forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve the long standing problem of classification of standard compact Clifford-Klein forms of homogeneous spaces of simple non-compact real Lie groups. The result is that standard compact Clifford-Klein forms always arise from triples $(\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{h},\mathfrak{l})$ of real Lie algebras such that $\mathfrak{h}\subset\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{l}\subset\mathfrak{g}$, $\mathfrak{g}$ is simple and absolutely simple, $\mathfrak{h},\mathfrak{l}$ are (non-compact) reductive, $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{h}+\mathfrak{l}$, and the intersection $\mathfrak{h}\cap\mathfrak{l}$ is compact. The consequence of this is the following characterization of proper co-compact actions of reductive Lie subgroups $L\subset G$ on a homogeneous spaces $G/H$ determined by absolutely simple real Lie group $G$ and a closed reductive subgroup $H$: $L$ acts on $G/H$ properly and co-compactly if and only if $G=H\cdot L$ and $H\cap L$ is compact</description>

      <title>Curves and surfaces making a constant angle with a parallel transported direction in Riemannian spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last two decades, much effort has been dedicated to studying curves and surfaces according to their angle with a given direction. However, most findings were obtained using a case-by-case approach, and it is often unclear what are consequences of the specificities of the ambient manifold and what could be generic. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework to unify parts of these findings. We study curves and surfaces by prescribing the angle they make with a parallel transported vector field. We show that the characterization of Euclidean helices in terms of their curvature and torsion is also valid in any Riemannian manifold. Among other properties, we prove that surfaces making a constant angle with a parallel transported direction are extrinsically flat ruled surfaces. We also investigate the relation between their geodesics and the so-called slant helices; we prove that surfaces of constant angle are the rectifying surface of a slant helix, i.e., the ruled surface with rulings given by the Darboux vector field of the directrix. We characterize rectifying surfaces of constant angle; in other words, when their geodesics are slant helices. As a corollary, we show that if every geodesic of a surface of constant angle is a slant helix, then the ambient manifold is flat. Finally, we characterize surfaces in the product of a Riemannian surface with the real line making a constant angle with the vertical real direction.</description>

      <title>Codimension two mean curvature flow of entire graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the graphical mean curvature flow of maps ${\bf f}:\mathbb{R}^m\to\mathbb{R}^n$, $m\ge 2$, and derive estimates on the growth rates of the evolved graphs, based on a new version of the maximum principle for properly immersed submanifolds that extends the well-known maximum principle of Ecker and Huisken derived in their seminal paper [10]. In the case of uniformly area decreasing maps ${\bf f}:\mathbb{R}^m\to\mathbb{R}^2$, $m\ge 2$, we use this maximum principle to show that the graphicality and the area decreasing property are preserved. Moreover, if the initial graph is asymptotically conical at infinity, we prove that the normalized mean curvature flow smoothly converges to a self-expander.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the elliptic genus in [10] by the gauge group E_8 and the gauge group E_8*E_8. Then we prove that the generalized elliptic genus are the weak Jacobi forms. Using these elliptic genus, we obtain some SL_2(Z) modular forms and get some new anomaly cancellation formulas of characteristic forms for almost complex manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study \lambda-biharmonic hypersurfaces in the product space L^{m}\times\mathbb{R}, where L^{m} is an Einstein space and \mathbb{R} is a real line. We prove that \lambda-biharmonic hypersurfaces with constant mean curvature in L^{m}\times\mathbb{R} are either minimal or vertical cylinders, and obtain some classification results for \lambda$-biharmonic hypersurfaces under various constraints. Furthermore, we investigate \lambda-biharmonic hypersurfaces in the product space L^{m}(c)\times\mathbb{R}, where L^{m}(c) is a space form with constant sectional curvature c, and categorize hypersurfaces that are either totally umbilical or semi-parallel.</description>

      <title>Kodaira vanishing theorems for Kahler Lie algebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Lie algebroid is a generalization of Lie algebra that provides a general framework to describe the symmetries of a manifold. In this paper, we generalize the Kodaira vanishing theorem, which is a basic result in complex geometry, to Kahler Lie algebroids. The generalization of the Kodaira vanishing theorem states that the kernel of the Lie algebroid Laplace operator on Lie algebroid positive line bundle-valued (p,q)-forms vanishes when p+q is sufficiently large. The most difficult part of the proof of the generalized Kodaira vanishing theorem is the generalization of the Kahler identities to Lie algebroids. In this paper, we provide an approach by using local coordinate calculation.</description>

Abstract: Spectral (Bloch) varieties of multidimensional differential operators on non-simply connected manifolds are defined. In their terms it is given a description of the analytical dependence of the spectra of magnetic Laplacians on non-simply connected manifolds on the values of the Aharonov-Bohm fluxes and a construction of analogues of spectral curves for two-dimensional Dirac operators on Riemann surfaces and, thereby, new conformal invariants of immersions of surfaces into 3- and 4-dimensional Euclidean spaces.</description>

      <title>4-Dimensional Isoparametric Hypersurfaces of Index 2 in the Pseudo-Riemannian Space Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study isoparametric hypersurfaces, whose principal curvatures are all constant, in the pseudo-Riemannian space forms. In this paper, we investigate three topics.Firstly, according to Petrov's classification theorem, we give a classification of hypersurfaces of index 2 with respect to a pair of a shape operator and a metric. Therefore, we can define types of isoparametric hypersurfaces of index 2 concerning the classification. Secondly, we give several examples of certain types. Thirdly, we show that there exist no isoparametric hypersurfaces of index 2 whose shape operators have complex principal curvatures in certain cases.</description>

      <title>Collapsing regular Riemannian foliations with flat leaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present how to collapse a manifold equipped with a closed flat regular Riemannian foliation with leaves of positive dimension on a compact manifold, while keeping the sectional curvature uniformly bounded from above and below. From this deformation, we show that a closed flat regular Riemannian foliation with leaves of positive dimension on a compact simply-connected manifold is given by torus actions. This gives a geometric characterization of aspherical regular Riemannian foliations given by torus actions.</description>

      <title>Relative aspherical conjecture and higher codimensional obstruction to positive scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the solution of the aspherical conjecture up to dimension 5 [CL20][Gro20], we want to study a relative version of the aspherical conjecture. We present a natural condition generalizing the model $X\times\mathbb{T}^k$ to the relative aspherical setting. Such model is closely related to submanifold obstruction of positive scalar curvature (PSC), and would be in similar spirit as [HPS15][CRZ23] in codim 2 case. In codim 3 and 4, we prove results on how 3-manifold obstructs the existence of PSC under our relative aspherical condition. This could be regarded as a relative version extension of the aspherical conjecture up to dim 5.</description>

Abstract: We consider the pseudo-nearly K\"ahler $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})\times\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ and we study its Lagrangian submanifolds. We provide examples of Lagrangian submanifolds which do not have an analogue in $\mathbb{S}^3\times\mathbb{S}^3$. We also provide an expression for the isometry group of $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})\times\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ with the pseudo-Riemannian nearly K\"ahler metric. The main result is a complete classification of extrinsically homogeneous Lagrangian submanifolds in this space.</description>

Abstract: Utilizing recent mathematical advances in proving stability of Minkowski spacetime with minimal decay rates and nonlinear stability of Kerr black holes with small angular momentum, we investigate the detailed asymptotic behaviors of gravitational waves generated in these spacetimes. Here we report and propose a new angular momentum memory effect along future null infinity. This accompanies Christodoulou's nonlinear displacement memory effect and the spin memory effect. The connections and differences to these effects are also addressed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Restoration, generalization, and dimensionality reduction of a vector field from samples are the most common and crucial tasks in dynamical system analysis. An optimization-based algorithm to fulfill these tasks is suggested. Given noisy, sparse, or redundant sampled vector fields, the optimization process encapsulates the inherent geometry of the dynamical system derived from the Koopman eigenfunction space. The dynamic geometry is revealed via the exact penalty method, compromising accuracy and smoothness. This algorithm is backed up by promising results of denoising and generalization with a concise dynamics representation leading to dimensionality reduction.</description>

      <title>An efficient algorithm for the Riemannian logarithm on the Stiefel manifold for a family of Riemannian metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the popularization of the Stiefel manifold for numerical applications in 1998 in a seminal paper from Edelman et al., it has been exhibited to be a key to solve many problems from optimization, statistics and machine learning. In 2021, H\"uper et al. proposed a one-parameter family of Riemannian metrics on the Stiefel manifold, subsuming the well-known Euclidean and canonical metrics. Since then, several methods have been proposed to obtain a candidate for the Riemannian logarithm given any metric from the family. Most of these methods are based on the shooting method or rely on optimization approaches. For the canonical metric, Zimmermann proposed in 2017 a particularly efficient method based on a pure matrix-algebraic approach. In this paper, we derive a generalization of this algorithm that works for the one-parameter family of Riemannian metrics. The algorithm is proposed in two versions, termed backward and forward, for which we prove that it conserves the local linear convergence previously exhibited in Zimmermann's algorithm for the canonical metric.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we carry out the equivalence problem for fifth-order differential operators on the line under general fiber-preserving transformation using the Cartan method of equivalence. Two versions of equivalence problems have been solved. We consider the direct equivalence problem and an equivalence problem to determine the sufficient and necessary conditions on fifth-order differential operators such that there exists a fiber--preserving transformation mapping one to the other according to gauge equivalence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.07188v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An LCK (locally conformally Kahler) manifold is a complex manifold admitting a Kahler covering with monodromy acting by homotheties. Hopf manifolds and their submanifolds are the prime examples. This book presents an introduction to the principles of LCK geometry (the first two parts) and its current situation (the last part). It is supposed to be accessible to master and graduate students of complex geometry. The book contains many exercises of different levels of difficulty. We finish it by a list of open questions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.09638v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We realize specific classical symmetric spaces, like the semi-K\"ahler symmetric spaces discovered by Berger, as cotangent bundles of symmetric flag manifolds. These realizations enable us to describe these cotangent bundles' geodesics and Lagrangian submanifolds.
  As a final application, we present the first examples of vector bundles over simply connected manifolds with nonnegative curvature that cannot accommodate metrics with nonnegative sectional curvature, even though their associated unit sphere bundles can indeed accommodate such metrics. Our examples are derived from explicit bundle constructions over symmetric flag spaces.</description>

      <title>On Some Local Geometry of Bi-Contact Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the local geometry of a pair of independent contact structures on 3-manifolds under maps that independently preserve each contact structure. We discover that such maps are homotheties on the contact 1-forms and we discover differential invariants associated to such structures under these equivalences. This allows us to generalize the notion of contact circles and (equilateral) hyperbolas to contact ellipses and hyperbolas. Moreover, these invariants may sometimes be used to define a complete local normal form and in at least one case are related to symplectic structures through a natural prolongation in the Cartan equivalence method. Finally, there is a type of natural Riemannian metric (but not necessarily the well-known associated contact metric) and we discover certain curvatures may be written in terms of the bi-contact differential invariants.</description>

      <title>The nonholonomic bracket on contact mechanical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study contact nonholonomic mechanical sys\-tems. We construct a general framework for non-holonomic constraints in contact geometry and, in this framework, we define different nonholonomic brackets using con\-venient \linebreak decompositions of the tangent bundle of the phase space. \linebreak Furthermore, we prove that all of them coincide. In particular, one the brackets is a natural extension of that defined by R.J. Eden, but now it is an almost Jacobi bracket since it is not satisfy the Leibniz rule.</description>

      <title>Betti numbers and compatible almost complex structures on the Hard Lefschetz condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A special class of symplectic manifolds is those satisfying the Hard Lefschetz condition. The algebraic property of $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb C)$-module gives a natural constraint on the Betti numbers. However, such a constraint is only necessary, and it is not so clear what condition on the Betti numbers is equivalent to the Hard Lefschetz condition. In this paper, we give some relations between the Betti numbers and the variant Hodge numbers on the Hard Lefschetz condition. In general, we give a sufficient condition on Betti numbers and variant Hodge numbers for any almost K\"ahler manifold satisfying the Hard Lefschetz condition. In particular, we offer an equivalent condition on the first Betti number for compact symplectic $4$-manifolds satisfying the Hard Lefschetz condition.</description>

      <title>On the Hamilton-Lott conjecture in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study $n$-dimensional Ricci flows with non-negative Ricci curvature where the curvature is pointwise controlled by the scalar curvature and bounded by $C/t$, starting at metric cones which are Reifenberg outside the tip. We show that any such flow behaves like a self-similar solution up to an exponential error in time. As an application, we show that smooth $n$-dimensional complete non-compact Riemannian manifolds which are uniformly PIC1-pinched, with positive asymptotic volume ratio, are Euclidean. This confirms a higher dimensional version of a conjecture of Hamilton and Lott under the assumption of non-collapsing. It also yields a new and more direct proof of the original conjecture of Hamilton and Lott in three dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct all axi-symmetric non-gradient $m$-quasi-Einstein structures on a two-sphere. This includes the spatial cross-section of the extreme Kerr black hole horizon corresponding to $m=2$, as well as a family of new regular metrics with $m\neq 2$ given in terms of hypergeometric functions. We also show that in the case $m=-1$ with vanishing cosmological constant the only orientable compact solution in dimension two is the flat torus, which proves that there are no compact surfaces with a metrisable affine connection with skew Ricci tensor.</description>

      <title>Isoperimetric Inequalities on Slabs with applications to Cubes and Gaussian Slabs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study isoperimetric inequalities on "slabs", namely weighted Riemannian manifolds obtained as the product of the uniform measure on a finite length interval with a codimension-one base. As our two main applications, we consider the case when the base is the flat torus $\mathbb{R}^2 / 2 \mathbb{Z}^2$ and the standard Gaussian measure in $\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$.
  The isoperimetric conjecture on the three-dimensional cube predicts that minimizers are enclosed by spheres about a corner, cylinders about an edge and coordinate planes. This has only been established for relative volumes close to $0$, $1/2$ and $1$ by compactness arguments. Our analysis confirms the isoperimetric conjecture on the three-dimensional cube with side lengths $(\beta,1,1)$ in a new range of relatives volumes $\bar v \in [0,1/2]$. In particular, we confirm the conjecture for the standard cube ($\beta=1$) for all $\bar v \leq 0.120582$, when $\beta \leq 0.919431$ for the entire range where spheres are conjectured to be minimizing, and also for all $\bar v \in [0,1/2] \setminus (\frac{1}{\pi} - \frac{\beta}{4},\frac{1}{\pi} + \frac{\beta}{4})$. When $\beta \leq 0.919431$ we reduce the validity of the full conjecture to establishing that the half-plane $\{ x \in [0,\beta] \times [0,1]^2 \; ; \; x_3 \leq \frac{1}{\pi} \}$ is an isoperimetric minimizer. We also show that the analogous conjecture on a high-dimensional cube $[0,1]^n$ is false for $n \geq 10$.
  In the case of a slab with a Gaussian base of width $T&gt;0$, we identify a phase transition when $T = \sqrt{2 \pi}$ and when $T = \pi$. In particular, while products of half-planes with $[0,T]$ are always minimizing when $T \leq \sqrt{2 \pi}$, when $T &gt; \pi$ they are never minimizing, being beaten by Gaussian unduloids. In the range $T \in (\sqrt{2 \pi},\pi]$, a potential trichotomy occurs.</description>

      <title>Convex co-compact representations of 3-manifold groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2009.05191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A representation of a finitely generated group into the projective general linear group is called convex co-compact if it has finite kernel and its image acts convex co-compactly on a properly convex domain in real projective space. We prove that the fundamental group of a closed irreducible orientable 3-manifold can admit such a representation only when the manifold is geometric (with Euclidean, Hyperbolic, or Euclidean $\times$ Hyperbolic geometry) or when every component in the geometric decomposition is hyperbolic. In each case, we describe the structure of such examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The elastic energy of a bending-resistant interface depends both on its geometry and its material composition. We consider such a heterogeneous interface in the plane, modeled by a curve equipped with an additional density function. The resulting energy captures the complex interplay between curvature and density effects, resembling the Canham-Helfrich functional. We describe the curve by its inclination angle, so that the equilibrium equations reduce to an elliptic system of second order. After a brief variational discussion, we investigate the associated nonlocal $L^2$-gradient flow evolution, a coupled quasilinear parabolic problem. We analyze the (non)preservation of quantities such as convexity, positivity, and symmetry, as well as the asymptotic behavior of the system. The results are illustrated by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Smooth Cartan triples and Lie twists over Hausdorff \'etale Lie groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09177v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe how to recover a Lie structure on a twist over a Hausdorff \'etale groupoid from functional-analytic data in the spirit of Connes' reconstruction theorem for manifolds. We first characterise when a smooth structure on the unit space of a Hausdorff \'etale groupoid can be extended to a Lie-groupoid structure on the whole groupoid. We introduce Lie twists over Hausdorff Lie groupoids, building on Kumjian's notion of a twist over a topological groupoid. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions on a family of sections of a twist over a Lie groupoid under which the twist can be made into a Lie twist so that all the specified sections are smooth. We use these results in the setting of twists over \'etale groupoids to describe conditions on a Cartan pair of C*-algebras and a family of normalisers of the subalgebra, under which Renault's Weyl twist for the pair can be made into a Lie twist for which the given normalisers correspond to smooth sections.</description>

      <title>Horizons that Gyre and Gimble: A Differential Characterization of Null Hypersurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the thermodynamics of black hole solutions conformal to stationary solutions, we study the geometric invariant theory of null hypersurfaces. It is well-known that a null hypersurface in a Lorentzian manifold can be treated as a Carrollian geometry. Additional structure can be added to this geometry by choosing a connection which yields a Carrollian manifold. In the literature various authors have introduced Koszul connections to study the study the physics on these hypersurfaces. In this paper we examine the various Carrollian geometries and their relationship to null hypersurface embeddings. We specify the geometric data required to construct a rigid Carrollian geometry, and we argue that a connection with torsion is the most natural object to study Carrollian manifolds. We then use this connection to develop a hypersurface calculus suitable for a study of intrinsic and extrinsic differential invariants on embedded null hypersurfaces; motivating examples are given, including geometric invariants preserved under conformal transformations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an initial data set having a continuous symmetry and a marginally outer trapped surface (MOTS) that is not preserved by this symmetry. We show that such a MOTS is unstable except in an exceptional case. In non-rotating cases we provide a Courant-type lower bound on the number of unstable eigenvalues. These results are then used to prove the instability of a large class of exotic MOTSs that were recently observed in the Schwarzschild spacetime. We also discuss the implications for the apparent horizon in data sets with translational symmetry.</description>
