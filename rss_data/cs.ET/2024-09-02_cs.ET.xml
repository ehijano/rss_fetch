      <title>A Prototype Model of Zero-Trust Architecture Blockchain with EigenTrust-Based Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance Protocol to Manage Decentralized Clinical Trials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated the emergence of decentralized Clinical Trials (DCTs) due to patient retention, accelerate trials, improve data accessibility, enable virtual care, and facilitate seamless communication through integrated systems. However, integrating systems in DCTs exposes clinical data to potential security threats, making them susceptible to theft at any stage, a high risk of protocol deviations, and monitoring issues. To mitigate these challenges, blockchain technology serves as a secure framework, acting as a decentralized ledger, creating an immutable environment by establishing a zero-trust architecture, where data are deemed untrusted until verified. In combination with Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled wearable devices, blockchain secures the transfer of clinical trial data on private blockchains during DCT automation and operations. This paper proposes a prototype model of the Zero-Trust Architecture Blockchain (z-TAB) to integrate patient-generated clinical trial data during DCT operation management. The EigenTrust-based Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (T-PBFT) algorithm has been incorporated as a consensus protocol, leveraging Hyperledger Fabric. Furthermore, the Internet of Things (IoT) has been integrated to streamline data processing among stakeholders within the blockchain platforms. Rigorous evaluation has been done to evaluate the quality of the system.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Autism Spectrum Disorder Early Detection with the Parent-Child Dyads Block-Play Protocol and an Attention-enhanced GCN-xLSTM Hybrid Deep Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16924</link>

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a rapidly growing neurodevelopmental disorder. Performing a timely intervention is crucial for the growth of young children with ASD, but traditional clinical screening methods lack objectivity. This study introduces an innovative approach to early detection of ASD. The contributions are threefold. First, this work proposes a novel Parent-Child Dyads Block-Play (PCB) protocol, grounded in kinesiological and neuroscientific research, to identify behavioral patterns distinguishing ASD from typically developing (TD) toddlers. Second, we have compiled a substantial video dataset, featuring 40 ASD and 89 TD toddlers engaged in block play with parents. This dataset exceeds previous efforts on both the scale of participants and the length of individual sessions. Third, our approach to action analysis in videos employs a hybrid deep learning framework, integrating a two-stream graph convolution network with attention-enhanced xLSTM (2sGCN-AxLSTM). This framework is adept at capturing dynamic interactions between toddlers and parents by extracting spatial features correlated with upper body and head movements and focusing on global contextual information of action sequences over time. By learning these global features with spatio-temporal correlations, our 2sGCN-AxLSTM effectively analyzes dynamic human behavior patterns and demonstrates an unprecedented accuracy of 89.6\% in early detection of ASD. Our approach shows strong potential for enhancing early ASD diagnosis by accurately analyzing parent-child interactions, providing a critical tool to support timely and informed clinical decision-making.</description>

      <title>AI-driven Reverse Engineering of QML Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is a rapidly emerging area of research, driven by the capabilities of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. With the progress in the research of QML models, there is a rise in third-party quantum cloud services to cater to the increasing demand for resources. New security concerns surface, specifically regarding the protection of intellectual property (IP) from untrustworthy service providers. One of the most pressing risks is the potential for reverse engineering (RE) by malicious actors who may steal proprietary quantum IPs such as trained parameters and QML architecture, modify them to remove additional watermarks or signatures and re-transpile them for other quantum hardware. Prior work presents a brute force approach to RE the QML parameters which takes exponential time overhead. In this paper, we introduce an autoencoder-based approach to extract the parameters from transpiled QML models deployed on untrusted third-party vendors. We experiment on multi-qubit classifiers and note that they can be reverse-engineered under restricted conditions with a mean error of order 10^-1. The amount of time taken to prepare the dataset and train the model to reverse engineer the QML circuit being of the order 10^3 seconds (which is 10^2x better than the previously reported value for 4-layered 4-qubit classifiers) makes the threat of RE highly potent, underscoring the need for continued development of effective defenses.</description>

      <title>Colaboot: A Cloud-based Diskless PC Booting Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent increases in endpoint-based security events and threats compelled enterprise operations to switch to virtual desktop infrastructure and web-based applications. In addition to reducing potential hazards, this has guaranteed a consistent desktop environment for every user. On the other hand, the attack surface is greatly increased because all endpoints are connected to the company network, which could harbor malware and other advanced persistent threats. This results in a considerable loss of system resources on each individual endpoint. Hence our work proposes a standard called Colaboot that enables machines throughout a company to boot from a single operating system in order to address these problems and guarantee a consistent operating system environment that could be easily updated to the most recent security patches across all work stations.</description>

      <title>Secure Ownership Management and Transfer of Consumer Internet of Things Devices with Self-sovereign Identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The popularity of the Internet of Things (IoT) has driven its usage in our homes and industries over the past 10-12 years. However, there have been some major issues related to identity management and ownership transfer involving IoT devices, particularly for consumer IoT devices, e. g. smart appliances such as smart TVs, smart refrigerators, and so on. There have been a few attempts to address this issue; however, user-centric and effective ownership and identity management of IoT devices have not been very successful so far. Recently, blockchain technology has been used to address these issues with limited success. This article presents a Self-sovereign Identity (SSI) based system that facilitates a secure and user-centric ownership management and transfer of consumer IoT devices. The system leverages a number of emerging technologies, such as blockchain and decentralized identifiers (DID), verifiable credentials (VC), under the umbrella of SSI. We present the architecture of the system based on a threat model and requirement analysis, discuss the implementation of a Proof-of-Concept based on the proposed system and illustrate a number of use-cases with their detailed protocol flows. Furthermore, we analyse its security using ProVerif, a state-of-the art protocol verification tool and examine its performance.</description>
