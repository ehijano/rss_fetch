      <title>Event GDR: Event-Centric Generative Document Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative document retrieval, an emerging paradigm in information retrieval, learns to build connections between documents and identifiers within a single model, garnering significant attention. However, there are still two challenges: (1) neglecting inner-content correlation during document representation; (2) lacking explicit semantic structure during identifier construction. Nonetheless, events have enriched relations and well-defined taxonomy, which could facilitate addressing the above two challenges. Inspired by this, we propose Event GDR, an event-centric generative document retrieval model, integrating event knowledge into this task. Specifically, we utilize an exchange-then-reflection method based on multi-agents for event knowledge extraction. For document representation, we employ events and relations to model the document to guarantee the comprehensiveness and inner-content correlation. For identifier construction, we map the events to well-defined event taxonomy to construct the identifiers with explicit semantic structure. Our method achieves significant improvement over the baselines on two datasets, and also hopes to provide insights for future research.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Pretraining and Generation for Recommendation: A Tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized recommendation stands as a ubiquitous channel for users to explore information or items aligned with their interests. Nevertheless, prevailing recommendation models predominantly rely on unique IDs and categorical features for user-item matching. While this ID-centric approach has witnessed considerable success, it falls short in comprehensively grasping the essence of raw item contents across diverse modalities, such as text, image, audio, and video. This underutilization of multimodal data poses a limitation to recommender systems, particularly in the realm of multimedia services like news, music, and short-video platforms. The recent surge in pretraining and generation techniques presents both opportunities and challenges in the development of multimodal recommender systems. This tutorial seeks to provide a thorough exploration of the latest advancements and future trajectories in multimodal pretraining and generation techniques within the realm of recommender systems. The tutorial comprises three parts: multimodal pretraining, multimodal generation, and industrial applications and open challenges in the field of recommendation. Our target audience encompasses scholars, practitioners, and other parties interested in this domain. By providing a succinct overview of the field, we aspire to facilitate a swift understanding of multimodal recommendation and foster meaningful discussions on the future development of this evolving landscape.</description>

      <title>Identifying Key Terms in Prompts for Relevance Evaluation with GPT Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relevance evaluation of a query and a passage is essential in Information Retrieval (IR). Recently, numerous studies have been conducted on tasks related to relevance judgment using Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, demonstrating significant improvements. However, the efficacy of LLMs is considerably influenced by the design of the prompt. The purpose of this paper is to identify which specific terms in prompts positively or negatively impact relevance evaluation with LLMs. We employed two types of prompts: those used in previous research and generated automatically by LLMs. By comparing the performance of these prompts in both few-shot and zero-shot settings, we analyze the influence of specific terms in the prompts. We have observed two main findings from our study. First, we discovered that prompts using the term answerlead to more effective relevance evaluations than those using relevant. This indicates that a more direct approach, focusing on answering the query, tends to enhance performance. Second, we noted the importance of appropriately balancing the scope of relevance. While the term relevant can extend the scope too broadly, resulting in less precise evaluations, an optimal balance in defining relevance is crucial for accurate assessments. The inclusion of few-shot examples helps in more precisely defining this balance. By providing clearer contexts for the term relevance, few-shot examples contribute to refine relevance criteria. In conclusion, our study highlights the significance of carefully selecting terms in prompts for relevance evaluation with LLMs.</description>

      <title>Learnable Tokenizer for LLM-based Generative Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harnessing Large Language Models (LLMs) for generative recommendation has garnered significant attention due to LLMs' powerful capacities such as rich world knowledge and reasoning. However, a critical challenge lies in transforming recommendation data into the language space of LLMs through effective item tokenization. Existing approaches, such as ID identifiers, textual identifiers, and codebook-based identifiers, exhibit limitations in encoding semantic information, incorporating collaborative signals, or handling code assignment bias. To address these shortcomings, we propose LETTER (a LEarnable Tokenizer for generaTivE Recommendation), designed to meet the key criteria of identifiers by integrating hierarchical semantics, collaborative signals, and code assignment diversity. LETTER integrates Residual Quantized VAE for semantic regularization, a contrastive alignment loss for collaborative regularization, and a diversity loss to mitigate code assignment bias. We instantiate LETTER within two generative recommender models and introduce a ranking-guided generation loss to enhance their ranking ability. Extensive experiments across three datasets demonstrate the superiority of LETTER in item tokenization, thereby advancing the state-of-the-art in the field of generative recommendation.</description>

      <title>PromptLink: Leveraging Large Language Models for Cross-Source Biomedical Concept Linking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linking (aligning) biomedical concepts across diverse data sources enables various integrative analyses, but it is challenging due to the discrepancies in concept naming conventions. Various strategies have been developed to overcome this challenge, such as those based on string-matching rules, manually crafted thesauri, and machine learning models. However, these methods are constrained by limited prior biomedical knowledge and can hardly generalize beyond the limited amounts of rules, thesauri, or training samples. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive results in diverse biomedical NLP tasks due to their unprecedentedly rich prior knowledge and strong zero-shot prediction abilities. However, LLMs suffer from issues including high costs, limited context length, and unreliable predictions. In this research, we propose PromptLink, a novel biomedical concept linking framework that leverages LLMs. It first employs a biomedical-specialized pre-trained language model to generate candidate concepts that can fit in the LLM context windows. Then it utilizes an LLM to link concepts through two-stage prompts, where the first-stage prompt aims to elicit the biomedical prior knowledge from the LLM for the concept linking task and the second-stage prompt enforces the LLM to reflect on its own predictions to further enhance their reliability. Empirical results on the concept linking task between two EHR datasets and an external biomedical KG demonstrate the effectiveness of PromptLink. Furthermore, PromptLink is a generic framework without reliance on additional prior knowledge, context, or training data, making it well-suited for concept linking across various types of data sources.

      <title>DynLLM: When Large Language Models Meet Dynamic Graph Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Last year has witnessed the considerable interest of Large Language Models (LLMs) for their potential applications in recommender systems, which may mitigate the persistent issue of data sparsity. Though large efforts have been made for user-item graph augmentation with better graph-based recommendation performance, they may fail to deal with the dynamic graph recommendation task, which involves both structural and temporal graph dynamics with inherent complexity in processing time-evolving data. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a novel framework, called DynLLM, to deal with the dynamic graph recommendation task with LLMs. Specifically, DynLLM harnesses the power of LLMs to generate multi-faceted user profiles based on the rich textual features of historical purchase records, including crowd segments, personal interests, preferred categories, and favored brands, which in turn supplement and enrich the underlying relationships between users and items. Along this line, to fuse the multi-faceted profiles with temporal graph embedding, we engage LLMs to derive corresponding profile embeddings, and further employ a distilled attention mechanism to refine the LLM-generated profile embeddings for alleviating noisy signals, while also assessing and adjusting the relevance of each distilled facet embedding for seamless integration with temporal graph embedding from continuous time dynamic graphs (CTDGs). Extensive experiments on two real e-commerce datasets have validated the superior improvements of DynLLM over a wide range of state-of-the-art baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Test Collections for Retrieval Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test collections play a vital role in evaluation of information retrieval (IR) systems. Obtaining a diverse set of user queries for test collection construction can be challenging, and acquiring relevance judgments, which indicate the appropriateness of retrieved documents to a query, is often costly and resource-intensive. Generating synthetic datasets using Large Language Models (LLMs) has recently gained significant attention in various applications. In IR, while previous work exploited the capabilities of LLMs to generate synthetic queries or documents to augment training data and improve the performance of ranking models, using LLMs for constructing synthetic test collections is relatively unexplored. Previous studies demonstrate that LLMs have the potential to generate synthetic relevance judgments for use in the evaluation of IR systems. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate whether it is possible to use LLMs to construct fully synthetic test collections by generating not only synthetic judgments but also synthetic queries. In particular, we analyse whether it is possible to construct reliable synthetic test collections and the potential risks of bias such test collections may exhibit towards LLM-based models. Our experiments indicate that using LLMs it is possible to construct synthetic test collections that can reliably be used for retrieval evaluation.</description>

      <title>Is Interpretable Machine Learning Effective at Feature Selection for Neural Learning-to-Rank?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural ranking models have become increasingly popular for real-world search and recommendation systems in recent years. Unlike their tree-based counterparts, neural models are much less interpretable. That is, it is very difficult to understand their inner workings and answer questions like how do they make their ranking decisions? or what document features do they find important? This is particularly disadvantageous since interpretability is highly important for real-world systems. In this work, we explore feature selection for neural learning-to-rank (LTR). In particular, we investigate six widely-used methods from the field of interpretable machine learning (ML) and introduce our own modification, to select the input features that are most important to the ranking behavior. To understand whether these methods are useful for practitioners, we further study whether they contribute to efficiency enhancement. Our experimental results reveal a large feature redundancy in several LTR benchmarks: the local selection method TabNet can achieve optimal ranking performance with less than 10 features; the global methods, particularly our G-L2X, require slightly more selected features, but exhibit higher potential in improving efficiency. We hope that our analysis of these feature selection methods will bring the fields of interpretable ML and LTR closer together.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Investigation of Distilling Large Language Models into Cross-Encoders for Passage Re-ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-encoders distilled from large language models are more effective re-rankers than cross-encoders fine-tuned using manually labeled data. However, the distilled models do not reach the language model's effectiveness. We construct and release a new distillation dataset, named Rank-DistiLLM, to investigate whether insights from fine-tuning cross-encoders on manually labeled data -- hard-negative sampling, deep sampling, and listwise loss functions -- are transferable to large language model ranker distillation. Our dataset can be used to train cross-encoders that reach the effectiveness of large language models while being orders of magnitude more efficient.

      <title>Enhancing Language Models for Financial Relation Extraction with Named Entities and Part-of-Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Financial Relation Extraction (FinRE) task involves identifying the entities and their relation, given a piece of financial statement/text. To solve this FinRE problem, we propose a simple but effective strategy that improves the performance of pre-trained language models by augmenting them with Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Part-Of-Speech (POS), as well as different approaches to combine these information. Experiments on a financial relations dataset show promising results and highlights the benefits of incorporating NER and POS in existing models.

      <description>arXiv:2405.06669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While automatic summarization techniques have made significant advancements, their primary focus has been on summarizing short news articles or documents that have clear structural patterns like scientific articles or government reports. There has not been much exploration into developing efficient methods for summarizing financial documents, which often contain complex facts and figures. Here, we study the problem of bullet point summarization of long Earning Call Transcripts (ECTs) using the recently released ECTSum dataset. We leverage an unsupervised question-based extractive module followed by a parameter efficient instruction-tuned abstractive module to solve this task. Our proposed model FLAN-FinBPS achieves new state-of-the-art performances outperforming the strongest baseline with 14.88% average ROUGE score gain, and is capable of generating factually consistent bullet point summaries that capture the important facts discussed in the ECTs.</description>

      <title>SoccerNet-Echoes: A Soccer Game Audio Commentary Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The application of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology in soccer offers numerous opportunities for sports analytics. Specifically, extracting audio commentaries with ASR provides valuable insights into the events of the game, and opens the door to several downstream applications such as automatic highlight generation. This paper presents SoccerNet-Echoes, an augmentation of the SoccerNet dataset with automatically generated transcriptions of audio commentaries from soccer game broadcasts, enhancing video content with rich layers of textual information derived from the game audio using ASR. These textual commentaries, generated using the Whisper model and translated with Google Translate, extend the usefulness of the SoccerNet dataset in diverse applications such as enhanced action spotting, automatic caption generation, and game summarization. By incorporating textual data alongside visual and auditory content, SoccerNet-Echoes aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for the development of algorithms specialized in capturing the dynamics of soccer games. We detail the methods involved in the curation of this dataset and the integration of ASR. We also highlight the implications of a multimodal approach in sports analytics, and how the enriched dataset can support diverse applications, thus broadening the scope of research and development in the field of sports analytics.</description>

      <title>Decoding Geometric Properties in Non-Random Data from First Information-Theoretic Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the principles of information theory, measure theory, and theoretical computer science, we introduce a univariate signal deconvolution method with a wide range of applications to coding theory, particularly in zero-knowledge one-way communication channels, such as in deciphering messages from unknown generating sources about which no prior knowledge is available and to which no return message can be sent. Our multidimensional space reconstruction method from an arbitrary received signal is proven to be agnostic vis-a-vis the encoding-decoding scheme, computation model, programming language, formal theory, the computable (or semi-computable) method of approximation to algorithmic complexity, and any arbitrarily chosen (computable) probability measure of the events. The method derives from the principles of an approach to Artificial General Intelligence capable of building a general-purpose model of models independent of any arbitrarily assumed prior probability distribution. We argue that this optimal and universal method of decoding non-random data has applications to signal processing, causal deconvolution, topological and geometric properties encoding, cryptography, and bio- and technosignature detection.</description>

Abstract: Edge computing provides resources for IoT workloads at the network edge. Monitoring systems are vital for efficiently managing resources and application workloads by collecting, storing, and providing relevant information about the state of the resources. However, traditional monitoring systems have a centralized architecture for both data plane and control plane, which increases latency, creates a failure bottleneck, and faces challenges in providing quick and trustworthy data in volatile edge environments, especially where infrastructures are often built upon failure-prone, unsophisticated computing and network resources. Thus, we propose DEMon, a decentralized, self-adaptive monitoring system for edge. DEMon leverages the stochastic gossip communication protocol at its core. It develops efficient protocols for information dissemination, communication, and retrieval, avoiding a single point of failure and ensuring fast and trustworthy data access. Its decentralized control enables self-adaptive management of monitoring parameters, addressing the trade-offs between the quality of service of monitoring and resource consumption. We implement the proposed system as a lightweight and portable container-based system and evaluate it through experiments. We also present a use case demonstrating its feasibility. The results show that DEMon efficiently disseminates and retrieves the monitoring information, addressing the challenges of edge monitoring.</description>

      <title>Almanac Copilot: Towards Autonomous Electronic Health Record Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clinicians spend large amounts of time on clinical documentation, and inefficiencies impact quality of care and increase clinician burnout. Despite the promise of electronic medical records (EMR), the transition from paper-based records has been negatively associated with clinician wellness, in part due to poor user experience, increased burden of documentation, and alert fatigue. In this study, we present Almanac Copilot, an autonomous agent capable of assisting clinicians with EMR-specific tasks such as information retrieval and order placement. On EHR-QA, a synthetic evaluation dataset of 300 common EHR queries based on real patient data, Almanac Copilot obtains a successful task completion rate of 74% (n = 221 tasks) with a mean score of 2.45 over 3 (95% CI:2.34-2.56). By automating routine tasks and streamlining the documentation process, our findings highlight the significant potential of autonomous agents to mitigate the cognitive load imposed on clinicians by current EMR systems.</description>

      <title>Temporal Interest Network for User Response Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08487v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: User response prediction is essential in industrial recommendation systems, such as online display advertising. Among all the features in recommendation models, user behaviors are among the most critical. Many works have revealed that a user's behavior reflects her interest in the candidate item, owing to the semantic or temporal correlation between behaviors and the candidate. While the literature has individually examined each of these correlations, researchers have yet to analyze them in combination, that is, the semantic-temporal correlation. We empirically measure this correlation and observe intuitive yet robust patterns. We then examine several popular user interest models and find that, surprisingly, none of them learn such correlation well.
  To fill this gap, we propose a Temporal Interest Network (TIN) to capture the semantic-temporal correlation simultaneously between behaviors and the target. We achieve this by incorporating target-aware temporal encoding, in addition to semantic encoding, to represent behaviors and the target. Furthermore, we conduct explicit 4-way interaction by deploying target-aware attention and target-aware representation to capture both semantic and temporal correlation. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on two popular public datasets, and our proposed TIN outperforms the best-performing baselines by 0.43% and 0.29% on GAUC, respectively. During online A/B testing in Tencent's advertising platform, TIN achieves 1.65% cost lift and 1.93% GMV lift over the base model. It has been successfully deployed in production since October 2023, serving the WeChat Moments traffic. We have released our code at https://github.com/zhouxy1003/TIN.</description>

      <title>On Generative Agents in Recommendation</title>

Abstract: Recommender systems are the cornerstone of today's information dissemination, yet a disconnect between offline metrics and online performance greatly hinders their development. Addressing this challenge, we envision a recommendation simulator, capitalizing on recent breakthroughs in human-level intelligence exhibited by Large Language Models (LLMs). We propose Agent4Rec, a user simulator in recommendation, leveraging LLM-empowered generative agents equipped with user profile, memory, and actions modules specifically tailored for the recommender system. In particular, these agents' profile modules are initialized using real-world datasets (e.g. MovieLens, Steam, Amazon-Book), capturing users' unique tastes and social traits; memory modules log both factual and emotional memories and are integrated with an emotion-driven reflection mechanism; action modules support a wide variety of behaviors, spanning both taste-driven and emotion-driven actions. Each agent interacts with personalized recommender models in a page-by-page manner, relying on a pre-implemented collaborative filtering-based recommendation algorithm. We delve into both the capabilities and limitations of Agent4Rec, aiming to explore an essential research question: ``To what extent can LLM-empowered generative agents faithfully simulate the behavior of real, autonomous humans in recommender systems?'' Extensive and multi-faceted evaluations of Agent4Rec highlight both the alignment and deviation between agents and user-personalized preferences. Beyond mere performance comparison, we explore insightful experiments, such as emulating the filter bubble effect and discovering the underlying causal relationships in recommendation tasks. Our codes are available at https://github.com/LehengTHU/Agent4Rec.</description>

      <title>M3oE: Multi-Domain Multi-Task Mixture-of Experts Recommendation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18465v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-domain recommendation and multi-task recommendation have demonstrated their effectiveness in leveraging common information from different domains and objectives for comprehensive user modeling. Nonetheless, the practical recommendation usually faces multiple domains and tasks simultaneously, which cannot be well-addressed by current methods. To this end, we introduce M3oE, an adaptive Multi-domain Multi-task Mixture-of-Experts recommendation framework. M3oE integrates multi-domain information, maps knowledge across domains and tasks, and optimizes multiple objectives. We leverage three mixture-of-experts modules to learn common, domain-aspect, and task-aspect user preferences respectively to address the complex dependencies among multiple domains and tasks in a disentangled manner. Additionally, we design a two-level fusion mechanism for precise control over feature extraction and fusion across diverse domains and tasks. The framework's adaptability is further enhanced by applying AutoML technique, which allows dynamic structure optimization. To the best of the authors' knowledge, our M3oE is the first effort to solve multi-domain multi-task recommendation self-adaptively. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets against diverse baselines demonstrate M3oE's superior performance. The implementation code is available to ensure reproducibility.</description>

      <title>myAURA: Personalized health library for epilepsy management via knowledge graph sparsification and visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: We report the development of the patient-centered myAURA application and suite of methods designed to aid epilepsy patients, caregivers, and researchers in making decisions about care and self-management.
  Materials and Methods: myAURA rests on the federation of an unprecedented collection of heterogeneous data resources relevant to epilepsy, such as biomedical databases, social media, and electronic health records. A generalizable, open-source methodology was developed to compute a multi-layer knowledge graph linking all this heterogeneous data via the terms of a human-centered biomedical dictionary.
  Results: The power of the approach is first exemplified in the study of the drug-drug interaction phenomenon. Furthermore, we employ a novel network sparsification methodology using the metric backbone of weighted graphs, which reveals the most important edges for inference, recommendation, and visualization, such as pharmacology factors patients discuss on social media. The network sparsification approach also allows us to extract focused digital cohorts from social media whose discourse is more relevant to epilepsy or other biomedical problems. Finally, we present our patient-centered design and pilot-testing of myAURA, including its user interface, based on focus groups and other stakeholder input.
  Discussion: The ability to search and explore myAURA's heterogeneous data sources via a sparsified multi-layer knowledge graph, as well as the combination of those layers in a single map, are useful features for integrating relevant information for epilepsy.
  Conclusion: Our stakeholder-driven, scalable approach to integrate traditional and non-traditional data sources, enables biomedical discovery and data-powered patient self-management in epilepsy, and is generalizable to other chronic conditions.</description>

      <title>Review-based Recommender Systems: A Survey of Approaches, Challenges and Future Perspectives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recommender systems play a pivotal role in helping users navigate an overwhelming selection of products and services. On online platforms, users have the opportunity to share feedback in various modes, including numerical ratings, textual reviews, and likes/dislikes. Traditional recommendation systems rely on users explicit ratings or implicit interactions (e.g. likes, clicks, shares, saves) to learn user preferences and item characteristics. Beyond these numerical ratings, textual reviews provide insights into users fine-grained preferences and item features. Analyzing these reviews is crucial for enhancing the performance and interpretability of personalized recommendation results. In recent years, review-based recommender systems have emerged as a significant sub-field in this domain. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the developments in review-based recommender systems over recent years, highlighting the importance of reviews in recommender systems, as well as the challenges associated with extracting features from reviews and integrating them into ratings. Specifically, we present a categorization of these systems and summarize the state-of-the-art methods, analyzing their unique features, effectiveness, and limitations. Finally, we propose potential directions for future research, including the integration of multimodal data, multi-criteria rating information, and ethical considerations.</description>

      <title>Optimizing E-commerce Search: Toward a Generalizable and Rank-Consistent Pre-Ranking Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In large e-commerce platforms, search systems are typically composed of a series of modules, including recall, pre-ranking, and ranking phases. The pre-ranking phase, serving as a lightweight module, is crucial for filtering out the bulk of products in advance for the downstream ranking module. Industrial efforts on optimizing the pre-ranking model have predominantly focused on enhancing ranking consistency, model structure, and generalization towards long-tail items. Beyond these optimizations, meeting the system performance requirements presents a significant challenge. Contrasting with existing industry works, we propose a novel method: a Generalizable and RAnk-ConsistEnt Pre-Ranking Model (GRACE), which achieves: 1) Ranking consistency by introducing multiple binary classification tasks that predict whether a product is within the top-k results as estimated by the ranking model, which facilitates the addition of learning objectives on common point-wise ranking models; 2) Generalizability through contrastive learning of representation for all products by pre-training on a subset of ranking product embeddings; 3) Ease of implementation in feature construction and online deployment. Our extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements in both offline metrics and online A/B test: a 0.75% increase in AUC and a 1.28% increase in CVR.</description>

      <title>C-Pack: Packaged Resources To Advance General Chinese Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07597v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce C-Pack, a package of resources that significantly advance the field of general Chinese embeddings. C-Pack includes three critical resources. 1) C-MTEB is a comprehensive benchmark for Chinese text embeddings covering 6 tasks and 35 datasets. 2) C-MTP is a massive text embedding dataset curated from labeled and unlabeled Chinese corpora for training embedding models. 3) C-TEM is a family of embedding models covering multiple sizes. Our models outperform all prior Chinese text embeddings on C-MTEB by up to +10% upon the time of the release. We also integrate and optimize the entire suite of training methods for C-TEM. Along with our resources on general Chinese embedding, we release our data and models for English text embeddings. The English models achieve state-of-the-art performance on MTEB benchmark; meanwhile, our released English data is 2 times larger than the Chinese data. All these resources are made publicly available at https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagEmbedding.</description>

      <title>RAR-b: Reasoning as Retrieval Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semantic textual similartiy (STS) and information retrieval tasks (IR) tasks have been the two major avenues to record the progress of embedding models in the past few years. Under the emerging Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) paradigm, we envision the need to evaluate next-level language understanding abilities of embedding models, and take a conscious look at the reasoning abilities stored in them. Addressing this, we pose the question: Can retrievers solve reasoning problems? By transforming reasoning tasks into retrieval tasks, we find that without specifically trained for reasoning-level language understanding, current state-of-the-art retriever models may still be far from being competent for playing the role of assisting LLMs, especially in reasoning-intensive tasks. Moreover, albeit trained to be aware of instructions, instruction-aware IR models are often better off without instructions in inference time for reasoning tasks, posing an overlooked retriever-LLM behavioral gap for the research community to align. However, recent decoder-based embedding models show great promise in narrowing the gap, highlighting the pathway for embedding models to achieve reasoning-level language understanding. We also show that, although current off-the-shelf re-ranker models fail on these tasks, injecting reasoning abilities into them through fine-tuning still appears easier than doing so to bi-encoders, and we are able to achieve state-of-the-art performance across all tasks by fine-tuning a reranking model. We release Reasoning as Retrieval Benchmark (RAR-b), a holistic suite of tasks and settings to evaluate the reasoning abilities stored in retriever models. RAR-b is available at https://github.com/gowitheflow-1998/RAR-b.</description>
