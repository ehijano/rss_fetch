      <title>Extreme ATM skew in a local volatility model with discontinuity: joint density approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10849v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper concerns a local volatility model in which volatility takes two possible values, and the specific value depends on whether the underlying price is above or below a given threshold value. The model is known, and a number of results have been obtained for it. In particular, option pricing formulas and a power law behaviour of the implied volatility skew have been established in the case when the threshold is taken at the money. In this paper we derive an alternative representation of option pricing formulas. In addition, we obtain an approximation of option prices by the corresponding Black-Scholes prices. Using this approximation streamlines obtaining the aforementioned behaviour of the skew. Our approach is based on the natural relationship of the model with Skew Brownian motion and consists of the systematic use of the joint distribution of this stochastic process and some of its functionals.</description>

      <title>On conditioning and consistency for nonlinear functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a family of conditional nonlinear expectations defined on the space of bounded random variables and indexed by the class of all the sub-sigma-algebras of a given underlying sigma-algebra. We show that if this family satisfies a natural consistency property, then it collapses to a conditional certainty equivalent defined in terms of a state-dependent utility function. This result is obtained by embedding our problem in a decision theoretical framework and providing a new characterization of the Sure-Thing Principle. In particular we prove that this principle characterizes those preference relations which admit consistent backward conditional projections. We build our analysis on state-dependent preferences for a general state space as in Wakker and Zank (1999) and show that their numerical representation admits a continuous version of the state-dependent utility. In this way, we also answer positively to a conjecture posed in the aforementioned paper.</description>
