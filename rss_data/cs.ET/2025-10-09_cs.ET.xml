      <title>A Hybrid Quantum-AI Framework for Protein Structure Prediction on NISQ Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms provide a direct, physics-based approach to protein structure prediction, but their accuracy is limited by the coarse resolution of the energy landscapes generated on current noisy devices. We propose a hybrid framework that combines quantum computation with deep learning, formulating structure prediction as a problem of energy fusion. Candidate conformations are obtained through the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) executed on IBM's 127-qubit superconducting processor, which defines a global yet low-resolution quantum energy surface. To refine these basins, secondary structure probabilities and dihedral angle distributions predicted by the NSP3 neural network are incorporated as statistical potentials. These additional terms sharpen the valleys of the quantum landscape, resulting in a fused energy function that enhances effective resolution and better distinguishes native-like structures. Evaluation on 375 conformations from 75 protein fragments shows consistent improvements over AlphaFold3, ColabFold, and quantum-only predictions, achieving a mean RMSD of 4.9 {\AA} with statistical significance (p &lt; 0.001). The findings demonstrate that energy fusion offers a systematic method for combining data-driven models with quantum algorithms, improving the practical applicability of near-term quantum computing to molecular and structural biology.</description>

      <title>A Review of 10 Years of ProtoSpace: Spacecraft CAD Visualization in Collaborative Augmented Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ProtoSpace is a custom JPL-built platform to help scientists and engineers visualize their CAD models collaboratively in augmented reality (AR) and on the web in 3D. In addition to this main use case, ProtoSpace has been used throughout the entire spacecraft mission lifecycle and beyond: ventilator design and assembly; providing AR-based instructions to astronauts in-training; educating the next generation on the process of spacecraft design; etc. ProtoSpace has been used for a decade by NASA missions-including Mars Perseverance, Europa Clipper, NISAR, SPHEREx, CAL, and Mars Sample Return-to reduce cost and risk by helping engineers and scientists fix problems earlier through reducing miscommunication and helping people understand the spatial context of their spacecraft in the appropriate physical context more quickly. This paper will explore how ProtoSpace came to be, define the system architecture and overview-including HoloLens and 3D web clients, the ProtoSpace server, and the CAD model optimizer-and dive into the use cases, spin-offs, and lessons learned that led to 10 years of success at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</description>

      <title>The Stage Comes to You: A Real-Time Tele-Immersive System with 3D Point Clouds and Vibrotactile Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a low-latency tele-immersive entertainment system that streams 3D point clouds and performers' footstep vibrations, creating the sense that the stage is present. Moving performers and their surroundings are captured as dynamic point clouds under rapidly changing lighting, then processed, transmitted, and rendered within a total latency of less than 100 ms. Under high ambient noise, footstep vibrations are sensed by wearable accelerometers. Real-time visual and haptic streams are delivered to a remote venue, where a large 3D LED wall and a vibration-efficient haptic floor envelop dozens of spectators. A public trial at Expo 2025 linked sites 20 km apart: visitors watched a live dance show and conversed with performers without noticeable delay.</description>

      <title>An HPC-Inspired Blueprint for a Technology-Agnostic Quantum Middle Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a blueprint for a quantum middle layer that supports applications across various quantum technologies. Inspired by concepts and abstractions from HPC libraries and middleware, our design is backend-neutral and context-aware. A program only needs to specify its intent once as typed data and operator descriptors. It declares what the quantum registers mean and which logical transformations are required, without committing to gates, pulses, continuous-variable routines, or anneal backend. Such execution details are carried separately in a context descriptor and can change per backend without modifying the intent artifacts.
  We develop a proof of concept implementation that uses JSON files for the descriptors and two backends: a gate-model path realized with IBM Qiskit Aer simulator and an annealing path realized with D-Wave Ocean's simulated annealer. On a Max-Cut problem instance, the same typed problem runs on both backends by varying only the operator formulation (Quantum Approximated Optimization Algorithm formulation vs. Ising Hamiltonian formulation) and the context. The proposed middle layer concepts are characterized by portability, composability, and its minimal core can evolve with hardware capabilities.</description>

      <title>From Neural Sensing to Stimulation: An Interdisciplinary Roadmap for Neurotechnology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neurotechnologies are transforming how we measure, interpret, and modulate brain-body interactions, integrating real-time sensing, computation, and stimulation to enable precise physiological control. They hold transformative potential across clinical and non-clinical domains, from treating disorders to enhancing cognition and performance. Realizing this potential requires navigating complex, interdisciplinary challenges spanning neuroscience, materials science, device engineering, signal processing, computational modelling, and regulatory and ethical frameworks. This Perspective presents a strategic roadmap for neurotechnology development, created by early-career researchers, highlighting their role at the intersection of disciplines and their capacity to bridge traditional silos. We identify five cross-cutting trade-offs that constrain progress across functionality, scalability, adaptability, and translatability, and illustrate how technical domains influence their resolution. Rather than a domain-specific review, we focus on shared challenges and strategic opportunities that transcend disciplines. We propose a unified framework for collaborative innovation and education, highlight ethical and regulatory priorities, and outline a timeline for overcoming key bottlenecks. By aligning technical development with translational and societal needs, this roadmap aims to accelerate equitable, effective, and future-ready adaptive neurotechnologies, guiding coordinated efforts across the global research and innovation community.</description>

      <title>Layerwise Federated Learning for Heterogeneous Quantum Clients using Quorus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) holds the promise to solve classically intractable problems, but, as critical data can be fragmented across private clients, there is a need for distributed QML in a quantum federated learning (QFL) format. However, the quantum computers that different clients have access to can be error-prone and have heterogeneous error properties, requiring them to run circuits of different depths. We propose a novel solution to this QFL problem, Quorus, that utilizes a layerwise loss function for effective training of varying-depth quantum models, which allows clients to choose models for high-fidelity output based on their individual capacity. Quorus also presents various model designs based on client needs that optimize for shot budget, qubit count, midcircuit measurement, and optimization space. Our simulation and real-hardware results show the promise of Quorus: it increases the magnitude of gradients of higher depth clients and improves testing accuracy by 12.4% on average over the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>From Description to Detection: LLM based Extendable O-RAN Compliant Blind DoS Detection in 5G and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quality and experience of mobile communication have significantly improved with the introduction of 5G, and these improvements are expected to continue beyond the 5G era. However, vulnerabilities in control-plane protocols, such as Radio Resource Control (RRC) and Non-Access Stratum (NAS), pose significant security threats, such as Blind Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Despite the availability of existing anomaly detection methods that leverage rule-based systems or traditional machine learning methods, these methods have several limitations, including the need for extensive training data, predefined rules, and limited explainability. Addressing these challenges, we propose a novel anomaly detection framework that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in zero-shot mode with unordered data and short natural language attack descriptions within the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture. We analyse robustness to prompt variation, demonstrate the practicality of automating the attack descriptions and show that detection quality relies on the semantic completeness of the description rather than its phrasing or length. We utilise an RRC/NAS dataset to evaluate the solution and provide an extensive comparison of open-source and proprietary LLM implementations to demonstrate superior performance in attack detection. We further validate the practicality of our framework within O-RAN's real-time constraints, illustrating its potential for detecting other Layer-3 attacks.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic Computing -- An Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With traditional computing technologies reaching their limit, a new field has emerged seeking to follow the example of the human brain into a new era: neuromorphic computing. This paper provides an introduction to neuromorphic computing, why this and other new computing systems are needed, and what technologies currently exist in the neuromorphic field. It begins with a general introduction into the history of traditional computing and its present problems, and then proceeds to a general overview of neuromorphic systems. It subsequently discusses the main technologies currently in development. For completeness, the paper first discusses neuromorphic-style computing on traditional hardware, and then discusses the two top branches of specialized hardware in this field; neuromorphic chips and photonic systems. Both branches are explained as well as their relative benefits and drawbacks. The paper concludes with a summary and an outlook on the future.</description>

      <title>Lagrange Oscillatory Neural Networks for Constraint Satisfaction and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-inspired computing paradigms are receiving renewed attention to enhance efficiency in compute-intensive tasks such as artificial intelligence and optimization. Similar to Hopfield neural networks, oscillatory neural networks (ONNs) minimize an Ising energy function that embeds the solutions of hard combinatorial optimization problems. Despite their success in solving unconstrained optimization problems, Ising machines still face challenges with constrained problems as they can become trapped in infeasible local minima. In this paper, we introduce a Lagrange ONN (LagONN) designed to escape infeasible states based on the theory of Lagrange multipliers. Unlike existing oscillatory Ising machines, LagONN employs additional Lagrange oscillators to guide the system towards feasible states in an augmented energy landscape, settling only when constraints are met. Taking the maximum satisfiability problem with three literals as a use case (Max-3-SAT), we harness LagONN's constraint satisfaction mechanism to find optimal solutions for random SATlib instances with up to 200 variables and 860 clauses, which provides a deterministic alternative to simulated annealing for coupled oscillators. We benchmark LagONN with SAT solvers and further discuss the potential of Lagrange oscillators to address other constraints, such as phase copying, which is useful in oscillatory Ising machines with limited connectivity.</description>

      <title>Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm: Performance on Simulators and Quantum Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Running quantum circuits on quantum computers does not always generate "clean" results, unlike on a simulator, as noise plays a significant role in any quantum device. To explore this, we experimented with the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) on quantum simulators and real quantum hardware. QAOA is a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm and requires hundreds or thousands of independent executions of the quantum circuit for optimization, which typically goes beyond the publicly available resources for quantum computing. We were granted access to the IBM Quantum System One at the Cleveland Clinic, the first on-premises IBM system in the U.S. This paper explores different optimization methods, techniques, and error mitigation methods to observe how they react to quantum noise differently, which is helpful for other researchers to understand the complexities of running QAOA on real quantum hardware and the challenges faced in dealing with noise.</description>
