      <title>More Exact Thermodynamic Analysis of Topological Black Holes in $R^2$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the thermodynamics of topological black hole solutions in $R^{2}$ gravity, incorporating the effects of small statistical fluctuations up to first-order corrections. We precisely calculate entropy, internal energy, Helmholtz free energy, specific heat, enthalpy, and Gibbs free energy, accounting for perturbative thermal corrections. Our results reveal that the internal energy of small black holes diverges asymptotically due to these fluctuations. The corrected Gibbs free energy attains asymptotically high values for small horizon radii. In contrast, the equilibrium Gibbs free energy approaches zero. Additionally, we assess the stability of the black hole in the presence of these thermal fluctuations. We find that, in contrast to the equilibrium state, the thermal fluctuation introduces a double phase transition to the stability of the black hole. Our analysis reveals that the influence of fluctuations is notably significant, primarily for small black holes. These findings offer new insights into the thermodynamic properties of topological black holes in the presence of thermal fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Condensate Dark Stars beyond the Mean-Field Approximation: The Lee-Huang-Yang correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study structural properties of self-gravitating fluid spheres made of a dilute, homogeneous and ultracold Bose gas assuming repulsive, short-range interactions. For the first time we include the Lee-Huang-Yang correction to the usual polytropic equation-of-state of index $n=1$, which goes beyond the Hartree mean-field approximation taking into account quantum fluctuations. We find that the correction has a considerable impact on the M-R relationships and other properties of condensate dark stars, such as factor of compactness and tidal Love numbers. The impact is more significant for equation-of-states that support larger highest stellar masses.</description>

      <title>Radiation properties and images of loop quantum Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole with a thin accretion disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the characteristics of circular geodesics around loop quantum Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole (LQRNBH) and the radiation properties and observational appearance of a thin accretion disk around it. By calculating the shadow radius and utilizing observational data from M87* and Sgr A*, we derive constraints on the quantum parameter $\zeta$ and charge parameter $Q$. The timelike circular geodesics around LQRNBH and the influence of the model parameters on the circular motion are also discussed. It is found that contrary to the case of the parameter $Q$, the increase of the quantum parameter $\zeta$ leads to the increase of the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). Then, by considering a thin accretion disk model, various radiation properties of the LQRNBH and the effects of the model parameters on them are studied. Concrete examples are provided for quantitative comparison of the radiation properties between LQRNBH and Schwarzschild black hole. With the ray-tracing method, the isoradial curves, redshift distributions, and the observed radiation fluxes of the direct and secondary images of the LQRNBH with the thin accretion disk for various model parameters and observation angles are numerically calculated and discussed. These results are beneficial for us to understand the physical consequences of loop quantum gravity effect.</description>

      <title>Tunnelling in Quantum Cosmology: WKB vs SWKB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The WKB approximation is a standard tool for studying tunnelling problems in quantum cosmology. We compare this method to the Supersymmetric WKB (SWKB) applied to a closed FRW minisuperspace model. We consider the transition from a dust towards a dark energy-dominated epoch can be explained by a generalized Chaplygin gas. Using analytic approximations for the superpotential (power-series and a Picard approximation), we derive closed-form SWKB tunnelling expressions and compute transmission probabilities as functions of the Chaplygin parameters $A$, $B$ and $\alpha$. Numerical root-finding locates classical turning points and numerical integration allows comparison with standard WKB results. We find that SWKB and WKB agree when the WKB validity condition holds, while the SWKB yields systematically larger (and plausibly more accurate) tunnelling probabilities for parameter values where the WKB assumptions break down. The results support the SWKB as a useful complementary approach for barrier-transmission studies in quantum cosmology.</description>

      <title>A nonlinear voice from GW250114 ringdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of quadratic quasi-normal modes would provide a direct probe into black hole nonlinear perturbations. We report the first observational evidence of a set of quadratic quasi-normal modes in the gravitational-wave ringdown of a binary black hole merger. Analyzing the signal from GW250114, we detect six nonlinear modes from the quadratic coupling of the fundamental $(2,2,0)$ mode and its first two overtones. At 5 final mass ($M_\mathrm{f}$) after the merger, the evidence for these nonlinear modes reaches a Bayes factor of 74. To single out these contributions, we employ recent theoretical progress to compute the waveforms and subtract the corresponding nonlinear modes from a numerical relativity surrogate waveform. Our data analysis uses a novel method that incorporates inspiral-merger inference results as a highly constraining prior for the ringdown inference. We further perform a test allowing for phenomenological deviations for the theoretically predicted amplitudes of the quadratic modes. The results show that an amplitude of zero is excluded at $3.0~\sigma$ significance level, while the theoretical expectation is consistent with the inference. This detection marks a first step towards observationally characterizing nonlinear perturbations in the ringdown of a black hole.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Post-Newtonian Analysis of Quadratic Gravity and Solar System Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work systematically investigates the post-Newtonian behavior of general quadratic gravity in the weak-field regime. By extending the Einstein-Hilbert action to include quadratic curvature terms as $\mathcal{L}\propto R-\lambda C^2+\mu R^2$, the theory introduces two massive modes: a scalar mode and a ghost tensor mode. Using the post-Newtonian expansion method, we derive the explicit expressions for the metric for a general source up to 1.5PN order. Furthermore, for a point-mass source, we extend the solution to 2PN order and evaluate the effective Parameterized Post-Newtonian parameters $\gamma(r)$ and $\beta(r)$. The results show that deviations from General Relativity are exponentially suppressed. The theory has the feature $\gamma(r)\equiv 1$ when $m_R=m_W$, and to ensure that gravity remains attractive, we have $m_W&gt;m_R/4$. The leading correction to $\beta(r)$ exhibiting a characteristic $\mathcal{O}(r \ln (r)e^{-mr})$ dependence. Based on the Solar System experiments, we derive preliminary constraints on the theory's parameters: $m_R,m_W\gtrsim23~\mathrm{AU}^{-1}$, corresponding to $\lambda\lesssim2.1\times10^{19}~\mathrm{m}^2$ and $\mu\lesssim 7.1\times 10^{18}~\mathrm{m}^2$. This study provides a theoretical foundation for future tests of quadratic gravity using pulsar timing arrays, gravitational-wave observations, and laboratory-scale short-range gravity experiments.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves and small-field astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrometric observations can, in principle, be used to detect gravitational waves. In this paper we give a practical overview of the gravitational wave effects which can be expected specifically in small-field astrometric data. Particular emphasis is placed on the differential effect between pairs of sources within a finite field of view. We also present several general findings that are not restricted to the small-field case. A detailed theoretical derivation of the general astrometric effect of a plane gravitational wave is provided. Numerical simulations, which underline our theoretical findings, are presented.
  We find that small-field missions suffer from significant detrimental properties, largely because their relatively small fields only allow the measurement of small differential effects which can be expected to be almost totally absorbed by standard plate calibrations.</description>

      <title>On Coordinate Singularities Induced by Trapping Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The trapping (or apparent) horizon serves as a key tool for tracing the complete evolution of black holes. We investigate a class of coordinate singularities induced by such trapping (or apparent) horizons in a spherically symmetric, dynamic spacetime, which are distinct from the well-known coordinate singularities associated with the Killing horizon. In particular, we clarify the geometric structure of this coordinate singularity by means of the Kodama vector field, thereby avoiding unphysical artifacts. We further employ the evolving Ellis drainhole as an analytical model to illustrate key details of this phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Interpolated Topology Change in a Spin Cobordism and the Chiral Weyl Curvature Diagnostic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topology change in Lorentzian quantum gravity demands geometric regulators that control curvature, spin structure, and chirality during nontrivial interpolations. We develop a framework for regulated topology change based on smooth Lorentzian spin cobordisms with interpolating metrics, allowing a transient failure of global hyperbolicity while preserving smoothness, Lorentz signature, and spin compatibility. Within this framework we introduce the Chiral Weyl Curvature Diagnostic, a curvature-based functional that weights topology-changing geometries by conformal curvature, spin admissibility, and topological complexity. The diagnostic functional is built from Weyl curvature invariants and includes a parity-odd dual Weyl term that is sensitive to geometric chirality. Spin consistency is enforced via a Stiefel-Whitney constraint, ensuring that only physically admissible cobordisms contribute. As an example, we construct a smooth spin cobordism between a Morris-Thorne wormhole and asymptotically flat Minkowski spacetime. In the throat region the curvature response is shown to be Weyl-dominated, and the parity-odd Weyl contribution sharply distinguishes chiral knotted embeddings while vanishing for amphichiral configurations. We then show that braids provide a natural language of throat dynamics: evolving wormhole throats trace time-dependent braid movies, with elementary braid generators representing the fundamental topological operations of the cobordism. Replacing crossing number by a braid-based complexity refines the diagnostic functional to operate at the level of these elementary exchanges and extends it naturally to multithroat and networked configurations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a Hamiltonian formulation of %the first order Weyl--Einstein--Cartan gravity which is covariant from the viewpoint of the geometry of the principal fiber bundle. The connection is represented by a $1$-form with values in the Poincar\'{e} Lie algebra, which is defined on the total space of the orthonormal frame bundle fibered over the space-time. Within the $10$-plectic framework we discover that the local equivariance property of the Cartan connection is a consequence of the Hamilton equations.</description>

      <title>Robust Bilinear-Noise-Optimal Control for Gravitational-Wave Detectors: A Mixed LQG/$H_\infty$ Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At its lowest frequencies, LIGO is limited by noise in its many degrees of freedom of suspended optics, which, in turn, introduce noise in the interferometer through their feedback control systems. Nonlinear interactions are a dominant source of low-frequency noise, mixing noise from multiple degrees of freedom. The lowest-order form is bilinear noise, in which the noise from two feedback-controlled subsystems multiplies to mask gravitational waves. Bilinear couplings require control trade-offs that simultaneously balance high- and low-frequency noise. Currently, there is no known lower limit to bilinear control noise. Here, we develop benchmark cost functions for bilinear noise and associated figures of merit. Linear-quadratic-Gaussian control then establishes aggressive feedback that saturates the lower bounds on the cost functions. We then develop a mixed LQG and $H_\infty$ approach to directly compute stable, robust, and optimal feedback, using the LIGO's alignment control system as an example. Direct computations are fast while ensuring a global optimum. By calculating optimal robust control, it is possible to construct the lower bound on controls noise along the Pareto front of practical controllers for LIGO. This method can be used to drastically improve controls noise in existing observatories as well as to set subsystem control noise requirements for next-generation detectors with parameterized design.</description>

      <title>Empirical study of the Pantheon SNeIa Catalog within power-law cosmology and varying speed of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the kinematics of late-time acceleration within Dolgov's power-law cosmology $a=\left(t/t_{0}\right)^{\mu}$ [Phys. Rev. D 55, 5881 (1997)] and Barrow's varying speed of light $c=c_{0}\,a^{-\zeta}$ [Phys. Rev. D 59, 043515 (1999)]. In this cosmology, light traveling through an expanding universe undergoes an additional refraction caused by the varying $c$ along its path, resulting in a modified Lemaitre redshift formula $1+z=a^{-(1+\zeta)}$. The model achieves a high-quality fit to the Pantheon Catalog of Type Ia supernovae and exhibits a notable degeneracy along the locus $(1+\zeta)\,\mu=1$. This empirical relation indicates that $c=\mu^{-1}c_{0}\,t_{0}\,\frac{da}{dt}$, a characteristic that is not present in the $\Lambda$CDM model. We will discuss the implications of these findings in the context of (i) late-time acceleration; (ii) the horizon problem; (iii) Kolb's coasting universe model [Astrophys. J. 344, 543 (1989)]; (iv) a generalization of the cosmological principle to the time domain; and (v) the emergence of a novel conformally flat metric applicable to cosmology.</description>

      <title>Mimetic Dark Matter from Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the coupling of mimetic dark matter to the Gauss-Bonnet topological term in addition to the Einstein-Hilbert action. We demonstrate that such interactions can naturally give rise to mimetic dark matter during the inflationary stage of the universe's evolution. By choosing an appropriate coupling between the mimetic field and the Gauss-Bonnet term, we find that at the end of inflation, the correct amount of dust-like dark matter is produced, with its energy density expressible in terms of the Hubble parameter at the end of inflation. Furthermore, depending on the form of the coupling, the post matter-radiation equality behavior of mimetic dark matter can experience slight modifications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Loop corrections in QED and gravity have recently been conjectured to give rise to an infinite tower of logarithmic soft theorems governing the universal low-energy behavior of photons and gravitons. We explore the implications of this tower for celestial CFT and for the algebra of conformally soft operators. The symmetry-governed part of the tower of logarithmic soft factors is shown to exponentiate, which demonstrates that these loop effects do not represent independent multi-particle interactions, but instead are rooted in the long-range exchange of gauge bosons between pairs of hard operator insertions. We define conformally soft loop operators, and compute their operator product expansions on the celestial sphere. The associated Ward identities exhibit characteristic non-local behaviors, which reflect the pair-wise interactions between hard operator insertions mediated by gauge bosons. We comment on the implications of these results for the soft operator algebra at loop order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the next two decades, gravitational-wave (GW) observations are expected to evolve from a discovery-driven endeavour into a precision tool for astrophysics, cosmology, and fundamental physics. Current second-generation ground-based detectors have established the existence of compact-binary mergers and enabled GW multi-messenger astronomy, but they remain limited in sensitivity, redshift reach, frequency coverage, and duty cycle. These limitations prevent them from addressing many fundamental open questions in cosmology. By the 2040s, wide-field electromagnetic surveys will have mapped the luminous Universe with unprecedented depth and accuracy. Nevertheless, key problems including the nature of dark matter, the physical origin of cosmic acceleration, the properties of gravity on cosmological scales, and the physical conditions of the earliest moments after the Big Bang will remain only partially constrained by electromagnetic observations alone. Progress on these fronts requires access to physical processes and epochs that do not emit light. Gravitational waves provide a unique and complementary observational channel: they propagate over cosmological distances largely unaffected by intervening matter, probe extreme astrophysical environments, and respond directly to the geometry of spacetime. In this context, next-generation GW observatories such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) will be transformative for European astronomy. Operating at sensitivities and frequencies beyond existing detectors, ET will observe binary black holes and neutron stars out to previously inaccessible redshifts, enable continuous high signal-to-noise monitoring of compact sources, and detect gravitational-wave backgrounds of astrophysical and cosmological origin. Together with space-based detectors, ET will play a central role in advancing our understanding of cosmic evolution and fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes: constraints, potential evidence and prospects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) may have formed in the early Universe and may account for all or part of the dark matter. In this review, we summarize the current observational constraints on PBHs across the full mass range, highlight potential evidence for their existence, and outline the prospects for future searches, particularly with gravitational-wave observatories. We also discuss different PBH formation scenarios, identify the corresponding mass functions, and present the observational constraints in each case.</description>

      <title>Dyonic Taub-NUT-AdS Black Branes: Thermodynamics and Phase Diagrams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent developments in the thermodynamics of Taub-NUT spaces and the absence of Misner strings in Taub-NUT solutions with flat horizons, we investigated the phase structure of dyonic Taub-NUT solutions. We follow the treatment proposed in arXiv:2206.09124 and arXiv:2304.06705 to introduce the nut parameter as a conserved charge to the first law. Although the calculated quantities satisfy the first law, we have found a larger class of charges that satisfy the first law and depend on some arbitrary parameter which we call $\alpha$. We choose to describe phase diagrams as NUT parameter-Temperature graphs to show borders of big and small black hole phases. We study the phase structure of these spaces in a mixed ensemble (i.e., we fix the electric potential, the nut parameter, and the magnetic charge), which we classify into different cases depending on the value of $\alpha$. In some of these cases we have first-order phase transitions that end with critical points. These classes could include up to four critical points, again, depending on $\alpha$ and the other quantities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07774v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spacetimes with metrics admitting an expansion in terms of a combination of powers of 1/r and ln r are known as polyhomogeneous spacetimes. The asymptotic behaviour of the Newman-Penrose quantities for the vacuum polyhomogeneous spacetimes is presented under certain gauges. The Bondi mass is revisited via the Iyer-Wald formalism. The memory effect of the gravitational radiation in the vacuum polyhomogeneous spacetimes is also discussed. It is found that the appearance of the logarithmic terms does not affect the balance law and it remains identical to that of spacetimes with metrics admitting an expansion in terms of powers of 1/r.</description>

      <title>Improved parametrized test of general relativity using the IMRPhenomX waveform family: Including higher harmonics and precession</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When testing general relativity (GR) with gravitational wave observations, parametrized tests of deviations from the expected strong-field source dynamics are one of the most widely used techniques. We present an updated version of the parametrized framework with the state-of-art IMRPhenomX waveform family. Our new framework incorporates deviations in the dominant mode as well as in the higher-order modes of the waveform. We demonstrate that the missing physics of either higher-order modes or precession in the parametrized model can lead to a biased conclusion of false deviation from GR. Our new implementation mitigates this issue and enables us to perform the tests for highly asymmetric and precessing binaries without being subject to systematic biases due to missing physics. Finally, we apply the improved test to analyze events observed during the second half of the third observing run of LIGO and Virgo (O3b). We provide constraints on GR deviations by combining O3b results with those from previous observation runs. Our findings show no evidence for violations of GR.</description>

      <title>Realistic assessment of a single gravitational wave source localization taking into account precise pulsar distances with pulsar timing arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are anticipated to detect continuous gravitational waves (GWs) from individual supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) in the near future. To identify the host galaxy of a GW source, PTAs require significantly improved angular resolution beyond the typical range of 100-1000 square degrees achieved by recent continuous GW searches. In this study, we investigate how precise pulsar distance measurements can enhance the localization of a single GW source. Accurate distance information, comparable to or better than the GW wavelength (typically 1~pc) can refine GW source localization. In the near future, with the advent of Square Kilometre Array (SKA), such high-precision distance measurements will be feasible for a few nearby pulsars. We focus on the relatively nearby pulsars J0437-4715 (156 pc) and J0030+0451 (331 pc), incorporating their actual distance uncertainties based on current VLBI measurements and the anticipated precision of the SKA-era. By simulating 87 pulsars with the GW signal and Gaussian white noise in the timing residuals, we assess the impact of the pulsar distance information on GW source localization. Our results show that without precise distance information, localization remains insufficient to identify host galaxies under 10 ns noise. However, incorporating SKA-era distance precision for nearby pulsars J0437-4715 and J0030+0451 can reduce localization uncertainties to the required level of $10^{-3}$ $\rm deg^{2}$. Localization accuracy strongly depends on the geometric configuration of pulsars with well-measured distances and improves notably near and between such pulsars. The improvement of the localization will greatly aid in identifying the host galaxy of a GW source and constructing an SMBHB catalog. It will further enable follow-up electromagnetic observations to investigate the SMBHB in greater detail.</description>

      <title>Quantum aspects of spacetime: A quantum optics view of acceleration radiation and black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the centennial of quantum mechanics, we offer an overview of the central role played by quantum information and thermalization in problems involving fundamental properties of spacetime and gravitational physics. This is an open area of research still a century after the initial development of formal quantum mechanics, highlighting the effectiveness of quantum physics in the description of all natural phenomena. These remarkable connections can be highlighted with the tools of modern quantum optics, which effectively addresses the three-fold interplay of interacting atoms, fields, and spacetime backgrounds describing gravitational fields and noninertial systems. In this review article, we select aspects of these phenomena centered on quantum features of the acceleration radiation of particles in the presence of black holes. The ensuing horizon-brightened radiation (HBAR) provides a case study of the role played by quantum physics in nontrivial spacetime behavior, and also shows a fundamental correspondence with black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Gravitational baryogenesis in $f(T,L_m)$ gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observed matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe remains a fundamental challenge in modern physics. In this work, we explore gravitational baryogenesis within the framework of $f(T,L_m)$ gravity, where the gravitational Lagrangian depends on both the torsion scalar $T$ and the matter Lagrangian $L_m$. We consider three representative models and examine their ability to generate the observed baryon-to-entropy ratio. Our analysis shows that couplings involving both torsion and the matter Lagrangian, $\partial_\mu(-T-\frac{L_m}{L_0})$, can successfully account for the baryon asymmetry for decoupling temperatures in the range $10^{12}$-$10^{14}\,\text{GeV}$, while remaining consistent with small deviations from General Relativity. These results highlight the capacity of $f(T,L_m)$ gravity to provide novel mechanisms for baryogenesis, demonstrating that the interplay between torsion and matter-sector contributions can naturally generate the observed asymmetry. The framework also remains compatible with late-time cosmological evolution, offering a unified setting for early- and late-time dynamics.</description>

      <title>A relativistic treatment of accretion disk torques on extreme mass-ratio inspirals around non-spinning black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a relativistically accurate formalism to model the interaction between stellar mass compact objects embedded in thin accretion disks around a non-spinning supermassive black hole, using tools from self-force theory and Hamiltonian perturbation theory. We then apply this formalism to analyze the evolution of a compact object on a nearly circular and equatorial orbit interacting with a thin equatorial disk. We provide analytic and relativistically-accurate expressions for the rates of energy and angular momentum exchanged during interactions due to Lindblad and corotation resonances. Our results show that relativistic corrections can enhance the magnitude of the torque by 1-2 orders of magnitude compared to purely Newtonian expressions when the orbit of the compact object is smaller than $10$ Schwarzschild radii of the supermassive black hole. We also demonstrate that strong relativistic shifts the inner Lindblad resonances closer to the compact object than the outer Lindblad resonances when the compact object is closer than 4 Schwarzschild radii to the supermassive black hole, potentially leading to a reversal in the direction of the torque acting on the compact object. Finally, we provide a dephasing estimate and show that using the relativistic torque formula is crucial to obtain reliable estimates for extreme mass ratio inspirals in orbits closer than 5 Schwarzschild radii to the supermassive black hole. Our results highlight the importance of using relativistically-accurate models of environmental interactions in extreme mass-ratio inspirals close to a supermassive black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-local gravity can potentially solve several problems of gravitational field both at Ultra-Violet and Infra-Red scales. However, such an approach has been formulated mainly in metric formalism. In this paper, we discuss non-local theories of gravity in the metric-affine framework. In particular, we study the dynamics of metric-affine analogue of some well-studied non-local theories, by treating the metric and the connection as independent fields. The approach gives the opportunity to deal with non-local gravity under a more general standard. Furthermore, we introduce some novel non-local metric-affine theories with no Riemannian analogue and investigate their dynamics. Finally we discuss some cosmological applications of our development.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03564v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We model the motion of a small compact object on a nearly circular orbit around a spinning supermassive black hole, which is also interacting with a thin equatorial accretion-disk surrounding the latter, through tools from self-force and Hamiltonian perturbation theory. We provide an analytical and relativistically-accurate formalism to calculate the rate of energy and angular momentum exchanged at Lindblad resonances. We show that strong relativistic effects can potentially cause a reversal in the direction of the torque on the small compact object if the surface density gradient is not too large. We analytically explore the dependence of the torque reversal location on the spin of the supermassive black hole and demonstrate that the ratio of the reversal location to the innermost stable circular orbit is approximately insensitive to the spin of the supermassive black hole. Our results show that relativistic torques can be 1--2 order of magnitude larger than the Newtonian torque routinely used in the literature to model disk/small-compact-object interactions close to the supermassive black hole. Our results highlight the importance of including relativistic effects when modeling environmental effects in extreme mass-ratio inspirals.</description>

      <title>Primordial observables of explicit diffeomorphism violation in gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the potential for current and future gravitational-wave detectors to observe imprints of explicit diffeomorphism violation in primordial signals. Starting from a simple model with known effects, we derive the strain amplitude and power spectrum for primordial gravitational waves, both of which are affected by the symmetry breaking. Through this, we directly find predictions for the tensor spectral index and tensor-to-scalar which are different from general relativity. By considering the known sensitivity curves for NANOGrav, SKA, THEIA, $\mu$-ARES, ASTROD-GW, LISA, BBO, DECIGO, CE, AION-km, AEDGE, ET, and aLIGO, we place observability limits on the parameters controlling the diffeomorphism violation. For instance, we find that aLIGO could observe signals for \(s_{00} \lesssim -0.1\), while more sensitive future detectors like LISA and DECIGO could probe violations as small as \(s_{00} \approx -5 \times 10^{-4}\) and \(-3 \times 10^{-3}\), respectively. Finally, we consider the existing constraints on the number of relativistic degrees of freedom $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ which is tightly constrained by Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and we find that $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ only weakly depends on the symmetry breaking but places a lower bound on the coefficients which is consistent with available bounds from the speed of gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>On the Complexified Spacetime Manifold Mapping of AdS to dS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a complex manifold, one can bridge anti-de Sitter and de Sitter spacetimes via analytic continuation, preserving geometric invariants and regularity, avoiding singularities during the AdS-dS transition. It unifies gravitational and gauge interactions under a complexified symmetry group, maintaining bulk unitarity for both AdS and dS. Boundary unitarity is upheld in AdS but not in dS due to the spacelike conformal boundary. The theory uses holographic principles like the MacDowell-Mansouri and Quantum Extremal Surface prescriptions to align entanglement and black hole entropy with AdS/CFT and general relativity. HUFT provides insights into AdS and dS holography, the cosmological constant, and quantum gravity unitarity and entanglement.</description>

Abstract: We show that primordial adiabatic curvature fluctuations generate an instability of the scalar field sourcing a kination era. We demonstrate that the generated higher Fourier modes constitute a radiation-like component dominating over the kination background after about $11$ e-folds of cosmic expansion. Current constraints on the extra number of neutrino flavors $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ thus imply the observational bound of approximately 10 e-folds, representing the most stringent bound to date on the stiffness of the equation of state of the pre-Big-Bang-Nucleosynthesis universe.</description>

      <title>Gravitational dressing: from the crossed product to more general algebraic and mathematical structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24833v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The crossed product, and consequent transition from von Neumann algebras of type III to II, is recovered from a truncation of more general gravitational dressing constructions, about certain spacetimes. This is done by extending "standard dressing" constructions previously used to give a perturbative definition of "gravitational splittings," defining approximate localization of information. This result appears to illustrate that this algebraic transition is a small piece of a more general algebraic, or other mathematical, structure associated with quantum gravity. The leading-order structure involves noncommutativity from separated regions, and at the nonperturbative level connects with a possible explanation of holographic behavior for gravity.</description>

      <title>Gauge-Invariant Entire-Function Regulators and UV Finiteness in NonLocal Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11756v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We clarify the status of gauge-invariant entire-function regulators in NonLocal Quantum Field Theory. The regulator is implemented as an entire function of the covariant Laplace--Beltrami operator. Working in the background-field formalism and expanding around flat, trivial backgrounds, we show that plane waves diagonalize the d'Alembertian, so that the entire function reduces to a multiplicative form factor in Minkowski momentum space. After Wick rotation, to the Euclidean axis, producing exponential ultraviolet damping in loop integrals without introducing additional poles or branch cuts. Our analysis provides a concise, gauge-covariant justification for the use of entire-function regulators in nonlocal quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb Z_2$-Stable Dark Matter via Broken $\text{SU}(5)$ Gauge Bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19462v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I construct and analyze a dark matter sector that is neutral under the unbroken Standard Model gauge group and couples only to the broken $\text{SU}(5)$ gauge directions, the leptoquark vectors $X,Y$. An exact $\mathbb Z_2$ renders the dark matter stable. I give a gauge-covariant definition of projectors onto the unbroken Standard Model and broken ($X,Y$) subspaces, demonstrate that the covariant derivative of dark matter selects only $X,Y$, and integrate out $X,Y$ at tree level to obtain the leading effective operators. I also derive the loop-induced $\chi^2\,G^a_{\mu\nu}G^{a\mu\nu}$ coupling to gluons, prove color neutrality, and show consistency with cold dark matter phenomenology. Cosmological production proceeds via UV freeze-in or even more suppressed channels in.</description>

      <title>Exact Infrared Triangle in Massless sQED with Long-range Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The logarithmic soft photon theorem in four spacetime dimensions encodes an infinite-dimensional asymptotic symmetry which acts on massive matter as a divergent superphaserotation. Here we extend this result to massless matter which is both more subtle and surprising. We derive the charge associated to divergent superphaserotations and show that it exactly vanishes to all orders in the electromagnetic coupling. This is in agreement with the vanishing of the classical logarithmic soft photon theorem which is one-loop exact. Special care is required for massless matter due to potential collinear divergences which, as we show, do however not affect the superphaserotation charge. We furthermore compute the infrared corrections to the charge associated to the subleading tree-level soft photon theorem. As a corollary of our result, we find that the tail to the velocity kick memory due to the long-range interactions between soft electromagnetic radiation and massless matter vanishes.</description>

      <title>On the Cooling of Compact Stars in Light of the HESS J1731-347 Remnant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent analyses on the central compact object in the HESS J1731-347 supernova remnant reported not only surprising structural properties (mass $M$ and radius $R$), but also an interesting thermal evolution. More precisely, it has been estimated that $M=0.77^{+0.20}_{-0.17}M_\odot$ and $R=10.4^{+0.86}_{-0.78}$ km (at the $1\sigma$ level), while a redshited surface temperature of $153^{+4}_ {-2}$ keV at an age of 2-6 kyrs has been reported. In the present work, we conduct an in-depth investigation on the possible nature (hadronic, hybrid, quark) of this compact object by attempting to not only explain its mass and radius but also the corresponding estimations for its temperature and age. In the case of hybrid stars we also examine possible effects of the symmetry energy on the activation of different neutrino emitting process, and hence on the resulting cooling curves. We found that the reported temperature and age may be compatible to hadronic stellar configurations regardless of whether pairing effects are included. In the scenario of hybrid stars, we found that the strange quark matter core has to be in a superconducting state in order to reach an agreement with the observational constraints. In addition, the hadronic phase must be soft enough so that the direct Urca process is not activated. Furthermore, we have shown that the considered cooling constraints can be reconciled within the framework of strange stars. However, quark matter has to be in a superconducting state and the quark direct Urca process needs to be blocked.</description>

      <title>Graviton-Photon Mixing by a Kerr-Newman Black Hole with Worldline EFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00980v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In black hole perturbation theory, the difficulty in separating electromagnetic and gravitational sectors of the coupled Teukolsky equations has prevented a general treatment of scattering processes involving both electromagnetic waves and gravitational waves in presence of a Kerr-Newman black hole. We present the first computation of the gauge-invariant, low-frequency scattering amplitude for graviton photoproduction by a Kerr-Newman black hole at tree level up to $\mathcal{O}\big((\omega/m)^2\big)$ or $\mathcal{O}(S^2)$ and linear in $\kappa$, using the worldline effective field theory. The relevant Wilson coefficients are determined by matching the graviton and photon one-point functions to the Kerr-Newman solution. We obtain the full angular dependence of the conversion cross section in the presence of spin and comment on the factorization relation between the graviton photoproduction amplitude and the photon Compton amplitude for a classical spinning source. The result provides a benchmark for future analyses of coupled gravitoelectromagnetic scattering in spinning charged compact object backgrounds.</description>
