      <title>Vertical Ground Reaction Forces Waveform Flattening during Gait in Women with Knee Osteoarthritis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background. Knee Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common chronic joint condition, and its prevalence increases with age. This study aims to examine whether flattened vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) waveforms and reduced knee range of motion (RoM) occur together during gait as compensatory strategies to maintain gait speed. Methods. Twelve women with knee OA and twelve healthy women of the same age completed the Western Ontario and McMaster University Index (WOMAC) to assess self-reported pain, stiffness, and function. The groups were divided into two groups: OA vs. control 2 limbs or left and right in the Control group. A mixed-design ANOVA was used to examine differences in vertical ground response forces (VGRFs) peaks, minimum VGRF, anterior-posterior weight acceptance (ADWA) and propulsive force (ADPO), knee RoM, and gait speeds. Results. In the OA group, the mean Peak 1 vGFR was 1.109 (SD = 0.05) for the right leg (p 0.05), while the mean min vGFFR was 0.87 (SD=0.04) for the left leg. The OA leg exhibited a mean ADWA of 0.23 0.04 kg/BW, which was significantly lower than the control group's right leg (0.28 0.09 kg/bw, p0.05). No group differences in gait velocity were detected. Conclusions. We interpret the flattening of the vFGFR waveform and the reduction in knee RoM as components of an adaptive, yet potentially maladaptive, motor strategy</description>

      <title>Thickness of epithelia on wavy substrates: measurements and continuous models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We measured the thickness of MDCK epithelia grown on substrates with a sinusoidal profile. We show that while at long wavelength the profile of the epithelium follows that of the substrate, at short wavelengths cells are thicker in valleys than on ridges. This is reminiscent of the so-called {\guillemotleft} healing length {\guillemotright} in the case of a thin liquid film wetting a rough solid substrate. We explore the ability of continuum mechanics models to account for these observations. Modeling the epithelium as a thin liquid film, with surface tension, does not fully account for the measurements. Neither does modeling the epithelium as a thin incompressible elastic film. On the contrary, the addition of an apical active stress gives satisfactory agreement with measurements, with one fitting parameter, the ratio between the active stress and the elastic modulus.</description>

      <title>Periodontal Bone Loss Analysis via Keypoint Detection With Heuristic Post-Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13477v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes a deep learning framework and annotation methodology for the automatic detection of periodontal bone loss landmarks, associated conditions, and staging. 192 periapical radiographs were collected and annotated with a stage agnostic methodology, labelling clinically relevant landmarks regardless of disease presence or extent. We propose a heuristic post-processing module that aligns predicted keypoints to tooth boundaries using an auxiliary instance segmentation model. An evaluation metric, Percentage of Relative Correct Keypoints (PRCK), is proposed to capture keypoint performance in dental imaging domains. Four donor pose estimation models were adapted with fine-tuning for our keypoint problem. Post-processing improved fine-grained localisation, raising average PRCK^{0.05} by +0.028, but reduced coarse performance for PRCK^{0.25} by -0.0523 and PRCK^{0.5} by -0.0345. Orientation estimation shows excellent performance for auxiliary segmentation when filtered with either stage 1 object detection model. Periodontal staging was detected sufficiently, with the best mesial and distal Dice scores of 0.508 and 0.489, while furcation involvement and widened periodontal ligament space tasks remained challenging due to scarce positive samples. Scalability is implied with similar validation and external set performance. The annotation methodology enables stage agnostic training with balanced representation across disease severities for some detection tasks. The PRCK metric provides a domain-specific alternative to generic pose metrics, while the heuristic post-processing module consistently corrected implausible predictions with occasional catastrophic failures. The proposed framework demonstrates the feasibility of clinically interpretable periodontal bone loss assessment, with potential to reduce diagnostic variability and clinician workload.</description>

      <title>Design and optimization of in situ self-functionalizing stress sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mechanical contributions are crucial regulators of diverse biological processes, yet their \textit{in vivo} measurement remains challenging due to limitations of current techniques, that can be destructive or require complex dedicated setups. This study introduces a novel method to synthesize biocompatible, self-functionalizing stress sensors based on inverted emulsions, that can be used to probe stresses inside tissues but can also locally perturb the biological environment through specific binder presentation or drug delivery. We engineered an optimal design for these inverted emulsions, focusing on finding the balance between the two contradictory constraints: achieving low surface tension for deformability while maintaining emulsion instability for efficient self-functionalization and drug release. Proof-of-concept experiments in both agarose gels and complex biological systems, including brain organoids and zebrafish embryos, confirm the droplets ability to deform in response to mechanical stress applied within the tissue, to self-functionalize and to release encapsulated molecules locally. These versatile sensors offer a method for non-invasive stress measurements and targeted chemical delivery within living biological tissues, giving the potential to overcome current technical barriers in biophysical studies.</description>

      <title>Large-scale spatial variable gene atlas for spatial transcriptomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatial variable genes (SVGs) reveal critical information about tissue architecture, cellular interactions, and disease microenvironments. As spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies proliferate, accurately identifying SVGs across diverse platforms, tissue types, and disease contexts has become both a major opportunity and a significant computational challenge. Here, we present a comprehensive benchmarking study of 20 state-of-the-art SVG detection methods using human slides from STimage-1K4M, a large-scale resource of ST data comprising 662 slides from more than 18 tissue types. We evaluate each method across a range of biologically and technically meaningful criteria, including recovery of pathologist-annotated domain-specific markers, cross-slide reproducibility, scalability to high-resolution data, and robustness to technical variation. Our results reveal marked differences in performance depending on tissue type, spatial resolution, and study design. Beyond benchmarking, we construct the first cross-tissue atlas of SVGs, enabling comparative analysis of spatial gene programs across cancer and normal tissues. We observe similarities between pairs of tissues that reflect developmental and functional relationships, such as high overlap between thymus and lymph node, and uncover spatial gene programs associated with metastasis, immune infiltration, and tissue-of-origin identity in cancer. Together, our work defines a framework for evaluating and interpreting spatial gene expression and establishes a reference resource for the ST community.</description>
