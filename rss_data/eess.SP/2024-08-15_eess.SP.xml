      <title>User-Centric Machine Learning for Resource Allocation in MPTCP-Enabled Hybrid LiFi and WiFi Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an emerging paradigm of heterogeneous networks (HetNets) towards 6G, the hybrid light fidelity (LiFi) and wireless fidelity (WiFi) networks (HLWNets) have potential to explore the complementary advantages of the optical and radio spectra. Like other cooperation-native HetNets, HLWNets face a crucial load balancing (LB) problem due to the heterogeneity of access points (APs). The existing literature mostly formulates this problem as joint AP selection and resource allocation (RA), presuming that each user equipment (UE) is served by one AP at a time, under the constraint of the traditional transmission control protocol (TCP). In contrast, multipath TCP (MPTCP), which allows for the simultaneous use of multiple APs, can significantly boost the UE's throughput as well as enhancing its network resilience. However, the existing TCP-based LB methods, particularly those aided by machine learning, are not suitable for the MPTCP scenario. In this paper, we discuss the challenges when developing learning-aided LB in MPTCP-enabled HLWNets, and propose a novel user-centric learning model to tackle this tricky problem. Unlike the conventional network-centric learning methods, the proposed method determines the LB solution for a single target UE, rendering low complexity and high flexibility in practical implementations. Results show that the proposed user-centric approach can greatly outperform the network-centric learning method. Against the TCP-based LB method such as game theory, the proposed method can increase the throughput of HLWNets by up to 40\%.</description>

      <title>Exploration of LLMs, EEG, and behavioral data to measure and support attention and sleep</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the application of large language models (LLMs), pre-trained models with massive textual data for detecting and improving these altered states. We investigate the use of LLMs to estimate attention states, sleep stages, and sleep quality and generate sleep improvement suggestions and adaptive guided imagery scripts based on electroencephalogram (EEG) and physical activity data (e.g. waveforms, power spectrogram images, numerical features). Our results show that LLMs can estimate sleep quality based on human textual behavioral features and provide personalized sleep improvement suggestions and guided imagery scripts; however detecting attention, sleep stages, and sleep quality based on EEG and activity data requires further training data and domain-specific knowledge.</description>

      <title>Optimal Joint Fronthaul Compression and Beamforming Design for Networked ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates a networked integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where multiple base stations (BSs), connected to a central processor (CP) via capacity-limited fronthaul links, cooperatively serve communication users while simultaneously sensing a target. The primary objective is to minimize the total transmit power while meeting the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirements for communication and sensing under fronthaul capacity constraints, resulting in a joint fronthaul compression and beamforming design (J-FCBD) problem. We demonstrate that the optimal fronthaul compression variables can be determined in closed form alongside the beamformers, a novel finding in this field. Leveraging this insight, we show that the remaining beamforming design problem can be solved globally using the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique, albeit with considerable complexity. Furthermore, the tightness of its SDR reveals zero duality gap between the considered problem and its Lagrangian dual. Building on this duality result, we exploit the novel UL-DL duality within the ISAC framework to develop an efficient primal-dual (PD)-based algorithm. The algorithm alternates between solving beamforming with a fixed dual variable via fixed-point iteration and updating dual variable via bisection, ensuring global optimality and achieving high efficiency due to the computationally inexpensive iterations. Numerical results confirm the global optimality, effectiveness, and efficiency of the proposed PD-based algorithm.</description>

      <title>SPEED: Scalable Preprocessing of EEG Data for Self-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) research typically focuses on tasks with narrowly defined objectives, but recent studies are expanding into the use of unlabeled data within larger models, aiming for a broader range of applications. This addresses a critical challenge in EEG research. For example, Kostas et al. (2021) show that self-supervised learning (SSL) outperforms traditional supervised methods. Given the high noise levels in EEG data, we argue that further improvements are possible with additional preprocessing. Current preprocessing methods often fail to efficiently manage the large data volumes required for SSL, due to their lack of optimization, reliance on subjective manual corrections, and validation processes or inflexible protocols that limit SSL. We propose a Python-based EEG preprocessing pipeline optimized for self-supervised learning, designed to efficiently process large-scale data. This optimization not only stabilizes self-supervised training but also enhances performance on downstream tasks compared to training with raw data.</description>

      <title>RIS-Aided Bistatic Radar for Rapid NLOS Sensing in the Teraharetz Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a non-lineof-sight (NLOS) sensing problem at terahertz frequencies. To be able to observe the targets shadowed by a blockage, we propose a method using reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS). We employ a bistatic radar system and scan the obstructed area with RIS using hierarchical codebooks (HCB). Moreover, we propose an iterative maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) scheme to yield the optimum sensing accuracy, converging to Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). We take band-specific effects such as diffraction and beam squint into account and show that these effects are relevant factors affecting localization performance in RIS-employed radar setups. The results show that under NLOS conditions, the system can still localize all the targets with very good accuracy using the RIS. The initial estimates obtained by the HCBs can provide centimeter-level accuracy, and when the optimal performance is needed, at the cost of a few extra transmissions, the proposed iterative MLE method improves the accuracy to sub-millimeter accuracy, yielding the position error bound.</description>

      <title>On the Spectral Efficiency of Movable and Rotary Access Points under Rician Fading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-User Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MU-MIMO) is a pivotal technology in present-day wireless communication systems. In such systems, a base station or Access Point (AP) is equipped with multiple antenna elements and serves multiple active devices simultaneously. Nevertheless, most of the works evaluating the performance of MU-MIMO systems consider APs with static antenna arrays, that is, without any movement capability. Recently, the idea of APs and antenna arrays that are able to move have gained traction among the research community. Many works evaluate the communications performance of antenna systems able to move on the horizontal plane. However, such APs require a very bulky, complex and expensive movement system. In this work, we propose a simpler and cheaper alternative: the utilization of rotary APs, i.e. APs that can rotate. We also analyze the performance of a system in which the AP is able to both move and rotate. The movements and/or rotations of the APs are computed in order to maximize the mean per-user achievable spectral efficiency, based on estimates of the locations of the active devices and using particle swarm optimization. We adopt a spatially correlated Rician fading channel model, and evaluate the resulting optimized performance of the different setups in terms of mean per-user achievable spectral efficiencies. Our numerical results show that both the optimal rotations and movements of the APs can provide substantial performance gains when the line-of-sight components of the channel vectors are strong. Moreover, the simpler rotary APs can outperform the movable APs when their movement area is constrained.</description>

      <title>Online ML-based Joint Channel Estimation and MIMO Decoding for Dynamic Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an online method for joint channel estimation and decoding in massive MIMO-OFDM systems using complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs). The study evaluates the performance of various CVNNs, such as the complex-valued feedforward neural network (CVFNN), split-complex feedforward neural network (SCFNN), complex radial basis function (C-RBF), fully-complex radial basis function (FC-RBF) and phase-transmittance radial basis function (PT-RBF), in realistic 5G communication scenarios. Results demonstrate improvements in mean squared error (MSE), convergence, and bit error rate (BER) accuracy. The C-RBF and PT-RBF architectures show the most promising outcomes, suggesting that RBF-based CVNNs provide a reliable and efficient solution for complex and noisy communication environments. These findings have potential implications for applying advanced neural network techniques in next-generation wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Analog Spiking Neuron in CMOS 28 nm Towards Large-Scale Neuromorphic Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The computational complexity of deep learning algorithms has given rise to significant speed and memory challenges for the execution hardware. In energy-limited portable devices, highly efficient processing platforms are indispensable for reproducing the prowess afforded by much bulkier processing platforms.
  In this work, we present a low-power Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron design fabricated in TSMC's 28 nm CMOS technology as proof of concept to build an energy-efficient mixed-signal Neuromorphic System-on-Chip (NeuroSoC). The fabricated neuron consumes 1.61 fJ/spike and occupies an active area of 34 $\mu m^{2}$, leading to a maximum spiking frequency of 300 kHz at 250 mV power supply.
  These performances are used in a software model to emulate the dynamics of a Spiking Neural Network (SNN). Employing supervised backpropagation and a surrogate gradient technique, the resulting accuracy on the MNIST dataset, using 4-bit post-training quantization stands at 82.5\%. The approach underscores the potential of such ASIC implementation of quantized SNNs to deliver high-performance, energy-efficient solutions to various embedded machine-learning applications.</description>

      <title>A Single Channel-Based Neonatal Sleep-Wake Classification using Hjorth Parameters and Improved Gradient Boosting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sleep plays a crucial role in neonatal development. Monitoring the sleep patterns in neonates in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) is imperative for understanding the maturation process. While polysomnography (PSG) is considered the best practice for sleep classification, its expense and reliance on human annotation pose challenges. Existing research often relies on multichannel EEG signals; however, concerns arise regarding the vulnerability of neonates and the potential impact on their sleep quality. This paper introduces a novel approach to neonatal sleep stage classification using a single-channel gradient boosting algorithm with Hjorth features. The gradient boosting parameters are fine-tuned using random search cross-validation (randomsearchCV), achieving an accuracy of 82.35% for neonatal sleep-wake classification. Validation is conducted through 5-fold cross-validation. The proposed algorithm not only enhances existing neonatal sleep algorithms but also opens avenues for broader applications.</description>

      <title>Accelerating High-Fidelity Waveform Generation via Adversarial Flow Matching Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces PeriodWave-Turbo, a high-fidelity and high-efficient waveform generation model via adversarial flow matching optimization. Recently, conditional flow matching (CFM) generative models have been successfully adopted for waveform generation tasks, leveraging a single vector field estimation objective for training. Although these models can generate high-fidelity waveform signals, they require significantly more ODE steps compared to GAN-based models, which only need a single generation step. Additionally, the generated samples often lack high-frequency information due to noisy vector field estimation, which fails to ensure high-frequency reproduction. To address this limitation, we enhance pre-trained CFM-based generative models by incorporating a fixed-step generator modification. We utilized reconstruction losses and adversarial feedback to accelerate high-fidelity waveform generation. Through adversarial flow matching optimization, it only requires 1,000 steps of fine-tuning to achieve state-of-the-art performance across various objective metrics. Moreover, we significantly reduce inference speed from 16 steps to 2 or 4 steps. Additionally, by scaling up the backbone of PeriodWave from 29M to 70M parameters for improved generalization, PeriodWave-Turbo achieves unprecedented performance, with a perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) score of 4.454 on the LibriTTS dataset. Audio samples, source code and checkpoints will be available at https://github.com/sh-lee-prml/PeriodWave.</description>

      <title>The inverse obstacle problem for nonlinear inclusions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Monotonocity Principle states a monotonic relationship between a possibly non-linear material property and a proper corresponding boundary operator. The Monotonicity Principle (MP) has attracted great interest in the field of inverse problems, because of its fundamental role in developing real time imaging methods. Recently, with quite general assumptions, a MP in the presence of non linear materials has been established for elliptic PDE, such as those governing Electrical Resistance Tomography.
  Together with recently introduced imaging methods and algorithms based on MP, arises a fundamental question related to the Converse (of the MP). Indeed, the Converse of the MP is fundamental to define the theoretical limits of applicability of imaging methods and algorithms. Specifically, the Converse of the MP guarantees that the outer boundary of a nonlinear anomaly can be reconstructed by means of MP based imaging methods.
  In this paper, the Converse of the Monotonicity Principle for nonlinear anomaly embedded in a linear material is proved. The results is provided in a quite general setting for Electrical Resistance Tomography. Moreover, the nonlinear electrical conductivity of the anomaly, as function of the electric field, can be either bounded or not bounded from infinity and/or zero.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The forthcoming generation of wireless technology, 6G, promises a revolutionary leap beyond traditional data-centric services. It aims to usher in an era of ubiquitous intelligent services, where everything is interconnected and intelligent. This vision requires the seamless integration of three fundamental modules: Sensing for information acquisition, communication for information sharing, and computation for information processing and decision-making. These modules are intricately linked, especially in complex tasks such as edge learning and inference. However, the performance of these modules is interdependent, creating a resource competition for time, energy, and bandwidth. Existing techniques like integrated communication and computation (ICC), integrated sensing and computation (ISC), and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) have made partial strides in addressing this challenge, but they fall short of meeting the extreme performance requirements. To overcome these limitations, it is essential to develop new techniques that comprehensively integrate sensing, communication, and computation. This integrated approach, known as Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Computation (ISCC), offers a systematic perspective for enhancing task performance. This paper begins with a comprehensive survey of historic and related techniques such as ICC, ISC, and ISAC, highlighting their strengths and limitations. It then explores the state-of-the-art signal designs for ISCC, along with network resource management strategies specifically tailored for ISCC. Furthermore, this paper discusses the exciting research opportunities that lie ahead for implementing ISCC in future advanced networks. By embracing ISCC, we can unlock the full potential of intelligent connectivity, paving the way for groundbreaking applications and services.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous System Design for Cell-Free Massive MIMO in Wideband Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cell-free massive multi-input multi-output (CFmMIMO) offers uniform service quality through distributed access points (APs), yet unresolved issues remain. This paper proposes a heterogeneous system design that goes beyond the original CFmMIMO architecture by exploiting the synergy of a base station (BS) and distributed APs. Users are categorized as near users (NUs) and far users (FUs) depending on their proximity to the BS. The BS serves the NUs, while the APs cater to the FUs. Through activating only the closest AP of each FU, the use of downlink pilots is enabled, thereby enhancing performance. This heterogeneous design outperforms other homogeneous massive MIMO configurations, demonstrating superior sum capacity while maintaining comparable user-experienced rates. Moreover, it lowers the costs associated with AP installations and reduces signaling overhead for the fronthaul network.</description>

      <title>GSVD-NMF: Recovering Missing Features in Non-negative Matrix Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is an important tool in signal processing and widely used to separate mixed sources into their components. However, NMF is NP-hard and thus may fail to discover the ideal factorization; moreover, the number of components may not be known in advance and thus features may be missed or incompletely separated. To recover missing components from under-complete NMF, we introduce GSVD-NMF, which proposes new components based on the generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) between preliminary NMF results and the SVD of the original matrix. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that GSVD-NMF often recovers missing features from under-complete NMF and helps NMF achieve better local optima.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Multipath Information for Integrated Localization and Sensing via PHD Filtering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15538v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate localization and perception are pivotal for enhancing the safety and reliability of vehicles. However, current localization methods suffer from reduced accuracy when the line-of-sight (LOS) path is obstructed, or a combination of reflections and scatterings is present. In this paper, we present an integrated localization and sensing method that delivers superior performance in complex environments while being computationally efficient. Our method uniformly leverages various types of multipath components (MPCs) through the lens of random finite sets (RFSs), encompassing reflections, scatterings, and their combinations. This advancement eliminates the need for the multipath identification step and streamlines the filtering process by removing the necessity for distinct filters for different multipath types, a requirement that was critical in previous research. The simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of our method in both robustness and effectiveness, particularly in complex environments where the LOS MPC is obscured and in situations involving clutter and missed detection of MPC measurements.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic-array-type current sensors have garnered increasing popularity owing to their notable advantages, including broadband functionality, a large dynamic range, cost-effectiveness, and compact dimensions. However, the susceptibility of the measurement error of one or more magnetic measurement units (MMUs) within the current sensor to drift significantly from the nominal value due to environmental factors poses a potential threat to the measurement accuracy of the current sensor. In light of the need to ensure sustained measurement accuracy over the long term, this paper proposes an innovative self-healing approach rooted in cyber-physics correlation. This approach aims to identify MMUs exhibiting abnormal measurement errors, allowing for the exclusive utilization of the remaining unaffected MMUs in the current measurement process. To achieve this, principal component analysis (PCA) is employed to discern the primary component, arising from fluctuations of the measured current, from the residual component, attributed to the drift in measurement error. This analysis is conducted by scrutinizing the measured data obtained from the MMUs. Subsequently, the squared prediction error (SPE) statistic (also called $Q$ statistic) is deployed to individually identify any MMU displaying abnormal behavior. The experimental results demonstrate the successful online identification of abnormal MMUs without the need for a standard magnetic field sensor. By eliminating the contributions from the identified abnormal MMUs, the accuracy of the current measurement is effectively preserved.</description>

      <title>Spectrum Prediction With Deep 3D Pyramid Vision Transformer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a deep learning (DL)-based task-driven spectrum prediction framework, named DeepSPred. The DeepSPred comprises a feature encoder and a task predictor, where the encoder extracts spectrum usage pattern features, and the predictor configures different networks according to the task requirements to predict future spectrum. Based on the Deep- SPred, we first propose a novel 3D spectrum prediction method combining a flow processing strategy with 3D vision Transformer (ViT, i.e., Swin) and a pyramid to serve possible applications such as spectrum monitoring task, named 3D-SwinSTB. 3D-SwinSTB unique 3D Patch Merging ViT-to-3D ViT Patch Expanding and pyramid designs help the model accurately learn the potential correlation of the evolution of the spectrogram over time. Then, we propose a novel spectrum occupancy rate (SOR) method by redesigning a predictor consisting exclusively of 3D convolutional and linear layers to serve possible applications such as dynamic spectrum access (DSA) task, named 3D-SwinLinear. Unlike the 3D-SwinSTB output spectrogram, 3D-SwinLinear projects the spectrogram directly as the SOR. Finally, we employ transfer learning (TL) to ensure the applicability of our two methods to diverse spectrum services. The results show that our 3D-SwinSTB outperforms recent benchmarks by more than 5%, while our 3D-SwinLinear achieves a 90% accuracy, with a performance improvement exceeding 10%.</description>

      <title>Exact Tensor Completion Powered by Slim Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, a tensor completion problem is studied, which aims to perfectly recover the tensor from partial observations. The existing theoretical guarantee requires the involved transform to be orthogonal, which hinders its applications. In this paper, jumping out of the constraints of isotropy and self-adjointness, the theoretical guarantee of exact tensor completion with arbitrary linear transforms is established by directly operating the tensors in the transform domain. With the enriched choices of transforms, a new analysis obtained by the proof discloses why slim transforms outperform their square counterparts from a theoretical level. Our model and proof greatly enhance the flexibility of tensor completion and extensive experiments validate the superiority of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>On the Impact of Uncertainty and Calibration on Likelihood-Ratio Membership Inference Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a membership inference attack (MIA), an attacker exploits the overconfidence exhibited by typical machine learning models to determine whether a specific data point was used to train a target model. In this paper, we analyze the performance of the state-of-the-art likelihood ratio attack (LiRA) within an information-theoretical framework that allows the investigation of the impact of the aleatoric uncertainty in the true data generation process, of the epistemic uncertainty caused by a limited training data set, and of the calibration level of the target model. We compare three different settings, in which the attacker receives decreasingly informative feedback from the target model: confidence vector (CV) disclosure, in which the output probability vector is released; true label confidence (TLC) disclosure, in which only the probability assigned to the true label is made available by the model; and decision set (DS) disclosure, in which an adaptive prediction set is produced as in conformal prediction. We derive bounds on the advantage of an MIA adversary with the aim of offering insights into the impact of uncertainty and calibration on the effectiveness of MIAs. Simulation results demonstrate that the derived analytical bounds predict well the effectiveness of MIAs.</description>
