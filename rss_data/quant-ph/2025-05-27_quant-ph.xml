      <title>Time Independence Does Not Limit Information Flow. I. The Free-Particle Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The speed of information propagation in long-range interacting quantum systems is limited by Lieb-Robinson-type bounds, whose tightness can be established by finding specific quantum state-transfer protocols. Previous works have given quantum state-transfer protocols that saturate the corresponding Lieb-Robinson bounds using time-dependent Hamiltonians. Are speed limits for quantum information propagation different for time-independent Hamiltonians? In a step towards addressing this question, we present and analyze two optimal time-independent state-transfer protocols for free-particle systems, which utilize continuous-time single-particle quantum walks with hopping strength decaying as a power law. We rigorously prove and numerically confirm that our protocols achieve quantum state transfer, with controllable error over an arbitrarily long distance in any spatial dimension, at the speed limits set by the free-particle Lieb-Robinson bounds. This shows that time independence does not limit information flow for long-range free-particle Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Time independence does not limit information flow. II. The case with ancillas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the impact of locality restrictions on quantum dynamics and algorithmic complexity has been well studied in the general case of time-dependent Hamiltonians, the capabilities of time-independent protocols are less well understood. Using clock constructions, we show that the light cone for time-independent Hamiltonians, as captured by Lieb-Robinson bounds, is the same as that for time-dependent systems when local ancillas are allowed. More specifically, we develop time-independent protocols for approximate quantum state transfer with the same run-times as their corresponding time-dependent protocols. Given any piecewise-continuous Hamiltonian, our construction gives a time-independent Hamiltonian that implements its dynamics in the same time, up to error $\varepsilon$, at the cost of introducing a number of local ancilla qubits for each data qubit that is polylogarithmic in the number of qubits, the norm of the Hamiltonian and its derivative (if it exists), the run time, and $1/\varepsilon$. We apply this construction to state transfer for systems with power-law-decaying interactions and one-dimensional nearest-neighbor systems with disordered interaction strengths. In both cases, this gives time-independent protocols with the same optimal light-cone-saturating run-times as their time-dependent counterparts.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Control via Automatic Control Skips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control of quantum operations is a crucial yet expensive construct for quantum computation. Efficient implementations of controlled operations often avoid applying control to certain subcircuits, which can significantly reduce the number of gates and overall circuit depth. However, these methods are specialized and circuits frequently need to be implemented manually. This paper presents a generic method for finding "skippable" patterns without having to tailor implementations for each algorithm. We prove that finding the optimal operations to be skipped is generally NP-hard. Nevertheless, sub-optimal, polynomial approximation algorithms that find skippable subcircuits can lead to over $50\%$ improvement in circuit metrics for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Chaos and thermalization in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) provides a cornerstone for understanding thermalization in isolated quantum systems, linking quantum chaos with statistical mechanics. In this work, we extend the ETH framework to open quantum systems governed by Lindblad dynamics. We introduce the concept of Liouvillian stripe (spectral subset of the non-Hermitian Liouvillian superoperator) which enables the definition of effective pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians. This construction allows us to conjecture a Liouvillian version of ETH, whereby local superoperators exhibit statistical properties akin to ETH in closed systems. We substantiate our hypothesis using both random Liouvillians and a driven-dissipative quantum spin chain, showing that thermalization manifests through the suppression of coherent oscillations and the emergence of structureless local dynamics. These findings have practical implications for the control and measurement of many-body open quantum systems, highlighting how chaotic dissipative dynamics can obscure the system response to external probes.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Memory Effects in the Dynamics of Two-Level System Defect Ensembles Using Broadband, Cryogenic Transient Dielectric Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-level system defects (TLSs) in dielectrics are believed to be the primary source of decoherence in superconducting circuits. However, the precise origin of these defects, including their atomistic morphology, frequency distributions, and dipole moments, remains relatively unexplored. A significant reason for this lack of understanding is that TLS defects are currently probed with resonators or qubits that require complex multi-stage fabrication processes. These probes are packaged, cooled in a dilution refrigerator, and measured to infer their corresponding coherence times. However, even frequency-tunable probes only gather information about TLS defects within their mode volume and a narrow bandwidth around their resonance frequency. As a result, a detailed understanding of the atomistic origins of TLS defects in isolated materials and interfaces is currently lacking, making it challenging to design the next generation of superconducting devices and dielectric materials from first principles. Here, we introduce a novel approach that enables probing the cryogenic dielectric response of TLS defect ensembles using a broadband 3D waveguide. This technique provides evidence of memory effects in the dynamics of TLS defect ensembles that may enable the extraction of critical information about the origins of the underlying TLS defects and their interactions. Importantly, this novel spectroscopy technique can be used at all stages of fabrication and ultimately inform mitigation strategies to reduce the impact of TLS defects on superconducting circuits. As a result, this technique will help usher in a new understanding of the atomistic origin of TLS defects, which will have profound consequences for quantum information science and the broader materials science community.</description>

      <title>Non-Clifford gates between stabilizer codes via non-Abelian topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose protocols to implement non-Clifford logical gates between stabilizer codes by entangling into a non-Abelian topological order as an intermediate step. Generalizing previous approaches, we provide a framework that generates a large class of non-Clifford and non-diagonal logical gates between qudit surface codes by gauging the topological symmetry of symmetry-enriched topological orders. As our main example, we concretely detail a protocol that utilizes the quantum double of $S_3$ to generate a controlled-charge conjugation ($C\mathcal{C}$) gate between a qubit and qutrit surface code. Both the preparation of non-Abelian states and logical state injection between the Abelian and non-Abelian codes are executed via finite-depth quantum circuits with measurement and feedforward. We discuss aspects of the fault-tolerance of our protocol, presenting insights on how to construct a heralded decoder for the quantum double of $S_3.$ We also outline how analogous protocols can be used to obtain logical gates between qudit surface codes by entangling into $\mathcal{D}(G),$ where $G$ is a semidirect product of Abelian groups. This work serves as a step towards classifying the computational power of non-Abelian quantum phases beyond the paradigm of anyon braiding on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Towards a Quantum-classical Augmented Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past decade, several small-scale quantum key distribution networks have been established. However, the deployment of large-scale quantum networks depends on the development of quantum repeaters, quantum channels, quantum memories, and quantum network protocols. To improve the security of existing networks and adopt currently feasible quantum technologies, the next step is to augment classical networks with quantum devices, properties, and phenomena. To achieve this, we propose a change in the structure of the HTTP protocol such that it can carry both quantum and classical payload. This work lays the foundation for dividing one single network packet into classical and quantum payloads depending on the privacy needs. We implement logistic regression, CNN, LSTM, and BiLSTM models to classify the privacy label for outgoing communications. This enables reduced utilization of quantum resources allowing for a more efficient secure quantum network design. Experimental results using the proposed methods are presented.</description>

      <title>Improving variational counterdiabatic driving with weighted actions and computer algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational counterdiabatic (CD) driving is a disciplined and widely used method to robustly control quantum many-body systems by mimicking adiabatic processes with high fidelity and reduced duration. Central to this technique is a universal structure of the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP) over a parameterized Hamiltonian. Here, we reveal that introducing a new degree of freedom into the theory of the AGP can significantly improve variational CD driving. Specifically, we find that the algebraic characterization of the AGP is not unique, and we exploit this non-uniqueness to develop the weighted variational method for deriving a refined driving protocol. This approach extends the conventional method in two aspects: it effectively incorporates nonlocal information, and it assigns customized weights to matrix elements relevant to specific problems. We also develop an efficient numerical algorithm to compute the refined driving protocol using computer algebra. Our framework is broadly applicable, as it can replace almost all previous uses of variational CD driving. We demonstrate its practicality by applying it to adiabatic evolution along the ground state of a parameterized Hamiltonian. This proposal outperforms the conventional method in terms of fidelity, as confirmed by extensive numerical simulations on quantum Ising models.</description>

      <title>State Engineering of Unsteerable Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lindbladian dynamics of open systems may be employed to steer a many-body system towards a non-trivial ground state of a local Hamiltonian. Such protocols provide us with tunable platforms facilitating the engineering and study of non-trivial many-body states. Steering towards a degenerate ground state manifold provides us with a protected platform to employ many-body states as a resource for quantum information processing. Notably, ground states of frustrated local Hamiltonians have been known not to be amenable to steering protocols. Revisiting this intricate physics we report two new results: (i) we find a broad class of (geometrically) frustrated local Hamiltonians for which steering of the ground state manifold is possible through a sequence of discrete steering steps. Following the steering dynamics, states within the degenerate ground-state manifold keep evolving in a non-stationary manner. (ii) For the class of Hamiltonians with ground states which are non-steerable through local superoperators, we derive a "glass floor" on how close to the ground state one can get implementing a steering protocol. This is expressed invoking the concept of cooling-by-steering (a lower bound of the achievable temperature), or through an upper bound of the achievable fidelity. Our work provides a systematic outline for studying quantum state manipulation of a broad class of strongly correlated states.</description>

      <title>The Lie Algebra of XY-mixer Topologies and Warm Starting QAOA for Constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The XY-mixer has widespread utilization in modern quantum computing, including in variational quantum algorithms, such as Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA). The XY ansatz is particularly useful for solving Cardinality Constrained Optimization tasks, a large class of important NP-hard problems. First, we give explicit decompositions of the dynamical Lie algebras (DLAs) associated with a variety of $XY$-mixer topologies. When these DLAs admit simple Lie algebra decompositions, they are efficiently trainable. An example of this scenario is a ring $XY$-mixer with arbitrary $R_Z$ gates. Conversely, when we allow for all-to-all $XY$-mixers or include $R_{ZZ}$ gates, the DLAs grow exponentially and are no longer efficiently trainable.
  We provide numerical simulations showcasing these concepts on Portfolio Optimization, Sparsest $k$-Subgraph, and Graph Partitioning problems. These problems correspond to exponentially-large DLAs and we are able to warm-start these optimizations by pre-training on polynomial-sized DLAs by restricting the gate generators. This results in improved convergence to high quality optima of the original task, providing dramatic performance benefits in terms of solution sampling and approximation ratio on optimization tasks for both shared angle and multi-angle QAOA.</description>

      <title>Continuous quantum correction on Markovian and Non-Markovian models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate continuous quantum error correction, comparing performance under a Markovian error model to two distinct non-Markovian models. The first non-Markovian model involves an interaction Hamiltonian between the system and an environmental qubit via an X-X coupling, with a "cooling" bath acting on the environment qubit. This model is known to exhibit abrupt transitions between Markovian and non-Markovian behavior. The second non-Markovian model uses the post-Markovian master equation (PMME), which represents the bath correlation through a memory kernel; we consider an exponentially decaying kernel and both underdamped and overdamped dynamics. We systematically compare these non-Markovian error models against the Markovian case and against each other, for a variety of different codes. We start with a single qubit, which can be solved analytically. We then consider the three-qubit repetition code and the five-qubit "perfect" code. In all cases, we find that the fidelity decays more rapidly in the Markovian case than in either non-Markovian model, suggesting that continuous quantum error correction has enhanced performance against non-Markovian noise. We attribute this difference to the presence of a quantum Zeno regime in both non-Markovian models.</description>

      <title>Provably Robust Training of Quantum Circuit Classifiers Against Parameter Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in quantum computing have spurred significant interest in harnessing its potential for speedups over classical systems. However, noise remains a major obstacle to achieving reliable quantum algorithms. In this work, we present a provably noise-resilient training theory and algorithm to enhance the robustness of parameterized quantum circuit classifiers. Our method, with a natural connection to Evolutionary Strategies, guarantees resilience to parameter noise with minimal adjustments to commonly used optimization algorithms. Our approach is function-agnostic and adaptable to various quantum circuits, successfully demonstrated in quantum phase classification tasks. By developing provably guaranteed optimization theory with quantum circuits, our work opens new avenues for practical, robust applications of near-term quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Disparity between multipartite entangling and disentangling powers of unitaries: Even vs Odd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare the multipartite entangling and disentangling powers of unitary operators by assessing their ability to generate or eliminate genuine multipartite entanglement. Our findings reveal that while diagonal unitary operators can exhibit equal entangling and disentangling powers, certain non-diagonal unitaries demonstrate an imbalance when acting on fully separable states, thereby extending the known disparity from bipartite systems to those with any number of parties. Counterintuitively, we construct classes of unitaries and their adjoints that display unequal entanglement generation capacities, behaving differently when applied to systems with an even number of qubits compared to those with an odd number. Further, we illustrate that this asymmetry can be simulated using physically realizable Hamiltonians: systems with an even number of qubits employ nearest-neighbor Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions, while those with an odd number utilize a combination of Heisenberg and DM interactions. Additionally, we present a circuit composed of random noncommuting unitaries, constructed from alternating layers of two-qubit Haar-random gates, to illustrate the discrepancy in the entangling and disentangling capabilities of unitaries.</description>

      <title>Coherence as a resource for phase estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum phase estimation is a core problem in quantum technologies ranging from metrology to quantum computing, where phase estimation is a key subroutine in various algorithms. Here, we quantitatively connect the performance of phase estimation protocols with quantum coherence. To achieve this, we construct and characterize resource theories of quantum networks that cannot generate coherence. Given multiple copies of a unitary encoding an unknown phase and a fixed coherent state, we estimate the phase using such networks. For a unified and general approach, we assess the quality of the estimate using a generic cost function that penalizes deviations from the true value. We determine the minimal average cost that can be achieved in this manner and explicitly derive optimal protocols. From this we construct a family of coherence measures that directly connect a state's coherence with its value for phase estimation, demonstrating that every bit of coherence helps. This establishes coherence as an essential resource for phase estimation and, thus, for any quantum technology relying on it as a subroutine.</description>

Abstract: We propose and analyze a hierarchical quantum error correction (QEC) scheme that concatenates hypergraph product (HGP) codes with rotated surface codes to achieve fault-tolerant quantum computation on planar architectures with only nearest-neighbor interactions. The upper layer employs (3,4)-random HGP codes, known for their constant encoding rate and favorable distance scaling, while the lower layer consists of a rotated surface code with distance 5, allowing hardware compatibility through lattice surgery. To address the decoding bottleneck, we utilize a soft-decision decoding strategy that combines belief propagation with ordered statistics (BP-OS) decoding, enhanced by a syndrome-conditioned logical error probability computed via a tailored lookup table for the lower layer. Numerical simulations under a code capacity noise model demonstrate that our hierarchical codes achieve logical error suppression below the threshold. Furthermore, we derive explicit conditions under which the proposed codes surpass surface codes in both qubit efficiency and error rate. In particular, for the size parameter $s \geq 4$ (which corresponds to 16 logical qubits) and the distance $d\geq 25$, our construction outperforms the rotated surface code in practical regimes with physical error rates around or less than $10^{-2}$. These results suggest that concatenated qLDPC-surface architectures offer a scalable and resource-efficient path toward near-term fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Universal quantum control by non-Hermitian Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional manipulations over quantum system, e.g., coherent population trapping and unidirectional transfer, focus on the Hamiltonian engineering while regarding the system's manifold geometry and constraint equation as secondary causes. Here we treat them on equal footing in controlling a finite-dimensional quantum system under a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, which is inspired by the d'Alembert's principle for the active force, the constraint force, and the inertial force. The non-Hermitian Hamiltonian could be triangularized in a constraint picture spanned by a set of completed and orthonormal basis states, that is found to be a sufficient condition to construct at least one universal nonadiabatic passage in both bra and ket spaces. The passage ends up with a desired target state that is automatically normalized with no artificial normalization used in the existing treatments for non-Hermitian quantum systems. Our construction is explicitly demonstrated for the perfect population transfer in the two-level system and the cyclic population transfer in the three-level system. This theory substantially generalizes our framework of universal quantum control to the regime of non-Hermitian quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear optical analogues of quantum phase transitions in a squeezing-enhanced LMG model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate nonlinear optical analogues of quantum phase transitions within a squeezing-enhanced generalized Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model, focusing on excited-state quantum phase transitions in optical fibers with tetragonal symmetry. Our analysis reveals a novel squeezing effect that induces classical bifurcations in polarization dynamics, even without a linear rotor-like term. By mapping the nonlinear polarization dynamics to the generalized LMG model, we establish a direct correspondence between optical bifurcations and quantum critical phenomena, uncovering geometric gauge structures akin to Berry-like phases. These findings highlight the interplay between classical and quantum behaviors in optical systems, offering a versatile platform for studying quantum many-body physics with applications in quantum metrology and simulation.</description>

      <title>On the time-dependent Born-Oppenheimer Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the time-dependent Born-Oppenheimer approximation (BOA) of a classical quantum molecule involving a possibly large number of nuclei and electrons, described by a Schr\"odinger equation. In the spirit of Born and Oppenheimer's original idea we study quantitatively the approximation of the molecular evolution. We obtain an iterable approximation of the molecular evolution to arbitrary order and we derive an effective equation for the reduced dynamics involving the nuclei equivalent to the original Schr\"odinger equation and containing no electron variables. We estimate the coefficients of the new equation and find tractable approximations for the molecular dynamics going beyond the one corresponding to the original Born and Oppenheimer approximation.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of elastic wave equations via Schr\"odingerisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study quantum simulation algorithms on the elastic wave equations using the Schr\"odingerisation method. The Schr\"odingerisation method transforms any linear PDEs into a system of Schr\"odinger-type PDEs -with unitary evolution-using the warped phase transformation that maps the equations in one higher dimension. This makes them suitable for quantum simulations. We expore the application in two forms of the elastic wave equations. For the velocity-stress equation in isotropic media, we explore the symmetric matrix form under the external forcing via Schr\"odingerisation combined with spectral method. For problems with variable medium parameters, we apply Schr\"odingerisation method based on the staggered grid method to simulate velocity and stress fields, and give the complexity estimates. For the wave displacement equation, we transform it into a hyperbolic system and apply the Schr\"odingerisation method, which is then discretized by the spectral method and central difference scheme. Details of the quantum algorithms will be provided, along with the complexity analysis which demontrate exponential quantum advantage in space dimensin over the classical algorithms.</description>

      <title>Tunable Entanglement of Multi-Level Atoms in Photonic Crystals: Leveraging Resonant Dipole Interactions and Quantum Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of entanglement dynamics in multi-level V-type atomic systems embedded within PC cavities. We mainly focus on the synergistic roles of resonant dipole-dipole interactions and quantum interference through analytical modeling and numerical simulations using the Schrodinger equation. In our analysis, we show that resonant dipole-dipole interactions and quantum interference serve as potent tools for tuning and stabilizing entanglement in structured photonic environments. Key findings reveal that resonant interaction dominates when interatomic distances align with the localization length of photonic bound states induced by bandgap which enables coherent coupling via evanescent fields. The entanglement is preserved for extended times when dipoles of each atom are aligned parallel or anti-parallel while a novel oscillatory entanglement mechanism emerges from orthogonally aligned atomic dipoles. It is mainly driven by destructive interference between vacuum-mediated pathways and bandgap-engineered photonic density of states. This mechanism exhibits non-Markovian dynamics, including delayed feedback and entanglement revival. We further demonstrate that positioning the atomic excited states deeper within the photonic bandgap accelerates the decay of entanglement oscillations due to the exponential suppression of resonant energy exchange mediated by evanescent modes.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate quantum teleportation of a qutrit system using a complete set of two-qutrit entangled states obtained from the representation theory of the SU(3) group. All measurement gates essential for end-to-end teleportation are systematically evaluated, and these are found to be non-unitary. Our approach extends Bennett's teleportation protocol to the qutrit system with minimal modifications, preserving operational simplicity and underscoring the necessity of non-unitary measurement operators in high-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum phase transition in a 2D atomic Bose gas with a g-wave Feshbach resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent repoet on the formation of two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of spinning g-wave molecules is surprise. Here we study quantum phase transition in the quasi-2D atomic Bose gas with a g-wave Feshbach resonance, and show that there are two phase transitions in this system: from a phase with only a atomic Bose-Einstein condensate to a phase with coexistence of atomic and molecular condensation and from the coexistence phase to a phase with only a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate. We show that the g-wave resonance Feshbach has two features in the phase transitions, a phase with only a atomic Bose-Einstein condensate is no longer forbidden and resonance effects appear only at levels beyond the mean-field. We determine the T=0 beyond mean-field phase diagram of the gas as a function of magnetic field and molecular condensation density. We also detemine the ratio of atomic to molecular condensation in the coexistence phase, which can be tested in experiments.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian effects on the quantum parameter estimation in pseudo-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) is a fundamental quantity in quantum parameter estimation theory, characterizing the ultimate precision bound of parameter estimation. In this work, we investigate QFI for quantum states in non-Hermitian systems. By employing the projected Hilbert space method and spectral decomposition, we derive an explicit expression for the QFI in terms of the density matrix and parameter generators. This formulation not only recovers the well-known results in the Hermitian case but also captures the non-Hermitian effects induced by the time-dependent norm of the state. To validate our theoretical framework, we analyze a single-qubit pseudo-Hermitian system and apply Naimark dilation theory to embed it into an equivalent Hermitian system. The comparison between the original and dilated systems demonstrates the consistency and applicability of the proposed QFI formula in non-Hermitian settings. In addition, we investigate a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric system to further explore the influence of non-Hermiticity on QFI. Our findings offer a new perspective for analyzing and enhancing QFI in non-Hermitian systems, paving the way for promising applications in non-Hermitian quantum metrology and sensing.</description>

      <title>Running a six-qubit quantum circuit on a silicon spin qubit array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simplicity of encoding a qubit in the state of a single electron spin and the potential for their integration into industry-standard microchips continue to drive the field of semiconductor-based quantum computing. However, after decades of progress, validating universal logic in these platforms has advanced little beyond first-principles demonstrations of meeting the DiVincenzo criteria. Case in point, and specifically for silicon-based quantum dots, three-qubit algorithms have been the upper limit to date, despite the availability of devices containing more qubits. In this work, we fully exploit the capacity of a spin-qubit array and implement a six qubit quantum circuit, the largest utilizing semiconductor quantum technology. By programming the quantum processor, we execute quantum circuits across all permutations of three, four, five, and six neighbouring qubits, demonstrating successful programmable multi-qubit operation throughout the array. The results reveal that, despite the high quality of individual units, errors quickly accumulate when combining all of them in a quantum circuit. This work highlights the necessity to minimize idling times through simultaneous operations, boost dephasing times, and consistently improve state preparation and measurement fidelities.</description>

      <title>Sensing single molecule magnets with nitrogen vacancy centers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-molecule magnets (SMMs) are molecules that can function as tiny magnets, with potential applications such as magnetic memory bits in storage devices. Current research and development of SMMs have shown their ability to maintain magnetization for a considerable amount of time at low temperatures. However, in magnetic memory applications, the molecules would probably be on a surface at room temperature, and characterizing SMMs under these conditions is challenging and requires specialized techniques. To this end, we use the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond, which can function as a highly sensitive sensor of magnetic fields in a broad frequency range at the nanoscale. Here, we utilize single NVs to detect the magnetic noise of cobalt-based SMMs' placed on the diamond surface. We investigated the noise at 296K and at 5-8K, observing a significant influence of the SMMs on the NV center relaxation times at the different temperatures from which we infer their magnetic properties - their magnetic noise spectrum density (NSD). Moreover, we witnessed the effect of an applied magnetic field on the SMMs' magnetic NSD. The method is useful in characterizing SMMs as memory units on surfaces.</description>

      <title>Universal dissipators for driven open quantum systems and the correction to linear response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate in parallel two common pictures used to describe quantum systems interacting with their surrounding environment, i.e., the stochastic Hamiltonian description, where the environment is implicitly included in the fluctuating internal parameters of the system, and the explicit inclusion of the environment via the time-convolutionless projection operator method. Utilizing these two different frameworks, we show that the dissipator characterizing the dynamics of the reduced system, determined up to second order in the noise strength or bath-system coupling, is universal. That is, it keeps the same form regardless of the drive term, as long as the drive is weak. We thoroughly discuss the assumptions on which this treatment is based and its limitations. By considering the first non-vanishing higher-order term in our expansion, we also derive the linear response correction due to memory-mediated environmental effects in driven-dissipative systems. We demonstrate this technique to be highly accurate for the problems of dephasing in a driven qubit and for the theory of pseudomodes for quantum environments.</description>

Abstract: High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems are the most powerful tools that we currently have to solve complex scientific simulations. Quantum computing (QC) has the potential to enhance HPC systems by accelerating the execution of specific kernels that can be offloaded to a Quantum Processing Unit (QPU), granting them new capabilities, improving the speed of computation, or reducing energy consumption. In this paper, we present QMIO: a state-of-the-art hybrid HPCQC system, which tightly integrates HPC and QC. We describe its hardware and software components, the integration middleware, and the lessons learned during the design, implementation, and operation of the system.</description>

      <title>Effect of noise and topologies on multi-photon quantum protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum-augmented networks aim to use quantum phenomena to improve detection and protection against malicious actors in a classical communication network. This may include multiplexing quantum signals into classical fiber optical channels and incorporating purely quantum links alongside classical links in the network. In such hybrid networks, quantum protocols based on single photons become a bottleneck for transmission distances and data speeds, thereby reducing entire network performance. Furthermore, many of the security assumptions of the single-photon protocols do not hold up in practice because of the impossibility of manufacturing single-photon emitters. Multi-photon quantum protocols, on the other hand, are designed to operate under practical assumptions and do not require single photon emitters. As a result, they provide higher levels of security guarantees and longer transmission distances. However, the effect of channel and device noise on multiphoton protocols in terms of security, transmission distances, and bit rates has not been investigated. In this paper, we focus on channel noise and present our observations on the effect of various types of noise on multi-photon protocols. We also investigate the effect of topologies such as ring, star, and torus on the noise characteristics of the multi-photon protocols. Our results show the possible advantages of switching to multi-photon protocols and give insights into the repeater placement and topology choice for quantum-augmented networks.</description>

      <title>Spin-qubit readout analysis based on a Hidden Markov Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Across most qubit platforms, the readout fidelities do not keep up with the gate fidelities, and new ways to increase the readout fidelities are searched for. For semiconductor spin qubits, a typical qubit-readout signal consists of a finite stretch of a digitized charge-sensor output. Such a signal trace is usually analyzed by compressing it into a single value, either maximum or sum. The binary measurement result follows by comparing the single value to a decision threshold fixed in advance. This threshold method, while simple and fast, omits information that could potentially improve the readout fidelity. Here, we analyze what can be achieved by more sophisticated signal-trace processing using the Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The HMM is a natural choice, being the optimal statistical processing if the noise is white. It also has a computationally efficient implementation, known as the forward-backward algorithm, making HMM processing practical. However, unlike in many computer-simulation studies, in real experiments the noise is correlated. How this change affects the HMM implementation and reliability is our subject. We find that the HMM using white noise as the system statistical model is surprisingly sensitive to correlations; it only tolerates very small correlation times. We suggest alleviating this deficiency by a signal pre-filtering. The correlations have a similar strongly negative impact on the HMM model calibration (the Baum-Welch algorithm). Besides studying the effects of noise correlations, as a specific application of the HMM we calculate the readout fidelity at elevated temperatures, relevant to recent experimental pursuits of `hot' spin qubits.</description>

      <title>Experimental Approaches to Distinguishing Quantum Collapse from Unitary Evolution: A Weak Measurement Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an experiment designed to distinguish between competing interpretations of quantum mechanics: those that involve wave function collapse and those that assume purely unitary evolution. The experiment tests whether an observer can measure a system without collapsing its wave function.
  To this end, we introduce the concept of an unconscious observer, defined by two criteria: (1) It measures a quantum system and sets the state of another system based on the result. (2) It allows an external experimentalist to infer the measurement outcome by examining the observer's state. The more distinguishable the observer's resulting states, the more it resembles a conventional measurement apparatus. Using weak measurements, the experimentalist probes these states, thereby testing the second criterion.
  The interference patterns observed in this setup reveal whether collapse has occurred, allowing experimental discrimination between collapse-based and unitary interpretations.</description>

      <title>Matrix-product-state approach for qubits-waveguide systems in real space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a matrix-product-state-based numerical approach for simulating systems composed of several qubits and a common one-dimensional waveguide. In the presented approach, the one-dimensional waveguide is modeled in real space. Thus, one can use the advantage of matrix-product states that are suited for simulating low-entangled one-dimensional systems. The price to pay is that the vacuum of the waveguide in this modeling becomes the Bogoliubov vacuum, and one has to consider a not-so-small local Hilbert space for bosonic degrees of freedom. To manage the large local Hilbert space, we adopt the recently proposed single-site schemes. We demonstrate the potential of the presented approach by simulating superradiant phenomena within the Hamiltonian dynamics.</description>

      <title>Simple finite-dimensional model of the metastable state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have constructed an approximate analytical solution of the spectral problem for a finite-dimensional matrix of a special kind, which turns out to be a very simple and quite satisfactory model of the metastable state. Most of the characteristic properties of the metastable state are reproduced: line shape, decay dynamics, and density of states. The correctness of the approximate analytical solution was verified by direct numerical calculations. The proposed model is a finite-dimensional analog of the Fano formalism.</description>

      <title>Self-testing in a constrained prepare-measure scenario sans assuming quantum dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a device-independent (DI) self-testing protocol in a constrained prepare-measure scenario, based on the $n-$bit parity-oblivious multiplexing (POM) task. In this scenario, a parity-oblivious constraint is imposed on the preparations, allowing us to define a classical bound derived from a preparation noncontextual ontological model. We derive the optimal quantum success probability in the POM task devoid of assuming the dimension of the quantum system, an essential step towards DI self-testing, which has hitherto not been demonstrated in prepare-measure scenario. We demonstrate that the optimal quantum value exceeds preparation noncontextual bound and, as a result, this establishes DI self-testing of the preparations and the measurement devices. Furthermore, by explicitly constructing the required unitaries, we show that the optimal preparations and measurements in an unknown but finite dimensional Hilbert space, responsible for the observed input-output correlations, can be mapped, via an unitary, onto a known finite-dimensional quantum system. Our results thus pave the way for scalable, single system based DI certification protocols in the prepare-measure scenario.</description>

      <title>Catability as a metric for evaluating superposed coherent states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superposed coherent states are central to quantum technologies, yet their reliable identification remains a challenge, especially in noisy or resource-constrained settings. We introduce a novel, directly measurable criterion for detecting cat-like features in quantum states, rooted in the concept of nonlinear squeezing. This approach bypasses the need for full state tomography and reveals structure where fidelity fails. The numerical results confirm its robustness under loss and its potential for experimental implementation. The method naturally generalizes to more exotic superpositions, including multiheaded cat states.</description>

      <title>Sensing high-frequency AC fields via a two-qubit probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum sensors allow us to measure weak oscillating fields with incredible precision. One common approach is to use the time evolution of a single two-level system in conjunction with applied control pulses to measure the oscillating field. For high-frequency fields, the time interval required between the applied pulses decreases, meaning that errors due to the finite width of the pulses can become important. This paper presents an alternative scheme that does not rely on applying pulses with short time intervals. Our scheme uses two interacting two-level systems. In the presence of an oscillating field, the interaction strength changes. The oscillating field can be estimated by measuring the change in this interaction strength. We quantify the precision of this estimate by calculating the Fisher information. We show the effect of noise on our scheme and discuss how control pulses can be applied to mitigate the impact of noise. Importantly, the time interval between these pulses need not be very short.</description>

      <title>Truncated Variational Hamiltonian Ansatz: efficient quantum circuit design for quantum chemistry and material science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize quantum chemistry and material science by offering solutions to complex problems unattainable with classical computers. However, the development of efficient quantum algorithms that are efficient under noisy conditions remains a major challenge. This paper introduces the truncated Variational Hamiltonian Ansatz (tVHA), a novel circuit design for conducting quantum calculations on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. tVHA provides a promising approach for a broad range of applications by utilizing principles from the adiabatic theorem in solid state physics. Our proposed ansatz significantly reduces the parameter count and can decrease circuit size substantially, with a trade-off in accuracy. Thus, tVHA facilitates easier convergence within the variational quantum eigensolver framework compared to state-of-the-art ans\"atze such as Unitary Coupled Cluster (UCC) and Hardware-Efficient Ansatz (HEA). While this paper concentrates on the practical applications of tVHA in quantum chemistry, demonstrating its suitability for both weakly and strongly correlated systems and its compatibility with active space calculations, its underlying principles suggest a wider applicability extending to the broader field of material science computations on quantum computing platforms.</description>

      <title>Quantum computing of magnetic-skyrmion-like patterns in Heisenberg ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We diagonalize the quantum two-dimensional spin-1/2 Heisenberg model with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) by applying the variational quantum eigensolver, running on a quantum-computer simulator, which turns out to be a more efficient approach than a classical direct diagonalization for systems with more than 17 sites. The calculated external-magnetic-field dependence of the total energy, of the magnetization, as well as of the topological charge exhibits a distinctive discontinuity which hints for the existence of zero-temperature magnetic skyrmions-like structures at the quantum level, controlled by the combination of the exchange-coupling and the DMI parameters. The potentially measurable jump in the magnetization upon changing the field indicates the investigated objects as stable enough for eventual applications in spintronics or even as information carriers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $[[n,k,d]]$ quantum maximum-distance-separable code maps $k$ source qudits to $n$ coded qudits such that any $n-(d-1)$ coded qudits may recover all source qudits and $n = k + 2 (d-1)$. The entropy of the joint state of the reference system of $k$ qudits and the $n$ coded qudits is fully characterized - the joint state must be pure, i.e., has entropy zero; and any sub-system whose number of qudits is at most half of $k+n$, the total number of qudits in the joint state must be maximally mixed, i.e., has entropy equal to its size.</description>

      <title>Spinor Bose-Einstein condensate as an analog simulator of molecular bending vibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) can be operated as an analog simulator of the two-dimensional vibron model. This algebraic model for the description of bending and stretching vibrations of molecules, in the case of a triatomic molecules, exhibits two phases where linear and bent configurations are stabilised. Spinor BECs can be engineered to simulate states that correspond to linear or bent triatomic molecules, with the BEC's Wigner function encoding information about the molecular configuration. We show how quantum simulations of the bending dynamics of linear molecules can be realized, and how the straightening of a bent molecule leads to a dynamical instability. In the dynamics triggered by the corresponding instability, a significant amount of entanglement is generated, and we characterise the dynamics with the squeezing parameter and the quantum Fisher information (QFI). The scaling of the non-Gaussian sensitivity, described by the difference between squeezing and QFI, grows with the system size once the spinor system crosses from the linear to the bent phase, thus serving as a dynamical witness for the quantum phase transition.</description>

      <title>Tight Generalization of Robertson-Type Uncertainty Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the tightest possible Robertson-type preparation uncertainty relation, which explicitly depends on the eigenvalue spectrum of the quantum state. The conventional constant 1/4 is replaced by a state-dependent coefficient with the largest and smallest eigenvalues of the density operator. This coefficient is optimal among all Robertson-type generalizations and does not admit further improvement. Our relation becomes more pronounced as the quantum state becomes more mixed, capturing a trade-off in quantum uncertainty that the conventional Robertson relation fails to detect. In addition, our result provides a strict generalization of the Schroedinger uncertainty relation, showing that the uncertainty trade-off is governed by the sum of the covariance term and a state-dependent improvement over the Robertson bound. As applications, we also refine error-disturbance trade-offs by incorporating spectral information of both the system and the measuring apparatus, thereby generalizing the Arthurs-Goodman and Ozawa inequalities.</description>

      <title>Robust quantification of spectral transitions in perturbed quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum system subject to an external perturbation can experience leakage between uncoupled regions of its energy spectrum separated by a gap. To quantify this phenomenon, we present two complementary results. First, we establish time-independent bounds on the distances between the true dynamics and the dynamics generated by block-diagonal effective evolutions constructed via the Schrieffer-Wolff and Bloch methods. Second, we prove that, under the right conditions, this leakage remains small eternally. That is, we derive a time-independent bound on the leakage itself, expressed in terms of the spectral gap of the unperturbed Hamiltonian and the norm of the perturbation, ensuring its validity for arbitrarily large times. Our approach only requires a finite spectral gap, thus accommodating continuous and unbounded spectra. Finally, we apply our bounds to specific systems of practical interest.</description>

      <title>Robust self-testing and certified randomness based on chained Bell inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-testing is the strongest certification procedure that uniquely characterizes the physical system based on the observed statistics, without any knowledge of the inner workings of the devices. The optimal quantum violation of a Bell inequality enables such a device-independent (DI) self-testing of the source and the measurement devices. In this work, we demonstrate the DI self-testing based on the chained Bell inequality. We devise an elegant sum-of-squares (SOS) technique enabling dimension-independent optimization of the quantum violation. Our approach enables the derivation of the state along with the relationship between the local observables directly from the optimization condition. This improves the previous methods of self-testing by deriving the state from the self-testing relation instead of assuming that the state is restricted to a two-qubit system. One significant aspect is the robustness of such self-testing in real experimental situations involving noise and imperfection, leading to deviation from the optimal quantum violation. We provide an analytical technique for robust self-testing in the presence of noise. As an application of our scheme, we demonstrate the generation of two bit DI randomness and analyze the robustness of such randomness.</description>

      <title>High entanglement regimes in the Weisskopf-Wigner theory for spontaneous decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we review the Weisskopf-Wigner formalism for spontaneous emission considering the spatial modes of light as well as external atomic degrees of freedom which we introduce in the theory by modeling the atom as a wavepacket in momentum space with a given initial uncertainty. We perform a purity calculation in order to quantify the entanglement encoded in the momentum variables of the atom-photon system. Our purity calculations reveal two high entanglement regimes depending on the initial atomic momentum uncertainty: $1)$ the Recoil entanglement regime (which arises in the small momentum uncertainty region) where recoil effects dominate the mechanisms that originate entanglement, and $2)$ the Doppler entanglement regime (in the large momentum uncertainty region) where homogeneous Doppler shifts in the emitted photon's frequency play the fundamental part in the build up of quantum correlations in the system. Physical considerations are made to explain the nature of each entanglement regime as well as provide their respective thresholds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unitary quantum gates constitute the building blocks of Quantum Computing in the circuit paradigm. In this work, we engineer a locally driven two-qubit Hamiltonian whose instantaneous ground-state dynamics generates the controlled-NOT (CNOT) quantum gate. In practice, quantum gates have to be implemented in finite-time, hence non-adiabatic and external noise effects debilitate gate fidelities. Here, we show that counterdiabatic control can restore gate performance with near perfect fidelities even in open quantum systems subject to decoherence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the performance of an adiabatic evolution protocol when initialized from a Gibbs state at finite temperature. Specifically, we identify the diagonality of the final state in the energy eigenbasis, as well as the difference in energy and in energy variance with respect to the ideal adiabatic limit as key benchmarks for success and introduce metrics to quantify the off-diagonal contributions. Provided these benchmarks converge to their ideal adiabatic values, we argue that thermal expectation values of observables can be recovered, in accordance with the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. For the transverse-field Ising model, we analytically establish that these benchmarks converge polynomially in both the quasi-adiabatic evolution time $T$ and system size. We perform numerical studies on non-integrable systems and find close quantitative agreement for the off-diagonality metrics, along with qualitatively similar behavior in the energy convergence.</description>

      <title>Thermalization in open many-body systems and KMS detailed balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from a microscopic description of weak system-bath interactions, we derive from first principles a quantum master equation that does not rely on the well-known rotating wave approximation. This includes generic many-body systems, with Hamiltonians with vanishingly small energy spacings that forbid that approximation. The equation satisfies a general form of detailed balance, called KMS, which ensures exact convergence to the many-body Gibbs state. Unlike the more common notion of GNS detailed balance, this notion is compatible with the absence of the rotating wave approximation. We show that the resulting Lindbladian dynamics not only reproduces the thermal equilibrium point, but also approximates the true system evolution with an error that grows at most linearly in time, giving an exponential improvement upon previous estimates. This master equation has quasi-local jump operators, can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer, and reduces to the usual Davies dynamics in the limit. With it, we provide a rigorous model of many-body thermalization relevant to both open quantum systems and quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Line search by quantum logic spectroscopy enhanced with squeezing and statistical tests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum logic spectroscopy, internal transitions of trapped ions and molecules can be probed by detecting the motional displacement caused by an applied light field of variable frequency. This provides a solution to ``needle in a haystack'' problems, such as the search for narrow clock transitions in highly charged ions, recently discussed by S. Chen et al. (Phys. Rev. Applied 22, 054059). The main bottleneck is the search speed over a frequency bandwitdh, which can be increased by enhancing the sensitivity of displacement detection. In this work, we explore two complementary improvements: the use of squeezed motional states and optimal statistical postprocessing of data using a hypothesis testing framework. We demonstrate that each method independently provides a substantial boost to scan speed. Their combination effectively mitigates state preparation and measurement errors, improving the scan speed by an order of magnitude and fully leveraging the quantum enhancement offered by squeezing.</description>

      <title>Classical-to-quantum transfer of geometric phase for non-interferometric phase measurement and manipulation of quantum state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometric phase, originating from the cyclic evolution of a state, such as polarization on the Poincar\'e sphere, is typically measured through interferometric approaches that often include unwanted contributions from the dynamic phase. Here, we present a non-interferometric technique based on quantum correlation of pair photons to measure the geometric phase of a classical beam. The transfer of geometric phase of the classical pump beam arising from the cyclic evolution of its polarization state on the Poincar\'e sphere onto the polarization-entangled pair photons generated via spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a Sagnac interferometer enables easy control over the quantum state. Characterization of the generated quantum states reveals that the geometric phase of the pump beam controls the coincidence counts, entanglement visibility, Bell's parameter, quantum state tomography, and fidelity in close agreement with theoretical predictions. We observe sinusoidal modulation of the Bell's parameter and state fidelity with changes in the geometric phase, resulting in transitions between orthogonal Bell states and Bell-like maximally entangled states. Our results establish the geometric phase of the classical pump as a tunable parameter for quantum state control, offering a compact, passive platform for phase manipulation in quantum photonic systems, enabling geometric phase-based quantum gates, and compensating unwanted phase acquired by the quantum state on propagation.</description>

      <title>Estimation of multivariate traces of states given partial classical information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bargmann invariants of order $n$, defined as multivariate traces of quantum states $\text{Tr}[\rho_1\rho_2 \ldots \rho_n]$, are useful in applications ranging from quantum metrology to certification of nonclassicality. A standard quantum circuit used to estimate Bargmann invariants is the cycle test. In this work, we propose generalizations of the cycle test applicable to a situation where $n$ systems are given and unknown, and classical information on $m$ systems ($m\leq n)$ is available, allowing estimation of invariants of order $n+m$. Our main result is a generalization of results on 4th order invariants appearing in double weak values from Chiribella et al. [Phys. Rev. Research 6, 043043 (2024)]. The use of classical information on some of the states enables circuits on fewer qubits and with fewer gates, decreasing the experimental requirements for their estimation, and enabling multiple applications we briefly review.</description>

      <title>Hardware-tailored logical Clifford circuits for stabilizer codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction is the art of protecting fragile quantum information through suitable encoding and active interventions. After encoding $k$ logical qubits into $n&gt;k$ physical qubits using a stabilizer code, this amounts to measuring stabilizers, decoding syndromes, and applying an appropriate correction. Although quantum information can be protected in this way, it is notoriously difficult to manipulate encoded quantum data without introducing uncorrectable errors. Here, we introduce a mathematical framework for constructing hardware-tailored quantum circuits that implement any desired Clifford unitary on the logical level of any given stabilizer code. Our main contribution is the formulation of this task as a discrete optimization problem. We can explicitly integrate arbitrary hardware connectivity constraints. As a key feature, our framework naturally incorporates an optimization over all Clifford gauges (differing only in their action outside the code space) of a desired logical circuit. In this way, we find, for example, fault-tolerant and teleportation-free logical Hadamard circuits for the $[[8,3,2]]$ code. From a broader perspective, we turn away from the standard generator decomposition approach and instead focus on the holistic compilation of entire logical circuits, leading to significant savings in practice. Our work introduces both the necessary mathematics and open-source software to compile hardware-tailored logical Clifford circuits for stabilizer codes.</description>

      <title>A distillation-teleportation protocol for fault-tolerant QRAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a protocol for fault-tolerantly implementing the logical quantum random access memory (QRAM) operation, given access to a specialized, noisy QRAM device. For coherently accessing classical memories of size $2^n$, our protocol consumes only $\mathrm{poly}(n)$ fault-tolerant quantum resources (logical gates, logical qubits, quantum error correction cycles, etc.), avoiding the need to perform active error correction on all $\Omega(2^n)$ components of the QRAM device. This is the first rigorous conceptual demonstration that a specialized, noisy QRAM device could be useful for implementing a fault-tolerant quantum algorithm. In fact, the fidelity of the device can be as low as $1/\mathrm{poly}(n)$. The protocol queries the noisy QRAM device $\mathrm{poly}(n)$ times to prepare a sequence of $n$-qubit QRAM resource states, which are moved to a general-purpose $\mathrm{poly}(n)$-size processor to be encoded into a QEC code, distilled, and fault-tolerantly teleported into the computation. To aid this protocol, we develop a new gate-efficient streaming version of quantum purity amplification that matches the optimal sample complexity in a wide range of parameters and is therefore of independent interest.
  The exponential reduction in fault-tolerant quantum resources comes at the expense of an exponential quantity of purely classical complexity: each of the $n$ iterations of the protocol requires adaptively updating the $2^n$-size classical dataset and providing the noisy QRAM device with access to the updated dataset at the next iteration. While our protocol demonstrates that QRAM is more compatible with fault-tolerant quantum computation than previously thought, the need for significant classical computational complexity exposes potentially fundamental limitations to realizing a truly $\mathrm{poly}(n)$-cost fault-tolerant QRAM.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Cost of Erasure Correction in Quantum MDS Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In distributed quantum storage, physical qubits of a code will be stored across the network. When qubits in one of the nodes are lost i.e. when the node is erased, the remaining nodes need to communicate with a new node to replace the lost qubits. Here, we look at the problem of how much entanglement cost is needed to perform such a distributed quantum erasure correction. We focus on distributed quantum storage based on quantum maximum distance separable (MDS) codes. We derive lower bounds on the entanglement cost when the quantum network used for the erasure correction has a star topology. We show that the simple method of downloading the non-erased qudits and performing operations at a single node is optimal when the minimal number of non-erased nodes are accessed. It remains to be seen what the entanglement cost will be when a non-minimal number of non-erased nodes are accessed. The techniques used in this work can be developed further to study the entanglement cost of quantum erasure correction in more general code families and network topologies.</description>

      <title>Circuit-level-configurable Zero-field Superconducting Diodes: A Universal Platform Beyond Intrinsic Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern industry seeks next-generation microelectronics with ultra-low dissipation and noise beyond semiconducting systems, where the superconducting electronics offer promise. Its physical foundation is the superconducting diode effect (SDE) with nonreciprocal supercurrent. SDE has hitherto mainly relied on material-specific intrinsic symmetry breaking in superconductors, suffering from low yield, controllability, and compatibility with further functional extension - an undesirable aspect for applications. Here, we demonstrated a field-free SDE due to the chemical potential shift from external circuit line resistance, which is generic and challenges the previous interpretations of the intrinsic symmetry breaking in superconductivity for zero-field SDE. Moreover, this SDE is circuit-level configurable since it can be electrically switched on/off with its polarity and efficiency precisely modulated via gate voltage and circuit reconfiguration, facilitating functional extension. Such a generic, controllable and extensible SDE addresses critical challenges in dissipationless circuit towards application, and thus establishes a robust platform for scalable superconducting electronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the physics of a small group of quantum states defined above the sharply defined ground state of a chaotic ensemble. This `universality class of the first levels' (UFL) is realized in the majority of `synthetic' random matrix models but, for all we know, in only one microscopically defined system: low-dimensional gravity. We discuss the physical properties of these states, notably their exceptional rigidity against external perturbations, as quantified by the so-called quantum state fidelity. Examining these structures through the lenses of random matrix and string theory, we highlight their relevance to the physics of low-dimensional holographic principles.</description>

      <title>Coherence, Transport, and Chaos in 1D Bose-Hubbard Model: Disorder vs. Stark Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quantum coherence and phase transitions in a finite-size one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model using exact numerical diagonalization. The system is investigated under the competing effects of thermal fluctuations, a Stark potential, and a disorder term. We compute several observables, including the condensate fraction, superfluid fraction, visibility, number fluctuations, and the $\ell_1$-norm of quantum coherence, to characterize the transition from the Mott insulator to the superfluid phase. In the standard Bose-Hubbard model, ground-state properties exhibit signatures of a quantum phase transition under open boundary conditions. While finite-size effects preclude an exact realization of the thermodynamic transition, our findings serve as indicators of the underlying quantum critical behavior of the disordered Bose-Hubbard model. At finite temperatures, this critical point shifts to a smooth crossover, reflecting the suppression of long-range coherence typical of larger systems. A nonzero Stark potential delays this crossover, promoting localization and the formation of non-superfluid condensates. In contrast, thermal fluctuations can induce unexpected coherence through fluctuation-driven tunneling. Disorder disrupts superfluidity but preserves local coherence, with thermal states exhibiting an enhanced $\ell_1$-norm of coherence within the Bose glass regime. Our results highlight how disorder, tilt, and temperature jointly reshape the coherence landscape, and offer valuable insights for quantum simulation and the characterization of quantum phases in strongly correlated systems. Non-ergodic behavior is observed in the clean system where the mean gap ratio stays below Poisson and Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE) values. With a Stark potential, level statistics shift from Poisson-like to near-GOE as tunneling increases, which indicates a crossover to semi-ergodic dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The manipulation of material properties by laser light holds great promise for the development of future technologies. However, the full picture of the electronic response to laser driving remains to be uncovered. We present a novel approach to reveal details of the electron dynamics of laser-dressed materials, which consists of calculating and analysing the time-dependent partial density of states (PDOS) of materials during their interaction with a driving electromagnetic field. We show that the laser-dressed PDOS provides information about the structure of the bonds that form the laser-dressed electron density, analogous to the information that a PDOS can provide about the electron structure in a field-free case. We illustrate how our method can provide insights into the electron dynamics of materials in a site- and orbital-selective manner with calculations for a laser-dressed wurtzite ZnO crystal. Our work provides an analytical tool for the interpretation of subcycle-resolved experiments on laser-dressed materials and for the development of strategies for optical manipulation of material properties.</description>

Abstract: To overcome the limitations of existing algorithms for solving self-bound quantum many-body problems -- such as those encountered in nuclear and particle physics -- that access only a restricted subset of energy levels and provide limited structural information, we introduce and demonstrate a novel quantum-classical approach capable of resolving the complete bound-state spectrum. This method also provides the total angular momentum $J$ associated with each eigenstate. Our approach is based on expressing the Hamiltonian in second-quantized form within a novel input model combined with a scan scheme, enabling broad applicability to configuration-interaction calculations across diverse fields. We apply this hybrid method to compute, for the first time, the bound-state spectrum together with corresponding $J$ values of ${^{20}O}$ using a realistic strong-interaction Hamiltonian. Our approach applies to hadron spectra and $J$ values solved in the relativistic Basis Light-Front Quantization approach.</description>

      <title>Measurement and Calibration Approaches for Full Two-Port Scattering Parameters at mK Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper describes the developed set-up and the characterization approaches to realize full two-port, calibrated scattering parameters measurements at cryogenic temperatures, providing a complete uncertainty budget. The system developed at the Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica (INRiM, Italy), exploits the Short-Open-Load-Reciprocal technique, to realize error corrected cryogenic measurements with single cooling cycle. The system operates at temperatures down to the mK range, in the band 4-12 GHz in coaxial line. Calibration standards are referred to traceable room temperature measurements, while a numerical approach is used to evaluate the artifact response shift from room temperature values, and derive key information to enable full measurement uncertainty budget. Moreover, relevant measurement uncertainty contributions are evaluated according to internationally agreed procedures, and a comprehensive uncertainty budget is presented. Test measurements on a 20 dB attenuator are shown as an example. An attenuation value of 20.70 +/- 0.08 dB (95% confidence interval) was obtained at 6 GHz.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the temporal dynamics of light interacting with a one-dimensional lattice of cold atoms. In such a system, a photonic band gap opens up, yielding an efficient Bragg reflection for an incident field incoming with the right angle and detuning. Here, we report two new effects appearing in the Bragg reflection. First, for some detunings, there is a ``flash'', i.e., a transient increase of the reflected intensity when the incident field is switched off. Second, the subsequent extinction of the reflected field is clearly superradiant, with decay rates up to 8 times the natural decay rate of the atomic excited state. Numerical simulations are in qualitative agreement with the observations, which can be explained by a classical photonic model.</description>

      <title>Tensorization is a powerful but underexplored tool for compression and interpretability of neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensorizing a neural network involves reshaping some or all of its dense weight matrices into higher-order tensors and approximating them using low-rank tensor network decompositions. This technique has shown promise as a model compression strategy for large-scale neural networks. However, despite encouraging empirical results, tensorized neural networks (TNNs) remain underutilized in mainstream deep learning. In this position paper, we offer a perspective on both the potential and current limitations of TNNs. We argue that TNNs represent a powerful yet underexplored framework for deep learning--one that deserves greater attention from both engineering and theoretical communities. Beyond compression, we highlight the value of TNNs as a flexible class of architectures with distinctive scaling properties and increased interpretability. A central feature of TNNs is the presence of bond indices, which introduce new latent spaces not found in conventional networks. These internal representations may provide deeper insight into the evolution of features across layers, potentially advancing the goals of mechanistic interpretability. We conclude by outlining several key research directions aimed at overcoming the practical barriers to scaling and adopting TNNs in modern deep learning workflows.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of defect formation in the quantum annealing of random transverse-field Ising chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the strong-disorder renormalization group method, a microscopic mechanism of defect formation in the quantum annealing of the random transverse-field Ising chain is proposed, which represents the annealing process as a gradual aggregation of strongly coupled spin clusters. The ferromagnetic ground states of clusters are either preserved or get excited in pairwise fusions of clusters, depending on the effective annealing rate of the fusion, the latter events being responsible for the appearance of defects in the final state. An interesting consequence of the theory is that, although the Griffiths-McCoy phases surrounding the critical point are gapless, these phases are still effectively gapped from the point of view of quantum annealing. Thereby we provide an a posteriori justification of the assumption on the finiteness of gap outside of the critical point tacitly used in earlier works, and also refine the functional form of its vanishing at the critical point. The defect density in the final state is found to decrease with the annealing time $\tau$ asymptotically as $n(\tau)\sim \ln^{-2}\left(\frac{\tau}{\ln^2\tau}\right)$. In addition to this, our approach gives access also to the time-dependent density of defects accumulated during the annealing process at intermediate times.</description>

      <title>Universal non-thermal fixed point for quasi-1D Bose gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatio-temporal scaling dynamics connected to non-thermal fixed points has been suggested as a universal framework to describe the relaxation of isolated far-from-equilibrium systems. Experimental studies in weakly-interacting cold atom systems have found scaling dynamics connected to specific attractors. In our experiments, we study a quantum gas of strongly interacting $^6$Li$_2$ Feshbach molecules, brought far out of equilibrium by imprinting a white-noise phase profile. The observed relaxation follows the same universal dynamics as for the previously observed formation of the order parameter in a shock-cooled gas of weakly interacting $^{87}$Rb atoms. Our results point to a single universal fixed point with a large basin of attraction governing the relaxation of quasi-1D bosonic systems, independent of their specific initial conditions and microscopic details.</description>

      <title>Quantum suppression of cold reactions far from the s-wave energy limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.07725v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum effects in chemical reactions are most pronounced at ultracold temperatures, where only a few partial waves contribute. While interference among many partial waves is theoretically expected to persist at higher temperatures, direct evidence for such quantum effects in reactive processes has been lacking. Here, we report the first observation of quantum interference suppressing a chemical reaction in the multi-partial-wave regime: resonant charge exchange between a single $^{87}$Rb atom and its parent ion $^{87}$Rb$^+$. Using quantum-logic detection on a single atom-ion pair and a calibrated in-situ measurement of Langevin collision probabilities, we benchmark the thermally averaged reaction rate against both classical and quantum predictions. We find that the reaction rate is suppressed by over an order of magnitude relative to the classical expectation, despite occurring in the millikelvin temperature regime (more than three orders of magnitude above the $s$-wave threshold), where more than a dozen partial waves contribute. These results establish quantum interference as a key mechanism in chemical reactivity beyond the ultracold limit and offer a platform for probing coherent quantum effects in atom-ion reactions where \textit{ab initio} methods remain intractable.</description>

      <title>Extension of the Watanabe-Sagawa-Ueda uncertainty relation for measurement errors to infinite-dimensional systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.09309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the Watanabe--Sagawa--Ueda (WSU) uncertainty relation for measurement errors to infinite-dimensional quantum systems. The WSU uncertainty relation provides trade-off relations between measurement errors based on quantum estimation theory, but has been previously confined to finite-dimensional systems. We demonstrate that a similar relation holds in infinite-dimensional settings. We develop both classical and quantum estimation theories for infinite-dimensional parameter spaces using Fr\'{e}chet derivatives and establish the necessary mathematical framework, including extended Cram\'{e}r--Rao inequalities. We define measurement errors in infinite-dimensional systems and derive an error--error uncertainty relation with a tighter bound than in the original formulation. This research provides a theoretical framework that could potentially be applied to observables like position and momentum, which require infinite-dimensional representation, contributing to our understanding of measurement constraints in a more general framework of quantum theory.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Approximation Scheme for k-Means</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08167v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a quantum approximation scheme (i.e., $(1 + \varepsilon)$-approximation for every $\varepsilon &gt; 0$) for the classical $k$-means clustering problem in the QRAM model with a running time that has only polylogarithmic dependence on the number of data points. More specifically, given a dataset $V$ with $N$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ stored in QRAM data structure, our quantum algorithm runs in time $\tilde{O} \left( 2^{\tilde{O}(\frac{k}{\varepsilon})} \eta^2 d\right)$ and with high probability outputs a set $C$ of $k$ centers such that $cost(V, C) \leq (1+\varepsilon) \cdot cost(V, C_{OPT})$. Here $C_{OPT}$ denotes the optimal $k$-centers, $cost(.)$ denotes the standard $k$-means cost function (i.e., the sum of the squared distance of points to the closest center), and $\eta$ is the aspect ratio (i.e., the ratio of maximum distance to minimum distance). This is the first quantum algorithm with a polylogarithmic running time that gives a provable approximation guarantee of $(1+\varepsilon)$ for the $k$-means problem. Also, unlike previous works on unsupervised learning, our quantum algorithm does not require quantum linear algebra subroutines and has a running time independent of parameters (e.g., condition number) that appear in such procedures.</description>

      <title>Efficient Pauli channel estimation with logarithmic quantum memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14326v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we revisit one of the prototypical tasks for characterizing the structure of noise in quantum devices: estimating every eigenvalue of an $n$-qubit Pauli noise channel to error $\epsilon$. Prior work [14] proved no-go theorems for this task in the practical regime where one has a limited amount of quantum memory, e.g. any protocol with $\le 0.99n$ ancilla qubits of quantum memory must make exponentially many measurements, provided it is non-concatenating. Such protocols can only interact with the channel by repeatedly preparing a state, passing it through the channel, and measuring immediately afterward.
  This left open a natural question: does the lower bound hold even for general protocols, i.e. ones which chain together many queries to the channel, interleaved with arbitrary data-processing channels, before measuring? Surprisingly, in this work we show the opposite: there is a protocol that can estimate the eigenvalues of a Pauli channel to error $\epsilon$ using only $O(\log n/\epsilon^2)$ ancilla and $\tilde{O}(n^2/\epsilon^2)$ measurements. In contrast, we show that any protocol with zero ancilla, even a concatenating one, must make $\Omega(2^n/\epsilon^2)$ measurements, which is tight.
  Our results imply, to our knowledge, the first quantum learning task where logarithmically many qubits of quantum memory suffice for an exponential statistical advantage. Our protocol can be naturally extended to a protocol that learns the eigenvalues of Pauli terms within any subset $A$ of a Pauli channel with $O(\log\log(|A|)/\epsilon^2)$ ancilla and $\tilde{O}(n^2/\epsilon^2)$ measurements.</description>

      <title>The physics and metaphysics of the conceptuality interpretation of quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics has maintained over the years the reputation of being "the most obscure theory." It works perfectly well, but nobody seems to know why. It has been argued that the difficulty in understanding quantum theory is our failed attempt to force onto it a wrong conceptual scheme, wanting at all costs to think about the objects of the theory as, precisely, objects, i.e., entities having continuously actual spatiotemporal properties. This too restrictive spatiotemporal scheme is most probably at the heart of the problem, as also underlined by the Einsteinian revolution, but then what could be an alternative? Many thinkers have suggested that we must surrender to the fact that our physical world is one of immanent powers and potencies. Aristotle did so ante quantum litteram, followed by scholars like Heisenberg, Primas, Shimony, Piron, Kastner, Kauffman, de Ronde, just to name a few, including the authors, who were both students of Piron in Geneva. However, if on the one hand a potentiality ontology puts the accent on the processes of change, responsible for the incessant shifts between actual and potential properties, on the other hand it does not tell what these changes are all about. In other words, the metaphysical question remains of identifying the nature of the bearer of these potencies, or potentialities, and of the entities that can actualize them. It is the purpose of the present article to emphasize that the above question has found a possible answer in the recent Conceptuality Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, which we believe offers the missing ontology and metaphysics that can make the theory fully intelligible, and even intuitive.</description>

      <title>Advantage of multi-partite entanglement for quantum cryptography over long and short ranged networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing sophistication of available quantum networks has seen a corresponding growth in the pursuit of multi-partite cryptographic protocols. Whilst the use of multi-partite entanglement is known to offer an advantage in certain abstractly motivated contexts, the quest to find practical advantage scenarios is ongoing and substantial difficulties in generalising some bi-partite security proofs still remain. We present rigorous results that address both these challenges at the same time. First, we prove the security of a variant of the GHZ state based secret sharing protocol against general attacks, including participant attacks which break the security of the original GHZ state scheme. We then identify parameters for a performance advantage over realistic bottleneck networks. We show that whilst channel losses limit the advantage region to short distances over direct transmission networks, the addition of quantum repeaters unlocks the performance advantage of multi-partite entanglement over point-to-point approaches for long distance quantum cryptography.</description>

      <title>Full Characterization of the Depth Overhead for Quantum Circuit Compilation with Arbitrary Qubit Connectivity Constraint</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In some physical implementations of quantum computers, 2-qubit operations can be applied only on certain pairs of qubits. Compilation of a quantum circuit into one compliant to such qubit connectivity constraint results in an increase of circuit depth. Various compilation algorithms were studied, yet what this depth overhead is remains elusive. In this paper, we fully characterize the depth overhead by the routing number of the underlying constraint graph, a graph-theoretic measure which has been studied for 3 decades. We also give reduction algorithms between different graphs, which allow compilation for one graph to be transferred to one for another. These results, when combined with existing routing algorithms, give asymptotically optimal compilation for all commonly seen connectivity graphs in quantum computing.</description>

      <title>The Fate of Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06677v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement manifests itself in non-local correlations between the constituents of a system. In its simplest realization, a measurement on one subsystem is affected by a prior measurement on its partner, irrespective of their separation. For multiple parties, purely collective types of entanglement exist but their detection, even theoretically, remains an outstanding open question. Here, we argue that all forms of multipartite entanglement entirely disappear during the typical evolution of a physical state as it heats up, evolves in time in a large family of dynamical protocols, or as its parts become separated. We focus on the generic case where the system interacts with an environment. These results mainly follow from the geometry of the entanglement-free continent in the space of physical states, and hold in great generality. We illustrate these phenomena with a frustrated molecular quantum magnet in and out of equilibrium, and a quantum spin chain. In contrast, if the particles are fermions, such as electrons, another notion of entanglement exists that protects bipartite quantum correlations. However, genuinely collective fermionic entanglement disappears during typical evolution, thus sharing the same fate as in bosonic systems. These findings provide fundamental knowledge about the structure of entanglement in quantum matter and architectures, paving the way for its manipulation.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a broad lemma, one consequence of which is the higher order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) of tensors defined by DeLathauwer, DeMoor and Vandewalle (2000). By an analogous application of the lemma, we find a complex orthogonal version of the HOSVD. Kraus' (2010) algorithm used the HOSVD to compute normal forms of almost all $n$-qubit pure states under the action of the local unitary group. Taking advantage of the double cover $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{C}) \times \operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{C}) \to \operatorname{SO}_4({\mathbb{C}})$, we produce similar algorithms (distinguished by the parity of $n$) that compute normal forms for almost all $n$-qubit pure states under the action of the SLOCC group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14931v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum states of a spin $\tfrac{1}{2}$ (a qubit) are parametrized by the space ${\mathbf {CP}}^1 \sim S^2$, the Bloch sphere. A spin $j$ for a generic $j$ (a $2j+1$-state system) is represented instead by a point of a larger space, ${\mathbf {CP}}^{2j}$. Here we study the state of a single angular momentum/spin in the limit, $j \to \infty$. The special class of states $ | j, {\mathbf n}\rangle \in {\mathbf {CP}}^{2j} $, with spin oriented towards definite spatial directions ${\mathbf n} \in S^2$, i.e., $({\mathbf J}\cdot {\mathbf n} ) \, | j, {\mathbf n}\rangle = j\, |j, {\mathbf n}\rangle $, are found to behave as classical angular momenta, $j \, {\mathbf n}$, in this limit. Vice versa, general spin states in ${\mathbf {CP}}^{2j}$ do not become classical, even at large $j$. We discuss these questions, by analysing the Stern-Gerlach processes, the angular-momentum composition rule, and the rotation matrix. Our observations help to clarify better how classical mechanics emerges from quantum mechanics in this context (e.g., with unique trajectories for a particle carrying a large spin), and to make the widespread idea that large spins somehow become classical, more precise.</description>

      <title>Explicit block encodings of boundary value problems for many-body elliptic operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18347v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulation of physical systems is one of the most promising use cases of future digital quantum computers. In this work we systematically analyze the quantum circuit complexities of block encoding the discretized elliptic operators that arise extensively in numerical simulations for partial differential equations, including high-dimensional instances for many-body simulations. When restricted to rectangular domains with separable boundary conditions, we provide explicit circuits to block encode the many-body Laplacian with separable periodic, Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin boundary conditions, using standard discretization techniques from low-order finite difference methods. To obtain high-precision, we introduce a scheme based on periodic extensions to solve Dirichlet and Neumann boundary value problems using a high-order finite difference method, with only a constant increase in total circuit depth and subnormalization factor. We then present a scheme to implement block encodings of differential operators acting on more arbitrary domains, inspired by Cartesian immersed boundary methods. We then block encode the many-body convective operator, which describes interacting particles experiencing a force generated by a pair-wise potential given as an inverse power law of the interparticle distance. This work provides concrete recipes that are readily translated into quantum circuits, with depth logarithmic in the total Hilbert space dimension, that block encode operators arising broadly in applications involving the quantum simulation of quantum and classical many-body mechanics.</description>

      <title>Performance of Quantum Approximate Optimization with Quantum Error Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12104v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms must be scaled up to tackle real-world applications. Doing so requires overcoming the noise present on today's hardware. The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising candidate for scaling up, due to its modest resource requirements and documented asymptotic speedup over state-of-the-art classical algorithms for some problems. However, achieving better-than-classical performance with QAOA is believed to require fault tolerance. In this paper, we demonstrate a partially fault-tolerant implementation of QAOA using the $[[k+2,k,2]]$ ``Iceberg'' error detection code. We observe that encoding the circuit with the Iceberg code improves the algorithmic performance as compared to the unencoded circuit for problems with up to $20$ logical qubits on a trapped-ion quantum computer. Additionally, we propose and calibrate a model for predicting the code performance. We use this model to characterize the limits of the Iceberg code and extrapolate its performance to future hardware with improved error rates. In particular, we show how our model can be used to determine the necessary conditions for QAOA to outperform the Goemans-Williamson algorithm on future hardware. To the best of our knowledge, our results demonstrate the largest universal quantum computing algorithm protected by partially fault-tolerant quantum error detection on practical applications to date, paving the way towards solving real-world applications with quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Geometric Optimization of Quantum Control with Minimum Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the optimization of quantum control from a differential geometric perspective. In our approach, optimal control minimizes the cost associated with evolving a quantum state, with the cost quantified by the length of the trajectory on a relevant Riemannian manifold. We demonstrate the optimization protocol in systems with SU(2) and SU(1,1) dynamical symmetries, which encompass a broad range of physical systems. In these systems, the time evolution can be represented by trajectories on a three-dimensional manifold. Given the initial and final states, the minimum-cost quantum control corresponds to a geodesic on the manifold. When the trajectory between the initial and final states is specified, the minimum-cost control corresponds to a geodesic within a submanifold embedded in the three-dimensional space. This framework provides a geometric method for optimizing shortcuts to adiabatic driving.</description>

      <title>Creating Automated Quantum-Assisted Solutions for Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When trying to use quantum-enhanced methods for optimization problems, the sheer number of options inhibits its adoption by industrial end users. Expert knowledge is required for the formulation and encoding of the use case, the selection and adaptation of the algorithm, and the identification of a suitable quantum computing backend. Navigating the decision tree spanned by these options is a difficult task and supporting integrated tools are still missing. We propose the QuaST decision tree, a framework that allows to explore, automate and systematically evaluate solution paths. It helps end users to transfer research to their application area, and researchers to gather experience with real-world use cases. Our setup is modular, highly structured and flexible enough to include any kind of preparation, pre-processing and post-processing steps. We develop the guiding principles for the design of the ambitious framework and discuss its implementation. The QuaST decision tree includes multiple complete top-down paths from an application to its fully hybrid quantum solution.</description>

      <title>On the Computational Power of QAC0 with Barely Superlinear Ancillae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06499v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\mathrm{QAC}^0$ is the family of constant-depth polynomial-size quantum circuits consisting of arbitrary single qubit unitaries and multi-qubit Toffoli gates. It was introduced by Moore [arXiv: 9903046] as a quantum counterpart of $\mathrm{AC}^0$, along with the conjecture that $\mathrm{QAC}^0$ circuits can not compute PARITY. In this work we make progress on this longstanding conjecture: we show that any depth-$d$ $\mathrm{QAC}^0$ circuit requires $n^{1+3^{-d}}$ ancillae to compute a function with approximate degree $\Theta(n)$, which includes PARITY, MAJORITY and $\mathrm{MOD}_k$. We further establish superlinear lower bounds on quantum state synthesis and quantum channel synthesis. This is the first superlinear lower bound on the super-linear sized $\mathrm{QAC}^0$. Regarding PARITY, we show that any further improvement on the size of ancillae to $n^{1+\exp(-o(d))}$ would imply that PARITY $\not\in$ QAC0. These lower bounds are derived by giving low-degree approximations to $\mathrm{QAC}^0$ circuits. We show that a depth-$d$ $\mathrm{QAC}^0$ circuit with $a$ ancillae, when applied to low-degree operators, has a degree $(n+a)^{1-3^{-d}}$ polynomial approximation in the spectral norm. This implies that the class $\mathrm{QLC}^0$, corresponding to linear size $\mathrm{QAC}^0$ circuits, has approximate degree $o(n)$. This is a quantum generalization of the result that $\mathrm{LC}^0$ circuits have approximate degree $o(n)$ by Bun, Robin, and Thaler [SODA 2019]. Our result also implies that $\mathrm{QLC}^0\neq\mathrm{NC}^1$.</description>

      <title>Tailoring fusion-based photonic quantum computing schemes to quantum emitters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06784v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fusion-based quantum computation is a promising quantum computing model where small-sized photonic resource states are simultaneously entangled and measured by fusion gates. Such operations can be readily implemented with scalable photonic hardware: resource states can be deterministically generated by quantum emitters and fusions require only shallow linear-optical circuits. Here, we propose fusion-based architectures tailored to the capabilities and noise models in quantum emitters. We show that high tolerance to dominant physical error mechanisms can be achieved, with fault-tolerance thresholds of 8% for photon loss, 4% for photon distinguishability between emitters, and spin noise thresholds well above memory-induced errors for typical spin-photon interfaces. Our construction and analysis provide guidelines for the development of photonic quantum hardware targeting fault-tolerant applications with quantum emitters.</description>

      <title>Effect of environment-induced interatomic interaction on entanglement generation for uniformly accelerated atoms with a boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considering environment-induced interatomic interaction, we study the entanglement dynamics of two uniformly accelerated atoms that interact with fluctuating massless scalar fields in the Minkowski vacuum in the presence of a reflecting boundary. The two atoms are initially prepared in a state such that one is in the ground state and the other is in the excited state, which is separable. When the acceleration is small, the rate of entanglement generation at the initial time and the maximum of concurrence generated during evolution oscillate with the distance between the atoms and the boundary before reaching a stable value, and may decrease non-monotonically with the acceleration, which means the anti-Unruh phenomenon can exist for some situations even when environmental considerations are taken into account. The results show that there exists the competition of the vacuum fluctuations caused by the boundary and the acceleration. In addition, the time evolution of concurrence will not be affected by the environment-induced interatomic interaction under certain conditions. For a larger acceleration, when the environment-induced interatomic interaction is considered, the concurrence may disappear later compared with the result when the environment-induced interatomic interaction is neglected.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal transmission in hybrid atomic ensemble-optomechanical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate perfect optical nonreciprocal transmission in a hybrid optomechanical system that incorporates an atomic ensemble. By introducing complex coupling strengths between the atomic ensemble and a mechanical oscillator, nonreciprocity is induced through interference between distinct optical pathways. The nonreciprocal transmission is governed by the real and imaginary components of the coupling constants, along with the relative phase differences between the optomechanical couplings. Our analysis reveals that, with precise tuning of system parameters, such as coupling strengths, detuning, and phase differences, perfect nonreciprocity can be achieved. We derive the conditions necessary for optimal nonreciprocal transmission and demonstrate its dependence on the complex nature of the coupling. These findings offer valuable insights for the design of nonreciprocal optical devices, including isolators and circulators, with potential applications in quantum communication, signal processing, and photonics.</description>

Abstract: We derive a mesoscopic theory of the Josephson junction from non-relativistic scalar electrodynamics. Our theory reproduces the Josephson relations with the canonical current phase relation acquiring a weak second harmonic term, and it improves the standard lumped-element descriptions employed in circuit quantum electrodynamics by providing spatial resolution of the superconducting order parameter and electromagnetic field. By providing an ab initio derivation of the charge qubit Hamiltonian that relates traditionally free qubit parameters to geometric and material properties, we progress toward the quantum engineering of superconducting circuits at the subnanometer scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a mapping of the nonlinear, electrostatic Vlasov equation with Krook-type collision operators, discretized on a (1+1) dimensional grid, onto a recent Carleman linearization-based quantum algorithm for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with quadratic nonlinearities. We derive upper bounds for the query- and gate complexities of the quantum algorithm in the limit of large grid sizes. We conclude that these are polynomially larger than the time complexity of the corresponding classical algorithms. We find that this is mostly due to the dimension, sparsity and norm of the Carleman linearized evolution matrix. We show that the convergence criteria of the quantum algorithm places severe restrictions on potential applications. This is due to the high level of dissipation required for convergence, that far exceeds the physical dissipation effect provided by the Krook operator for typical plasma physics applications.</description>

Abstract: A typical surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) system relies on deeply subwavelength field localization in nanoscale plasmonic cavities to enhance both the excitation and emission of Raman-active molecules. Here, we demonstrate that a germanium-vacancy (GeV) defect in diamond can efficiently mediate the excitation process, by acting as a bright atomic antenna. At low temperatures, the GeV's low dissipation allows it to be efficiently populated by the incident field, resulting in a thousand-fold increase in the efficiency of Raman scattering. We show that atomic antenna-enhanced Raman scattering can be distinguished from conventional SERS by tracing the dependence of Stokes intensity on input power.</description>

      <title>Quantum Security Analysis of the Key-Alternating Ciphers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the quantum security of key-alternating ciphers (KAC), a natural multi-round generalization of the Even-Mansour (EM) cipher underlying many block cipher constructions, including AES. While the classical security of KAC and the quantum security of the $1$-round KAC (i.e. Even-Mansour) cipher are well understood, the quantum resistance of multi-round KAC remains largely unexplored. We focus on the $2$-round KAC construction, defined using public $n$-bit permutations $P_1$, $P_2$ and keys $k_0$, $k_1$, and $k_2$ as $E(x) = P_2(P_1(x \oplus k_0) \oplus k_1) \oplus k_2$. Our main contributions are as follows:
  1. Quantum Lower Bounds. We provide the first formal analysis showing that a $2$-round KAC is quantum-secure in both the $Q1$ and $Q2$ models. Specifically, in the $Q1$ model, a (non-adaptive) adversary must make at least $2^{2n/5}$ quantum queries to the public permutations and at least $2^{2n/5}$ classical queries to the cipher in order to distinguish it from a random permutation (in contrast to the classical lower bound of $2^{2n/3}$ queries). As a corollary, we show that in the $Q2$ model, a (non-adaptive) adversary requires $2^{n/4}$ quantum queries. To achieve such a result, we employ the quantum hybrid method along with recently proposed lifting theorems in the ideal cipher and random permutation oracle model.
  2. Quantum Key-Recovery Attack. We give the first nontrivial quantum key-recovery attack on multi-round KAC in the $Q1$ model. Our quantum attack applies to any $t$-round KAC and achieves quantum query complexity $O(2^{\alpha n})$, where $\alpha = \frac{t(t+1)}{(t+1)^2 + 1}$, improving over the best known classical bound of $O(2^{\alpha' n})$, where $\alpha' = \frac{t}{t+1}$, from Bogdanov et al. (EUROCRYPT 2012). The attack leverages a novel application of quantum walk algorithms specifically adapted to the KAC structure.</description>

      <title>Simulating quantum circuits with arbitrary local noise using Pauli Propagation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a polynomial-time classical algorithm for estimating expectation values of arbitrary observables on typical quantum circuits under any incoherent local noise, including non-unital or dephasing. Although previous research demonstrated that some carefully designed quantum circuits affected by non-unital noise cannot be efficiently simulated, we show that this does not apply to average-case circuits, as these can be efficiently simulated using Pauli-path methods. Specifically, we prove that, with high probability over the circuit gates choice, Pauli propagation algorithms with tailored truncation strategies achieve an inversely polynomially small simulation error. This result holds for arbitrary circuit topologies and for any local noise, under the assumption that the distribution of each circuit layer is invariant under single-qubit random gates. Under the same minimal assumptions, we also prove that most noisy circuits can be truncated to an effective logarithmic depth for the task of {estimating} expectation values of observables, thus generalizing prior results to a significantly broader class of circuit ensembles. We further numerically validate our algorithm with simulations on a $6\times6$ lattice of qubits under the effects of amplitude damping and dephasing noise, as well as real-time dynamics on an $11\times11$ lattice of qubits affected by amplitude damping.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14045v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical scheme to generate nonreciprocal bipartite entanglement between a cavity mode and vibrational modes in a molecular cavity optomechanical system. Our system consists of $\mathcal{N}$ molecules placed inside a spinning whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) resonator. The vibrational modes of these molecules are coupled to the WGM resonator mode (which is analogous to a plasmonic cavity) and the resonator is also coupled to an auxiliary optical cavity. We demonstrate that nonreciprocal photon-vibration entanglement and nonreciprocal vibration-vibration entanglement can be generated in this system, even at high temperatures. These nonreciprocal entanglements arise due to the Sagnac-Fizeau effect induced by the spinning WGM resonator. We find that spinning the WGM resonator in the counter-clockwise (CCW) direction enhances both types of nonreciprocal entanglement, especially under blue-detuned driving of the optical cavity mode. Furthermore, we show that vibration-vibration entanglement can be significantly enhanced by increasing the number of molecules. Our findings have potential applications in quantum information transmission and in the development of nonreciprocal quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decoherence in superconducting quantum circuits, caused by loss mechanisms like material imperfections and two-level system (TLS) defects, remains a major obstacle to improving the performance of quantum devices. In this work, we present atomic-level characterization of cross-sections of a Josephson junction and a spiral resonator to assess the quality of critical interfaces. Employing scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and electron-energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), we identify structural imperfections associated with oxide layer formation and carbon-based contamination, and correlate these imperfections to the patterning and etching steps in the fabrication process and environmental exposure. These results suggest that TLS imperfections at critical interfaces significantly contribute to limiting device performance, emphasizing the need for an improved fabrication process.</description>

Abstract: Superconducting traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs) are increasingly used in various applications, including quantum computing, quantum sensing, and dark matter detection. However, one important characteristic of these amplifiers, gain compression, has not received much attention. As a result, there is a lack of comprehensive experimental exploration of this phenomenon in the existing literature. In this study, we present an experimental investigation of gain compression in a Josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifier based on a four-wave mixing process. We have implemented a novel setup to monitor the complex transmission of both the pump and signal tones, which allows us to simultaneously track pump depletion and signal amplification as functions of signal power and frequency across the entire bandwidth of the device. Our findings indicate that, while pump depletion occurs during gain compression, it is not the only mechanism involved in the saturation of a TWPA. Power-induced phase-matching processes also take place within the device. This study provides valuable insights for optimizing TWPAs for applications that require high total input power, such as multiplexed qubit readout or broadband photon emission.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Wave Function as a Complex Probability Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10523v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper suggests an interpretation for the wave function, based on some elements of Nelson's stochastic mechanics, the time-symmetric laws of quantum theory and complex probabilities. Our main purpose is to demonstrate that the wave function and its complex conjugate can be interpreted as complex probability densities (or quasi-probability distributions) related to non-real forward and backward in time stochastic motion respectively. Those two quasi-Brownian motions serve as mathematical abstracts in order to derive the Born rule using probability theory and the intersection of the two probability sets that describe each of those motions. This proposal is useful also for explaining more about the role of complex numbers in quantum mechanics that produces this so-called "wave-like" nature of quantum reality. Our perspective also challenges the notion of physical superposition which is a fundamental concept in the Copenhagen interpretation and some other interpretations of quantum theory. Moreover, it is suggested that, embracing the idea of stochastic processes in quantum theory, may explain the reasons for the appearance of classical behavior in large objects, in contrast to the quantum behavior of small ones. In other words, we claim that a combination of a probabilistic and no-ontic view of the wave function with a stochastic hidden-variables approach, like Nelson's and others', may provide some insight into the quantum physical reality and potentially establish the groundwork for a novel interpretation of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Quantum dissipative dynamics of driven Duffing oscillator near attractors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum dissipative dynamics near the stable states (attractors) of a driven Duffing oscillator. A refined perturbation theory that can treat two perturbative parameters with different orders is developed to calculate the quantum properties of the Duffing oscillator near the attractors. We obtain the perturbative analytical results, that go beyond the standard linearization approach, for the renormalized level spacings, the orbital displacements, and the effective temperature near the classical attractor. Furthermore, we demonstrate that strong damping induces additional slight renormalization of level spacings, and the Bose distribution together with dephasing. Our work provides new insights into the quantum dynamics of the driven Duffing oscillator and offers a theoretical framework that can be applied to related quantum systems near their stable states.</description>

      <title>Simulating quantum instruments with projective measurements and quantum post-processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum instruments describe both the classical outcome and the updated state associated with a quantum measurement. We ask whether these processes can be simulated using only a natural subset of resources, namely projective measurements on the system and quantum processing of the post-measurement states. We show that the simulability of instruments can be connected to an entanglement classification problem. This leads to a computationally efficient necessary condition for simulation of generic instruments and to a complete characterisation for qubits. We use this to address relevant quantum information tasks, namely (i) the noise-tolerance of standard qubit unsharp measurements, (ii) non-projective advantages in information-disturbance trade-offs, and (iii) increased sequential Bell inequality violations under projective measurements. Moreover, we consider also $d$-dimensional L\"uders instruments that correspond to weak versions of standard basis measurements and show that for large $d$ these can permit scalable noise-advantages over projective implementations.</description>

      <title>Non-unitary enhanced transfer efficiency in quantum walk search on complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The task of finding an element in an unstructured database is known as spatial search and can be expressed as a quantum walk evolution on a graph. In this article, we modify the usual search problem by adding an extra trapping vertex to the graph, which is only connected to the target element. We study the transfer efficiency of the walker to a trapping site, using the search problem as a case study. Thus, our model offers no computational advantage for the search problem, but focuses on information transport in an open environment with a search Hamiltonian. The walker evolution is a mix between classical and quantum walk search dynamics. The balance between unitary and non-unitary dynamics is tuned with a parameter, and we numerically show that depending on the graph topology and the connectivity of the target element, this hybrid approach can outperform a purely classical or quantum evolution for reaching the trapping site. We show that this behavior is only observed in the presence of an extra trapping site, and that depending on the topology, the increase of non-unitary operations can be compensated by increasing the strength of the quantum walk exploration. This compensation comes at the cost of reducing or even suppressing the searching feature of the evolution. In that case, the unitary dynamics will only induce a regular quantum walk behavior. We also relate the optimal hybrid regime to the entropy's decay rate. As the introduction of non-unitary operations may be considered as noise, we interpret this phenomena as a noisy-assisted quantum evolution.</description>

      <title>Spatial correlations and entanglement in a hybrid system of N fermion pairs with harmonic interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the Moshinsky model, we analyze the spatial correlation and the entanglement of the ground state across different bipartitions of a system composed by $N$ pairs of harmonically confined fermions of two different interacting species. We find that in the strongly attractive regime fermions tend to localize within a confined region, while Pauli exclusion induces a spatial repulsion among identical particles. Conversely, in the strongly repulsive regime, the system exhibits phase separation into two spatially distinct domains. We propose a suitably designed entanglement measure that takes into account the (in)distinguishable nature of the particles, so as to guarantee that only quantum correlations beyond exchange or Slater correlations contribute to the entanglement. Our findings reveal how entanglement varies across different bipartitions, influenced by both the number of pairs and the interaction strength. The obtained entanglement between distinguishable species increases with both $N$ and the interaction strength, whereas the entanglement between subsystems of which at least one contains particles of both species decreases with $N$, suggesting a screening effect that weakens effective interactions among parties of the same kind. Our results sheds light on the intricate interplay between particle statistics and entanglement dynamics in composite quantum systems, and provides insights into the fundamental quantum correlations in fermionic systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum dual extended Hamming code immune to collective coherent errors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05249v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collective coherent (CC) errors are inevitable, as every physical qubit undergoes free evolution under its kinetic Hamiltonian. These errors can be more damaging than stochastic Pauli errors because they affect all qubits coherently, resulting in high-weight errors that standard quantum error-correcting (QEC) codes struggle to correct. In quantum memories and communication systems, especially when storage durations are long, CC errors often dominate over stochastic noise. Trapped-ion platforms, for example, exhibit strong CC errors with minimal stochastic Pauli components. In this work, we address the regime where immunity to CC errors, high code rate (due to limited qubit availability), and moderate distance (sufficient for correcting low-weight errors) are all essential. We construct a new family of constant-excitation (CE) stabilizer codes with parameters $[[2^{r+1}, 2^r - (r+1), 4]]$. The smallest instance, the $[[8,1,4]]$ code, improves the code rate and error threshold of the best previously known CE code by factors of approximately two and four, respectively.</description>

Abstract: The recent advancements in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices implementation allow us to study their application to real-life computational problems. However, hardware challenges are not the only ones that hinder our quantum computation capabilities. Software limitations are the other, less explored side of this medal. Using satellite image segmentation as a task example, we investigated how difficult it is to run a hybrid quantum-classical model on a real, publicly available quantum device. We also analyzed the costs of such endeavor and the change in quality of model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11430v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the use of a flexible and highly accurate Markov chain Monte Carlo Quantum Detector Tomography method as a minimization algorithm to best describe the response of an efficient $120 nm$ wide NbTiN superconducting nanobridge single photon detector. Separation of the internal quantum efficiency and external quantum efficiency is possible due to the difference in saturation behavior of an ideal 1-photon threshold detector as compared to a detector with non-unity 1-photon internal quantum efficiency. From a statistical analysis of our measurements (at $T=4.23\pm0.01K$, $I=29.4\pm0.1\mu A$, $I/I_\text{switch}=0.90\pm0.01$) we find an external quantum efficiency $\eta=(1.60\pm0.05)\cdot10^{-6}$, a 1-photon internal quantum efficiency $p_1=0.568\pm0.008$ and unity multi-photon (2 or more) internal quantum efficiency.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel lower bound on communication complexity using quantum relative entropy and mutual information, refining previous classical entropy-based results. By leveraging Uhlmann's lemma and quantum Pinsker inequalities, the authors establish tighter bounds for information-theoretic security, demonstrating that quantum protocols inherently outperform classical counterparts in balancing privacy and efficiency. Also explores symmetric Quantum Private Information Retrieval (QPIR) protocols that achieve sub-linear communication complexity while ensuring robustness against specious adversaries: A post-quantum cryptography based protocol that can be authenticated for the specious server; A ring-LWE-based protocol for post-quantum security in a single-server setting, ensuring robustness against quantum attacks; A multi-server protocol optimized for hardware practicality, reducing implementation overhead while maintaining sub-linear efficiency. These protocols address critical gaps in secure database queries, offering exponential communication improvements over classical linear-complexity methods. The work also analyzes security trade-offs under quantum specious adversaries, providing theoretical guarantees for privacy and correctness.</description>

Abstract: Ma and Huang recently proved that the PFC construction, introduced by Metger, Poremba, Sinha and Yuen [MPSY24], gives an adaptive-secure pseudorandom unitary family PRU. Their proof developed a new path recording technique [MH24].
  In this work, we show that a linear number of sequential repetitions of the parallel Kac's Walk, introduced by Lu, Qin, Song, Yao and Zhao [LQSY+24], also forms an adaptive-secure PRU, confirming a conjecture therein. Moreover, it additionally satisfies strong security against adversaries making inverse queries. This gives an alternative PRU construction, and provides another instance demonstrating the power of the path recording technique. We also discuss some further simplifications and implications.</description>

As a result, our proof yields a key rate consistent with previous findings. Importantly, unlike all the prior security proofs, our approach offers a fully rigorous and mathematical justification for achieving the key rate with the claimed correctness and secrecy parameters, thereby representing a significant step toward the formal certification of QKD systems.</description>

      <title>A log-depth in-place quantum Fourier transform that rarely needs ancillas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When designing quantum circuits for a given unitary, it can be much cheaper to achieve a good approximation on most inputs than on all inputs. In this work we formalize this idea, and propose that such "optimistic quantum circuits" are often sufficient in the context of larger quantum algorithms. For the rare algorithm in which a subroutine needs to be a good approximation on all inputs, we provide a reduction which transforms optimistic circuits into general ones. Applying these ideas, we build an optimistic circuit for the in-place quantum Fourier transform (QFT). Our circuit has depth $O(\log (n / \epsilon))$ for tunable error parameter $\epsilon$, uses $n$ total qubits, i.e. no ancillas, is local for input qubits arranged in 1D, and is measurement-free. The circuit's error is bounded by $\epsilon$ on all input states except an $O(\epsilon)$-sized fraction of the Hilbert space. The circuit is also rather simple and thus may be practically useful. Combined with recent QFT-based fast arithmetic constructions [arXiv:2403.18006], the optimistic QFT yields factoring circuits of nearly linear depth using only $2n + O(n/\log n)$ total qubits. Additionally, we apply our reduction technique to yield an approximate QFT with well-controlled error on all inputs; it is the first to achieve the asymptotically optimal depth of $O(\log (n/\epsilon))$ with a sublinear number of ancilla qubits. The reduction uses long-range gates but no measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03397v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Qubit control protocols have traditionally leveraged a characterisation of the qubit-bath coupling via its power spectral density. Previous work proposed the inference of noise operators that characterise the influence of a classical bath using a grey-box approach that combines deep neural networks with physics-encoded layers. This overall structure is complex and poses challenges in scaling and real-time operations. Here, we show that no expensive neural networks are needed and that this noise operator description admits an efficient parameterisation. We refer to the resulting parameter space as the \textit{quantum feature space} of the qubit dynamics resulting from the coupled bath. We show that the Euclidean distance defined over the quantum feature space provides an effective method for classifying noise processes in the presence of a given set of controls. Using the quantum feature space as the input space for a simple machine learning algorithm (random forest, in this case), we demonstrate that it can effectively classify the stationarity and the broad class of noise processes perturbing a qubit. Finally, we explore how control pulse parameters map to the quantum feature space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the thermalization dynamics of a quantum system embedded in an incommensurate potential and coupled to a Markovian thermal reservoir. The dephasing induced by the bath drives the system toward an infinite-temperature steady state, erasing all initial information-including signatures of localization. We find that initially localized states can relax to the homogeneous steady state faster than delocalized states. Moreover, low-temperature initial states thermalize to infinite temperature more rapidly than high-temperature states -- a phenomenon reminiscent of the Mpemba effect, in which hotter liquids freeze faster than colder ones. The slowest relaxation mode in the Liouvillian spectrum plays a critical role in the expedited thermalization for localized or cold initial states. Our results reveal that the combination of disordered structure and environmental dissipation may lead to non-trivial thermalization behavior, which advances both the conceptual framework of the Mpemba effect and the theoretical understanding of nonequilibrium processes in dissipative disordered systems.</description>

Abstract: Recent years have enjoyed a strong interest in exploring properties and applications of random quantum circuits. In this work, we explore the ensemble of $t$-doped Clifford circuits on $n$ qubits, consisting of Clifford circuits interspersed with $t$ single-qubit non-Clifford gates. We establish rigorous convergence bounds towards unitary $k$-designs, revealing the intrinsic cost in terms of non-Clifford resources in various flavors. First, we analyze the $k$-th order frame potential, which quantifies how well the ensemble of doped Clifford circuits is spread within the unitary group. We prove that a quadratic doping level, $t = \tilde{\Theta}(k^2)$, is both necessary and sufficient to approximate the frame potential of the full unitary group. As a consequence, we refine existing upper bounds on the convergence of the ensemble towards state $k$-designs. Second, we derive tight bounds on the convergence of $t$-doped Clifford circuits towards relative-error $k$-designs, showing that $t = \tilde{\Theta}(nk)$ is both necessary and sufficient for the ensemble to form a relative $\varepsilon$-approximate $k$-design. Similarly, $t = \tilde{\Theta}(n)$ is required to generate pseudo-random unitaries. All these results highlight that generating random unitaries is extremely costly in terms of non-Clifford resources, and that such ensembles fundamentally lie beyond the classical simulability barrier. Additionally, we introduce doped-Clifford Weingarten functions to derive analytic expressions for the twirling operator over the ensemble of random doped Clifford circuits, and we establish their asymptotic behavior in relevant regimes.</description>

      <title>Quantum computing with atomic qubit arrays: confronting the cost of connectivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: These notes present a review of the status of quantum computing with arrays of neutral atom qubits, an approach which has demonstrated remarkable progress in the last few years. Scaling digital quantum computing to qubit counts and control fidelities that will enable solving outstanding scientific questions, and provide commercial value, is an outstanding challenge, not least because of the requirement of connecting and entangling distant qubits. Long-range Rydberg gates and physical motion outfit atomic qubit arrays with tools for establishing connectivity. These tools operate on different timescales and with distinct levels of parallelization. We analyze several prototypical architectures from the perspective of achieving fast connectivity for circuits with large scale entanglement, as well as fast cycle times for measurement based quantum error correcting codes. Extending Rydberg interactions to multiple atomic species has emerged as a promising route to achieving this latter requirement.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking quantum computers via protocols</title>

Abstract: Benchmarking quantum computers often deals with the parameters of single qubits or gates and sometimes deals with algorithms run on an entire chip or a noisy simulator of a chip. Here we propose the idea of using protocols to benchmark quantum computers. The advantage of using protocols, especially the seven suggested here, over other benchmarking methods is that there is a clear cutoff (i.e., a threshold) distinguishing quantumness from classicality for each of our protocols. The protocols we suggest enable a comparison among various circuit-based quantum computers, and also between real chips and their noisy simulators. This latter method may then be used to better understand the various types of noise of the real chips. We use some of these protocols to answer an important question: ``How many effective qubits are there in this N-qubit quantum computer/simulator?'', and we then conclude which effective sub-chips can be named ``truly-quantum''.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML) have sparked significant interest, driving extensive exploration of quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms to address a wide range of complex challenges. The development of high-performance QML models requires expert-level expertise, presenting a key challenge to the widespread adoption of QML. Critical obstacles include the design of effective data encoding strategies and parameterized quantum circuits, both of which are vital for the performance of QML models. Furthermore, the measurement process is often neglected-most existing QML models employ predefined measurement schemes that may not align with the specific requirements of the targeted problem. We propose an innovative framework that renders the observable of a quantum system-specifically, the Hermitian matrix-trainable. This approach employs an end-to-end differentiable learning framework, enabling simultaneous optimization of the neural network used to program the parameterized observables and the standard quantum circuit parameters. Notably, the quantum observable parameters are dynamically programmed by the neural network, allowing the observables to adapt in real time based on the input data stream. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed method effectively programs observables dynamically within variational quantum circuits, achieving superior results compared to existing approaches. Notably, it delivers enhanced performance metrics, such as higher classification accuracy, thereby significantly improving the overall effectiveness of QML models.</description>

      <title>Decoding across transversal Clifford gates in the surface code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transversal logical gates offer the opportunity for fast and low-noise logic, particularly when interspersed by a single round of parity check measurements of the underlying code. Using such circuits for the surface code requires decoding across logical gates, complicating the decoding task. We show how one can decode across an arbitrary sequence of transversal gates for the unrotated surface code, using a fast "logical observable" minimum-weight-perfect-matching (MWPM) based decoder, and benchmark its performance in Clifford circuits under circuit-level noise. We propose windowed logical observable matching decoders to address the problem of fully efficient decoding: our basic windowed decoder is computationally efficient under the restriction of quiescent (slow) resets. Our two-step windowed decoder can be computationally inefficient but allows fast resets. For both windowed decoders we identify errors which scale sublinearly in $d$ - depending on the structure of the circuit - which can lead to logical failure, and we propose methods to adapt the decoding to remove such failures. Our work highlights the complexity and interest in efficient decoding of fast logic for the surface code.</description>

      <title>On Dequantization of Supervised Quantum Machine Learning via Random Fourier Features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the quest for quantum advantage, a central question is under what conditions can classical algorithms achieve a performance comparable to quantum algorithms--a concept known as dequantization. Random Fourier features (RFFs) have demonstrated potential for dequantizing certain quantum neural networks (QNNs) applied to regression tasks, but their applicability to other learning problems and architectures remains unexplored. In this work, we derive bounds on the generalization performance gap between classical RFF models and quantum models for regression and classification tasks with both QNN and quantum kernel architectures. We support our findings with numerical experiments that illustrate the practical dequantization of existing quantum kernel-based methods. Our findings not only broaden the applicability of RFF-based dequantization but also enhance the understanding of potential quantum advantages in practical machine-learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Kostka Numbers Constrain Particle Exchange Statistics beyond Fermions and Bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing theoretical explorations of intermediate statistics beyond bosons and fermions have followed three routes: (1) a statistical-mechanics route that modifies microstate counting rules; (2) a quantum-mechanics route that generalizes wavefunction exchange symmetry via group representations; and (3) a quantum-field-theory route that deforms the creation-annihilation algebra. While each route has advanced individually, a unified formulation remains elusive. Recently, consistency between routes (2) and (3) was demonstrated (Nature 637, 314 (2025)). Here, employing combinatorial arguments with Kostka numbers, we establish the microstate uniqueness theorem (MUT). It demonstrates that statistical-mechanics counting constraints (route 1) and symmetric-group-based quantum-mechanical exchange symmetry (a restricted subset of route 2, excluding braid-group generalizations) are mathematically incompatible under indistinguishability. Consequently, intermediate statistics based on higher-dimensional irreducible representations of the symmetric group or on modified microstate-counting rules are mathematically ruled out for indistinguishable particles. The MUT relies solely on the indistinguishability principle, without invoking Lorentz symmetry or any field-theoretic assumptions.</description>

      <title>Joint Encryption and Error Correction for Secure Quantum Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Secure quantum networks are a bedrock requirement for developing a future quantum internet. However, quantum channels are susceptible to channel noise that introduce errors in the transmitted data. The traditional approach to providing error correction typically encapsulates the message in an error correction code after encryption. Such separate processes incur overhead that must be avoided when possible. We, consequently, provide a single integrated process that allows for encryption as well as error correction. This is a first attempt to do so for secure quantum communication and combines the Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code with the three-stage secure quantum communication protocol. Lastly, it allows for arbitrary qubits to be transmitted from sender to receiver making the proposed protocol general purpose.</description>

      <title>Bounds on eigenstate thermalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.10069v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which asserts that every eigenstate of a many-body quantum system is indistinguishable from a thermal ensemble, plays a pivotal role in understanding thermalization of isolated quantum systems. Yet, no evidence has been obtained as to whether the ETH holds for all few-body operators in a chaotic system; such few-body operators include key quantities in statistical mechanics, such as the total magnetization, the momentum distributions, and their low-order thermal and quantum fluctuations. Here, we formulate a conjecture that for a generic nonintegrable system the ETH holds for all $m$-body operators with $m &lt; {\alpha}_{\ast} N$ in the thermodynamic limit for some nonzero constant ${\alpha}_{\ast} &gt; 0$. We first prove this statement for systems with Haar-distributed energy eigenstates to analytically motivate our conjecture. We then verify the conjecture for generic spin, Bose, and Fermi systems with local and few-body interactions by large-scale numerical calculations. Our results imply that generic systems satisfy the ETH for all few-body operators, including their thermal and quantum fluctuations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a rigorous construction of a large class of generalized spin-boson models with ultraviolet-divergent form factors. This class comprises various models of many possibly non-identical atoms with arbitrary but finite numbers of levels, interacting with a boson field. Ultraviolet divergences are assumed to be mild, such that no self-energy renormalization is necessary. Our construction is based on recent results by A. Posilicano, which also allow us to state an explicit formula for the domain of self-adjointness for our Hamiltonians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are promising systems for quantum technologies, including quantum metrology and sensing. A promising strategy for the achievement of high sensitivity to external fields relies on the exploitation of large ensembles of NV centers, whose fabrication by ion implantation is upper limited by the amount of radiation damage introduced in the diamond lattice. In this works we demonstrate an approach to increase the density of NV centers upon the high-fluence implantation of MeV N2+ ions on a hot target substrate (&gt;550 {\deg}C). Our results show that, with respect to room-temperature implantation, the high-temperature process increases the vacancy density threshold required for the irreversible conversion of diamond to a graphitic phase, thus enabling to achieve higher density ensembles. Furthermore, the formation efficiency of color centers was investigated on diamond substrates implanted at varying temperatures with MeV N2+ and Mg+ ions revealing that the formation efficiency of both NV centers and magnesium-vacancy (MgV) centers increases with the implantation temperature.</description>

Abstract: We unravel a deep connection between limits of real numbers and limits in category theory. Using a new variant of the classical characterisation of the real numbers, we characterise the category of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and linear contractions in terms of simple category-theoretic structures and properties that do not refer to norms, continuity, or real numbers. This builds on Heunen, Kornell, and Van der Schaaf's easier characterisation of the category of all Hilbert spaces and linear contractions.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic Irreversibility in Quantum Systems: Free Expansion in a Fermion Chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15263v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a free fermion chain with uniform nearest-neighbor hopping and let it evolve from an arbitrary initial state with a fixed macroscopic number of particles. We then prove that, at a sufficiently large and typical time, the measured coarse-grained density distribution is almost uniform with (quantum mechanical) probability extremely close to one. This establishes the emergence of irreversible behavior, i.e., a ballistic diffusion, in a system governed by quantum mechanical unitary time evolution. It is conceptually important that irreversibility from any initial state is proved here without introducing any randomness to the initial state or the Hamiltonian, while the known examples, both classical and quantum, rely on certain randomness or apply to limited classes of initial states. The essential new ingredient in the proof is the large deviation bound for every energy eigenstate, which is reminiscent of the strong ETH (energy eigenstate thermalization hypothesis).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15804v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate classification of brain tumors from MRI scans is critical for effective treatment planning. This study presents a Hybrid Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (HQCNN) that integrates quantum feature-encoding circuits with depth-wise separable convolutional layers to analyze images from a publicly available brain tumor dataset. Evaluated on this dataset, the HQCNN achieved 99.16% training accuracy and 91.47% validation accuracy, demonstrating robust performance across varied imaging conditions. The quantum layers capture complex, non-linear relationships, while separable convolutions ensure computational efficiency. By reducing both parameter count and circuit depth, the architecture is compatible with near-term quantum hardware and resource-constrained clinical environments. These results establish a foundation for integrating quantum-enhanced models into medical-imaging workflows with minimal changes to existing software platforms. Future work will extend evaluation to multi-center cohorts, assess real-time inference on quantum simulators and hardware, and explore integration with surgical-planning systems.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm in systems with large condition numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21641v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm offers an exponential speedup in system size for treating linear equations of the form $A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$ on quantum computers when compared to their traditional counterparts, it faces a challenge related to the condition number ($\mathcal{\kappa}$) scaling of the $A$ matrix. In this work, we address the issue by introducing the post-selection-improved HHL (Psi-HHL) framework that operates on a simple yet effective premise: subtracting mixed and wrong signals to extract correct signals while providing the benefit of optimal scaling in the condition number of $A$ (denoted as $\mathcal{\kappa}$) for large $\mathcal{\kappa}$ scenarios. This approach, which leads to minimal increase in circuit depth, has the important practical implication of having to use substantially fewer shots relative to the traditional HHL algorithm. The term `signal' refers to a feature of $|x\rangle$. We design circuits for overlap and expectation value estimation in the Psi-HHL framework. We demonstrate performance of Psi-HHL via numerical simulations. We carry out two sets of computations, where we go up to 26-qubit calculations, to demonstrate the ability of Psi-HHL to handle situations involving large $\mathcal{\kappa}$ matrices via: (a) a set of toy matrices, for which we go up to size $64 \times 64$ and $\mathcal{\kappa}$ values of up to $\approx$ 1 million, and (b) application to quantum chemistry, where we consider matrices up to size $256 \times 256$ that reach $\mathcal{\kappa}$ of about 393. The molecular systems that we consider are Li$_{\mathrm{2}}$, KH, RbH, and CsH.</description>

      <title>Finite Temperature Casimir Effect of Scalar Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19275v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive analytic expressions for the Helmholtz free energy, Casimir force, and Casimir entropy for both one-dimensional and three-dimensional scalar fields with Dirichlet boundary conditions at finite temperature. We investigate the negative Casimir entropy problem in these systems, as well as for a scalar field in the bulk of a three-dimensional sphere, and find that this issue arises under different regularization prescriptions with differing counterterms. We argue against introducing any counterterms for the thermal corrections to the Casimir effect and predict that the thermal-fluctuation-induced Casimir force becomes repulsive in the high-temperature regime -- for instance, when $aT/(\pi\hbar{v})&gt;0.2419$ for three-dimensional scalar fields.</description>

      <title>Impact of micromotion and field-axis misalignment on the excitation of Rydberg states of ions in a Paul trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24047v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trapped ions are among the most advanced platforms for quantum simulation and computation. Their capabilities can be further augmented by making use of electronically highly excited Rydberg states, which enable the realization of long-ranged electric dipolar interactions. Most experimental and theoretical studies so far focus on the excitation of ionic Rydberg states in linear Paul traps, which generate confinement by a combination of static and oscillating electric fields. These two fields need to be carefully aligned to minimize so-called micromotion, caused by the time-dependent electric field. The purpose of this work is to systematically understand the qualitative impact of micromotion on the Rydberg excitation spectrum, when the symmetry axes of the two electric fields do not coincide. Considering this scenario is not only important in the case of possible field misalignment, but becomes inevitable for Rydberg excitations in 2D and 3D ion crystals. We develop a minimal model describing a single trapped Rydberg ion, which we solve numerically via Floquet theory and analytically using a perturbative approach. We calculate the excitation spectra and analyze in which parameter regimes addressable and energetically isolated Rydberg lines persist, which are an important requirement for conducting coherent manipulations.</description>

      <title>Introduction of Additive Particle Theory for Path Integral Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06796v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Path integral approaches have been used for boson and fermion systems. The path integral approach has been successful in the many-boson system. However, in the many-fermion system, the path integral approach is not feasible due to the sign problem. In this letter, I introduce additive particle (AP) theory in order to generate an approximation method that avoids the sign problem. The AP theory considers one electron as a string polymer, and virtual particles are added into the system. The AP theory is an approximation, but it is constructed to be able to generate the pair distribution function between free electrons and the density of states of the free electrons at an arbitrary temperature. Hence, when the electrostatic interactions are decreased, the AP theory converges to the free electron system. On the other hand, it deviates from the actual system when the electrostatic interactions are increased.</description>

      <title>Unitarity constrains the quantum information metrics for particle interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unitarity provides mathematical and physical constraints on quantum information systems. e.g., in entanglement swapping, unitarity requires the same von Neumann entanglement entropy generation for either a particle interaction or an act of measurement. For the first time, the language of non-relativistic quantum mechanics is presented to derive the density matrix for hard scattering. We show that unitarity allows for finding the latter's cross section without using the scattering amplitude or the Lippmann-Schwinger equation plus Green's function. We also show the language of relativistic quantum mechanics can be used to derive the momentum entropy or Sackur-Tetrode equation for the inelastic scattering of an electron from a proton. The latter entropy derives from a Shannon entropy and an additional entropy that evokes the uncertainty principle. This article's presentation allows particle physicists to readily begin calculating quantum information metrics such as correlations and mutual information for any particle interaction.</description>

      <title>Double Microwave Shielding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop double microwave shielding, which has recently enabled evaporative cooling to the first Bose-Einstein condensate of polar molecules [Bigagli et al., Nature 631, 289 (2024)]. Two microwave fields of different frequency and polarization are employed to effectively shield polar molecules from inelastic collisions and three-body recombination. Here, we describe in detail the theory of double microwave shielding. We demonstrate that double microwave shielding effectively suppresses two- and three-body losses. Simultaneously, dipolar interactions and the scattering length can be flexibly tuned, enabling comprehensive control over interactions in ultracold gases of polar molecules. We show that this approach works universally for a wide range of molecules. This opens the door to studying many-body physics with strongly interacting dipolar quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Detecting Many-Body Scars from Fisher Zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The far-from-equilibrium dynamics of certain interacting quantum systems still defy precise understanding. One example is the so-called quantum many-body scars (QMBSs), where a set of energy eigenstates evade thermalization to give rise to long-lived oscillations. Despite the success of viewing scars from the perspectives of symmetry, commutant algebra and quasiparticles, it remains a challenge to elucidate the mechanism underlying all QMBS and to distinguish them from other forms of ergodicity breaking. In this work, we introduce an alternative route to detect and diagnose QMBS based on Fisher zeros, i.e., the patterns of zeros of the analytically continued partition function $Z$ on the complex $\beta$ (inverse temperature) plane. For systems with scars, a continuous line of Fisher zeros will appear off the imaginary $\beta$ axis and extend upward, separating the $\beta$-plane into regions with distinctive thermalization behaviors. This conjecture is motivated from interpreting the complex $Z$ as the return amplitude of the thermofield double state, and it is validated by analyzing two models with QMBS, the $\bar{P}X\bar{P}$ model and the Ising chain in external fields. These models also illustrate the key difference between QMBS and strong ergodicity breaking including their distinctive renormalization group flows on the complex $\beta$-plane. This ``statistical mechanics" approach places QMBS within the same framework of thermal and dynamical phase transitions. It has the advantage of spotting scars without exhaustively examining each individual quantum state.</description>

      <title>Almost Strong Zero Modes at Finite Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11121v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interacting fermionic chains exhibit extended regions of topological degeneracy of their ground states as a result of the presence of Majorana or parafermionic zero modes localized at the edges. In the opposite limit of infinite temperature, the corresponding non-integrable spin chains, obtained via generalized Jordan-Wigner mapping, are known to host so-called Almost Strong Zero Modes, which are long-lived with respect to any bulk excitations. Here, we study the fairly unexplored territory that bridges these two extreme cases of zero and infinite temperature. We blend two established techniques for states, the Lanczos series expansion and a tensor network ansatz, uplifting them to the level of operator algebra. This allows us to efficiently simulate large system sizes for arbitrarily long timescales and to extract the temperature-dependent decay rates. We observe that for the Kitaev-Hubbard model, the decay rate of the edge mode depends exponentially on the inverse temperature $\beta$, and on an effective energy scale $\Delta_{\rm eff}$ that is greater than the thermodynamic gap of the system $\Delta$.</description>

      <title>Temporal Model On Quantum Logic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a unified theoretical framework for modeling temporal memory dynamics, combining concepts from temporal logic, memory decay models, and hierarchical contexts. The framework formalizes the evolution of propositions over time using linear and branching temporal models, incorporating exponential decay (Ebbinghaus forgetting curve) and reactivation mechanisms via Bayesian updating. The hierarchical organization of memory is represented using directed acyclic graphs to model recall dependencies and interference. Novel insights include feedback dynamics, recursive influences in memory chains, and the integration of entropy-based recall efficiency. This approach provides a foundation for understanding memory processes across cognitive and computational domains.</description>

Abstract: We propose a new particle-trajectory detector composed of Josephson junctions, named the superconducting cloud chamber. By measuring the quantum phase difference, this device can detect charged particles with extremely low kinetic energy, providing a new method for detecting slow-moving particles. It can also be utilized to detect millicharged dark matter particles thermalized with the Earth's environment within the mass range of $10^4\sim 10^{10}\,$GeV.</description>

      <title>Shortcut to spin dynamics for quantum mixtures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01447v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of the long-time dynamics of quantum systems can be a real challenge, especially in systems like ultracold gases, where the required timescales may be longer than the lifetime of the system itself. In this work, we show that it is possible to access the long-time dynamics of a strongly repulsive atomic gas mixture in shorter times. The shortcut-to-dynamics protocol that we propose does not modify the fate of the observables, but effectively jumps ahead in time without changing the system's inherent evolution. Just like the next-chapter button in a movie player that allows to quickly reach the part of the movie one wants to watch, it is a leap into the future.</description>

      <title>A theory of quasiballistic spin transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent work [Mierzejewski et al., Phys. Rev. B 107, 045134 (2023)] observed "quasiballistic spin transport" - long-lived and transiently ballistic modes of the magnetization density - in numerical simulations of infinite-temperature XXZ chains with power-law exchange interactions. We develop an analytical theory of such quasiballistic spin transport. Previous work found that this effect was maximized along a specific locus in the space of model parameters, which interpolated smoothly between the integrable Haldane-Shastry and XX models and whose shape was estimated from numerics. We obtain an analytical estimate for the lifetime of the spin current and show that it has a unique maximum along a different locus, which interpolates more gradually between the two integrable points. We further rule out the existence of a conserved two-body operator that protects ballistic spin transport away from these integrable points by proving that a corresponding functional equation has no solutions. We discuss connections between our approach and an integrability-transport conjecture for spin.</description>

      <title>Lanczos-Pascal approach to correlation functions in chaotic quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We suggest a method to compute approximations to temporal correlation functions of few-body observables in chaotic many-body systems in the thermodynamic limit based on the respective Lanczos coefficients. Given the knowledge of these Lanczos coefficients, the method is very cheap. Usually accuracy increases with more Lanczos coefficients taken into account, however, we numerically find and analytically argue that the convergence is rather quick, if the Lanczos coefficients exhibit a smoothly increasing structure. For pertinent examples we compare with data from dynamical typicality computations for large but finite systems and find good agreement if few Lanczos coefficients are taken into account. From the method it is evident that in these cases the correlation functions are well described by a low number of damped oscillations.</description>

      <title>Periodic Motzkin chain: Ground states and symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00835v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motzkin chain is a model of nearest-neighbor interacting quantum $s=1$ spins with open boundary conditions. It is known that it has a unique ground state which can be viewed as a sum of Motzkin paths. We consider the case of periodic boundary conditions and provide several conjectures about structure of the ground state space and symmetries of the Hamiltonian. We conjecture that the ground state is degenerate and independent states are distinguished by eigenvalues of the third component of total spin operator. Each of these states can be described as a sum of paths, similar to the Motzkin paths. Moreover, there exist two operators commuting with the Hamiltonian, which play the roles of lowering and raising operators when acting at these states. We conjecture also that these operators generate a $C$-type Lie algebra, with rank equal to the number of sites. The symmetry algebra of the Hamiltonian is actually wider, and extended, besides the cyclic shift operator, by a central element contained in the third component of total spin operator.</description>
