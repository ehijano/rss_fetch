      <title>Empowering Abilities: Increasing Representation of Students with Disabilities in the STEM Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ExploreSTEM Summer Camps 2023 were designed to deliver inclusive STEM education to students aged 14 to 22 years with disabilities. This paper presents a thorough examination of the 2023 camp program, emphasizing the pivotal role of inclusive STEM education in potentially shaping students' personal and academic trajectories. The curriculum encompassed four weeklong fundamental STEM domains: Internet of Things (IoT), Computational Engineering, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR). Within Camp 1, students actively engaged with Dash robots, employing dedicated programming environments to command actions and gather sensor data, fostering interactions with the IoT platform and facilitating seamless data transmission. Camp 2 was dedicated to acquainting students with foundational computational engineering principles, establishing a robust framework for comprehending intricate engineering concepts. Camp 3 commenced with insightful presentations elucidating AI applications across multifaceted industries, including engineering, healthcare, and education, illuminating AI's pervasive influence on contemporary society. The primary aim of Camp 4 was to introduce students to the immersive domains of AR and VR, showcasing their applications beyond conventional STEM disciplines into everyday life experiences. The amalgamation of informative presentations, interactive activities, and a nurturing learning environment cultivated an engaging and enriching experience for all participants. By embracing inclusivity and harnessing innovative pedagogical approaches, the ExploreSTEM Summer Camps empowered students to explore, innovate, and excel within the dynamic realm of STEM education.</description>

      <title>Does Ownership Structure Matter? A Case Study on Business Performance of Two Accounting Companies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many public organisations procure a substantial amount of goods and services from in-house companies. When providing their goods and services, those companies are supposed to fulfil objectives set for them and for the wider entity, including in particular cost-effectiveness. This paper examines the performance of selected in-house companies both by analyzing the externally reported financial performance (top-down) and analyzing the internal operations and related performance (bottom-up). Based on the analysis, it is discussed, 1) how the in-house companies fulfil their assigned tasks as publicly owned entities and 2) how these in-house companies and their performance should be controlled by public bodies. Methodologically the paper takes advantage of two cases of accounting companies: one publicly owned in-house company and another private company. As a conclusion, in this case top-down analysis reveals inefficiencies which are further explored via bottom-up analysis. In this case, privatization leads to enhanced business performance.</description>

      <title>Regulation and Frontier Housing Supply</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.01969v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Regulation is a major driver of housing supply, yet often difficult to observe directly. This paper estimates frontier cost, the non-land cost of producing housing absent regulation, and regulatory tax, which quantifies regulation in money terms. Working within an urban environment of multi-floor, multi-family housing and using only apartment prices and building heights, we show that the frontier is identified from the support of supply and demand shocks without recourse to instrumental variables. In an application to new Israeli residential construction, and accounting for random housing quality, the estimated mean regulatory tax is 48% of housing prices, with significant variation across locations. Higher regulation is associated with proximity to city center, higher density, and higher prices. We construct a lower bound for the regulatory tax that allows quality to differ systematically over location and time, by assuming (weak) complementarity between quality and demand. The bound is most useful after prices have increased, so that at the end of our sample period, with prices at their highest, we bound the regulatory tax between 40% (using a 2km radius) and 53%.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Production Planning and Control Systems in Different Environments: A Comparative Simulation Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Selecting the appropriate production planning and control systems (PPCS) presents a significant challenge for many companies, as their performance, i.e., overall costs, depends on the production system environment. Key environmental characteristics include the system's structure, i.e., flow shop, hybrid shop, or job shop, and the planned shop load. Besides selecting a suitable PPCS, its parameterization significantly influences the performance. This publication investigates the performance and the optimal parametrization of Material Requirement Planning (MRP), Reorder Point System (RPS), and Constant Work In Progress (ConWIP) at different stochastic multi-item multi-stage production system environments by conducting a comprehensive full factorial simulation study. The results indicate that MRP and ConWIP generally outperform RPS in all observed environments. Moreover, when comparing MRP with ConWIP, the performance clearly varies depending on the specific production system environment.</description>

      <title>Energy Price and Workload Related Dispatching Rule: Balancing Energy and Production Logistics Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In response to the escalating need for sustainable manufacturing practices amid fluctuating energy prices, this study introduces a novel dispatching rule that integrates energy price and workload considerations with Material Requirement Planning (MRP) to optimize production logistics and energy costs. The dispatching rule effectively adjusts machine operational states, i.e. turn the machine on or off, based on current energy prices and workload. By developing a stochastic multi-item multi-stage job shop simulation model, this research evaluates the performance of the dispatching rule through a comprehensive full-factorial simulation. Findings indicate a significant enhancement in shop floor decision-making through reduced overall costs. Moreover, the analysis of the Pareto front reveals trade-offs between minimizing energy and production logistics costs, aiding decision-makers in selecting optimal configurations.</description>
