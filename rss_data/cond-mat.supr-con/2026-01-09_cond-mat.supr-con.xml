      <title>Fluctuation conductivity in ultraclean multicomponent superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the intrinsic fluctuation conductivity in metals with multiply sheeted Fermi surfaces approaching a superconducting critical point. Restricting our attention to extreme type-II multicomponent superconductors motivates focusing on the ultraclean limit. Using functional-integral techniques, we derive the Gaussian fluctuation action from which we obtain the gauge-invariant electromagnetic linear response kernel. This allows us to compute the optical conductivity tensor. We identify essential conditions required for a nonzero longitudinal conductivity at finite frequencies in a disorder-free and translationally invariant system. Specifically, this is neither related to impurity scattering nor electron-phonon interaction, but derives indirectly from the multicomponent character of the incipient superconducting order and the parent metallic state. Under these conditions, the enhancement of the DC conductivity due to fluctuations close to the critical point follows the same critical behaviour as in the diffusive limit.</description>

      <title>Fast Phase Logic Family for Achieving Very Large Scale Integration in Superconductor Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast Phase Logic (FPL) is a novel digital superconductor electronic (SCE) logic family specifically designed to address critical challenges in state-of-the-art SCE, such as low device density and integration levels. The FPL family improves circuit performance by employing various Josephson junction (JJ) structures, including high-$J_c$ self-shunted 0-JJ stacks, $\pi$-JJs, and 0/$\pi$-JJ stacks. FPL utilizes 0- and $\pi$-JJs to replace the bulky geometric inductors required in single flux quantum (SFQ) logic families like RSFQ. The proposed FPL family can deliver up to two orders of magnitude improvement in integration density over RSFQ logic with a five-fold reduction in the bias current requirements. Circuit performance is enhanced with reduced latency and increased throughput. Furthermore, the FPL family provides a higher output voltage level and higher impedance, which better match those of CMOS circuits. The much smaller flux storage loops in FPL greatly reduce susceptibility to trapped flux and crosstalk. Advancements in fabrication processes that would further benefit FPL implementation include the use of NbTiN-based JJs with higher critical current density and fabrication temperature range up to 400~$^\circ$C, or the use of stacked JJ structures. The resulting increased density makes very large-scale integration (VLSI) more practical. The FPL family has the potential to significantly advance SCE technology. Near-term applications are envisioned in accelerator cores for signal processing and artificial intelligence, with long-term potential in supercomputing applications. The advantages of FPL were demonstrated through an architectural study of a fast Fourier transform (FFT) circuit, comparing it with CMOS and SFQ technologies.</description>

      <title>Direct Observation of the Spillover of High Magnetic Field-induced SC3 Superconductivity Outside the Spin-Polarized State in UTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our recent study of the high magnetic field phase landscape of UTe$_2$ [Phys. Rev. X 15, 021019 (2025)] we found indirect evidence that the SC3 superconducting phase spills out beyond the first-order phase boundary of the spin-polarized state. This prior study was limited to a maximal field strength of 41.5 T, and mapped the $b-ac$ rotation plane. Here we measure a high quality sample with residual resistivity ratio RRR = 605 under rotations in the $b-c$ plane up to 45 T. This extended field range helps to unambiguously demonstrate the spillover of SC3 outside the polarized paramagnetic state. This is identified by the observation of zero resistance at low temperatures, for magnetic field strengths lower than the metamagnetic transition field resolved at higher temperatures. This observation is consistent with the scenario that electronic pairing of the SC3 phase is mediated by quantum critical fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Condensation mechanism of high-$T_c$ cuprates: the key role of pairon excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we show that the condensation mechanism in cuprates involves the strong coupling of the condensate to pairon excited states. We present an accessible formalism that significantly extends our previous work, providing a theoretical basis for the energy-dependent gap function $\Delta(E)$. The latter is proportional to the effective spin exchange energy, $J_{eff}$, with no retardation effects, such as the case of spin-fluctuation or phonon mediated couplings. The fundamental parameters of the superconducting (SC) state are the condensation energy per pair, $\beta_c$, and the antinodal energy gap, $\Delta_p$, which are quantitatively extracted by fitting the cuprate quasiparticle spectrum from tunneling experiments.
  An explicit formula for the critical temperature is also derived in the model. Valid for any doping, we find $T_c$ to be proportional to $\beta_c$, and not the gap $\Delta_p$, in sharp contrast to conventional SC. The numerical factor $\beta_c/k_BT_c\simeq 2.24$ originates from pair excitations of the condensate, following Bose statistics, with a mini-gap $\delta_M \simeq 1\,$meV in the excitation spectrum. These results strongly suggest that the same `all-electron' mechanism is at work all along the $T_c$-dome.</description>

      <title>Multigap nodeless superconductivity in Dirac semimetal PdTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PdTe has recently been reported to be a type-II Dirac semimetal while a bulk nodal and surface nodeless superconductivity (SC) has been claimed to coexist. In this work, we applied point-contact spectroscopy (PCS) method to systematically study the superconducting gap in PdTe single crystals with a SC transition temperature $T_{c}=4.3$ K. The obtained differential conductance curves show a common deviation from a single-gap superconducting behavior and can be better fitted by a two-gap Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk model, suggesting the larger gap $\Delta_{L}$ with $2\Delta_{L}$=3.7 $k_{B}T_{c}$ and the smaller gap $\Delta_S$ yielding $2\Delta_{S}$=1.1-2.2 $k_{B}T_{c}$ with a weak interband scattering. The variations of conductance spectra among different contacts are proposed to be caused by the anisotropy of Fermi surface topology associated with different gaps.</description>

      <title>Low-loss Material for Infrared Protection of Cryogenic Quantum Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fragile quantum states of low-temperature quantum applications require protection from infrared radiation caused by higher-temperature stages or other sources. We propose a material system that can efficiently block radiation up to the optical range while transmitting photons at low gigahertz frequencies. It is based on the effect that incident photons are strongly scattered when their wavelength is comparable to the size of particles embedded in a weakly absorbing medium (Mie-scattering). The goal of this work is to tailor the absorption and transmission spectrum of an non-magnetic epoxy resin containing sapphire spheres by simulating its dependence on the size distribution. Additionally, we fabricate several material compositions, characterize them, as well as other materials, at optical, infrared, and gigahertz frequencies. In the infrared region (stop band) the attenuation of the Mie-scattering optimized material is high and comparable to that of other commonly used filter materials. At gigahertz frequencies (pass-band), the prototype filter exhibits a high transmission at millikelvin temperatures, with an insertion loss of less than $0.4\,$dB below $10\,$GHz.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Correlated Electron Molecular Orbital Materials using Graph Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlated electron molecular orbital (CEMO) materials host emergent electronic states built from molecular orbitals localized over clusters of transition metal ions, yet have historically been discovered sporadically and generally been treated as isolated case studies. Here we establish CEMO materials as a systematically discoverable class and introduce a graph-based framework to identify, classify, and organize transition-metal cluster motifs in inorganic solids. Starting from crystal structures in the Materials Project, we construct transition metal connectivity graphs, extract cluster motifs using a bond-cutting algorithm, and determine cluster point groups, effective cluster sublattice dimensionality, and translational symmetry. Applying this approach in a high-throughput screen of 34,548 compounds yields 5,306 cluster-containing materials, including 2,627 stable or metastable compounds with isolated clusters and 984 materials featuring mixed-metal clusters. The resulting dataset reveals symmetry and element-dependent trends in cluster formation. By integrating cluster classification with flat-band lattice topology and battery-relevant information, we provide further relevant information to multiple scientific communities. The accompanying open dataset, Cluster Finder software, and interactive web platform enable systematic exploration of cluster-driven electronic phenomena and establish a general pathway for discovering correlated quantum materials and functional materials with cluster-based or extended metal-metal bonding in inorganic solids.</description>

      <title>Single-enantiomer spin polarisers in superconducting junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral matter acting as a spin-selective device in biased electron transport is attracting attention for the quantum-technological design of miniaturized electronics. To date, however, experimental reports on spin selectivity are not conclusive. The magnetoresistance in electron transport measurements observed for chiral materials on ferromagnets upon magnetisation reversal is proposed to result from electrostatic rather than from the sought-after chiral effects. Recent break junction studies even question the spin-dependent electron flow across single chiral molecules. Here, we avoid ferromagnetic electrodes and magnetisation reversal to provide unambiguous experimental evidence for the chirality-induced spin selectivity effect of single enantiomers. Functionalising the superconducting tip of a scanning tunnelling microscope with a manganese atom cluster gives rise to Yu-Shiba-Rusinov resonances that serve as spin-sensitive probes of the tunnelling current in junctions of single heptahelicene molecules adsorbed on a crystalline lead surface. Our key finding is the dependence of the signal strength of these states in spectroscopy of the differential conductance on the handedness of the molecule. The experiments unveil the role of the enantiomers as spin polarisers and the irrelevance of electrostatics in the chosen model system.</description>

      <title>A First-principles Study of Weyl Nodal Loop and Multiple Sets of Weyl Points in Trigonal PtBi$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coexistence of surface superconductivity and Fermi arcs in trigonal $\gamma$-PtBi$_2$ has recently attracted attention for possible realization of topological superconductivity. The Fermi arcs on the two different (0001) surface terminations have been associated with the set of Weyl points just above the Fermi energy (E$_F$). Here using first-principles calculations to explore the band crossings over the full Brillouin zone between the nominally highest valence and lowest conduction bands in $\gamma$-PtBi$_2$, we find a Weyl nodal loop (WNL) and multiple sets of Weyl points (WPs). The main difference between the two reported experimental structural parameters is the magnitude of Bi-layer buckling. While the WNL, bulk gap region and the set of Weyl points just above the E$_F$ are robust, the number and location of the other sets of WPs depend sensitively on the structural parameters with different magnitude of Bi-layer buckling. Besides calculating the 2D Fermi surface with Fermi arcs and quasi-particle interference (QPI) around the E$_F$ in good agreements with ARPES and experimental QPI, we also predict new Fermi arc features at higher energy.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field-bias current interplay in HgTe-based three-terminal Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate HgTe/Nb-based three-terminal Josephson junctions in T-shaped and X-shaped geometries and their critical current contours (CCCs). By decomposing the CCCs into the contributions from individual junctions, we uncover how bias current and magnetic field jointly determine the collective Josephson behavior. A perpendicular magnetic field induces a tunable crossover between SQUID-like and Fraunhofer-like interference patterns, controlled by the applied bias. Moreover, magnetic flux produces pronounced deformations of the CCC, enabling symmetry control in the $(I_1,I_2)$ plane. Remarkably, we identify a regime of strongly enhanced Josephson diode efficiency, reaching values up to $\eta\approx 0.8$ at low bias and magnetic field. The experimental results are quantitatively reproduced by resistively shunted junction (RSJ) simulations, which capture the coupled dynamics of current and flux in these multi-terminal superconducting systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synthetic platforms afford an unparalleled degree of controllability in realizing strongly-correlated phases of matter. In this work, we study the possibility of electrically tunable exciton-mediated superconductivity arising in charge-imbalanced bilayer semiconductors. Focusing on the case of a bilayer semiconductor heterostructure, we identify the gating conditions required to achieve exciton density wave order within a self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation. We analyze the role of the coupling of excitonic fluctuations to the fermionic charge carriers to find that the Goldstone mode of the density wave order can mediate attractive interactions leading to superconductivity. Furthermore, when the system is close to the density wave ordering, the interactions mediated by low-energy exciton modes can support an interlayer pair-density wave superconductor of anisotropic character. We discuss experimental signatures associated with these phenomena.</description>

      <title>Electronically-controlled one- and two-qubit gates for transmon quasicharge qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting protected qubits aim to achieve sufficiently low error rates so as to allow realization of error-corrected, utility-scale quantum computers. A recent proposal encodes a protected qubit in the quasicharge degree of freedom of the conventional transmon device. Operating such a protected `quasicharge qubit' requires implementing new strategies. Here we show that an electronically-controllable tunnel junction formed by two topological superconductors can be used to implement single- and two-qubit gates on quasicharge qubits. Schemes for both these gates are based on the same dynamical $4\pi$-periodic Josephson effect and therefore have the same gate times and error characteristics. We simulate the dynamics of a topological Josephson junction in a parameter regime with non-negligible charging energy, and characterize the robustness of such gate operations against charge noise. Our results point to a compelling strategy for implementation of quasicharge qubit gates based on junctions of minimal Kitaev chains of quantum dots.</description>
