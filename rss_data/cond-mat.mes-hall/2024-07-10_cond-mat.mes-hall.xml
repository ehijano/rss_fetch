      <title>Bound state-continuum resonance transition in a shallow quantum well</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show a transition from a bound state to a continuum resonance in a shallow quantum well (QW) by electrostatic gating to bend the conduction band edge. This bound state-continuum resonance (BSCR) transition is particularly relevant in topological quantum computing platforms where shallow InAs QWs are used. We predict the observed capacitance jump and the parallel metal-insulator transition accompanied the BSCR transition. An experimental puzzle in shallow InAs QWs is the mobility drop at an electron density smaller than expected for the bound-state second subband occupation. We explain this puzzle as a result of intersubband scattering involving a level-broadened continuum resonance, mediated by screened Coulomb impurities.</description>

      <title>Absence of Majorana oscillations in finite-length full-shell hybrid nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Majorana bound states (MBSs) located at the ends of a hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire are only true zero modes if their characteristic localization length is much smaller than the nanowire length, $\xi_M\ll L$. Otherwise, their wave function overlap gives rise to a finite energy splitting that shows a characteristic oscillatory pattern $\sim e^{-2L/\xi_M}\cos(k_F L)$ versus external parameters that modify the Fermi momentum $k_F$. Detecting such "Majorana oscillations", measurable through low-bias conductance, has been proposed as a strategy for Majorana detection in pristine nanowires. Here we discuss how this detection scheme does not work in full-shell hybrid nanowires, an alternative design to partial-shell nanowires in which a superconductor shell fully wraps the semiconductor core. Using microscopic models, we provide both numerical simulations for Al/InAs hybrids as well as analytical approximations in terms of general nanowire parameters. We find that Majorana oscillations with flux in full-shell nanowires are absent in a wide portion of parameter space. This absence is not a signature of non-overlapping left- and right-end MBSs, but a consequence of the Majorana oscillation period being systematically larger than the flux window of odd Little-Parks lobes where Majorana zero-energy peaks are predicted to appear. Our results demonstrate that split near-zero modes or individual zero-energy crossings should not be dismissed as trivial even if they are found not to oscillate with flux.</description>

      <title>Quantum interference assisted to entanglement in a system of three micropillars within artificial magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quantum phenomena in a system of three coupled microcavities each supporting regime of strong coupling with exciton resonance. The possibility of observing polariton blockade in a dimer and triple micropillar configuration is discussed. We identify the resonance conditions corresponding to the onset of the photon blockade. The discovered quantum effects allow using these systems as versatile sources of individual polaritons. Various manifestations of the quantum blockade can be tuned with the use of the pumping laser frequency. We demonstrate that the presence of the cascade coupling between pillars enhances manifestations of sub-Poissonian statistics. Application of the effective gauge field in the triangle configuration allows for manifestation of a collective antibunching effect. In particular, we identify conditions of a multimode blockade -- a phenomenon consisting in blocking of excitation of the state with $n$ particles distributed over multiple coupled modes. A new effect of quantum entanglement of a non-Hermitian dimer with a micropillar in an artificial magnetic field has been discovered, associated with the simultaneous manifestation of antibunching on the dimer, the micropillar associated with it, and the triple-micropillar.</description>

      <title>Packing fraction related transport in disordered quantum dot arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models to describe electrical conduction in quantum dot (QD) constituted films often overlook the effects of geometric disorder. We address related issues by examining the influence of the QD packing fraction (PF) on the charge transport and transmission in QD arrays. Using transfer matrix based algorithms and Monte Carlo simulations, we quantify the transmission across disordered QD assemblies. Our results indicate a critical packing fraction ($PF_c $) of $\sim$ 0.64, marking a transition from a non-conducting to a conducting state, aligning well with experimental observations and analytical predictions. This study enhances the understanding of transport in QD arrays, with implications for designing efficient electronic devices based on disordered nanoscale systems.</description>

      <title>Dependence of strength of spin-orbit interaction on polarity of interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was experimentally observed that both magnetic anisotropy and spin-orbit interaction strength change when the magnetization of the nanomagnet is reversed. This indicates a variation in spin-orbit interaction strength depending on whether the magnetic field penetrates the interface from a ferromagnetic to a non-magnetic metal or vice versa. Systematic measurements of over 100 nanomagnets revealed a consistent, yet unexpected, pattern between variations in magnetic anisotropy and spin-orbit interactions with magnetization reversal. These changes align along a single straight line with a negative slope, suggesting a complex and indirect relationship. Our findings also suggest the presence of an additional, yet-to-be-identified effect that influences the change in magnetic anisotropy with magnetization reversal, beyond the variations in spin-orbit interaction strength. This finding highlights the complexity of magnetic behavior at the nanoscale and the critical role of magnetization direction in determining anisotropic properties.</description>

      <title>The quantum metric of electrons with spin-momentum locking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum materials are characterized by electromagnetic responses intrinsically linked to the geometry and topology of the electronic wavefunctions. These properties are encoded in the quantum metric and Berry curvature. While Berry curvature-mediated transport effects such as the anomalous and nonlinear Hall effects have been identified in several magnetic and nonmagnetic systems, quantum metric-induced transport phenomena remain limited to topological antiferromagnets. Here we show that spin-momentum locking -- a general characteristic of the electronic states at surfaces and interfaces of spin-orbit coupled materials -- leads to a nontrivial quantum metric. This metric activates a nonlinear in-plane magnetoresistance that we measure and electrically control in 111-oriented LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interfaces. These findings demonstrate the existence of quantum metric effects in a vast class of materials and provide new strategies to design functionalities based on the quantum geometry.</description>

      <title>3D Imaging of directional multi-scale cellulose nanostructures through multi-directional dark-field neutron tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hierarchical biomaterials embody nature's intricate design principles, offering advanced functionalities through the complex, multi-level organization of their molecular and nanosized building blocks. However, the comprehensive characterization of their 3D structure remains a challenge, particularly due to radiation damage caused by conventional X-ray- and electron-based imaging techniques, as well as due to the length scale limitations of scattering-based investigation methods. Here, we present a study utilizing multi-directional dark-field neutron imaging in tomographic mode to visualize the 3D nanoarchitecture of nanocellulose solid foams, a class of sustainable materials possessing complex and highly tunable hierarchical structures. By exploiting the unique properties of neutrons as a probe, this non-destructive method circumvents the inherent limitations of damage-inducing ionizing radiation, preserving the structural and chemical integrity of the biomaterials, and allowing for truly multiscale characterization of the spatial orientation and distribution of cellulose nano fibrils within large-volume samples. In particular, the study showcases the 3-dimensional anisotropic orientation and degree of alignment of nanofibrils with different crystallinity, across various length scales, from nanometers to centimeters. This approach offers a valuable and generally applicable tool for multi-scale characterisation of biobased materials where complex nanoscale arrangements inform macroscopic properties.</description>

      <title>Interference of ultrahigh frequency acoustic phonons from distant quasi-continuous sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of propagating acoustic waves is essential for telecommunication applications, quantum technologies, and sensing. Up to now, the electrical generation has been at the core of most implementations, but is technologically limited to a few gigahertz. Overcoming this frequency limit holds the prospect of faster modulators, quantum acoustics at higher working temperatures, nanoacoustic sensing from smaller volumes. Alternatively, the optical excitation of acoustic resonators has unlocked frequencies up to 1 THz, but in most cases, the acoustic energy cannot be efficiently extracted from the resonator into a propagating wave. Here, we demonstrate a quasi-continuous and coherent source of 20 GHz acoustic phonons, based on a ridge waveguide, structured in the vertical direction as a high-Q acousto-optic resonator. The high frequency phonons propagate up to 20 $\mu$m away from the source, with a decay rate of $\sim$1.14 dB/$\mu$m. We demonstrate the coherence between acoustic phonons generated from two distant sources through spatio-temporal interference. This concept could be scaled up to a larger number of sources, which enable a new generation of optically programmed, reconfigurable nanoacoustic devices and applications.</description>

      <title>Emerging Majorana bound states in superconducting Haldane nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the topological phase diagram of the $p$-wave superconducting Haldane model. In two dimensions, we find a topological nodal superconducting phase, which exhibits a chiral Majorana mode propagating along the edges of nanoribbons with cylindrical boundary conditions. This phase is however unstable in a finite two-dimensional rectangular-shaped lattice, yielding corner states close to zero energy in a flake with alternating zigzag and armchair edges. When we reduce one of the dimensions, quantum confinement gaps out the bulk bands faster than the edge states. In this scenario, hybridization between the edge states can then result in Majorana zero modes. Our results hence suggest quantum confinement as a crucial ingredient in building quasi-one-dimensional topological superconducting phases out of two-dimensional nodal topological superconductors. Furthermore, we characterize the emergence of this novel topological phase by means of its topological invariant, coinciding with a quantized conductance of $2 e^2/h$ in a normal-superconducting junction.</description>

      <title>Manipulation and trapping of magnetic skyrmions with domain walls in chiral magnetic thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we use chiral domain walls to manipulate and trap magnetic skyrmion quasi-particles in chiral magnetic materials such as ultrathin Co/Pt films. The magnetic skyrmions can be orientated such that their interaction with domain walls is repulsive, allowing for them to be stored between domain walls. In certain orientations, the skyrmion can be absorbed into the domain wall, forming a domain wall kink. In other orientations, it can absorbed to form a kink-antikink domain wall with zero topological charge. The magnetic skyrmion can even be orientated in such a way that it remains trapped but creates a topological defect-antidefect pair in one of the walls. By altering the phases of one of the chiral domain walls, one can erase or store the magnetic skyrmion as an isolated soliton or as a domain wall skyrmion/antiskyrmion. This adds a valuable asset to an ever growing toolbox of spintronic nano-devices.</description>

      <title>Structural Superlubricity at High Sliding Speeds under Ambient Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural superlubricity is an intriguing physical phenomenon, whereby sliding at a structurally incommensurate, atomically flat interface yields vanishingly small friction forces. Despite its recent experimental validation, critical questions remain regarding the physical limitations of the concept. In particular, it is not known whether the ultra-low friction state would persist at high sliding speeds relevant for practical, small-scale mechanical systems. Here, we perform sliding experiments via atomic force microscopy on gold nanoislands on graphite at increasing speeds, extracting interfacial friction forces under ambient conditions. A heterodyne detection methodology enables the extraction of extremely weak friction signals buried deep in the noise, revealing that the structurally superlubric regime extends over 100,000 nm/s with minimal changes in friction force, spanning three orders of magnitude in sliding speed. Our results contribute significantly to the pursuit of functional, superlubric mechanical devices.</description>

      <title>Coulomb drag by motion of a monolayer polar crystal through graphene nano-constriction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that motion of a polar crystalline layer between two graphene planes exerts Coulomb drag on electrons in graphene, inducing DC-drag current. The physical mechanism of the drag relies on the intervalley scattering of charge carriers in graphene by the time-dependent potential of the moving crystalline layer. In turn, the drag of electrons in graphene exercises the back-action on the crystalline layer, which can be expressed in terms of increased dynamic viscosity. The drag effect requires a finite threshold doping of graphene. Estimations of the drag effect for the layer of square ice shows that the doping level needed to observe the drag effect is within the reach of modern experiments.</description>

      <title>Quasiperiodicity protects quantized transport in disordered systems without gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The robustness of topological properties, such as adiabatic quantized currents, generally depends on the existence of gaps surrounding the relevant energy levels or symmetry-forbidden transitions. We uncover a new mechanism for topological protection via the observation of quantized currents which survive the addition of bounded local disorder large enough to close the relevant instantaneous energy gaps in a driven Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper chain, a prototypical model of quasiperiodic systems. Using a local picture in configuration-space based on Landau-Zener transitions, we show that in this case the topological protection does not depend on the spectral gaps, but rather on the number of states in an occupied band and the position of the band in configuration space. Moreover, we propose a protocol, realizable in cold atoms or photonic experiments, which leverages this stability to prepare topological many-body states with high Chern number and open new experimental avenues for the study of both the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects.</description>

      <title>Interplay between Majorana and Shiba states in a minimal Kitaev chain coupled to a superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two semiconducting quantum dots (QDs) coupled through a superconductor constitute a minimal realisation of a Kitaev chain with Majorana zero modes (MZMs). Such MZMs can be detected by e.g., tunneling conductance between each QD and normal leads [Dvir et al, Nature 614, 445 (2023)]. We here discuss how the seemingly trivial substitution of one of the normal leads by a superconducting (SC) one gives rise to a plethora of new effects. In particular, the coupling to the SC lead induces non-local Majorana effects upon variations of the QDs' energies. Furthermore, the lowest excitation of the chain is no longer determined by the bulk gap but rather by the energy of an emergent subgap Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) state coexisting with the MZMs. The YSR state hybridizes with the MZMs when the coupling between the SC and the QD is larger than the spin splitting, spoiling the Majorana properties, including the quantized conductance.</description>

      <title>Dirac cones and magic angles in the Bistritzer--MacDonald TBG Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the generic existence of Dirac cones in the full Bistritzer--MacDonald Hamiltonian for twisted bilayer graphene. Its complementary set, when Dirac cones are absent, is the set of magic angles. We show the stability of magic angles obtained in the chiral limit by demonstrating that the perfectly flat bands transform into quadratic band crossings when perturbing away from the chiral limit. Moreover, using the invariance of Euler number, we show that at magic angles there are more band crossings beyond these quadratic band crossings. This is the first result showing the existence of magic angles for the full Bistritzer--MacDonald Hamiltonian and solves Open Problem No.2 proposed in the recent survey arXiv:2310.20642.</description>

      <title>Precision frequency tuning of tunable transmon qubits using alternating-bias assisted annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting quantum processors are one of the leading platforms for realizing scalable fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC). The recent demonstration of post-fabrication tuning of Josephson junctions using alternating-bias assisted annealing (ABAA) technique and a reduction in junction loss after ABAA illuminates a promising path towards precision tuning of qubit frequency while maintaining high coherence. Here, we demonstrate precision tuning of the maximum $|0\rangle\rightarrow |1\rangle$ transition frequency ($f_{01}^{\rm max}$) of tunable transmon qubits by performing ABAA at room temperature using commercially available test equipment. We characterize the impact of junction relaxation and aging on resistance spread after tuning, and demonstrate a frequency equivalent tuning precision of 7.7 MHz ($0.17\%$) based on targeted resistance tuning on hundreds of qubits, with a resistance tuning range up to $18.5\%$. Cryogenic measurements on tuned and untuned qubits show evidence of improved coherence after ABAA with no significant impact on tunability. Despite a small global offset, we show an empirical $f_{01}^{\rm max}$ tuning precision of 18.4 MHz by tuning a set of multi-qubit processors targeting their designed Hamiltonians. We experimentally characterize high-fidelity parametric resonance iSWAP gates on two ABAA-tuned 9-qubit processors with fidelity as high as $99.51\pm 0.20\%$. On the best-performing device, we measured across the device a median fidelity of $99.22\%$ and an average fidelity of $99.13\pm 0.12 \%$. Yield modeling analysis predicts high detuning-edge-yield using ABAA beyond the 1000-qubit scale. These results demonstrate the cutting-edge capability of frequency targeting using ABAA and open up a new avenue to systematically improving Hamiltonian targeting and optimization for scaling high-performance superconducting quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Spin-Orbit Torques from Sputtered MoTe2 Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials with strong spin-orbit coupling and low crystalline symmetry are promising for generating large unconventional spin-orbit torques (SOTs), such as in-plane field-like (FL) torques and out-of-plane damping-like (DL) torques, which can effectively manipulate and deterministically switch an out-of-plane magnetization without the need for additional external in-plane magnetic fields. Here, we report SOTs generated by magnetron-sputtered 1T' MoTe2/Permalloy (Py; Ni80Fe20)/MgO heterostructures using both spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) and second harmonic Hall measurements. We observed unconventional FL and DL torques in our samples due to spins polarized normal to the interface of MoTe2 and Py layers, and studied the influence of crystallographic order and MoTe2 layer thickness on the SOTs. By comparing the Raman spectra of 1T' MoTe2 samples prepared in different ways, we found a tensile strain in sputtered MoTe2 films, which might further enhance the generation of unconventional torques by reducing the symmetry of 1T' MoTe2.</description>

      <title>Luttinger liquid tensor network: sine versus tangent dispersion of massless Dirac fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To apply the powerful many-body techniques of tensor networks to massless Dirac fermions one wants to discretize the $p\cdot\sigma$ Hamiltonian and construct a matrix-product-operator (MPO) representation. We compare two alternative discretization schemes, one with a sine dispersion, the other with a tangent dispersion, applied to a one-dimensional Luttinger liquid with Hubbard interaction. Both types of lattice fermions allow for an exact MPO representation of low bond dimension, so they are efficiently computable, but only the tangent dispersion gives a power law decay of the propagator in agreement with the continuum limit: The sine dispersion is gapped by the interactions, evidenced by an exponentially decaying propagator. Our construction of a tensor network with an unpaired Dirac cone works around the fermion-doubling obstruction by exploiting the fact that the \textit{nonlocal} Hamiltonian of tangent fermions permits a \textit{local} generalized eigenproblem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a perturbative approach for studying a class of multi-level time-dependent quantum systems with constant off-diagonal couplings and diabatic energies being odd functions of time. Applying this approach to a general multistate Landau-Zener (MLZ) model with all diabatic levels crossing at one point (named the one-crossing MLZ model), we derive analytical formulas of all its transition probabilities up to $4$th order in the couplings. These analytical asymptotic solutions at the diabatic limit can serve as reliable benchmarks for future studies of any unsolved one-crossing MLZ models.</description>

      <title>Lattice-tunable substituted iron garnets for low-temperature magnonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetic resonance of iron garnets is at the heart of rich physics and provides a crucial technology used inside microwave components. A barrier still stands in the way of integrated cryogenic devices with iron garnets, because their epitaxy requires paramagnetic substrates that cause large microwave losses at low temperatures. Finding alternative combinations of substrates and magnetic garnets is thus essential to enabling cryogenic integrated magnonics. With this motivation, we develop a new approach to the synthesis of epitaxial garnet films, based on the co-sputtering of binary oxides, enabling a precise and continuous tuning of the iron garnet composition. By substituting a controlled proportion of the iron with additional yttrium, we obtain Y$_{3}$(Y$_{x}$Fe$_{5-x}$)O$_{12}$ films of high crystalline quality that can be lattice-matched to yttrium scandium gallium garnet (YSGG), a diamagnetic substrate suitable for low-temperature applications. Ferromagnetic resonance performed at low temperatures confirms the elimination of substrate paramagnetism losses on YSGG. We also show that the Y$_{3}$(Y$_{x}$Fe$_{5-x}$)O$_{12}$ system can be matched to other substrates, such as gadolinium yttrium scandium gallium garnet and gadolinium scandium gallium garnet. Additionally, we demonstrate that Bi-substituted films of (Bi$_{0.8}$Y$_{2.2}$)Fe$_{5}$O$_{12}$ also offer ideal lattice matching to YSGG for low-temperature magnetic resonance. The present approach of controlled substitutions in iron garnets to obtain ideal lattice matching with diamagnetic substrates opens a very promising pathway to magnonic devices operating in low-temperature environments.</description>

      <title>Treatment of the strongly correlated topological superconductors through the $su(2|1)$ path-integral technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07022v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that topological superconductivity can be produced by strong electron-electron (e-e) interaction in two minimal one (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) models containing only nearest neighbor hopping and suitable superconducting order parameters. The presence of the strong e-e interaction constrains each atomic site to be either empty or singly occupied. One can treat this scenario by fractionalizing the electrons into spin and charge degrees of freedom. We use the coherent state symbols associated with the lowest irreducible representation of the $su(2|1)$ superalgebra spanned by the Hubbard operators to solve the proposed models, as they implicitly take into account both the single particle occupation constraint and the fractionalization of the electrons. Our two example display the emergence of topological superconductivity in an 1D nanowire with extended $s$-wave superconductivity, and in a 2D square lattice with $p$-wave superconductivity.</description>

Abstract: The topological magneto-electric effect (TME) is a characteristic property of topological insulators. In this article, we use a simplified coupled-Dirac-cone electronic structure model to theoretically evaluate the THz and far infrared Kerr and Faraday responses of thin films of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ with up to $N=10$ septuple layers with the goal of clarifying the relationship between these convenient magneto-optical observables and the TME. We find that for even $N$ the linear Kerr and Faraday responses to an electric field vanish in the low-frequency limit, even though the magnetoelectric response is large and approximately quantized.</description>

      <title>Non-universal surface magnetoelectric response in antiferromagnetic topological insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electronic ground state of a three-dimensional (3D) band insulator with time-reversal ($\Theta$) symmetry or time-reversal times a discrete translation ($\Theta T_{1/2}$) symmetry is classified by a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-valued topological invariant and characterized by quantized magnetoelectric response. Here we demonstrate by explicit calculation in model $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological insulator thin-films that whereas the magnetoelectric response is localized at the surface in the $\Theta$ symmetry (non-magnetic) case, it is non-universally partitioned between surface and interior contributions in the $\Theta T_{1/2}$ (anti-ferromagnetic) case, while remaining quantized. Within our model the magnetic field induced polarization arises entirely from an anomalous ${\cal N}=0$ Landau level subspace within which the projected Hamiltonian is a generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model whose topological properties are consistent with those of the starting 3D model. We identify a novel connection between the ground state geometry of that 3D model and surface-interior-partitioning in thin films.</description>

      <title>Surface induced odd-frequency spin-triplet superconductivity as a veritable signature of Majorana bound states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We predict surface-induced odd-frequency (odd-$\nu$) spin-triplet superconducting pairing can be a veritable signature of Majorana bound states (MBS) in a Josephson nodal $p$-wave superconductor ($p_{x}$)-spin flipper (SF)-nodal $p$-wave superconductor ($p_{x}$) junction. Remarkably, in a $p_{x}$-SF-$p_{x}$ Josephson junction three distinct phases emerge: the topological phase featuring MBS, the topological phase without MBS, and the trivial phase devoid of MBS. Surface odd-$\nu$ spin-triplet pairing is induced only in the topological regime when MBS appears. In contrast, surface-induced even-frequency (even-$\nu$) spin-triplet pairing is finite regardless of the existence of MBS. Importantly, we find the surface induced odd-$\nu$ spin-triplet pairing is immune to disorder in the topological phase featuring MBS, while in the trivial phase the surface induced even-$\nu$ spin-triplet pairing is affected by disorder. Our study offers a potential means for distinguishing the topological phase featuring MBS from both the trivial phase as well as the topological phase devoid of MBS, primarily through the observation of induced surface odd-$\nu$ spin-triplet superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Synthetic iterative scheme for thermal applications in hotspot systems with large temperature variance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A synthetic iterative scheme is developed for thermal applications in hotspot systems with large temperature variance. Different from previous work with linearized equilibrium state and small temperature difference assumption, the phonon equilibrium distribution shows a nonlinear relationship with temperature and mean free path changes with the spatial temperature when the temperature difference of system is large, so that the same phonon mode may suffer different transport processes in different geometric regions. In order to efficiently capture nonlinear and multiscale thermal behaviors, the Newton method is used and a macroscopic iteration is introduced for preprocessing based on the iterative solutions of the stationary phonon BTE. Macroscopic and mesoscopic physical evolution processes are connected by the heat flux, which is no longer calculated by classical Fourier's law but obtained by taking the moment of phonon distribution function. These two processes exchange information from different scales, such that the present scheme could efficiently deal with heat conduction problems from ballistic to diffusive regime. Numerical tests show that the present scheme could efficiently capture the multiscale heat conduction in hotspot systems with large temperature variances. In addition, a comparison is made between the solutions of the present scheme and effective Fourier's law by several heat dissipations problems under different sizes or selective phonon excitation. Numerical results show that compared to the classical Fourier's law, the results of the effective Fourier's law could be closer to the BTE solutions by adjusting effective coefficients. However, it is still difficult to capture some local nonlinear phenomena in complex geometries.</description>

Abstract: We study a model of electrons moving in a parent band of uniform Berry curvature. At sufficiently high parent Berry curvature, we show that strong repulsive interactions generically lead to the formation of an anomalous Hall crystal: a topological state with spontaneously broken continuous translation symmetry. Our results are established via a mapping to a problem of Wigner crystallization in a regular 2D electron gas. Interestingly, we find that a periodic electrostatic potential induces a competing state with opposite Chern number. Our theory offers a unified perspective for understanding several aspects of the recently observed integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects in rhombohedral multilayer graphene and provides a recipe for engineering new topological states.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the intrinsic contribution of nonlinear magnon thermal Hall Effect. We derive the intrinsic second order thermal Hall conductivity of magnon by the thermal scalar potential (TSP) method and the thermal vector potential (TVP) method. We find that the intrinsic second order magnon thermal Hall conductivity is related to the thermal Berry-connection polarizability (TBCP). We apply our theory to the monolayer ferromagnetic Hexagonal lattice, and we find that the second order magnon thermal Hall conductivity can be controlled by changing Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya strength and applying strain.</description>

      <title>Independent-oscillator model and the quantum Langevin equation for an oscillator: A review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This review provides a brief and quick introduction to the quantum Langevin equation for an oscillator, while focusing on the steady-state thermodynamic aspects. A derivation of the quantum Langevin equation is carefully outlined based on the microscopic model of the heat bath as a collection of a large number of independent quantum oscillators, the so-called independent-oscillator model. This is followed by a discussion on the relevant `weak-coupling' limit. In the steady state, we analyze the quantum counterpart of energy equipartition theorem which has generated a considerable amount of interest in recent literature. The free energy, entropy, specific heat, and third law of thermodynamics are discussed for one-dimensional quantum Brownian motion in a harmonic well. Following this, we explore some aspects of dissipative diamagnetism in the context of quantum Brownian oscillators, emphasizing upon the role of confining potentials and also upon the environment-induced classical-quantum crossover. We discuss situations where the system-bath coupling is via the momentum variables by focusing on a gauge-invariant model of momentum-momentum coupling in the presence of a vector potential; for this problem, we derive the quantum Langevin equation and discuss quantum thermodynamic functions. Finally, the topic of fluctuation theorems is discussed (albeit, briefly) in the context of classical and quantum cyclotron motion of a particle coupled to a heat bath.</description>

      <title>Signatures of electronic ordering in transport in graphene flat bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a wide family of electronic orders was unveiled in graphene flat bands, such as spin- and valley-polarized phases as well as nematic momentum-polarized phases, stabilized by exchange interactions via a generalized Stoner mechanism. Momentum polarization involves orbital degrees of freedom and is therefore expected to impact resistivity in a way that is uniquely sensitive to the ordering type. Under pocket polarization, carrier distribution shifts in $k$ space and samples the band mass in regions defined by the displaced momentum distribution. This makes transport coefficients sensitive to pocket polarization, resulting in the Ohmic resistivity decreasing with temperature. In addition, it leads to current switching and hysteresis under strong $E$ field. Being robust in the presence of electron-phonon scattering, this behavior can serve as a telltale sign of pocket polarization order. The fast timescale and low dissipation of the switching cycle may be advantageous for highly applicable memory-dependent resistors, i.e., memristors.</description>

      <title>Quantum criticality and Kibble-Zurek scaling in the Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Stark model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore quantum criticality and Kibble-Zurek scaling (KZS) in the Aubry-Andre-Stark (AAS) model, where the Stark field of strength $\varepsilon$ is added onto the one-dimensional quasiperiodic lattice. We perform scaling analysis and numerical calculations of the localization length, inverse participation ratio (IPR), and energy gap between the ground and first excited states to characterize critical properties of the delocalization-localization transition. Remarkably, our scaling analysis shows that, near the critical point, the localization length $\xi$ scales with $\varepsilon$ as $\xi\propto\varepsilon^{-\nu}$ with $\nu\approx0.3$ a new critical exponent for the AAS model, which is different from the counterparts for both the pure Aubry-Andre (AA) model and Stark model. The IPR $\mathcal{I}$ scales as $\mathcal{I}\propto\varepsilon^{s}$ with the critical exponent $s\approx0.098$, which is also different from both two pure models. The energy gap $\Delta E$ scales as $\Delta E\propto \varepsilon^{\nu z}$ with the same critical exponent $z\approx2.374$ as that for the pure AA model. We further reveal hybrid scaling functions in the overlap between the critical regions of the Anderson and Stark localizations. Moreover, we investigate the driven dynamics of the localization transitions in the AAS model. By linearly changing the Stark (quasiperiodic) potential, we calculate the evolution of the localization length and the IPR, and study their dependence on the driving rate. We find that the driven dynamics from the ground state is well described by the KZS with the critical exponents obtained from the static scaling analysis. When both the Stark and quasiperiodic potentials are relevant, the KZS form includes the two scaling variables. This work extends our understanding of critical phenomena on localization transitions and generalizes the application of the KZS to hybrid models.</description>

Abstract: Understanding how interacting particles approach thermal equilibrium is a major challenge of quantum simulators. Unlocking the full potential of such systems toward this goal requires flexible initial state preparation, precise time evolution, and extensive probes for final state characterization. We present a quantum simulator comprising 69 superconducting qubits which supports both universal quantum gates and high-fidelity analog evolution, with performance beyond the reach of classical simulation in cross-entropy benchmarking experiments. Emulating a two-dimensional (2D) XY quantum magnet, we leverage a wide range of measurement techniques to study quantum states after ramps from an antiferromagnetic initial state. We observe signatures of the classical Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition, as well as strong deviations from Kibble-Zurek scaling predictions attributed to the interplay between quantum and classical coarsening of the correlated domains. This interpretation is corroborated by injecting variable energy density into the initial state, which enables studying the effects of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) in targeted parts of the eigenspectrum. Finally, we digitally prepare the system in pairwise-entangled dimer states and image the transport of energy and vorticity during thermalization. These results establish the efficacy of superconducting analog-digital quantum processors for preparing states across many-body spectra and unveiling their thermalization dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Topological superconductivity (TSC) is a promising platform to host Majorana zero mode (MZM) for topological quantum computing. Recently, the noble metal alloy AuSn$_{4}$ has been identified as an intrinsic surface TSC. However, the atomic visualization of its nontrivial surface states and MZM remains elusive. Here, we report the direct observation of unconventional surface states and vortex zero mode at the gold (Au) terminated surfaces of AuSn$_{4}$, by ultra-low scanning tunneling microscope/spectroscopy. Distinct from the trivial metallic bulk states at tin (Sn) surfaces, the Au terminated surface exhibits pronounced surface states near Fermi level. Our density functional theory calculations indicate that these states arise from unconventional Rashba bands, where two Fermi circles from different bands share identical helical spin textures, chiralities, and group velocities in the same direction. Furthermore, we find that although the superconducting gap, critical temperature, anisotropic in-plane critical field are almost identical on Au and Sn terminated surfaces, the in-gap bound states inside Abrikosov vortex cores show significant differences. The vortex on Sn terminated surfaces exhibits a conventional Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon bound state while the Au surface shows a sharp zero-energy core state with a long non-splitting distance, resembling an MZM in a non-quantum-limit condition. This distinction may result from the dominant contribution of unconventional Rashba bands near Fermi energy from Au terminated surface. Our results provide a new platform for studying unconventional Rashba band and MZM in superconductors.</description>
