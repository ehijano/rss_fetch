      <title>Effect of variable relative permittivity on the thermodynamics of asymmetric valency aqueous salts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimentally determined empirical formulae for the concentration dependent relative permittivity of aqueous solutions of MgCl$_{2}$ and NiCl$_{2}$ are utilized to calculate the osmotic coefficient and the mean activity coefficient of these salts for a range of concentrations. The systems are modelled using the primitive model of electrolytes and analyzed using the symmetric Poisson-Boltzmann theory, the modified Poisson-Boltzmann theory, the mean spherical approximation, and the Monte Carlo simulations. Generally, the mean spherical approximation and the modified Poisson-Boltzmann theory reproduce the benchmark simulation data well up to $\sim $1.6 mol/dm$^{3}$ or more in many instances, while the symmetric Poisson-Boltzmann results show discrepancies starting from $\sim $0.25 mol/dm$^{3}$. Both the simulations and the theories tend to deviate from the corresponding experimental results beyond $\sim $1 mol/kg.</description>

      <title>The crack pattern of indented cohesive granular media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cohesive granular materials, like wet sand, retain their shape before yielding under stress. This solid-like behavior is associated with elasticity. As the loading increases, the material typically flows. However, cohesive materials can also develop cracks, similar to those observed in brittle materials. This study explores the formation of cracks during the indentation of a granular pile. A solid cylindrical indenter is pushed quasi-statically into the wet granular medium, causing radial cracks to appear. These cracks resemble mode I cracks observed in brittle solid materials. We characterize the crack pattern through direct observation and three-dimensional X-ray micro-tomography. Notably, we highlight the correlation between the dilation of the material during shearing and the appearance of cracks.</description>

      <title>On the constitutive behavior of linear viscoelastic solids under the plane stress condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent experimental and analytical developments enabling high-fidelity material characterization of (heterogeneous) sheet-like solid specimens, we seek to elucidate the constitutive behavior of linear viscoelastic solids under the plane stress condition. More specifically, our goal is to expose the relationship between the plane-stress viscoelastic constitutive parameters and their (native) ``bulk'' counterparts. To facilitate the sought reduction of the three-dimensional (3D) constitutive behavior, we deploy the concept of projection operators and focus on the frequency-domain behavior by resorting to the Fourier transform and the mathematical framework of tempered distributions, which extends the Fourier analysis to functions (common in linear viscoelasticity) for which Fourier integrals are not convergent. In the analysis, our primary focus is the on class of linear viscoelastic solids whose 3D rheological behavior is described by a set of constant-coefficient ordinary differential equations, each corresponding to a generic arrangement of ``springs'' and ``dashpots''. On reducing the general formulation to the isotropic case, we proceed with an in-depth investigation of viscoelastic solids whose bulk and shear modulus each derive from a suite of classical ``spring and dashpot'' configurations. To enable faithful reconstruction of the 3D constitutive parameters of natural and engineered solids via (i) thin-sheet testing and (ii) applications of the error-in-constitutive-relation approach to the inversion of (kinematic) sensory data, we also examine the reduction of thermodynamic potentials describing linear viscoelasticity under the plane stress condition. The analysis is complemented by a set of analytical and numerical examples, illustrating the effect on the plane stress condition on the behavior of isotropic and anisotropic viscoelastic solids.</description>

      <title>Rubber Wear: History, Mechanisms, and Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive review of wear mechanisms, with a primary focus on rubber wear under sliding conditions. Beginning with classical wear theories, including the Archard and Rabinowicz models, we analyze their applicability to both metals and elastomers and discuss extensions relevant to elastic contact and multiscale surface roughness. Various experimental studies on rubber, such as abrasion by sharp tools, erosion by particle impact, and wear during sliding on rough substrates, are reviewed and interpreted. The effects of environmental factors, such as oxygen and lubrication, are also discussed. In addition, we review a recently proposed wear model based on fatigue crack growth within asperity contact regions, which accounts for energy dissipation and multiscale interactions. This model explains the wide variability in the wear coefficient and predicts wear rates consistent with experimental observations across a broad range of conditions. It also explains the formation mechanism and provides the size distribution of rubber wear particles, from micrometer-scale up to severe cut-chip-chunk (CCC) wear. The results have implications for tire wear and the environmental impact of microscale wear debris (microplastics).</description>

      <title>Topological kicks enhance colloidal diffusivity in topological turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colloidal inclusions in nematic fluids induce topological defects that govern their dynamics. These defects create well-understood rheological behavior in passive nematics, but the interplay between colloid-associated defects and spontaneously generated activity-induced defects introduces new dynamical regimes in active nematic turbulence. Using mesoscale simulations, we study the motion of colloids with strong anchoring in an active nematic and find effective colloid diffusivity exhibits a striking non-monotonic dependence on activity. At low activities, topological kicks from the motile activity-induced bulk defects drive frequent rearrangements of the colloid-associated defects, enhancing colloidal transport. At high activity, defect interactions become isotropic, decorrelating colloidal motion and reducing the effective diffusivity. Our results reveal how the competition between colloid-associated and activity-induced defects fundamentally shapes transport in active nematics.</description>

      <title>Excitability and travelling waves in renewable active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Activity and renewability are distinctive features of living matter, and constitute a new class of materials that we term renewable active matter. A striking example is the cell cytoskeleton, where myosin filaments bind to the actin meshwork, apply contractile stresses and undergo continual stress/strain dependent turnover, thus acting as both force generators and sensors. As a consequence of nonreciprocity, arising from the independence of action and response, such living matter exhibits unusual mechanical properties like, segregation without attraction, fragility and force chains. Here we show that the interplay between activity and turnover gives rise to mechanical excitability in the form of travelling waves and pulses, and spatiotemporal chaos. We provide a systematic study of the nucleation, movement and shape of the travelling pulse, and present a boundary layer analysis to establish the existence of homoclinic orbits. Our analytical results are supported by detailed numerical analysis of the governing partial differential equations. This study has implications for the observed mechanical excitability in a variety of cellular contexts such as in isolated adherent cells and confluent cells within tissues.</description>

      <title>A collision model for very flexible Cosserat rods and immersed-boundary fluid-structure coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents a constraint-based collision model for Cosserat rods, able to handle dynamic or static contact between a large number of highly flexible structures. The model provides the required collision impulses prior to updating the solution of the rods, with the impulses accounted for as external loads. The procedure avoids the need to modify the structure solver itself and circumvents any iteration between the collision model and the solver for the Cosserat rods, maintaining the efficiency of any chosen Cosserat solver. The collision model is adopted from Tschisgale et al. (Arch. Appl. Mech., 2019) and extended towards higher stability, which is found necessary in the case of very flexible rods. Furthermore, the model is supplemented with additional terms that arise when the colliding rods are immersed in a fluid. The latter is accounted for by an immersed-boundary method. A large number of tests are conducted to demonstrate the functionality of the final model.</description>

      <title>TopoGEN: topology-driven microstructure generation for in silico modeling of fiber network mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fields of mechanobiology and biomechanics are expanding our understanding of the complex behavior of soft biological tissues across multiple scales. Given the intricate connection between tissue microstructure and its macroscale mechanical behavior, unraveling this mechanistic relationship remains an ongoing challenge. Reconstituted fiber networks serve as valuable in vitro models to simplify the intricacy of in vivo systems for targeted investigations. Concurrently, advances in imaging enable microstructure visualization and, through generative pipelines, modeling as discrete element networks. These mesoscale models provide insights into macroscale tissue behavior. However, a systematic study of how microstructural variations influence nonlinear tissue mechanics is still lacking. In this work, we develop a novel framework to generate topologically-driven discrete fiber networks. Leveraging these networks, we generate models of interconnected load-bearing fiber components that exhibit softening under compression and are bending-resistant. By virtually replicating microstructural features of reconstituted collagen networks, such as fiber volume fractions and cross-link concentration, we evaluate the robustness of our simulations. Analyzing the nonlinear elastic behavior at varying polymerization temperatures, we find consistency between the in silico results and in vitro data from the literature. We extend our investigation beyond empirically measurable factors to explore microstructural effects at the single fiber level (i.e., fibril morphology and stiffness) that are challenging to investigate experimentally. TopoGEN allows us to mechanistically explore localized microstructural phenomena and relate microstructural changes to the bulk mechanical response of soft biological materials, hence providing an indispensable tool to advance the fields of tissue biomechanics and engineering.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamics of air invasion in one-dimensional compliant fluid networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vascular networks exhibit a remarkable diversity of architectures and transport mechanisms across biological systems. Inspired by embolism propagation in plant xylem - where air invades water-filled conduits under negative pressure - we study air penetration in compliant one-dimensional hydrodynamic networks experiencing mass loss by pervaporation. Using a theoretical framework grounded in biomimetic models, we show that embolism dynamics are shaped by the interplay between network compliance and viscous dissipation. In particular, the competition between two timescales - the pressure diffusion time, $\tau_\mathrm{diff}$, and the pervaporation time, $\tau_\mathrm{pv}$ - governs the emergence of complex, history-dependent behaviors. When these two timescales are comparable, we uncover previously unreported nonlinear feedback between the internal pressure field and the embolism front, leading to transient depressurization and delayed interface motion. These results offer a minimal framework for understanding embolism dynamics in slow-relaxing vascular systems and provide design principles for soft microfluidic circuits with tunable, nonlinear response.</description>

      <title>Axisymmetric thermoviscous and thermal expansion flows for microfluidics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent microfluidic experiments have explored the precise positioning of micron-sized particles in liquid environments via laser-induced thermoviscous flow. From micro-robotics to biology at the subcellular scale, this versatile technique has found a broad range of applications. Through the interplay between thermal expansion and thermal viscosity changes, the repeated scanning of the laser along a scan path results in fluid flow and hence net transport of particles, without physical channels. Building on previous work focusing on two-dimensional microfluidic settings, we present an analytical, theoretical model for the thermoviscous and thermal expansion flows and net transport induced by a translating heat spot in three-dimensional, unconfined fluid. We first numerically solve for the temperature field due to a translating heat source in the experimentally relevant limit. Then, in our flow model, the small, localised temperature increase causes local changes in the mass density, shear viscosity and bulk viscosity of the fluid. We derive analytically the instantaneous flow generated during one scan and compute the net transport of passive tracers due to a full scan, up to quadratic order in the thermal expansion and thermal shear viscosity coefficients. We further show that the flow and transport are independent of bulk viscosity. In the far field, while the leading-order instantaneous flow is typically a three-dimensional source or sink, the leading-order average velocity of tracers is instead a source dipole, whose strength depends on the relative magnitudes of the thermal expansion and thermal shear viscosity coefficients. Our quantitative results reveal the potential for future three-dimensional net transport and manipulation of particles at the microscale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06950v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent results suggest that highly active, chaotic, non-equilibrium states of living fluids might share much in common with high Reynolds number, inertial turbulence. We now show, by using a hydrodynamical model, the onset of intermittency and the consequent multiscaling of Eulerian and Lagrangian structure functions as a function of the bacterial activity. Our results bridge the worlds of low and high Reynolds number flows as well as open up intriguing possibilities of what makes flows intermittent.</description>

      <title>Confined active particles with spatially dependent Lorentz force: an odd twist to the "best Fokker-Planck approximation"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a version of the so-called "best Fokker-Planck approximation" (BFPA) to describe the spatial properties of interacting active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles (AOUPs) in arbitrary spatial dimensions. In doing so, we also take into account the odd-diffusive contribution of the Lorentz force acting on a charged particle in a spatially dependent magnetic field, sticking to the overdamped limit. While the BFPA itself does not turn out to be widely useful, our general approach allows to deduce an appropriate generalization of the Fox approximation, which we use to characterize the stationary behavior of a single active particle in an external potential by deriving analytic expressions for configurational probability distributions (or effective potentials). In agreement with computer simulations, our theory predicts that the Lorentz force reduces the effective attraction and thus the probability to find an active particle in the vicinity of a repulsive wall. Even for an inhomogeneous magnetic field, our theoretical findings provide useful qualitative insights, specifically regarding the location of accumulation regions.</description>

      <title>Measuring collective diffusion properties by counting particles in boxes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The collective diffusion coefficient $D_\mathrm{coll}$ is a key quantity for describing the macroscopic transport properties of soft matter systems. However, measuring $D_\mathrm{coll}$ is a fundamental experimental and numerical challenge, as it either relies on nonequilibrium techniques that are hard to interpret or, at equilibrium, on Fourier-based approaches which are fraught with difficulties associated with Fourier transforms. In this work, we investigate the equilibrium diffusive dynamics of a 2D colloidal suspension experimentally and numerically. We use a "Countoscope" technique, which analyses the statistics of particle number counts $N(t)$ in virtual observation boxes of a series of microscopy images at equilibrium, to measure $D_\mathrm{coll}$ for the first time. We validate our results against Fourier-based approaches and establish best practices for measuring $D_\mathrm{coll}$ using fluctuating counts. We show that Fourier techniques yield inaccurate long-range collective measurements because of the non-periodic nature of an experimental image, yet counting exploits this property by using finite observation windows. Finally, we discuss the potential of our method to advance our understanding of collective properties in suspensions, particularly the role of hydrodynamic interactions.</description>

      <title>A microstructural model of transversely isotropic, fibre-reinforced hydrogels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fibre-reinforced hydrogels are promising materials for biomedical applications due to their strength, toughness, and tunability. However, it remains unclear how to design fibre-reinforced hydrogels for use in specific applications due to the lack of a flexible modelling framework that can predict and hence optimise their behaviour. In this paper, we present a microstructural model for transversely isotropic fibre-reinforced hydrogels that captures the specific geometry of the fibre network. The model also accounts for slack in the initial fibre network that is gradually removed upon deformation. The mechanical model for the fibre network is coupled to a nonlinear poroelastic model for the hydrogel matrix that accounts for osmotic stress. By comparing the model predictions to data from unconfined compression experiments, we show that the model can capture J-shaped stress-strain curves and time-dependent creep responses. We showcase how the model can be used to guide the design of materials for artificial cartilage by exploring how to maximise interstitial fluid pressure. We find that fluid pressurisation can be increased by using stiffer fibres, removing slack from the fibre network, and reducing the Young's modulus of the hydrogel matrix. Finally, a high-level and open-source Python package has been developed for simulating unconfined compression experiments using the model.</description>
