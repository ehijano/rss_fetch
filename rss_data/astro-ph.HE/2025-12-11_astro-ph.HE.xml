      <title>Probing jet base emission of M87* with the 2021 Event Horizon Telescope observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the presence and spatial characteristics of the jet base emission in M87* at 230 GHz, enabled by the enhanced uv coverage in the 2021 Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations. The addition of the 12-m Kitt Peak Telescope and NOEMA provides two key intermediate-length baselines to SMT and the IRAM 30-m, giving sensitivity to emission structures at scales of $\sim250~\mu$as and $\sim2500~\mu$as (0.02 pc and 0.2 pc). Without these baselines, earlier EHT observations lacked the capability to constrain emission on large scales, where a "missing flux" of order $\sim1$ Jy is expected. To probe these scales, we analyzed closure phases, robust against station-based gain errors, and modeled the jet base emission using a simple Gaussian offset from the compact ring emission at separations $&gt;100~\mu$as. Our analysis reveals a Gaussian feature centered at ($\Delta$RA $\approx320~\mu$as, $\Delta$Dec $\approx60~\mu$as), a projected separation of $\approx5500$ AU, with a flux density of only $\sim60$ mJy, implying that most of the missing flux in previous studies must arise from larger scales. Brighter emission at these scales is ruled out, and the data do not favor more complex models. This component aligns with the inferred direction of the large-scale jet and is consistent with emission from the jet base. While our findings indicate detectable jet base emission at 230 GHz, coverage from only two intermediate baselines limits reconstruction of its morphology. We therefore treat the recovered Gaussian as an upper limit on the jet base flux density. Future EHT observations with expanded intermediate-baseline coverage will be essential to constrain the structure and nature of this component.</description>

      <title>Viscously Spreading Accretion Disks around Black Holes: Implications for TDEs, LFBOTs and other Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple time-dependent model of viscously spreading accretion disks around black holes (BHs) with masses between $10-10^8M_\odot$. We apply the results to observations of late-time emission in tidal disruption events (TDEs) and luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBOT) such as AT2018cow. Our model generalizes previous work by incorporating outflows during super-Eddington accretion, non-conservation of mass and angular momentum in TDE circularization, irradiation of the outer disk by the inner accretion flow, and a range of viscous stress models. We show that many late-time plateaus in TDEs can be explained by disks formed with a large spread in angular momentum due to redistribution during circularization. Viscous spreading on year timescales is not required, although it is also compatible with the data. The collapse of radiation pressure dominated thin disks to the stable gas-pressure dominated phase greatly underpredicts TDE plateau luminosities, strongly favoring thermally stable magnetically dominated disk models. Irradiation of the outer disk in TDEs due to misalignment of the stellar orbit and black hole spin increases plateau luminosities and durations by factors of a few. Continued study of late-time TDE emission provides a unique opportunity to constrain the physics of disk formation and circularization, disk warps, angular momentum transport, and other poorly understood aspects of disk physics. The models we develop can also explain the late-time optical-UV emission in the LFBOT AT2018cow for BH masses of ~$10-100M_\odot$. The faint X-ray emission at late times in AT2018cow is likely due to ongoing absorption. Our models predict that late-time X-rays should eventually be detectable again, and that HST/JWST observations of AT2018cow may detect a break in the SED at near-IR-optical wavelengths, providing a powerful probe of outer accretion disk thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics of Black-Hole Coronae: QPOs, Turbulence, and Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The variability of X-rays observed from accreting black hole systems, including quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), suggests a complex nonlinear dynamics in the corona. Here, we propose a new theoretical framework for this problem, based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics. In this model, coronal variability arises from feedback between a macroscopic oscillation of the plasma and the rate at which it is cooled by the inverse Compton scattering of soft photons from the disc. The "pair thermostat'' mechanism then allows the corona to act as a heat engine that extracts work cyclically from the underlying thermal disequilibrium between the low-entropy heating and the high-entropy cooling by the soft photons, in close analogy to the well-known $\kappa$-mechanism for pulsating stars. This coronal self-oscillation may explain QPOs without the need to invoke an external resonant driving. Moreover, we argue that this mechanism can provide the power to generate turbulence and jets in the corona.</description>

      <title>Probing the origin of the kilonova candidate GRB 230307A: analysis of host galaxy and offset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the host galaxy of the long gamma-ray burst GRB 230307A, which is associated with a kilonova candidate likely produced by a binary neutron-star (BNS) merger. The transient occurred at a projected offset of $\sim 40$ kpc from its spiral-galaxy host. We consider two explanations for this large distance: (i) NSs that merge inside a remote globular cluster, or (ii) a BNS that formed in the disk whose orbit was strongly modified by the NS natal kicks. Using JWST data and comparisons with known globular clusters, we show that a globular-cluster origin is extremely unlikely, ruling out case (i). Considering case (ii), using JWST and MUSE data, we derive the host galaxy morphology, stellar mass, estimate the atomic gas (HI+He) contribution, and the host rotation curve. Assuming an NFW halo and applying Bayesian inference, we obtain a mass model for the host galaxy. From this model, we compute the time required for a disk-formed BNS, with a given natal kick, to reach the observed offset while marginalizing over uncertainties and over the initial position in the disk. We compare these results with BNS-merger simulations from the SEVN population-synthesis code combined with PARSEC stellar evolutionary tracks, which provide the coalescence time and kick velocity for each realization. The two approaches have an overlap in the kick-time diagram, but only 0.1\% of the simulated systems fall within the 2$\sigma$ region of the galaxy mass model. This indicates that a disk origin is possible, but requires fine-tuned conditions for the kilonova to occur at such a large distance from the host galaxy.</description>

      <title>Characterising the X-ray variability of QSOs to the highest Eddington ratios and black hole masses with eROSITA light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important diagnostic of the inner structure of accretion flows onto supermassive black holes are the stochastic flux variations at X-ray wavelengths. Despite its significance, a systematic characterisation of the statistical properties of the X-ray variability to the highest Eddington ratios and most massive black holes is still lacking. In this paper we address this issue using SRG/eROSITA 5-epoch light curves to characterise the mean X-ray variability of optically selected SDSS QSOs extending to black holes masses of $10^{10}$ solar and accretion rates close to the Eddington limit. The adopted variability statistic is the ensemble normalised excess variance, which is measured using a novel hierarchical Bayesian model (eBExVar) tailored to the Poisson nature of the X-ray light curves. We find a clear anti-correlation of the ensemble variability with black hole mass, extending previous results to time scales of months. This can be interpreted as evidence for an X-ray corona size and/or physical conditions that scale with black holes mass. We also find an unexpected increase of the ensemble normalised excess variance close to the Eddington limit, which is contrary to the predictions of empirical variability models. This result suggests an additional variability component for fast growing black holes that may be related to systematic variations of the hot corona size with Eddington ratio or shielding of the hot corona by an inner puffed-up disk and/or outflows.</description>

      <title>Tidal disruption event Calorimetry: Observational constraints on the physics of TDE optical flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events are routinely discovered as bright optical/UV flares, the properties of which are now well categorized on the population level. The underlying physical processes that produce the evolution of their X-ray emission and their long-lasting UV/optical plateau are well understood; however, the origin of their early-time optical/UV emission remains the subject of much debate and uncertainty. In this paper we propose and perform ``Calorimetric'' tests of published theories of these optical flares, contrasting theoretical predictions for the scaling of the radiated energy and peak luminosity of these flares with black hole mass (something which is predicted by each theory), with the observed (positive) black hole mass scaling. No one theory provides a satisfactory description of observations at all black hole mass scales. Theories relating to the reprocessing of an Eddington-limited compact accretion disk, or emission (energy) released in the formation of a Keplerian disk near the circularisation radius, perform best, but require extending. Models whereby the optical/UV flare are directly produced by shocks between debris streams (e.g., TDEmass), or the efficient reprocessing of the fallback rate (e.g., MOSFIT, or any other model in which $L \propto \dot{M}_{\mathrm{fb}}$), are ruled out at high $(&gt;5\sigma)$ significance by the data.</description>

      <title>Delving into the depths of NGC 3783 with XRISM IV. Mapping of the accretion flow with Fe K$\alpha$ emission lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using XRISM/Resolve $439 \, \rm ks$ time-averaged spectra of the well-known Seyfert-1.5 active galactic nucleus (AGN) in NGC 3783, we investigate the nature of the Fe K$\alpha$ emission line at 6.4 keV, the strongest and most common X-ray line observed in AGN. Even the narrow component of the line is resolved with evident Fe K$\alpha_{1}$ (6.404 keV) and K$\alpha_{2}$ (6.391 keV) contributions in a 2:1 flux ratio, fully consistent with a neutral gas with negligible bulk velocity. The narrow and intermediate-width components have a full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of 350 $\pm$ 50 km/s and $3510 \pm 470 \, \rm km/s$, respectively, suggesting that they arise in the outer disk/torus and/or BLR. We detect a $10\%$ excess flux around 4 $-$ 7 keV that is not well described by a symmetric Gaussian line, but is consistent with a relativistically broadened emission line. In this paper, we take the simplest approach to model the asymmetric line as a single emission line (assuming either neutral, He-like or H-like iron) convolved with a relativistic disk line model. As expected, the inferred inclination angle is highly sensitive to the assumed ionization state, and ranges between $i=17-44^{ \circ}$. This model also constrains the black hole spin via the extent of the red wing: the required gravitational redshift in the fitted disk-line profile disfavors a non-spinning (Schwarzschild) black hole. The derived inner radius is close to the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit $r_{\rm ISCO}$ and strongly correlated with the black hole spin. To better constrain the spin, we fix the inner radius at $r_{\rm ISCO}$ and derive a lower limit on the spin of $a \ge 0.29$ at the 3 $\sigma$ confidence level. A Compton shoulder is detected in our data as well as a $2-3 \, \sigma$ detection of the Cr K$\alpha$ and Ni K$\alpha$ lines.</description>

      <title>Frequency- and phase-resolved polarimetry of millisecond pulsars and its application to timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar timing is used for a variety of applications including tests of fundamental physics, probing the structure of neutron stars, and detecting nanohertz gravitational waves. Development of robust methods and generation of high-quality timing data is therefore of utmost importance. In this paper, we present a new technique for creating high-fidelity templates that can be used to measure the pulse times of arrival with significantly increased precision compared to existing methods. Our framework makes use of all available polarimetric information to generate frequency-dependent models of pulse-shape evolution of all four Stokes parameters. We apply this method to millisecond pulsars observed by the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array and show that it results in timing measurement uncertainties reduced up to $\sim$20-30\%. We also present, for the first time, phase- and frequency-resolved polarimetric measurements of millisecond pulsars observed with the Parkes Murriyang ultra-widebandwith-low receiver. The data, plots and the code underlying this analysis are made publicly available.</description>

      <title>An extragalactic gamma-ray binary formed in supernova 2022jli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On May 5 2022, a type Ic supernova (SN) explosion SN~2022jli was discovered. This SN showed additional optical emissions, which were found to exhibit 12.4-day periodic undulations and concordant periodic velocity shifts. These key features likely indicate a compact object in a binary system was formed. A faint $\gamma$-ray source was also detected at the position of the SN and upon checking the $\gamma$-ray photons' arrival times, it was revealed that the same 12.4-day periodicity was likely present. Here we report our detailed analysis results for the $\gamma$-ray source. Not only was the $\gamma$-ray emission detectable for $\sim$1.5\,years since the discovery time, but a strong modulation at period 12.5\,day was also clearly determined. Considering the newly formed compact object to be a neutron star or a stellar-mass black hole, the putative binary, having an orbital period of 12.5\,day, is likely the first extragalactic high-energy system detected. The system may serve as a valuable example for the formation of many such binaries observed in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies.</description>

      <title>The ONs and OFFs of Pulsar Radio Emission: Characterizing the Nulling Phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio emission from pulsars is known to exhibit a diverse range of emission phenomena, among which nulling, where the emission becomes temporarily undetectable, is an intriguing one. Observations suggest nulling is prevalent in many long-period pulsars and must be understood to obtain a more comprehensive picture of pulsar emission and its evolution. One of the limitations in observational characterisation of nulling is the limited signal-to-noise, making individual pulses often not easily distinguishable from noise or any putative faint emission. Although some of the approaches in the published literature attempt to address this, they lose efficacy when individual pulses appear indistinguishable from the noise, and as a result, can lead to less accurate measurements. Here we develop a new method (the $\mathbb{N}$sum algorithm) that uses sums of pulses for better distinguishability from noise and thus measures the nulling fraction more robustly. It can be employed for measuring nulling fractions in weaker pulsars and observations with a limited number of observed pulses. We compare our algorithm with the recently developed Gaussian Mixture Modelling approach, using both simulated and real data, and find that our approach yields consistent results for generic and weaker pulsars. We also explore quasi-periodicity in nulling and measure the related parameters for five pulsars, including PSRs~J1453$-$6413, J0950$+$0755 and J0026$-$1955, for which these are also the first such measurements. We compare and contrast our analysis of quasi-periodic nulling with previously published work and explore the use of spin-down energy loss ($\dot E$) to distinguish between different types of modulation behaviour.</description>

      <title>Discovery of the redback millisecond pulsar PSR J1728-4608 with ASKAP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of PSR J1728-4608, a new redback spider pulsar identified in images from the Australian SKA Pathfinder telescope. PSR J1728-4608 is a millisecond pulsar with a spin period of 2.86 ms, in a 5.05 hr orbit with a companion star. The pulsar exhibits a radio spectrum of the form $S_\nu \propto \nu^\alpha$, with a measured spectral index of $\alpha = -1.8(3)$. It is eclipsed for 42% of its orbit at 888 MHz, and multi--frequency image--domain observations show that the egress duration scales with frequency as a power law with index $n = -1.74$, where longer duration eclipses are seen at lower frequencies. An optical counterpart is detected in archival Gaia data within $0.5''$ of the radio position. It has a mean G-band magnitude of 18.8 mag and its light curve displays characteristics consistent with a combination of ellipsoidal modulation and irradiation effects. We also report the nearest Fermi $\gamma$-ray source, located 2$'$ away from our source, as a possible association. A radio timing study constrains the intrinsic and orbital properties of the system, revealing orbital period variations that we attribute to changes in the gravitational quadrupole moment of the companion star. At the eclipse boundary, we measure a maximum dispersion measure excess of $2.0 \pm 1.2 \ \mathrm{pc\ cm^{-3}}$, corresponding to an electron column density of $5.9 \pm 3.6 \times10^{18} \ \mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. Modelling of the eclipse mechanism suggests that synchrotron absorption is the dominant cause of the eclipses observed at radio wavelengths. The discovery and characterisation of systems like \psr\ provide valuable insights into pulsar recycling, binary evolution, the nature of companion-driven eclipses, and the interplay between compact objects and their plasma environments.</description>

      <title>X-ray Polarization and Spectral Variations in an Extreme High-Synchrotron-Peaked Blazar 1ES 1101--232</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first X-ray polarimetric observation of the extreme high-synchrotron-peaked blazar 1ES 1101--232, conducted by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). The data analysis incorporates simultaneous and quasi-simultaneous observations from Swift-XRT and NuSTAR. Our results reveal a significant detection of X-ray polarization in the 2--6 keV band at a confidence level (CL) of 6.6$\sigma$, with a polarization degree of $\Pi_{\rm X}=17.9\%\pm2.7\%$ and an electric vector position angle (EVPA) of $\psi_{\rm X}=10^\circ.0\pm4^\circ.4$. An even higher polarization degree of $\Pi_{\rm X}=38.9\%\pm9.1\%$ with an EVPA of $\psi_{\rm X}=13^\circ.9\pm6^\circ.7$ is observed within a narrower time interval, at a CL of 4.3$\sigma$. During the IXPE observational campaign, the X-ray spectrum of 1ES 1101--232 exhibits a clear soft-to-hard spectral evolution in the 0.3--10 keV band, although no significant flux variability is detected. Additionally, a clockwise hysteresis loop is identified in the flux--photon index plane. These findings collectively indicate that the X-ray emission from 1ES 1101--232 originates in a region characterized by a well-ordered magnetic field through synchrotron radiation.</description>

      <title>Dirac vs. Majorana Dark Matter Imprints on Neutron Star Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamental character of a fermionic dark matter, whether it is a Dirac or Majorana particle remains a key unresolved issue whose answer would profoundly affect dark-sector phenomenology and detection strategies thereby motivates complementary probes across particle and astrophysical experiments. Compact stars, particularly neutron stars, offer unique astrophysical laboratories for probing such fundamental properties under extreme densities. The presence of a fermionic DM admixed with nuclear matter can modify the equation of state, thereby affecting observable quantities such as the mass-radius (M-R) relation and tidal deformability. In this work, we investigate how the intrinsic particle nature of fermionic DM influences neutron star structure. Within a relativistic mean-field framework extended by a scalar (or Higgs like) portal coupling between DM and nucleons, we construct self-consistent equation of states for both Dirac and Majorana cases and solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations to obtain stellar configurations. Owing to the difference in internal degrees of freedom, Dirac DM (four degrees of freedom) generally softens the equation of state more strongly than Majorana DM (two degrees of freedom), leading to smaller radii and lower maximum masses. We identify the parameter space consistent with current NICER and gravitational-wave constraints, highlighting the potential of compact-star observations to discriminate between Dirac and Majorana dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this talk, I discussed a 3-dimensional "effective" velocity distribution of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), which, instead of the theoretically predicted velocity distribution of "entire" Galactic Dark Matter particles, describes the actual velocity distribution of WIMPs "scattering off" (specified) target nuclei in an underground detector. Based on numerical results carried out by our double Monte Carlo scattering-by-scattering simulation of 3-dimensional elastic WIMP-nucleus scattering, an (asymmetric) "forward-backward asymmetry" was also demonstrated.</description>

      <title>The impact of AGN environmental effects on testing general relativity with space-borne gravitational wave detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The space-borne gravitational wave detectors such as TianQin offers a new window to test General Relativity by observing the early inspiral phase of stellar-mass binary black holes. A key concern arises if these stellar-mass binary black holes reside in gaseous environments such as active galactic nucleus accretion disks, where environmental effects imprint detectable modulations on the gravita- tional waveform. Using Bayesian inference on simulated signals containing both environmental and dipole deviation, we have assessed the extent to which the presence of environmental effects affects the detectability of dipole radiation. Our results demonstrate that even in the presence of strong environmental coupling, the dipole parameter can be recovered with high precision, and the evidence for dipole radiation remains distinguishable. Crucially, we find that the existence of environmental effects does not fundamentally impede the identification of dipole radiation, provided both effects are simultaneously modelled in the inference process. This study establishes that future tests of modified gravity with space-borne observatories can remain robust even for sources in astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>Correlations of Simulated Black-Hole Movies Reveal Extreme-Lensing Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A black hole's gravitational pull can deflect light rays to an arbitrary degree. As a result, any source fluctuation near the black hole creates multiple lagged images on an observer's screen. For optically thin stochastic emission, these light echoes give rise to correlations of brightness fluctuations across time-dependent images (movies). The correlation pattern disentangles source-specific characteristics from universal features dictated by general relativity. This picture has motivated a proposal to use the two-point image correlation function as a probe of extreme gravitational lensing in upcoming black-hole imaging campaigns. In this work, we test the feasibility of this method by computing the two-point correlation function of brightness fluctuations in a black-hole movie of state-of-the-art realism. The movie is generated by ray tracing a general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation, which can then be blurred to any angular resolution. At an effective resolution expected to be achieved by next-generation terrestrial very-long-baseline interferometric arrays, the lensing signatures appear in neither time-averaged images nor light-curve autocorrelations. However, we demonstrate that they are clearly visible in the more fine-grained two-point image correlation function. Our positive findings motivate a more comprehensive investigation into the instrument specifications and inference techniques needed to resolve extreme lensing effects through correlations.</description>

      <title>A jet bent by a stellar wind in the black hole X-ray binary Cygnus X-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jets provide an important channel for kinetic feedback from accreting black holes into their environment, without which models of the formation of large-scale structure in the universe fail to reproduce the observed properties of galaxies. Hence, an accurate measurement of jet power is critical for understanding black hole growth through accretion and also for quantifying the impact of kinetic feedback. However, the absence of instantaneous jet power measurements has precluded direct comparisons with the accretion luminosity, forcing kinetic feedback models to rely on ad hoc assumptions about how much jet power is released per accreted amount of mass. Here we report the detection of stellar wind-induced bending of the jets in the black hole X-ray binary Cygnus X-1, using 18 years of high-resolution radio imaging. By modeling jet-wind interactions, we determine the current kinetic instantaneous power of the jet to be log$_{10}(L_{\rm jet}/{\rm erg\,s}^{-1}) = 37.3_{-0.2}^{+0.1}$, comparable to the accretion energy determined from its bolometric X-ray luminosity. This result critically places prevailing assumptions about the energetics of black hole powered jets in both galaxy formation simulations, and in scaling models of black hole accretion, on a firm empirical footing.</description>

      <title>No evidence for accretion around the intermediate-mass black hole in Omega Centauri</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For over a decade, both theoretical predictions and observational studies have suggested that $\omega$ Centauri ($\omega$ Cen), the most massive Milky Way globular cluster, might harbor an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). Recently, identification of fast-moving stars in the core of $\omega$ Cen provided the strongest evidence to date for the presence of such an IMBH. One of the key questions in the study of IMBHs is their accretion efficiency, which determines their radio and X-ray signatures. We investigate the accretion signature of the IMBH in $\omega$ Cen with ultra-deep radio continuum observations of the central region of the cluster. Using approximately 170 hours of Australia Telescope Compact Array observations, we achieve a root mean square noise of 1.1 $\mu$Jy at 7.25 GHz, making this the most sensitive radio image of the cluster to date. We detect no radio emission at any of the proposed centers of the cluster, imposing stringent constraints on the presence of an accreting IMBH in $\omega$ Cen. Considering the fundamental plane of black hole activity, our findings indicate that the accretion efficiency around the black hole is exceptionally low (with a conservative 3-$\sigma$ upper limit of $\epsilon \lesssim 4\times10^{-3}$).</description>

      <title>Massive Star Clusters as sources of high-energy gamma radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the contribution of massive star clusters (MSC) as sources of high-energy gamma rays and their impact on the ultra-high-energy (UHE) emission observed throughout the Galaxy. By modeling proton injection, the study explores how the acceleration of protons in massive star clusters contributes to the gamma radiation detectable from Earth. The analysis focuses on two primary types of clusters: widespread, dispersed clusters and younger, compact massive clusters, both of which host shock waves generated by supernova remnants (SNR). Clusters located near the solar system, within a 3-kiloparsec radius,are identified. Analytical methods are used to calculate energy spectra and gamma-ray production rates. The findings suggest that young and compact MSC contribute to multi-TeV to PeV gamma-ray emission, with the dominant contribution arising from nearby populations.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal ringing of Kerr black holes. III. Excitation coefficients for equatorial inspirals from the innermost stable circular orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remnant of a black hole binary merger settles into a stationary configuration by "ringing down" through the emission of gravitational waves that consist of a superposition of damped exponentials with discrete complex frequencies - the remnant black hole's quasinormal modes. While the frequencies themselves depend solely on the mass and spin of the remnant, the mode amplitudes depend on the merger dynamics. We investigate quasinormal mode excitation by a point particle plunging from the innermost stable circular orbit of a Kerr black hole. Our formalism is general, but we focus on computing the quasinormal mode excitation coefficients in the frequency domain for equatorial orbits, and we analyze their dependence on the remnant black hole spin. We find that higher overtones and subdominant multipoles of the radiation become increasingly significant for rapidly rotating black holes. This suggests that the prospects for detecting overtones and higher-order modes are considerably enhanced for highly spinning merger remnants.</description>

      <title>Search for Dark Matter Annihilation and Decay with H$\alpha$ Line Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I present a new indirect search for dark matter (DM) using Hydrogen-$\alpha$ (H$\alpha$) recombination emission. DM annihilation or decay products can ionize neutral gas; subsequent recombination cascades generate H$\alpha$ photons through the $3\rightarrow2$ transition. In quiet gas-rich dwarf galaxies, the $n{=}2$ population is negligible, so H$\alpha$ is effectively unabsorbed and traces the DM-energy injection site. Using the non-detection of extended H$\alpha$ emission in the Leo T dwarf galaxy with Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) observations, I derive the first H$\alpha$-based limits on DM annihilation and decay, reaching leading sensitivity for parts of the eV-GeV mass range. Existing and upcoming telescopes can further extend this reach, establishing H$\alpha$ imaging as a powerful DM search strategy.</description>

      <title>Double tidal disruption events or repeating partial tidal disruption events in AT 2020vdq</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AT 2020vdq has been known as a candidate of repeating partial tidal disruption events (pTDEs), due to its two flares with a time interval of $\sim$1000 days. Here, a simplified method is proposed to test such repeating pTDEs scenario considering a main-sequence star tidally disrupted twice. For the two flares in AT 2020vdq if related to the repeating pTDEs scenario, theoretical TDE model determined stellar mass of the original star disrupted for the first flare should be not very different from the mass of the star (to trace the reminder of the original star) disrupted for the second flare, because a partial TDE with impact parameter $\beta$ smaller than 1 can lead to most of (probable higher than 90\%) the stellar mass also bound to the reminder of the original star. After considering theoretical TDE model applied to describe the two flares in AT 2020vdq, the model determined stellar masses are about 2${\rm M_\odot}$ and $0.36{\rm M_\odot}$ for the stars disrupted in the first flare and the second flare. The large mass difference cannot be reasonably expected by the repeating pTDEs with $\beta$ around 0.6 in AT 2020vdq. The results in this manuscript indicate that the repeating pTDEs scenario is not preferred at current stage in AT 2020vdq, but the probable double TDEs for two individual stars tidally disrupted should be currently recommended.</description>

      <title>Investigating the interaction of a Cosmic String with an Accreting Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rotating black holes when attached to a cosmic string have their rotational energy extracted leading to a change in its spin and mass. The spin of a black hole can be measured using various methods for an accreting black hole in an X-ray binary system. Accretion disks around black holes have an innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) whose location is directly dependent on spin and mass of the black hole. The orbit's location changes as the black hole's spin changes and hence can be a method to detect the presence of cosmic strings. This study investigates this change and suggests the ejection of accretion material as black hole spin approaches maximum for prograde motion and material falling into the black hole for retrograde motion, regardless of the presence of cosmic string. However, in the presence of cosmic string, the spin-up process due to accretion is found out to be slower, even with high accretion rates and is detectable. There is a transition phase that occurs as the black hole approaches maximum spin, where even small changes in spin result in significant changes in the ISCO's position. Accreting black holes attached to a large string never reach this transition phase and this absence serves as potential evidence for the existence of a cosmic string.</description>

      <title>SN 2022ngb: a faint, slow-evolving Type IIb Supernova with a low-mass envelope</title>

Abstract: An extensive photometric and spectroscopic follow-up campaign of the Type IIb SN 2022ngb is presented in the article. Through detailed modeling of this dataset, we aim to constrain the key physical parameters of the explosion, infer the nature of the progenitor star and its environment, and probe the dynamical properties of the ejecta. We analyze photometric and spectroscopic data of SN 2022ngb. By constructing and modeling the bolometric light curve with semi-analytic models, we estimate the primary explosion parameters. The spectroscopic data are compared with those of well-studied SNe IIb and NLTE models to constrain the properties of the progenitor and the structure of the resulting ejecta. SN 2022ngb is a low-luminosity SN IIb with a peak bolometric luminosity of L_bol = 7.76 (+1.15/-1.00) x 10^41 erg/s and a V-band rising time of 24.32 +/- 0.50 days. Light curve modeling indicates an ejecta mass of ~2.9-3.2 M_sun, an explosion energy of ~1.4 x 10^51 erg, and a low synthesized 56Ni mass of ~0.045 M_sun. Nebular phase spectra exhibit asymmetric line profiles, pointing to a non-spherical explosion and an anisotropic distribution of radioactive material. Our analysis reveals a relatively compact stripped-envelope progenitor with a pre-SN mass of approximately 4.7 M_sun (corresponding to a 15-16 M_sun ZAMS star). Our analysis suggests that SN 2022ngb originated from the explosion of a moderate-mass relatively compact, stripped-envelope star in a binary system. The asymmetries inferred from the nebular phase spectral line features suggest a non-spherical explosion.</description>

      <title>Improving the inference of the stellar quantities using the extended $I$-Love-$Q$-$\delta M$ relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In relativistic Astrophysics the $I$-Love-$Q$ relations refer to approximately EoS-independent relations involving the moment of inertia, Love number, and quadrupole moment through some quantities that are normalised by the mass $M_0$ of the background configuration of the perturbative scheme. Since $M_0$ is not an observable quantity, this normalisation hinders the direct applicability of the relations. A common remedy assumes that $M_0$ coincides with the actual mass of the star $M_S$; however, this approximation is only adequate for very slow rotation (when the dimensionless spin parameter is $\chi_S&lt;0.1$). The more accurate alternative approach, based on the $I$-Love-$Q$-$\delta M$ set of relations, circumvents this limitation by enabling the inference of $M_0$. Here we review both approaches and provide numerical comparisons.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-Ray Bath in a Past Supernova Gives Birth to Earth-Like Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key question in astronomy is how ubiquitous Earth-like rocky planets are. The formation of terrestrial planets in our solar system was strongly influenced by the radioactive decay heat of short-lived radionuclides (SLRs), particularly $^{26}$Al, likely delivered from nearby supernovae. However, current models struggle to reproduce the abundance of SLRs inferred from meteorite analysis without destroying the protosolar disk. We propose the `immersion' mechanism, where cosmic-ray nucleosynthesis in a supernova shockwave reproduces estimated SLR abundances at a supernova distance ($\sim$1 pc), preserving the disk. We estimate that solar-mass stars in star clusters typically experience at least one such supernova within 1 pc, supporting the feasibility of this scenario. This suggests solar-system-like SLR abundances and terrestrial planet formation are more common than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Origin of the stellar Fe K{\alpha} line clarified with FUV and X-ray observations of a superflare on the RS Canum Venaticorum-type Star UX Arietis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluorescence line diagnostics of the Fe K{\alpha} line at $\sim 6.4$ keV observed in both solar and stellar flares can constrain the latitude and size of the flare loop, even in the absence of imaging observations. However, they are hampered by the unresolved origin of stellar Fe K{\alpha} lines: i.e., it is unclear which of the two mechanisms-photoionization by hard X-ray photons or collisional ionization by non-thermal electrons-is the dominant process. We present clear evidence for the photoionization origin based on simultaneous far ultraviolet (FUV) and soft X-ray observations of a superflare on the RS Canum Venaticorum-type Star UX Arietis with Extreme ultraviolet spetrosCope for ExosphEric Dynamic (EXCEED; 900$-$1480 \r{A}) onboard Hisaki and Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER; 0.2$-$12 keV). The flare started at 22:50 UT on 2018 November 15 and released $2 \times 10^{36}$ erg in the 900$-$1480 \r{A} band and $3 \times 10^{36}$ erg in the 0.3$-$4 keV band. The FUV emission, a proxy for non-thermal activity, peaked approximately 1.4 hours before the soft X-rays. In contrast, the Fe K{\alpha} line, detected at a statistical significance of $5.3 \sigma$ with an equivalent width of $67^{+28}_{-20}$ eV, peaked simultaneously with the thermal X-ray maximum rather than the non-thermal FUV peak-strongly supporting the photoionization hypothesis. Radiative transfer calculations, combined with the observed Fe K{\alpha} line intensity, further support the photoionization scenario and demonstrate the potential of this line to provide the flare geometry.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the X-ray-to-UV relation of Quasars in the era of all-sky surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The X-ray--to--UV relation of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), commonly parametrized via the monochromatic luminosities at $2500\,\mathring{A}$ and $2\,keV$, reflects the energetic interplay between the accretion disc and the X-ray-emitting corona, and is key for understanding accretion physics. Previous studies suggest that disc-dominated emission becomes more prominent with increasing optical luminosity. However, the redshift evolution of this relation remains debated, and a dependence on Eddington ratio, predicted by accretion flow models, is still observationally unconstrained. We revisit this relation using a large, nearly all-sky sample by combining the SDSS DR16Q QSO catalogue with X-ray data from XMM-Newton and the SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey DR1, yielding 136,745 QSOs at redshifts $0.5 \leq z &lt; 3.0$. We introduce a hierarchical Bayesian framework that treats X-ray detections and upper limits uniformly, enabling robust inference from both parametric and non-parametric models. We confirm a tight, sublinear $\log L_X({\rm 2\,keV})$-$\log L_{\nu}({\rm 2500\,\mathring{A}})$ correlation, but with a normalization at the lower end of previous estimates. Contrary to most literature results, we detect a mild but systematic redshift evolution: the relation flattens and its intrinsic scatter decreases at higher redshift. This trend is consistent with disc emission increasingly dominated by scattering and enhanced energy transfer to the X-ray corona, potentially indicating redshift evolution in the X-ray bolometric correction. We find no significant dependence on Eddington ratio, in tension with recent accretion flow models.</description>

      <title>Average Power-Density Spectrum of short and long Fermi-GBM Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most powerful electromagnetic outbursts in the Universe and emit a vast amount of their energy in the form of gamma rays. Their duration is extremely short on cosmic timescales, but they show a wealth of time variability in their light curves. Properties of this variability may carry information about the processes the gamma rays emerge from, which are still poorly understood. This research investigates the redshift-corrected gamma-ray light curves of 159 long GRBs, observed with the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor on the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope between 2008 and 2023. We calculate the average power-density spectrum (PDS) of different groups of GRBs that are distinguished based on fluence, peak rate, duration, redshift, and the different GRB phases. Almost all redshift-corrected spectra reveal a power-law behavior with high-frequency power-law indices distributed around $\sim -1.9 \pm 0.2$. The precursor phase and redshift-corrected short bursts exhibit a shallower power law with index $\sim -1.30 \pm 0.04$, potentially due to the limited statistics that these samples represent. Only in some cases, the high-frequency index is still consistent with the $-5/3$ (Kolmogorov) slope, found by earlier studies and linked to the appearance of fully developed turbulence.</description>

      <title>A NICER view of the 1.4 solar-mass edge-on pulsar PSR J0614-3329</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Four neutron star radius measurements have already been obtained by modeling the X-ray pulses of rotation-powered millisecond pulsars observed by the Neutron Star Interior Composition ExploreR (NICER). We report here the radius measurement of PSR J0614-3329 employing the same method with NICER and XMM-Newton data using Bayesian Inference. For all different models tested, including one with unrestricted inclination prior, we retrieve very similar non-antipodal hot regions geometries and radii. For the preferred model, we infer an equatorial radius of $R_{\rm eq}=10.29^{+1.01}_{-0.86}\,$km for a mass of $M=1.44^{+0.06}_{-0.07} \, M_{\odot}$ (median values with equal-tailed $68\%$ credible interval), the latter being essentially constrained from radio timing priors obtained by MeerKAT. A more complex model, fitting the data equally well, resulted in a consistent inferred radius. We find that, for all different models, the pulse emission originates from two hot regions, one at the pole and the other at the equator. The resulting radius constraint is consistent with previous X-ray and gravitational wave measurements of neutron stars in the same mass range. Equation of state inferences, including previous NICER and gravitational wave results, slightly soften the equation of state with PSR J0614$-$3329 included and shift the allowed mass-radius region toward lower radii by $\sim 300\,$m, which is compatible with previous analyses to within less than one standard deviation.</description>

      <title>Localisation and host galaxy identification of new Fast Radio Bursts with MeerKAT</title>

Abstract: Accurately localising fast radio bursts (FRBs) is essential for understanding their birth environments and for their use as cosmological probes. Recent advances in radio interferometry, particularly with MeerKAT, have enabled the localisation of individual bursts with arcsecond precision. In this work, we present the localisation of 15 apparently non-repeating FRBs detected with MeerKAT. Two of the FRBs, discovered in 2022, were localised in 8 second images from the projects which MeerTRAP was commensal to, while eight were localised using the transient buffer (TB) pipeline, and another one through SeeKAT, all with arcsecond precision. Four additional FRBs lacked TB triggers and sufficient signal, limiting their localisation only to arcminute precision. For eight of the FRBs in our sample, we identify host galaxies with greater than 90% confidence, and one with 80% confidence, while two FRBs have ambiguous associations. We measured spectroscopic redshifts for six host galaxies, ranging from 0.33 to 0.85, demonstrating MeerKAT's sensitivity to high redshift FRBs. We modelled the spectral energy distributions of host galaxies with sufficient photometric coverage to derive their stellar population and star formation properties. This work represents one of the largest uniform samples of well-localised distant FRBs to date, laying the groundwork for using MeerKAT FRBs as cosmological probes and understand how FRB hosts evolve at high redshift.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13906v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a study on the detection and characterization of transient quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the $\gamma$-ray emission of blazars 4C +31.03, MG1 J123931+0443, and PKS 1622$-$253. Using light curves derived from \textit{Fermi} Large Area Telescope data, we investigate oscillatory patterns characterized by periodic multiplicative amplitudes that vary linearly over time. By segmenting the light curves into increasing and decreasing trends, we analyze each segment independently, allowing for precise measurements of both the periodicity and long-term variations. To interpret these QPOs, we explore various theoretical scenarios that could explain their origin and underlying physical mechanisms. The variability observed in 4C~+31.03 is more consistent with a stochastic process, whereas the periods estimated for MG1~J123931+0443 and PKS~1622$-$253 align with the precessional dynamics expected from binary supermassive black hole systems. However, the current results remain tentative and do not allow for a definitive conclusion.</description>

      <title>No Metallicity Preference in Fast Radio Burst Host Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration extragalactic radio transients of unknown origin, and studying their host galaxies could offer clues to constrain progenitor models. Among host properties, gas-phase metallicity is a key factor influencing stellar evolution and transient productions. We analyze the largest uniformly selected sample of FRB host galaxies, measuring oxygen abundances (12+log(O/H)=8.04-8.85) for 31 hosts at redshifts z=0.04-0.98, using consistent emission-line diagnostics. Using a volume-limited subsample, we compare the distributions of stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and metallicity to a control sample of star-forming galaxies selected by the same criteria. We find that FRB host galaxies span a wide metallicity range and are broadly consistent with the SFR-weighted mass-metallicity relation of star-forming galaxies. We find no clear lower metallicity bound, suggesting that FRB progenitors can form in any metallicity environment through channels largely insensitive to metal abundance. Encouragingly, this implies FRBs can arise even in low-metallicity, high-redshift galaxies, supporting their potential as probes of matter distribution across cosmic time. Additionally, we find marginal ($\sim$2$\sigma$) evidence for a -0.09\pm0.04 dex metallicity offset from the fundamental metallicity relation. Despite model uncertainties, if real, this offset likely reflects suppressed SFRs at fixed mass and metallicity rather than metal deficiency. Similar offsets are observed in local post-merger galaxies and may reflect a post-starburst phase following galaxy interactions. Such systems may host FRB progenitors formed during the starburst that produce FRBs after a 100-500 Myr delay, broadly consistent with observed delay-time distributions, although further data are needed to confirm this interpretation.</description>

      <title>Possible Coronal Geometry in the Hard and Soft State of Black Hole X-ray Binaries from MONK Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the coronal geometry in different states of black hole X-ray binaries is important for more accurate modeling of the system. However, it is difficult to distinguish different geometries by fitting the observed Comptonization spectra. In this work, we use the Monte Carlo ray-tracing code MONK to simulate the spectra for three simple corona toy models widely proposed in observational studies: sandwich, spherical, and lamppost, varying their optical depth and size (height). By fitting the simulated NuSTAR observations with the simplcut*kerrbb model, we infer the possible parameter space for the hard state and soft state of different coronal geometries. The influence of the disk inclination angle, black hole spin and coronal temperature is discussed. We find that in the lamppost model, if we exclude the case of a very extended corona, the disk emission is always dominant, making the lamppost geometry incompatible with the hard state. While the sandwich and spherical models can produce similar spectra in both the hard and soft states, the simulated IXPE polarimetric spectra show the potential to break this degeneracy. Geometrical effects arising from the limited size of the corona become evident in lower-spin black holes and affect the spectral fitting, where the larger ISCO reduces the corona coverage of the inner disk.</description>

Abstract: It is generally believed that the electron-capture reactions happen when the oxygen-neon (ONe) cores grow in masses close to the Chandrasekhar limit, leading to the formation of neutron stars (NSs) via electron-capture supernovae (EC-SNe). EC-SNe are predicted to be the most likely short-lived and faint optical transients, and a small ejecta mass is expected during the collapse. This kind of SNe provide an alternative channel for producing isolated NSs and NS systems, especially for the formation of X-ray binaries and double NSs. Although EC-SNe were proposed ~45 yr ago, there are still some uncertainties for the origin of EC-SNe. In this article, we review recent studies on the two classic progenitor channels of EC-SNe, i.e., the single star channel and the binary star channel. In the single star channel, EC-SNe can happen in super asymptotic giant branch stars or He stars, whereas in the binary star channel EC-SNe can occur in He stars in binaries (involving He star+MS systems and NS+He star systems) or accretion-induced collapse in white dwarf binaries (involving the single-degenerate scenario and the double-degenerate scenario). Recent progress on the two progenitor channels is discussed, including the initial parameter range for EC-SNe, the evolutionary paths to EC-SNe, related objects and some observational constraints, etc. We also make some discussions on the possible candidates for EC-SNe in this article, and the impacts of EC-SNe on some research fields, e.g., the properties of NSs, double NS population and chemical products, etc. We also discuss the differences between EC-SNe and ultra-stripped SNe in this article. Research on EC-SNe is at a pivotal stage, with key theoretical uncertainties and observational challenges requiring integrated modeling and multi-wavelength observations for robust identification.</description>

      <title>XRISM/Resolve observations of Hercules X-1: vertical structure and kinematics of the disk wind</title>

Abstract: X-ray binary accretion disk winds can carry away a significant fraction of the matter transferred from the companion and hence strongly affect the accretion flow and the long-term evolution of the binary. However, accurate mass outflow rate measurements are challenging due to uncertainties in our understanding of the 3D wind structure. Most studies employ absorption line spectroscopy that only gives us a single sightline through the wind streamlines. Hercules X-1 is a peculiar X-ray binary which allows us to avoid this issue, as its warped, precessing accretion disk naturally presents a range of sightlines through the vertical structure of its disk wind. Here we present the first results from a large, coordinated campaign on Her X-1 led by the new XRISM observatory (with an exposure of 210 ks) and supported by XMM-Newton, NuSTAR and Chandra. We perform a time-resolved analysis and constrain the wind properties. With XRISM/Resolve, we directly detect the Her X-1 orbital motion with an amplitude of 170 km/s in the evolution of the wind velocity. After correcting for this effect, we observe an increase in wind velocity from 250 km/s to 600 km/s as the wind rises to greater heights above the disk. The wind column density decreases with increasing height, as expected, but its ionization parameter log($\xi$/erg cm s$^{-1}$) evolves only weakly from 3.65 to 3.9 as the wind expands away. Additionally, we detect a new orbital dependence of the wind properties, revealing a likely second component that appears only briefly after the eclipse by the secondary star.</description>

      <title>The Formation Rate and Luminosity Function of Fast X-ray transients from Einstein probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following its launch on 2024 January 9, the Einstein Probe (EP) telescope has detected hundreds of fast X-ray transients (FXTs), yet their physical origins remain elusive. Understanding their luminosity function and formation rate is crucial for elucidating their nature. Recently, the EP team has provided the latest catalog of EP-detected FXTs. Based on this catalog, we present a model-independent nonparametric approach to derive the luminosity function and formation rate of FXTs. Our analysis reveals significant cosmological luminosity evolution, characterized by a scaling relationship of $(1+z)^{3.58}$. After accounting for this evolution, we establish that the local luminosity function is best represented by a broken power law, with a break luminosity of $(4.17 \pm 0.34) \times 10^{46}$ erg/s. The formation rate exhibits a broken power law as $\rho(z) \propto (1+z)^{-4.25}$ at $z \lessapprox 0.9$ and $\rho(z) \propto (1+z)^{-0.26}$ at $z \gtrapprox 0.9$, yielding a local rate of approximately $153.8_{-95.1}^{+249.4}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$. This rate is higher than that of long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs). Our findings indicate that a component of FXTs is associated with LGRBs.</description>

      <title>Bell Instability and Cosmic-Ray Acceleration in AGN Ultrafast Outflow Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate magnetic-field amplification driven by the nonresonant hybrid (NRH or Bell) instability and its impact on cosmic-ray (CR) acceleration at reverse shocks of ultrafast outflows (UFOs) from active galactic nuclei (AGN). Previous kinetic studies by particle-in-cell simulations have demonstrated that when maximum CR energy is near the injection scale, NRH instability efficiently amplifies magnetic field up to the saturation level. However, the efficiency of NRH instability goes down as maximum energy increase since CR current is carried by escaping CRs near the maximum energy. We employ a one-dimensional MHD--CR framework solving telegraph-type diffusion--convection equations to trace the coupled evolution of CRs, magnetic fields, and shock dynamics under realistic parameters. We find a distinct transition with magnetic field strength: for weak background fields ($B_{0}\!\lesssim\!10^{-4}\,\mathrm{G}$), NRH instability efficiently amplifies upstream turbulence, driving a self-regulated state where $E_{\max}$ becomes independent of initial strength of magnetic turbulence. In contrast, for stronger background fields ($B_{0}\!\gtrsim\!10^{-3}\,\mathrm{G}$), the escaping CR current is too weak to drive NRH instability, and magnetic turbulence further decays through parametric instabilities, potentially reducing the acceleration efficiency. We give the physical interpretation for the transition and discuss conditions for PeV--EeV acceleration at UFO reverse shocks.</description>

      <title>Entity -- Hardware-agnostic Particle-in-Cell Code for Plasma Astrophysics. I: Curvilinear Special Relativistic Module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entity is a new-generation, fully open-source particle-in-cell (PIC) code developed to overcome key limitations in astrophysical plasma modeling, particularly the extreme separation of scales and the performance challenges associated with evolving, GPU-centric computing infrastructures. It achieves hardware-agnostic performance portability across various GPU and CPU architectures using the Kokkos library. Crucially, Entity maintains a high standard for usability, clarity, and customizability, offering a robust and easy-to-use framework for developing new algorithms and grid geometries, which allows extensive control without requiring edits to the core source code. This paper details the core general-coordinate special-relativistic module. Entity is the first PIC code designed to solve the Vlasov-Maxwell system in general coordinates, enabling a coordinate-agnostic framework that provides the foundational structure for straightforward extension to arbitrary coordinate geometries. The core methodology achieves numerical stability by solving particle equations of motion in the global orthonormal Cartesian basis, despite using generalized coordinates like Cartesian, axisymmetric spherical, and quasi-spherical grids. Charge conservation is ensured via a specialized current deposition technique using conformal currents. The code exhibits robust scalability and performance portability on major GPU platforms (AMD MI250X, NVIDIA A100, and Intel Max Series), with the 3D particle pusher and the current deposition operating efficiently at about 2 nanoseconds per particle per timestep. Functionality is validated through a comprehensive suite of standard Cartesian plasma tests and the accurate modeling of relativistic magnetospheres in curvilinear axisymmetric geometries.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Decoherence via Modified Dispersion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study in detail the effect of quantum decoherence in neutrino oscillations. We adopt a phenomenological approach that allows us to parametrize the energy dependence of the decoherence effects resulting from the modification of the neutrino dispersion relation. Using the open quantum system framework we derive decoherence parameters, which are usually connected to quantum gravitational effects. Furthermore, we study the sensitivity of decoherence on high-energy astrophysical neutrinos among all possible initial source compositions. We find that variation in the flux composition at neutrino telescopes can be a good probe to test such effects. Additionally, we show that a simple extension with heavy sterile neutrino decoherence produces verifiable signatures.</description>

      <title>Studies of stationary features in jets: 3C 279 quasar I. On-sky scattering and dynamics</title>

Abstract: A recent study on the dynamics of the quasi-stationary component (QSC) in the jet of BL~ Lacertae highlighted its significance in evaluating the physical properties of relativistic transverse waves in the parsec-scale jet. Motivated by this finding, we selected a different type of blazar, the flat-spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) 3C~279, which hosts a QSC at an angular median distance of 0.35~mas from the radio core, as revealed by 27 years of VLBA monitoring data at 15~GHz. We investigate the positional scatter and dynamics of a QSC in the 3C~279 jet, aiming to detect the presence of a relativistic transverse wave and estimate its characteristics. We employ an analytical statistical method to estimate the mean intrinsic speed of the QSC, while moving average and refinement methods are used to smooth its trajectory. Analysis of the QSC position scatter shows that the jet axis change its direction by about $21^{\circ}$ over 27 years and jet mean intrinsic full opening angle is $\approx 0.30^{\circ} \pm 0.03^{\circ}$. The apparent displacement vectors of the QSC exhibit strong asymmetry and anisotropy along the jet direction, indicating pronounced anisotropic displacements of the core along the jet axis. We estimated the mean intrinsic speed of the QSC to be superluminal, $\overline{\beta_{\rm s}} \approx 10$ in units of the speed of light, which, within the framework of the seagull-on-wave model, is interpreted as evidence for a relativistic transverse wave propagating through the QSC. Analysis of the reversing trajectory of the QSC enables the classification and characterisation of reversal patterns, which, in turn, allows the determination of key transverse wave parameters such as frequency, amplitude, inclination angle, and magnetic energy of the wave (abbrev.).</description>

      <title>Low-Energy Supernova Constraints on Lepton Flavor Violating Axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The extreme conditions within the supernova core, a high-temperature and high-density environment, create an ideal laboratory for the search for new physics beyond the Standard Model. Of particular interest are low-energy supernovae, characterized by their low explosion energies, which place strong constraints on the new-physics energy transfer from the core to the mantle. We compute low-energy supernova constraints on lepton-flavor-violating axions and axion-like particles that couple to both electrons and muons. For axion mass above the muon mass, the electron-muon coalescence and the axion decay are dominant production and reabsorption processes, respectively. We find that the low-energy supernovae provide the most stringent constraints on the axions in the mass range of $\sim (110,550)$ MeV, probing the coupling constant down to $g_{ae\mu} \simeq {\cal O}(10^{-11})$.</description>
