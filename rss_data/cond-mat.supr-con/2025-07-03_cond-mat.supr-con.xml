      <title>Weyl-Superconductivity revealed by Edge Mode mediated Nonlocal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological superconductivity (TSC) hosts exotic modes enabling error-free quantum computation and low-temperature spintronics. Despite preliminary evidence of edge modes, unambiguous signatures remain undetected. Here, we report the first observation of protected, non-local transport from the edge modes of the potential Weyl-superconductor \ch{FeTe_{0.55}Se_{0.45}}. Namely resonant charge injection, ballistic transport, and extraction via edge modes. An anomalous conductance plateau emerges only when topological, superconducting, and magnetic phases coexist, with source-drain contacts coupled via the edge. Moving the drain to the bulk switches the non-local transport process to a local Andreev process, generating a zero-bias conductance peak (ZBCP). The edge mode's topological protection is confirmed by its insensitivity to external magnetic fields and increasing temperatures until the spontaneous magnetization is substantially suppressed. Our findings provide a new methodology to demonstrate TSC edge states in \ch{FeTe_{0.55}Se_{0.45}} via topologically protected non-local transport.</description>

      <title>Trade-Offs in EuBa2Cu3Oy Films containing Artificial Pinning Centers: Higher Critical Currents yet Faster Vortex Creep</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electromagnetic properties of type-II superconductors depend on vortices-magnetic flux lines whose motion introduces dissipation that can be mitigated by pinning from material defects. The material disorder landscape is tuned by the choice of materials growth technique and incorporation of impurities that serve as vortex pinning centers. For example, metal organic deposition (MOD) and pulsed laser deposition (PLD) produce high-quality superconducting films with uncorrelated versus correlated disorder, respectively. Here, we study vortex dynamics in PLD-grown EuBa2Cu3Oy films containing varying concentrations of BaHfO3 inclusions and compare our results with those of MOD-grown (Y,Gd)Ba2Cu3Oy films. Despite both systems exhibiting behavior consistent with strong pinning theory, which predicts the critical current density J_c based on vortex trapping by randomly distributed spherical inclusions, we find striking differences in the vortex dynamics owing to the correlated versus uncorrelated disorder. Specifically, we find that the EuBa2Cu3Oy films grown without inclusions exhibit surprisingly slow vortex creep, comparable to the slowest creep rates achieved in (Y,Gd)Ba2Cu3Oy films containing high concentrations of BaHfO3. Whereas adding inclusions to (Y,Gd)Ba2Cu3Oy is effective in slowing creep, BaHfO3 increases creep in EuBa2Cu3Oy even while concomitantly improving J_c. Lastly, we find evidence of variable range hopping and that J_c is maximized at the BaHfO3 concentration that hosts a vortex or Bose glass state.</description>

      <title>Type-1.5 SNSPD: Interacting vortex theory of two bandgap superconducting single photon detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon detectors based on type-2 superconductors have found widespread applications from on-chip quantum computing to quantum remote sensing. Here, we develop the theory for a new class of type-1.5 superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs) based on two bandgap superconductors with high transition temperatures such as MgB2 (Tc ~38.6K). We show that vortex-vortex interactions in two component condensates lead to a unique operating regime where single photons can seed multiple vortices within a hotspot. We also show that dark counts are suppressed in the type-1.5 regime compared to the widely studied type-2 SNSPDs. Our work opens the door for exploring the unique vortex physics of two-gap superconductors for quantum device applications.</description>

      <title>D-wave condensates and the landscape of the 2D Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider BCS-like states in the 2D Hubbard model which, starting from some arbitrary point in field space in the neighborhood of a Hartree-Fock ground state, are relaxed within that BCS ansatz to local minima of the energy. As in the Hartree-Fock approximation there are a vast number of local minima. What is new, and unlike the conventional Hartree-Fock states, is that there is a region in parameter (coupling-density) space, where these local minima are associated with d-wave condensates.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional Superconductivity at the CaZrO3/KTaO3 (001) Heterointerfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the superconducting transport properties of two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) at (001)-oriented CaZrO3/KTaO3 (CZO/KTO) heterointerfaces. Our results unambiguously demonstrate the emergence of two-dimensional superconductivity, with a superconducting transition TC up to ~0.25 K. The two-dimensional nature of the superconducting state is corroborated by the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition and pronounced anisotropy of the upper critical field. The estimated superconducting layer thickness and coherence length are 10.1 nm and 146.4 nm, respectively, for the sample with nS=7.7*10^13 cm^-2. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the two-dimensional superconductivity at the CZO/KTO(001) interface can be effectively tuned by applying a back gate voltage. These findings conclusively establish two-dimensional superconductivity at the CZO/KTO(001) interfaces, providing a new platform for exploring emergent superconductivity in complex oxide heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Common superconducting transition in under and overdoped cuprate superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underdoped cuprate superconductors are believed to be strongly correlated with electronic systems with small phase stiffness leading to a large phase fluctuation region is known as the pseudogap state. With increasing doping it is generally agree that they become Fermi liquid, rendering the end of the superconductivity due to the sufficiently large electronic screening. However, this scenario does not stand against a recent experiment\cite{OverJJ2022} that combined magnetic susceptibility and Scanning Tunnelling Microscopy (STM) which measured superconducting gaps and amplitudes amid charge inhomogeneity far beyond the critical doping $p_{\rm c} \approx 0.27$. We reproduced these results by calculating the localized superconducting amplitudes that emerge out of charge inhomogeneities, which forms a mesoscopic granular superconductor with an array of Josephson junctions, whose average couplings determine the critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$. The calculations agree with the experiments and both yield that underdoped and overdoped compounds have superconducting long-range order by the same mechanism.</description>

      <title>Topological nodal $i$-wave superconductivity in PtBi$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most superconducting materials are well-understood and conventional in the sense that the pairs of electrons that cause the superconductivity by their condensation have the highest possible symmetry. Famous exceptions are the enigmatic high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors. Nodes in their superconducting gap are the fingerprint of their unconventional character and imply superconducting pairing of $d$-wave symmetry. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we observe that the Weyl semimetal PtBi$_2$ harbors nodes in its superconducting gap, implying unconventional $i$-wave pairing symmetry. At temperatures below $10\,\mathrm{K}$, the superconductivity in PtBi$_2$ gaps out its topological surface states, the Fermi arcs, while its bulk states remain normal. The nodes in the superconducting gap that we observe are located exactly at the center of the Fermi arcs, and imply the presence of topologically protected Majorana cones around this locus in momentum space. From this, we infer theoretically that robust zero-energy Majorana flat bands emerge at surface step edges. This not only establishes PtBi$_2$ surfaces as unconventional, topological $i$-wave superconductors but also as a promising material platform in the ongoing effort to generate and manipulate Majorana bound states.</description>

      <title>Electron-phonon vertex correction effect in superconducting H3S</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Migdal-Eliashberg (ME) formalism provides a reliable framework for describing phonon-mediated superconductivity in the adiabatic regime, where the electronic Fermi energy exceeds the characteristic phonon energy. In this work, we go beyond this limit by incorporating first-order vertex corrections to the electron-phonon (e-ph) interaction within the Eliashberg formalism and assess their impact on the superconducting properties of H3S and Pb using first-principles calculations. For H3S, where the adiabatic assumption breaks down, we find that vertex corrections to the e-ph coupling are substantial. When combined with phonon anharmonicity and the energy dependence of the electronic density of states, the predicted critical temperature (Tc) is in very good agreement with experimental observations. In contrast, for elemental Pb, where the adiabatic approximation remains valid, vertex corrections have a negligible effect, and the calculated Tc and superconducting gap closely match the predictions of the standard ME formalism. These findings demonstrate the importance of non-adiabatic corrections in strongly coupled high-Tc hydrides and establish a robust first-principles framework for accurately predicting superconducting properties across different regimes.</description>

      <title>Single-shot parity readout of a minimal Kitaev chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protecting qubits from noise is essential for building reliable quantum computers. Topological qubits offer a route to this goal by encoding quantum information non-locally, using pairs of Majorana zero modes. These modes form a shared fermionic state whose occupation -- either even or odd -- defines the fermionic parity that encodes the qubit. Crucially, this parity cannot be accessed by any measurement that probes only one Majorana mode. This reflects the non-local nature of the encoding and its inherent protection against noise. A promising platform for realizing such qubits is the Kitaev chain, implemented in quantum dots coupled via superconductors. Even a minimal chain of two dots can host a pair of Majorana modes and store quantum information in their joint parity. Here we introduce a new technique for reading out this parity, based on quantum capacitance. This global probe senses the joint state of the chain and enables real-time, single-shot discrimination of the parity state. By comparing with simultaneous local charge sensing, we confirm that only the global signal resolves the parity. We observe random telegraph switching and extract parity lifetimes exceeding one millisecond. These results establish the essential readout step for time-domain control of Majorana qubits, resolving a long-standing experimental challenge.</description>

      <title>A Replica-BCS theory for dirty superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14914v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the problem of dirty superconductors using a replica-symmetric BCS (RS-BCS) theory. We apply the RS-BCS theory to dirty superconductor grains of size $L^d$, where $L$ is the localization length and $d$ is the dimension of the system, assuming that the macroscopic system is composed of weakly coupled grains. Besides disordered potential, We also consider the case where regions with opposite signs of interaction exist in the grains, with net attractive interaction between electrons. Within the RS-BCS mean field theory, the system phase diagram, single-particle tunneling density of states and the superfluid density are computed within the RS-BCS theory for different strengths of disorder, We show that our result agrees qualitatively with previous numerical studies in the case with pure attractive interaction, and that a Cooper-pair-glass state may exist when regions with opposite sign of interaction exists and the net interaction between electrons is close to zero. The plausible relevance of our result to the anomalous metal state is discussed.</description>

      <title>Gapless superconductivity and its real-space topology in quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study superconductivity in Ammann-Beenker quasicrystals under magnetic field. By assuming an intrinsic $s$-wave pairing interaction and solving for mean-field equations self-consistently, we find gapless superconductivity in the quasicrystals at and near half filling. We show that gapless superconductivity originates in broken translational symmetry and confined states unique to the quasicrystals. When Rashba spin-orbit coupling is present, the quasicrystalline gapless superconductor can be topologically nontrivial and characterized by a nonzero pseudospectrum invariant given by a spectral localizer. The gapless topological superconducting phase exhibits edge states with near-zero energy. These findings suggest that quasicrystals can be a unique platform for realizing gapless superconductivity with nontrivial topology.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Coherence Peak in Near-Field Radiative Heat Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enhancement and peaks in near-field radiative heat transfer (NFRHT) typically arise due to surface phonon-polaritons, plasmon-polaritons, and electromagnetic (EM) modes in structured materials. However, the role of material quantum coherence in enhancing near-field radiative heat transfer remains unexplored. Here, we unravel that NFRHT in superconductor-ferromagnetic systems displays a unique peak at the superconducting phase transition that originates from the quantum coherence of Bogoliubov quasiparticles in superconductors. Our theory takes into account evanescent EM radiation emanating from fluctuating currents related to Cooper pairs and Bogoliubov quasiparticles in stark contrast to the current-current correlations induced by free electrons in conventional materials. Our proposed NFRHT configuration exploits ferromagnetic resonance at frequencies deep inside the superconducting band gap to isolate this superconducting coherence peak. Furthermore, we reveal that Cooper pairs and Bogoliubov quasiparticles have opposite effects on near-field thermal radiation and isolate their effects on many-body radiative heat transfer near superconductors. Our proposed phenomenon can have applications for developing thermal isolators and heat sinks in superconducting circuits.</description>
