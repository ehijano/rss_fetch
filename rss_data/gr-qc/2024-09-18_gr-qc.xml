      <title>Relativistic elastic membranes: rotating disks and Dyson spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the equations of motion for relativistic elastic membranes, that is, two-dimensional elastic bodies whose internal energy depends only on their stretching, starting from a variational principle. We show how to obtain conserved quantities for the membrane's motion in the presence of spacetime symmetries, determine the membrane's longitudinal and transverse speeds of sound in isotropic states, and compute the coefficients of linear elasticity with respect to the relaxed configuration. We then use this formalism to discuss two physically interesting systems: a rigidly rotating elastic disk, widely discussed in the context of Ehrenfest's paradox, and a Dyson sphere, that is, a spherical membrane in equilibrium in Schwarzschild's spacetime, with the isotropic tangential pressure balancing the gravitational attraction. Surprisingly, although spherically symmetric perturbations of this system are linearly stable, the axi-symmetric dipolar mode is already unstable. This may be taken as a cautionary tale against misconstruing radial stability as true stability.</description>

      <title>An improved IMR model for BBHs on elliptical orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waveforms capturing binary's evolution through the early-inspiral phase play a critical role in extracting orbital features that nearly disappear during the late-inspiral and subsequent merger phase due to radiation reaction forces; for instance, the effect of orbital eccentricity. Phenomenological approaches that model compact binary mergers rely heavily on combining inputs from both analytical and numerical approaches to reduce the computational cost of generating templates for data analysis purposes. In a recent work, Chattaraj et al., Phys. Rev. D 106, 124008 (2022) arXiv:2204.02377(gr-qc), we demonstrated construction of a dominant (quadrupole) mode inspiral-merger-ringdown (IMR) model for binary black holes (BBHs) on elliptical orbits. The model was constructed in time-domain and is fully analytical. The current work is an attempt to improve this model by making a few important changes in our approach. The most significant of those involves identifying initial values of orbital parameters with which the inspiral part of the model is evolved. While the ingredients remain the same as in arXiv:2204.02377(gr-qc), resulting waveforms at each stage seem to have improved as a consequence of new considerations proposed here. The updated model is validated also against an independent waveform family resulting overlaps better than $\sim 96.5\%$ within the calibrated range of binary parameters. Further, we use the prescription of the dominant mode model presented here to provide an alternate (but equivalent) model for the (dominant) quadrupole mode and extend the same to a model including the effect of selected non-quadrupole modes. Finally, while this model assumes non-spinning components, we show that this could also be used for mildly spinning systems with component spins (anti-) aligned w.r.t the orbital angular momentum.</description>

      <title>On massive particle surfaces, partial umbilicity and circular orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalization of photon spheres by considering the trajectories of massive particles leads to the definition of Massive Particle Surfaces (MPS). These surfaces are built with the trajectories of massive particles, and have a partial umbilicity property. Using the geodesic and Gaussian curvature of the Jacobi metric (a Riemannian metric) we derive a general condition for the existence of a Massive Particle Surface defined for an asymptotically flat spacetime metric. Our results can be applied to the worldlines of charged massive particle surfaces. We provide a simple characterization for timelike and null trajectories using a Riemannian geometric approach. We are able to recover the results for the existence of Light Rings (LR's) and timelike circular orbits (TCO's). We show how an event horizon gets characterized using the curvatures of a Riemannian metric. We discuss several examples, where we derive conditions for the existence of photon sphere and a massive particle surface. We calculate the radius of the photon sphere and the radius of the Innermost Stable Circular Orbits (ISCO).</description>

      <title>Probing dark-matter effects with gravitational waves using the parameterized post-Einsteinian framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A massive black hole can develop a dark-matter overdensity, and the dark matter changes the evolution of a stellar-mass compact object inspiraling around the massive black hole through the dense dark-matter environment. Specifically, dynamical friction speeds up the inspiral of the compact object and causes feedback on the dark-matter distribution. These intermediate mass-ratio inspirals with dark matter are a source of gravitational waves (GWs), and the waves can dephase significantly from an equivalent system in vacuum. Prior work has shown that this dephasing needs to be modeled to detect the GWs from these systems with LISA (the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna); it also showed that the density and distribution of dark matter can be inferred from a GW measurement. In this paper, we study whether the parametrized post-Einsteinian (ppE) framework can be used to infer the presence of dark matter in these systems. We confirm that if vacuum waveform templates are used to model the GWs from an inspiral in a dark-matter halo, then the resulting parameter estimation is biased. We then apply the ppE framework to determine whether it can reduce the parameter-estimation biases, and we find that adding one ppE phase term to a waveform template eliminates the parameter-estimation biases (statistical errors become larger than the systematic ones), but the effective post-Newtonian order in the ppE framework must be specified without uncertainties. When the post-Newtonian order has uncertainty, we find that the systematic errors on the ppE and the binary's parameters exceed the statistical errors. Thus, the simplest ppE framework would not give unbiased results for these systems, and a further extension of it, or dedicated parameter estimation with gravitational waveforms that include dark-matter effects would be needed.</description>

      <title>An Effective Model for the Quantum Schwarzschild Black Hole: Weak Deflection Angle, Quasinormal Modes and Bounding of Greybody Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we thoroughly explore two crucial aspects of a quantum Schwarzschild black solution within four-dimensional space-time: i) the weak deflection angle, ii) the rigorous greybody factor and, iii) the Dirac quasinormal modes}. Our investigation involves employing the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to precisely compute the deflection angle and establishing its correlation with the Einstein ring. Additionally, we derive the rigorous bounds for greybody factors through the utilization of general bounds for reflection and transmission coefficients in the context of Schrodinger-like one-dimensional potential scattering. We also compute the corresponding Dirac quasinormal modes using the WKB approximation. We reduce the Dirac equation to a Schrodinger-like differential equation and solve it with appropriate boundary conditions to obtain the quasinormal frequencies. To visually underscore the quantum effect, we present figures that illustrate the impact of varying the parameter $r_0$, or more specifically, in terms of the parameter $\alpha$. This comprehensive examination enhances our understanding of the quantum characteristics inherent in the Schwarzschild black solution, shedding light on both the deflection angle and greybody factors in a four-dimensional space-time framework.</description>

      <title>Hawking radiation far away from the event horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study particle production in Vaidya spacetime. Using the WKB approximation, the distribution of Hawking radiation is calculated without the near-horizon approximation, which leads to finite corrections to the purely thermal spectrum. We extend our analysis to extremal and non-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Kerr black holes. Our results can be understood in terms of a thermodynamic toy model, where one regards Hawking radiation as Unruh radiation perceived by observers outside of the black hole. Moreover, we extend the model to incorporate the backreaction of Hawking quanta on spacetime geometry. Our study suggests that the backreaction may prevent the formation of the event horizon and spacetime singularity.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of a Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by quintessence in the generalized uncertainty principle framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics of a Schwarzschild black hole, surrounded by the quintessence energy-matter in the linear and quadratic generalized uncertainty principle framework. Considering the variance in the position to be of the order of the event horizon radius and equating the variance in the momentum to the Hawking temperature of the black hole, we substitute these variances in the deformed algebra. From there we obtained the generalized uncertainty principle-modified black hole temperature and eventually the specific heat of the black hole. Then we calculate the critical as well as the remnant mass and obtain the entropy relation. We observe that the entropy relation includes the usual leading order ``\textit{area divided by four}" term, sub-leading logarithmic term, and higher order inverse of the area corrections. Finally, calculating the energy output as a function of time, we obtain the evaporation time of the black hole. The results show the dependence of the quintessence parameter on the thermodynamic quantities in the framework of linear and quadratic generalized uncertainty principle.</description>

      <title>Mapping Anisotropies in the Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background with TianQin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the milli-Hertz frequency band, stochastic gravitational-wave background can be composed of both astronomical and cosmological sources, both can be anisotropic. Numerically depicting these anisotropies can be critical in revealing the underlying properties of their origins. For the first time, we perform a theoretical analysis of the constraining ability of TianQin on multiple moments of the stochastic background. First, we find that with a one-year operation, for a background with a signal-to-noise ratio of 16, TianQin can recover the multiple moments up to $l=4$. We also identified a unique feature of the stochastic background sky map, which is the mirror symmetry along the fixed orbital plane of TianQin. Thirdly, we explain the difference in anisotropy recovering ability between TianQin and LISA, by employing the criteria of the singularity of the covariance matrix (which is the condition number). Finally, we find that since the different data channel combinations correspond to different singularities, certain combinations might have an advantage in stochastic background map-making. We believe that the findings of this work can provide an important reference to future stochastic background analysis pipelines. It can also serve as a guideline for designing better gravitational-wave detectors aiming to decipher anisotropies in the stochastic background.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical searches for subsolar-mass binaries and the third-generation gravitational wave detector era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from coalescing compact binaries has become routine with ground-based detectors like LIGO and Virgo. However, beyond standard sources such as binary black holes and neutron stars and neutron star black holes, no exotic sources revealing new physics have been discovered. Detecting ultra-compact objects, such as subsolar mass (SSM) compact objects, offers a promising opportunity to explore diverse astrophysical populations. However, searching for these objects using standard matched-filtering techniques is computationally intensive due to the dense parameter space involved. This increasing computational demand not only challenges current search methodologies but also poses significant obstacles for third-generation (3G) ground-based GW detectors. In the 3G era, signals may last tens of minutes, and detection rates could reach one per minute, requiring efficient search strategies to manage the computational load of long-duration signals. In this paper, we demonstrate a hierarchical search strategy designed to address the challenges of searching for long-duration signals, such as those from SSM compact binaries, and the anticipated issues with 3G detectors. We show that by adopting optimization techniques in a two-stage hierarchical approach, we can efficiently search for the SSM compact object in the current LIGO detectors. Our preliminary results show that conducting matched filtering at a lower frequency of 35 Hz improves the signal-to-noise ratio by 6% and enhances the detection volume by 10-20%, compared to the standard two-detector PyCBC search. This improvement is achieved while reducing computational costs by a factor of 2.5.</description>

      <title>History of a Particle Bounded to the Cosmological LTB Black Hole Surrounded by the Quintom Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a complete set of analytic time-varying geodesic equations of the LTB black hole surrounded by the Quintom field. Indeed, we probe the evolution of the effective potential of such a black hole and possible photon orbits on cosmic epochs. We deduce that passing time in the accelerated universe from the early to late time epochs causes the peak of effective potential to decrease and shift to small radii, while the possibility of forming a stable orbit increases. Besides, four situations including: terminating bound orbit, stable orbit, scattering flyby orbit, and terminating escape orbit have been illustrated in some cosmic time slices. Moreover, changing orbits with time from the early universe to the late time epochs have been investigated. Furthermore, the stability of orbits and ISCO have been analyzed.</description>

      <title>The dynamics of spherically symmetric black holes in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity with a Ricci coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of spherically symmetric black holes in scalar Gauss-Bonnet gravity with an additional coupling between the scalar field and the Ricci scalar using non-linear simulations that employ excision. In this class of theories, black holes possess hair if they lie in a specific mass range, in which case they exhibit a finite-area singularity, unlike general relativity. Our results show that the Ricci coupling can mitigate the loss of hyperbolicity in spherical evolution with black hole initial data. Using excision can enlarge the parameter space for which the system remains well-posed, as one can excise the elliptic region that forms inside the horizon. Furthermore, we explore a possible relation between the loss of hyperbolicity and the formation of the finite-area singularity inside the horizon. We find that the location of the singularity extracted from the static analysis matches the location of the sonic line well. Finally, when possible, we extract the monopolar quasi-normal modes and the time scale of the linear tachyonic instability associated with scalarization. We also check our results by utilizing a continued fraction analysis and supposing linear perturbations of the static solutions.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussianity Beyond the Scalar Sector: A Search for Tensor and Mixed Tensor-Scalar Bispectra with Planck Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial gravitational waves could be non-Gaussian, just like primordial scalar perturbations. Although the tensor two-point function has thus-far remained elusive, the three-point function could, in principle, be large enough to be detected in Cosmic Microwave Background temperature and polarization anisotropies. We perform a detailed analysis of tensor and mixed tensor-scalar non-Gaussianity through the Planck PR4 bispectrum, placing constraints on eleven primordial templates, spanning various phenomenological and physical regimes including modifications to gravity, additional fields in inflation, and primordial magnetic fields. All analysis is performed using modern quasi-optimal binned estimators, and yields no evidence for tensor non-Gaussianity, with a maximum detection significance of $1.8\sigma$. Our constraints are derived primarily from large-scales (except for tensor-scalar-scalar models), and benefit greatly from the inclusion of $B$-modes. Although we find some loss of information from binning, mask effects and residual foreground contamination, our $f_{\rm NL}$ bounds improve over those of previous analyses by $40-600\%$, with six of the eleven models being analyzed for the first time. Unlike for scalar non-Gaussianity, future low-noise experiments such as LiteBIRD, the Simons Observatory and CMB-S4, will yield considerable improvement in tensor non-Gaussianity constraints.</description>

      <title>Gravitational chargegenesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wash-in leptogenesis is an attractive mechanism to produce the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. It treats right-handed-neutrino interactions as spectator processes, on the same footing as electroweak sphalerons, that reprocess primordial charge asymmetries in the thermal plasma into a baryon-minus-lepton asymmetry. The origin of these primordial charges must be accounted for by new $CP$-violating dynamics at very high energies. In this paper, we propose such a scenario of chargegenesis that, unlike earlier proposals, primarily relies on new interactions in the gravitational sector. We point out that a coupling of a conserved current to the divergence of the Ricci scalar during reheating can lead to nonzero effective chemical potentials in the plasma that, together with a suitable charge-violating interaction, can result in the production of a primordial charge asymmetry. Gravitational chargegenesis represents a substantial generalization of the idea of gravitational baryogenesis. We provide a detailed analysis of a generic and minimal realization that is consistent with inflation and show that it can successfully explain the baryon asymmetry of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Galactic Compton Wavelengths in $f(R)$ Screening Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $f(R)$ theories of modified gravity may be compatible with current observations if the deviations from general relativity are sufficiently well screened in dense environments. In recent work [arXiv:2310.19955] we have shown that approximations commonly used to assess whether galaxies are screened, or unscreened, fail to hold in observationally interesting parts of parameter space. One of the assumptions commonly made in these approximations, and more broadly in the study of $f(R)$ models, is that the mass of the scalar mode can be neglected inside a galaxy. In this work we demonstrate that this approximation may fail spectacularly and discuss the implications of this for tests of the theory.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Probes of Higgs-Axion non-perturbative Couplings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the phenomenological implications of several non-trivial axion-Higgs couplings, which cover most of the possible non-perturbative scenarios. Specifically we consider the combination of having higher order non-renormalizable Higgs-axion couplings originating from a weakly coupled effective theory combined with non-perturbative couplings of the form $\sim \epsilon \Lambda_c^2|H|^2\cos (\frac{\phi}{f_a})$. Since we consider the misalignment axion, the non-perturbative couplings can be expanded in the form of a perturbation expansion in powers of $\phi/f_a$, thus after the electroweak symmetry breaking, the effective potential of the axion is drastically affected by these terms. We investigate the phenomenological implications of these terms for various values of the mass scale $\Lambda_c$, and some scenarios are theoretically disfavored, while other scenarios with non-perturbative Higgs-axion couplings of the form $\sim \epsilon \Lambda_c^2|H|^2\cos (\frac{\phi}{f_a})$ with $\Lambda_c\sim 10^{-10}\times m_a$ and $m_a\sim 10^{-10}\,$eV, lead to a characteristic pattern in the stochastic gravitational wave background via the deformation of the background equation of state parameter occurring at frequencies probed by the Einstein Telescope. We also consider loop effects from the Higgs sector caused by the term $\sim \epsilon \Lambda_c^2|H|^2\cos (\frac{\phi}{f_a})$ if we close the Higgs in one loop.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda$CDM Model Extension with Dissipative Dynamics and Sign-Switching Bulk Viscous Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we extend the standard $\Lambda$CDM model by incorporating causal viscous dark matter (vDM) modelled using Maxwell-Cattaneo theory and obtain a novel Hubble parameter solution for the model, which can even be extended to incorporate both radiation and baryonic matter components. A detailed and comprehensive analysis of the model is carried out by deriving theoretical constraints on model parameters, comparing the model with the latest observational data sets and validating the behaviour of the model under different thermodynamic laws. Such an in-depth analysis of the model yielded several intriguing results, like the presence of sign-switching bulk viscous pressure which aids both, the decelerated expansion in the early universe and the accelerated expansion in the late universe, possibility of having negative specific entropy rate in the early Universe while still satisfying the covariant second law of thermodynamics, and a correlation between relaxation time parameter and sign-switching redshift. Finally, we propose a unified dark matter (UDM) interpretation for the dark sector in this model and hence showed that, under the said UDM interpretation, this model can satisfy the much-required near equilibrium condition associated with the background dissipative theory both in the early and late phase of the Universe. Based on the NEC trend showcased by the model, we conjuncture that the late-accelerating behaviour of Universe can be viewed as a means for the UDM fluid to attain a global equilibrium state.</description>

      <title>Vetting quark-star models with gravitational waves in the hierarchical Bayesian framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of gravitational waves (GWs) has opened a new avenue for investigating the equation of state (EOS) of dense matter in compact stars, which is an outstanding problem in astronomy and nuclear physics. In the future, next-generation (XG) GW detectors will be constructed, deemed to provide a large number of high-precision observations. We investigate the potential of constraining the EOS of quark stars (QSs) with high-precision measurements of mass $m$ and tidal deformability $\Lambda$ from the XG GW observatories. We adopt the widely-used bag model for QSs, consisting of four microscopic parameters: the effective bag constant $B_{\rm eff}$, the perturbative quantum chromodynamics correction parameter $a_4$, the strange quark mass $m_s$, and the pairing energy gap $\Delta$. With the help of hierarchical Bayesian inference, for the first time we are able to infer the EOS of QSs combining multiple GW observations. Using the top 25 loudest GW events in our simulation, we find that, the constraints on $B_{\rm eff}$ and $\Delta$ are tightened by several times, while $a_4$ and $m_s$ are still poorly constrained. We also study a simplified 2-dimensional (2-d) EOS model which was recently proposed in literature. The 2-d model is found to exhibit significant parameter-estimation biases as more GW events are analyzed, while the predicted $m$-$\Lambda$ relation remains consistent with the full model.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Key Features of Repeating Fast Radio Bursts with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are enigmatic high-energy events with unknown origins, which are observationally divided into two categories, i.e., repeaters and non-repeaters. However, there are potentially a number of non-repeaters that may be misclassified, as repeating bursts are missed due to the limited sensitivity and observation periods, thus misleading the investigation of their physical properties. In this work, we propose a repeater identification method based on the t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) algorithm and apply the classification to the first Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) catalog. We find that the spectral morphology parameters, specifically spectral running ($r$), represent the key features for identifying repeaters from the non-repeaters. Also, the results suggest that repeaters are more biased towards narrowband emission, whereas non-repeaters are inclined toward broadband emission. We provide a list of 163 repeater candidates, with $5$ of which are confirmed with an updated repeater catalog from CHIME/FRB. Our findings help to the understanding of the various properties underlying repeaters and non-repeaters, as well as guidelines for future FRB detection and categorization.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from primordial black hole isocurvature: the effect of non-Gaussianities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-light primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses $M_{\rm PBH}&lt;5\times 10^8\mathrm{g}$ can dominate transiently the energy budget of the Universe and reheat the Universe through their evaporation taking place before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. The isocurvature energy density fluctuations associated to the inhomogeneous distribution of a population of such PBHs can induce an abundant production of GWs due to second-order gravitational effects. In this work, we discuss the effect of primordial non-Gaussianity on the clustering properties of PBHs and study the effect of a clustered PBH population on the spectral shape of the aforementioned induced GW signal. In particular, focusing on local-type non-Gaussianity we find a double-peaked GW signal with the amplitude of the low-frequency peak being proportional to the square of the non-Gaussian parameter $\tau_\mathrm{NL}$. Remarkably, depending on the PBH mass $M_{\rm PBH}$ and the initial abundance of PBHs at formation time, i.e. $\Omega_\mathrm{PBH,f}$, this double-peaked GW signal can lie well within the frequency bands of forthcoming GW detectors, namely LISA, ET, SKA and BBO, hence rendering this signal falsifiable by GW experiments and promoting it as a novel portal probing the primordial non-Gaussianity.</description>

      <title>Black holes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity with a background of modified Chaplygin gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:1908.09827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supposing the existence of modified Chaplygin gas with the equation of state $p=A\rho-B/\rho^\beta$ as a cosmic background, we obtain a static spherically-symmetric solution to the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravitational equations in 5D spacetime. The spacetime structure of the obtained black hole solution could be asymptotically anti-de Sitter or de Sitter, according to the specific values of modified Chaplygin gas parameters versus the cosmological constant. We analyze the parametric regions for both kinds of solutions. For asymptotically anti-de Sitter black hole, there exists the so-called small/large black hole phase transition, we obtain critical values of pressure, volume, and temperature and investigate the effects of both the Gauss-Bonnet gravity and the modified Chaplygin gas on these values. For asymptotically de Sitter black hole, no $P-r_h$ criticality and phase transition appear, and we show that the thermodynamic systems related to various horizons of asymptotically de Sitter black hole are in fact entangled.</description>

      <title>Warp Drives and Closed Timelike Curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10072v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is commonly accepted that superluminal travel may be used to facilitate time travel. This is a purely special-relativistic argument, using the fact that for observers in two frames of reference, separated by a spacelike interval, the non-causal (spacelike) future of one observer includes part of the causal past of the other. In this paper we provide a concrete realization of this argument in a curved general-relativistic spacetime, using warp drives as the means of faster-than-light travel. By generalizing the usual warp drive metric to allow for a non-unit lapse function, we allow the warp drive to switch between reference frames in a purely geometric way. With an additional modification allowing the warp drive to have compact support, this permits us to glue two warp drives together to construct a closed timelike geodesic, such that a test particle following the geodesics of the two warp drives travels back to its own past. This provides a precise mathematical model for the connection between faster-than-light travel and time travel in general relativity, and the first such model to be explicitly formulated using two warp drives. We also give a detailed discussion of weak energy condition violations in the non-unit-lapse warp drive.</description>

Abstract: We study the dynamics of homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker cosmological models with positive spatial curvature within the context of mimetic gravity theory by employing dynamical system techniques. Our analysis yields phase-space trajectories that describe physically relevant solutions, capturing various stages of cosmic evolution. We also employ Bayesian statistical analysis to constrain the cosmological parameters of the models, utilizing data from Type Ia supernovae and Hubble parameter data sets. The observational data sets provide support for the viability of mimetic gravity models, which can effectively describe the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe.</description>

We explore three forms (two are newly proposed here) of baryogenesis interaction and discuss the effect of these interaction terms on the baryon-to-entropy ratio during the radiation era of the expanding universe. We constrain the model parameters with the current observational data, implying that this modified gravity is capable to address the issue of baryon asymmetry in a successful manner.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Area variables are intrinsic to connection formulations of general relativity, in contrast to the fundamental length variables prevalent in metric formulations. Within 4D discrete gravity, particularly based on triangulations, the area-length system establishes a relationship between area variables associated with triangles and the edge length variables. This system is comprised of polynomial equations derived from Heron's formula, which relates the area of a triangle to its edge lengths.
  Using tools from numerical algebraic geometry, we study the area-length systems. In particular, we show that given the ten triangular areas of a single 4-simplex, there could be up to 64 compatible sets of edge lengths. Moreover, we show that these 64 solutions do not, in general, admit formulae in terms of the areas by analyzing the Galois group, or monodromy group, of the problem. We show that by introducing additional symmetry constraints, it is possible to obtain such formulae for the edge lengths. We take the first steps toward applying our results within discrete quantum gravity, specifically for effective spin foam models.</description>

Abstract: We present a covariant description of non-vacuum static spherically symmetric spacetimes in $f(R)$ gravity applying the (1+1+2) covariant formalism. The propagation equations are then used to derive a covariant and dimensionless form of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations. We then give a solution strategy to these equations and obtain some new exact solutions for the particular case $f(R)=R+\alpha R^{2}$, which have the correct thermodynamic properties for standard matter. We find that one of the solutions represents a stellar object with a unique structure called a double layer.</description>

      <title>Signatures of ultralight bosons in the orbital eccentricity of binary black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the existence of clouds of ultralight particles surrounding black holes during their cosmological history as members of a binary system can leave a measurable imprint on the distribution of masses and orbital eccentricities observable with future gravitational-wave detectors. Notably, we find that for nonprecessing binaries with chirp masses ${\cal M} \lesssim 10\,M_\odot$, formed exclusively in isolation, larger-than-expected values of the eccentricity, i.e. $e\gtrsim 10^{-2}$ at gravitational-wave frequencies $f_{\rm GW} \simeq 10^{-2}\,$Hz, would provide tantalizing evidence for a new particle of mass between $[0.5,2.5] \times 10^{-12}\,$eV in nature. The predicted evolution of the eccentricity can also drastically affect the in-band phase evolution and peak frequency. These results constitute unique signatures of boson clouds of ultralight particles in the dynamics of binary black holes, which will be readily accessible with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, as well as future mid-band and Deci-hertz detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03147v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotating black holes can produce superradiant clouds of ultralight bosons. When the black hole is part of a binary system, its cloud can undergo resonances and ionization. These processes leave a distinct signature on the gravitational waveform that depends on the cloud's properties. To determine the state of the cloud by the time the system enters the band of future millihertz detectors, we study the chronological sequence of resonances encountered during the inspiral. For the first time, we consistently take into account the nonlinearities induced by the orbital backreaction and we allow the orbit to have generic eccentricity and inclination. We find that the resonance phenomenology exhibits striking new features. Resonances can "start" or "break" above critical thresholds of the parameters, which we compute analytically, and induce dramatic changes in eccentricity and inclination. Applying these results to realistic systems, we find two possible outcomes. If the binary and the cloud are sufficiently close to counter-rotating, the cloud survives in its original state until the system enters in band; otherwise, the cloud is destroyed during a resonance at large separations, but leaves an imprint on the eccentricity and inclination. In both scenarios, we characterize the observational signatures, with particular focus on future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been shown that primordial tensor non-Gaussianities from a cubic Weyl action with a non-dynamical coupling are suppressed by the so-called slow-roll parameter in a conventional framework of slow-roll inflation. In this paper, we consider matter bounce cosmology in which the background spacetime is no longer quasi-de Sitter, and hence one might expect that the matter bounce models could predict non-suppressed non-Gaussianities. Nevertheless, we first show that the corresponding non-Gaussian amplitudes from the cubic Weyl term with a non-dynamical coupling are much smaller than those from the conventional slow-roll inflation, in spite of the fact that there is no slow-roll suppression. We then introduce a dynamical coupling that can boost the magnitude of graviton cubic interactions and clarify that there is a parameter region where the tensor non-Gaussianities can be enhanced and can potentially be tested by cosmic microwave background experiments.</description>

Abstract: We present a new Hubble parameterization method and employ observational data from Hubble, Pantheon, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations to constrain model parameters. The proposed method is thoroughly validated against these datasets, demonstrating a robust fit to the observational data. The obtained best-fit values are $H_0 = 67.5^{+1.3}_{-1.6}$ $\text{km s}^{-1} \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, $\Omega_{\rm{m0}} = 0.2764\pm{0.0094}$, and $\alpha = 0.33\pm{0.22}$, consistent with the Planck 2018 results, highlighting the existence of Hubble tension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superradiant clouds of ultralight bosons can leave an imprint on the gravitational waveform of black hole binaries through "ionization" and "resonances." We study the sequence of resonances as the binary evolves, and show that there are only two possible outcomes, each with a distinct imprint on the waveform. If the cloud and the binary are nearly counter-rotating, then the cloud survives in its original state until it enters the sensitivity band of future gravitational wave detectors, such as LISA. In all other cases, resonances destroy the cloud, while driving the binary to co-rotate with it and its eccentricity close to a fixed point. This opens up the possibility of inferring the existence of a new boson from the statistical analysis of a population of black hole binaries.</description>

Abstract: We construct the gravitational energy-momentum pseudo-tensor of up to fourth-order conformally invariant theories of gravity. Then we linearize the pseudo-tensor and use its average over a macroscopic region to find the energy and momentum carried by the plane gravitational waves of the three main conformally invariant theories of gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21349v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Starobinsky model of cosmological inflation in four spacetime dimensions is reviewed with the emphasis on impact of quantum gravity corrections. As a specific example of the quantum corrections, the Grisaru-Zanon quartic curvature terms in the gravitational effective action of closed superstrings are chosen. Those quartic curvature terms are compared to the Bel-Robinson tensor squared in a flat Friedman universe, and the upper bound on the effective string coupling constant is found by demanding unitarity (causality) and the absence of ghosts. It is found that the quantum corrections to the observables (tilts) of the cosmic microwave background radiation in the Starobinsky inflation may be of the same order of magnitude as the next-to-next-to-next classical contributions in the Starobinsky model with respect to the inverse powers of the e-folding number at the horizon crossing.</description>

      <title>What is the nature of GW230529? An exploration of the gravitational lensing hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On the 29th of May 2023, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration observed a compact binary coalescence event consistent with a neutron star-black hole merger, though the heavier object of mass 2.5-4.5 $M_\odot$ would fall into the purported lower mass gap. An alternative explanation for apparent observations of events in this mass range has been suggested as strongly gravitationally lensed binary neutron stars. In this scenario, magnification would lead to the source appearing closer and heavier than it really is. Here, we investigate the chances and possible consequences for the GW230529 event to be gravitationally lensed. We find this would require high magnifications and we obtain low rates for observing such an event, with a relative fraction of lensed versus unlensed observed events of $2 \times 10^{-3}$ at most. When comparing the lensed and unlensed hypotheses accounting for the latest rates and population model, we find a 1/58 chance of lensing, disfavoring this option. Moreover, when the magnification is assumed to be strong enough to bring the mass of the heavier binary component below the standard limits on neutron star masses, we find high probability for the lighter object to have a sub-solar mass, making the binary even more exotic than a mass-gap neutron star-black hole system. Even when the secondary is not sub-solar, its tidal deformability would likely be measurable, which is not the case for GW230529. Finally, we do not find evidence for extra lensing signatures such as the arrival of additional lensed images, type-II image dephasing, or microlensing. Therefore, we conclude it is unlikely for GW230529 to be a strongly gravitationally lensed binary neutron star signal.</description>

      <title>de Sitter State in Heterotic String Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.12843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent no-go theorems have ruled out four-dimensional classical de Sitter vacua in heterotic string theory. On the other hand, the absence of a well-defined Wilsonian effective action and other related phenomena also appear to rule out such time-dependent vacua with de Sitter isometries, even in the presence of quantum corrections. In this note, we argue that a four-dimensional de Sitter space can still exist in SO(32) heterotic string theory as a Glauber-Sudarshan state, i.e. as a coherent state, over a supersymmetric Minkowski background, albeit within a finite temporal domain. Borel resummation and resurgence play a crucial role in constructing such a state in the Hilbert space of heterotic theory governed entirely by the IR degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Does the Cosmological Constant really indicate the existence of a Dark Dimension?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16548v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to the "dark dimension" (DD) scenario, we might live in a universe with a single compact extra dimension, whose mesoscopic size is dictated by the measured value of the cosmological constant. This scenario is based on swampland conjectures, that lead to the relation $\rho_{\rm swamp}\sim m_{_{\rm KK}}^4$ between the vacuum energy $\rho_{\rm swamp}$ and the size of the extra dimension $m_{_{\rm KK}}^{-1}$ ($m_{_{\rm KK}}$ is the mass scale of a Kaluza-Klein tower), and on the corresponding result $\rho_{_{\rm EFT}}$ from the EFT limit. We show that $\rho_{_{\rm EFT}}$ contains previously missed UV-sensitive terms, whose presence invalidates the widely spread belief (based on existing literature) that the calculation gives automatically the finite result $\rho_{_{\rm EFT}}\sim m_{_{\rm KK}}^4$ (with no need for fine-tuning). This renders the matching between $\rho_{\rm swamp}$ and $\rho_{_{\rm EFT}}$ a non-trivial issue. We then comment on the necessity to find a mechanism that implements the suppression of the aforementioned UV-sensitive terms. This should finally allow to frame the DD scenario in a self-consistent framework, also in view of its several phenomenological applications based on EFT calculations.</description>

      <title>Removing the mask -- reconstructing a scalar field on the sphere from a masked field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper analyses a spectral approach to reconstructing a scalar field on the sphere, given only information about a masked version of the field together with precise information about the (smooth) mask. The theory is developed for a general mask, and later specialised to the case of an axially symmetric mask. Numerical experiments are given for the case of an axial mask motivated by the cosmic microwave background, assuming that the underlying field is a realisation of a Gaussian random field with an artificial angular power spectrum of moderate degree ($\ell \le 100$). The recovery is highly satisfactory in the absence of noise and even in the presence of moderate noise.</description>

      <title>On Carrollian and Galilean contractions of BMS algebra in 3 and 4 dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17245v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we find a class of Carrollian and Galilean contractions of (extended) BMS algebra in 3+1 and 2+1 dimensions. To this end, we investigate possible embeddings of 3D/4D Poincar\'{e} into the BMS${}_3$ and BMS${}_4$ algebras, respectively. The contraction limits in the 2+1-dimensional case are then enforced by appropriate contractions of its Poincar\'{e} subalgebras. In 3+1 dimensions, we have to apply instead the analogy between the structures of Poincar\'{e} and BMS algebra. In the case of non-vanishing cosmological constant in 2+1 dimensions, we consider the contractions of $\Lambda$-BMS${}_3$ algebra in an analogous manner.</description>

      <title>Loop Corrections in Bispectrum in USR Inflation with PBHs Formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the one-loop corrections in bispectrum of CMB scale perturbations induced from the small scale modes undergoing an intermediate phase of USR inflation in scenarios employed for PBHs formation. Using the formalism of effective field theory of inflation we calculate the cubic and quartic Hamiltonians and perform the in-in analysis for a subset of Feynman diagrams comprising both the cubic and the quartic exchange vertices. We show the one-loop corrections in bispectrum has the local shape with $f_{NL}$ having the same structure as the one-loop correction in power spectrum in their dependence on the duration of the USR phase and the sharpness of the transition to the final attractor phase. It is shown that in the models with a sharp transition the induced loop corrections in bispectrum can quickly violate the observational bounds on $f_{NL}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10068v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In [1] we pointed out that in the Dark Dimension scenario [2] theoretical issues arise when the prediction for the vacuum energy $\rho$, that is obtained from swampland conjectures in string theory, is confronted with the corresponding result for $\rho$ in the effective field theory (EFT) limit. One of the problems concerns the widely spread belief that in higher dimensional EFTs with compact dimensions the vacuum energy is automatically finite. On the contrary, our analysis shows that $\rho$ contains (previously missed) UV-sensitive terms. Our work was challenged in [3]. Here we show why in our opinion the claims in [3] are flawed, and provide further support to our findings. We conclude presenting ideas on the physical mechanism that should dispose of the large UV contributions to $\rho$.</description>

      <title>What if string theory has a de Sitter excited state?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11680v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose precise effective field theory criteria to obtain a four-dimensional de Sitter space within M-theory. To this effect, starting with the state space described by the action of metric perturbations, fluxes etc over the supersymmetric Minkowski vacuum in eleven-dimensions, we discuss the most general low energy effective action in terms of the eleven-dimensional fields including non-perturbative and non-local terms. Given this, our criteria to obtain a valid four-dimensional de Sitter solution at far IR involve satisfying the Schwinger-Dyson equations of the associated path integral, as well as obeying positivity constraints on the dual IIA string coupling and its time derivative. For excited states, the Schwinger-Dyson equations imply an effective emergent potential different from the original potential. We show that while vacuum solutions and arbitrary coherent states fail to satisfy these criteria, a specific class of excited states called the Glauber-Sudarshan states obey them. Using the resurgent structure of observables computed using the path integral over the Glauber-Sudarshan states, four-dimensional de Sitter in the flat slicing can be constructed using a Glauber-Sudarshan state in M-theory.
  Among other novel results, we discuss the smallness of the positive cosmological constant, including the curious case where the cosmological constant is very slowly varying with time. We also discuss the resolution of identity with the Glauber-Sudarshan states, generation and the convergence properties of the non-perturbative and the non-local effects, the problems with the static patch and other related topics. We analyze briefly the issues related to the compatibility of the Wilsonian effective action with Borel resummations and discuss how they influence the effective field theory description in a four-dimensional de Sitter space.</description>

      <title>The proper way to spatially decompose the gravitational-wave origin in stellar collapse simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) hold great potential for an unobscured view of protoneutron stars (PNSs) formed as a result of stellar collapses. While waiting for discovery, deepening the understanding of GW emission in theory is beneficial for both optimizing searching strategies and deciphering the eventual data. One significant aspect is the spatially dependent contribution to the overall GW signal extracted from sophisticated hydrodynamic simulations. I present the proper way to perform the spatial decomposition of GW strain with the quadrupole formula in the slow-motion and weak-field approximation. Then I demonstrate the approach using the results of a 2D axisymmetric pseudo-Newtonian hydrodynamic simulation of core-collapse supernova. I show a detailed comparison between the proper and improper methods and discuss the possible consequences based on the improper method. Moreover, with the correct approach, the GW spatial profiles agree well with those calculated from a consistent perturbative method.</description>

      <title>Galaxy groups in the presence of Cosmological Constant: Increasing the Masses of Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14944v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The boundaries of galaxy groups and clusters are defined by the interplay between the Newtonian attractive force and the decoupling from the local expansion of the Universe. This work extends the definition of a zero radial acceleration surface (ZRAS) and the turnaround surface (TS) for a general distribution of the masses in an expanding background, governed by the cosmological constant. We apply these definitions to different galaxy groups in the local Universe, mapping these groups up to ten megaparsec distances. We discuss the dipole and the quadrupole rate for the Local Group of Galaxies and the implementations on the Hubble diagram correction and galaxy groups virialization. With these definitions, we present the surfaces showing the interplay between the local expansion vs the local Newtonian attraction for galaxy groups in the local Universe. Further, we estimate the masses of different galaxy groups and show that the inclusion of the Cosmological Constant in the analysis predicts these masses to be higher by 5-10\%. For instance the Local Group of Galaxies is estimated to be $(2.47 \pm 0.08) \cdot 10^{12} M_{\odot}$. For the groups with enough tracers close to the TS, the contribution of the Cosmological Constant makes the masses to be even higher. The results show the importance of including the local cosmic expansion in analyzing the Cosmic Flow of the local Universe.</description>

      <title>Large $D$ gravity and low $D$ string via $\alpha^{\prime}$ corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the correspondence between large $D$ gravity and low $D$ string theory to the most general case, including its T-dual solutions. It is well-known that the large $D$ limit of the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole in gravity becomes a two-dimensional near-horizon geometry. Similarly, the large $D$ limit of its T-dual solution, obtained by the Buscher rules, namely the string black hole with a naked singularity, reduces to a two-dimensional near-singularity geometry. Both of these geometries are described by the two-dimensional low-energy effective action of string theory and are related to each other by scale-factor duality. Secondly, we demonstrate that these near-horizon/singuglarity geometries, including complete $\alpha^{\prime}$ corrections, can be described by the two-dimensional Hohm-Zwiebach action. This approach allows for the derivation of non-perturbative and non-singular solutions. Furthermore, the Hohm-Zwiebach action provides a systematic way to investigate the $\alpha^{\prime}$-corrected near-horizon/singularity geometries of different kinds of black holes, which are difficult to achieve through the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model method.</description>

      <title>Multidimensionality of the Hubble tension: the roles of $\Omega_m$ and $\omega_c$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hubble tension is inherently multidimensional, and bears important implications for parameters beyond $H_0$. We discuss the key role of the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$ and the physical cold dark matter density $\omega_c$. We argue that once $\Omega_m$ and the physical baryon density $\omega_b$ are calibrated, through Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and/or Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) for $\Omega_m$, and via Big Bang Nucleosynthesis for $\omega_b$, any model raising $H_0$ requires raising $\omega_c$ and, under minimal assumptions, also the clustering parameter $S_8$. We explicitly verify that this behaviour holds when analyzing recent BAO and SNeIa data. We argue that a calibration of $\Omega_m$ as reliable and model-independent as possible should be a priority in the Hubble tension discussion, and an interesting possibility in this sense could be represented by galaxy cluster gas mass fraction measurements.</description>

      <title>Performance-Portable Binary Neutron Star Mergers with AthenaK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an extension to the AthenaK code for general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) in dynamical spacetimes using a 3+1 conservative Eulerian formulation. Like the fixed-spacetime GRMHD solver, we use standard finite-volume methods to evolve the fluid and a constrained transport scheme to preserve the divergence-free constraint for the magnetic field. We also utilize a first-order flux correction (FOFC) scheme to reduce the need for an artificial atmosphere and optionally enforce a maximum principle to improve robustness. We demonstrate the accuracy of AthenaK using a set of standard tests in flat and curved spacetimes. Using a SANE accretion disk around a Kerr black hole, we compare the new solver to the existing solver for stationary spacetimes using the so-called "HARM-like" formulation. We find that both formulations converge to similar results. We also include the first published binary neutron star (BNS) mergers performed on graphical processing units (GPUs). Thanks to the FOFC scheme, our BNS mergers maintain a relative error of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-11})$ or better in baryon mass conservation up to collapse. Finally, we perform scaling tests of AthenaK on OLCF Frontier, where we show excellent weak scaling of $\geq 80\%$ efficiency up to 32768 GPUs and $74\%$ up to 65536 GPUs for a GRMHD problem in dynamical spacetimes with six levels of mesh refinement. AthenaK achieves an order-of-magnitude speedup using GPUs compared to CPUs, demonstrating that it is suitable for performing numerical relativity problems on modern exascale resources.</description>
