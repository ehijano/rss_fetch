      <title>Breaking the Strings: the signatures of Cosmic String Loop Fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of fragmentation on the cosmic string loop number density, using an approach inspired by the three-scale model and a Boltzmann equation. We build a new formulation designed to be more amenable to numerical resolution and present two complementary numerical methods to obtain the full loop distribution including the effect of fragmentation and gravitational radiation. We show that fragmentation generically predicts a decay of the loop number density on large scales and a deviation from a pure power-law. We expect fragmentation to be crucial for the calibration of loop distribution models.</description>

      <title>Bulk viscous cosmological models with cosmological constant: Observational constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether viscous cold dark matter (vCDM) in a $\Lambda$-dominated FLRW universe can alleviate the Hubble tension while satisfying thermodynamic constraints, examining both flat and curved geometries. We model vCDM with bulk viscosity $\zeta = \zeta_0\,(\Omega_{vc}/\Omega_{vc0})^m$, where $m$ determines the viscosity evolution and $\Omega_{vc}$ is the density parameter of vCDM. We explore two particular scenarios: constant viscosity ($m=0$), and variable viscosity ($m$ free). Using Bayesian inference, we constrain these models with the latest datasets: the Pantheon+ SN Ia sample (both with SH0ES calibration, PPS, and without it, PP), $H(z)$ measurements from CC and BAO as separate datasets, and a Gaussian prior on $H_0$ from 2022 SH0ES baseline, $H_0=73.04 \pm 1.04$ km/s/Mpc (R22 prior). We compare the models via information criteria such as AIC, BIC, DIC, and Bayesian evidence. Our results reveal that the Hubble tension persists, although it shows partial alleviation ($\sim 1\sigma$ tension) in all investigated scenarios when local measurements are included. For the flat $m=0$ case, the joint analysis yields $H_0 = 71.05^{+0.62}_{-0.60}$ km/s/Mpc. Curved model initially favors $\Omega_{K0} &gt; 0$ (at more than $2\sigma$), but this preference shifts toward flatness once the PPS+R22 prior are included. Notably, the current viscosity is constrained to $\zeta_0 \sim 10^6$ Pa s in all scenarios, in agreement with the thermodynamic requirements. Although model selection via BIC and Bayesian evidence favors $\Lambda$CDM, AIC and DIC show mild support for viscous models in some datasets. Bulk viscous models moderately improve fits but neither resolve the Hubble tension nor outperform the $\Lambda$CDM model. To achieve more robust constraints, future analyses should incorporate CMB observations, which are expected to break parameter degeneracies involving $m$ and $\tilde{\zeta}_0$.</description>

      <title>Shedding light on dark matter spikes through neutrino-dark matter interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of neutrino mass remains an open question in particle physics. One intriguing possibility is that neutrinos are massless in vacuum but acquire an effective refractive mass through interactions with ultralight dark matter (DM) during propagation. We investigate the capability of the upcoming Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) to probe such refractive masses using the time-of-flight delays of neutrinos from a galactic core-collapse supernova. Our analysis shows that DUNE can set competitive bounds on the refractive neutrino mass, with sensitivity significantly enhanced if neutrinos traverse a DM density spike near the Galactic Center. In particular, we quantify how the presence of a spike modifies the projected limits, demonstrating that supernova neutrino observations at DUNE provide a powerful and novel avenue to test both the nature of neutrino masses and the distribution of DM in the innermost regions of the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Population III star formation near high-redshift active galactic nuclei</title>

Abstract: Using cosmological radiation-hydrodynamical simulations, we study the effect of accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) on nearby dark-matter (DM) haloes in the very early universe. We find that an SMBH with a spectral energy distribution (SED) extending from the near-ultraviolet to hard X-rays, can produce a radiation background sufficient to delay gravitational collapse in surrounding DM haloes until up to $10^7$ M$_\odot$ of zero-metallicity gas is available for the formation of Population III (Pop III) stars or direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs). We model three scenarios, corresponding to an SMBH located at physical distances of 10, 100, and 1000 kpc from the Pop III host DM halo. Using these three scenarios, we use the SED to compute self-consistent photoionization, photoheating, and photodissociation rates. We include the effects of Compton scattering and gas self-shielding. The X-ray portion of the spectrum maintains an elevated free-electron fraction as the gas collapses to high density. This stimulates H2 formation, allowing the gas to cool further while counteracting the dissociation of H2 by Lyman-Werner radiation. As a result, a large cluster of Pop III stars is expected to form, except in the case with the most intense radiation in which a DCBH may instead form. Our simulated Pop III clusters have comparable HeII 1640 luminosities to the recently discovered Pop III host candidate near GN-z11, observed by the James Webb Space Telescope. In two of the scenarios we consider, the resulting clusters could be detectable using the telescope's NIRSpec instrument out to z ~ 15.</description>

      <title>Extra-natural production of superheavy Kaluza-Klein particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gauge fields in extra compact dimensions can drive inflation in the four-dimensional (4D) non-compact spacetime, a scenario known as extra-natural inflation. A time-dependent gauge field configuration generates the electric field along the compact dimension, enabling the production of Kaluza-Klein (KK) particles charged under the field via the Schwinger effect. We construct the extra-natural inflation model within a five-dimensional (5D) quantum electrodynamics (QED) framework coupled to gravity including matter fields that generate the inflationary one-loop effective potential. In general, multiple charged fields can exist, and we show that KK particle production occurs under these conditions. Since KK momentum is conserved, the produced KK particles may become superheavy dark matter or dominate the universe, depending on the model parameters. Furthermore, we show that even when the gauge field acts not as the inflaton but as a spectator field, its post-inflationary oscillations, initiated when the Hubble friction becomes negligible, can also generate superheavy KK modes. This suggests that KK particle production is a generic outcome when gauge potentials along compact dimensions are light.</description>

      <title>Nambu-Goldstone boson phenomenology in Domain-Wall Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Domain-Wall Standard Model (DWSM), a five-dimensional framework in which all Standard Model (SM) particles are localized on a domain wall embedded in a non-compact extra spatial dimension. A distinctive feature of this setup is the emergence of a Nambu-Goldstone (NG) boson, arising from the spontaneous breaking of translational invariance in the extra dimension due to the localization of SM chiral fermions. This NG boson couples via Yukawa interactions to SM fermions and their Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitations. We study the phenomenology of this NG boson and derive constraints from astrophysical processes (supernova cooling), Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), and collider searches for KK-mode fermions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The strongest limits arise from LHC data: we reinterpret existing mass bounds on squarks and sleptons in simplified supersymmetric models (assuming a massless lightest neutralino), as well as limits on exotic hadrons containing long-lived squarks or long-lived charged sleptons in the regime of extremely small Yukawa couplings. From this analysis, we obtain a conservative lower bound of 1 TeV on the masses of KK-mode quarks and charged leptons. Finally, we discuss the prospects for producing KK-mode fermions at future high-energy lepton colliders and outline strategies to distinguish their signatures from those of sfermions.</description>

      <title>ACT inflation and its influence on reheating era in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the observational viability of non-minimally coupled scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (GB) gravity, during inflation and post-inflationary reheating dynamics, from the perspective of the latest ACT-DR6 combined with the Planck 2018 and BAO data. It turns out that the ACT result considerably affects the inflationary e-fold number compared to the case where only Planck 2018 data is taken into account. The viable parameter spaces corresponding to the inflationary ACT-DR6+Planck18+BAO substantially influence the reheating phenomenology via the reheating equation of state ($w_\mathrm{eff}$) and the reheating temperature. In particular, the ACT-DR6+Planck18+BAO data seems to disfavor $w_\mathrm{eff} &lt; 1/3$ during the reheating stage, which is unlike to that of only Planck 2018 case. These reveal how the ACT-DR6 data hits the early universe phenomenology from inflation to reheating in the context of higher curvature like scalar-Einstein-GB theory of gravity.</description>

Abstract: We explore the potential of using late-time galaxy spins to test the parity symmetry of primordial vector fossils. Using $N$-body simulations, we analyze halo spins as a reliable proxy for galaxy spins to investigate the detectability of this effect. We develop a novel approach to generate initial conditions (ICs) that have substantial parity asymmetry but do not alter the initial matter power spectrum. We construct the initial spin fields from the parity broken ICs and halo spin fields using late-time halos evolved from such ICs. Focusing on the helicity of these vector fields, we detect substantial asymmetry in the initial spin field. In addition, we find that over $50\%$ of the initial spin field's asymmetry remains in the late-time halo spin field on a range of scales. Based on mock galaxy spin fields derived from the halo spin fields, we forecast that a maximum detection at $13\sigma$ is possible with the final DESI BGS for the model considered in this analysis. Our findings demonstrate that primordial vectorial parity violation survives nonlinear gravitational evolution, and thus, can be effectively probed with galaxy spins at late times.</description>

      <title>Model-Independent Test of Prerecombination New Physics: Measuring the Sound Horizon with Gravitational Wave Standard Sirens and the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation Angular Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a broad class of cosmological models where spacetime is described by a pseudo-Riemannian manifold, photons propagate along null geodesics, and their number is conserved, upcoming Gravitational Wave (GW) observations can be combined with measurements of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) angular scale to provide model-independent estimates of the sound horizon at the baryon-drag epoch. By focusing on the accuracy expected from forthcoming surveys such as LISA GW standard sirens and DESI or Euclid angular BAO measurements, we forecast a relative precision of $\sigma_{r_{\rm d}} /r_{\rm d} \sim 1.5\%$ within the redshift range $z \lesssim 1$. This approach will offer a unique model-independent measure of a fundamental scale characterizing the early universe, which is competitive with model-dependent values inferred within specific theoretical frameworks. These measurements can serve as a consistency test for $\Lambda$CDM, potentially clarifying the nature of the Hubble tension and confirming or ruling out new physics prior to recombination with a statistical significance of $\sim 4\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Discovery and Multi-Wavelength Analysis of a New Dissociative Galaxy Merger: The Champagne Cluster</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a new binary galaxy cluster merger, the Champagne Cluster (RM J130558.9+263048.4), using a detection method that identifies dynamically active clusters in the redMaPPer SDSS DR8 photometric galaxy cluster catalog. The Champagne Cluster exhibits the classic X-ray morphology of a post-pericenter dissociative galaxy cluster merger: an X-ray peak located between two galaxy overdensities at the same redshift. We conducted a Keck/DEIMOS survey and obtained redshifts for {\bfseries 102} member galaxies. The redshift analysis indicates a relative velocity of 411 $\pm$ 180 km/s between the two subclusters, which suggests that the merger is happening near the plane of the sky. We estimated the bulk temperature (8.20 $\pm 1.2$ keV) and total X-ray luminosity (7.29 $\pm$ 0.19 $\times$ $10^{44}$ erg $\times$ $s^{-1}$) of the intracluster medium using $\textit{Chandra}$ archival data. We used the $\textit{ClusterPyXT}$ software to make a temperature map, and we compared it to hydrodynamic simulations to constrain the time since pericenter (TSP), the impact parameter, and the mass ratio. We found two scenarios that matched our data: a returning system with an impact parameter of 0 and TSP of 2.2 Gyr, and an outbound system with an impact parameter of 500 kpc and TSP of 0.4 Gyr. Both scenarios have a mass ratio of 1:10.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the framework of microlensing to show that observations of binary systems, such as those made by {\it Gaia}, combined with follow-up weak lensing measurements, can provide a means to probe halos of exotic matter, possibly clumped around compact objects such as black holes. This could potentially cover a broad range of physical scenarios - from dark matter mini-halos to black holes with bosonic configurations around them, known as hair. In a dark halo-regular star binary system, assuming that light can freely propagate through the halo of the exotic matter, the companion star will produce characteristic, sizable lensing signatures due to the lens's potential deviating from a point mass gravitational potential. The signature of the multiple images, the magnification and the light-curve could be the smoking gun of such a dark halo structure. We discuss how the precise observations of the {\it Gaia} survey offer an opportunity to search for new, yet undiscovered fundamental fields interacting gravitationally with baryons.</description>

      <title>Tomographic Alcock-Paczynski Test with Marked Correlation Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20478v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tomographic Alcock-Paczynski (AP) method, developed over the past decade, exploits redshift evolution for cosmological determination, aiming to mitigate contamination from redshift distortions and capture nonlinear scale information. Marked Correlation Functions (MCFs) extend information beyond the two-point correlation. For the first time, this study integrated the tomographic AP test with MCFs to constrain the flat $w$CDM cosmology model. Our findings show that multiple density weights in MCFs outperform the traditional two-point correlation function, reducing the uncertainties of the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$ and dark energy equation of state $w$ by 48\% and 45\%, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce a novel principal component analysis (PCA) compression scheme that efficiently projects high-dimensional statistical measurements into a compact set of eigenmodes while preserving most of the cosmological information. This approach retains significantly more information than traditional coarse binning methods, which simply average adjacent bins in a lossy manner. Applying PCA compression also enables the effective use of marked correlation functions in 2D $(s,\mu)$ space, yielding an additional $\sim 50\%$ reduction in error margins. To assess robustness, we incorporate realistic redshift errors expected in future spectroscopic surveys. While these errors modestly degrade cosmological constraints, our combined framework, which utiizes MCFs and PCA compression within tomographic AP tests, is less affected and always yield to tight cosmological constraints. This scheme remains highly promising for upcoming slitless spectroscopic surveys, such as the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST).</description>

      <title>Challenging $\Lambda$CDM: 5$\sigma$ Evidence for a Dynamical Dark Energy Late-Time Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, there has been considerable debate regarding potential evidence for the dynamical nature of dark energy (DE), particularly in light of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements released by DESI survey. In this work, we propose an agnostic test that simultaneously constrains the dark energy (DE) equation of state (EoS) and probes the possibility of a transition between the quintessence and phantom regimes, or vice versa. Our initial approach is independent of physical priors, allowing the data to determine which behavior best fits the parameters. We then consider a minimally modified gravity theory known as VCDM, into which we can map our initial approximation, placing it within a theoretically stable framework. To this end, we incorporate the most up-to-date datasets available, including BAO measurements from DESI-DR2, Type Ia Supernovae from the PantheonPlus, DESY5, and Union3 samples, as well as Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from Planck. Our analysis reveals strong and statistically significant evidence for a quintessence-phantom transition across various data combinations. \textit{The strongest evidence is found for Planck+DESI+DESY5, with a significance exceeding $\sim$5$\sigma$ in favor of a quintessence-phantom transition at $z_{\dag} = 0.493^{+0.063}_{-0.081}$}. Beyond this redshift, the EoS remains within the phantom regime, while for $z &lt; z_{\dag}$, it favors the quintessence regime. Despite this strong indication, \textit{we find that such transitions do not resolve the $H_0$ tension}</description>

      <title>CSST Cosmological Emulator II: Generalized Accurate Halo Mass Function Emulation</title>

Abstract: Accurate theoretical prediction for halo mass function across a broad cosmological space is crucial for the forthcoming China Space Station Telescope (CSST) observations, which will capture cosmological information from multiple probes, e.g., cluster abundance, and weak lensing. In this work, we quantify the percent-level impact of different mass binning schemes when measuring the differential halo mass function from simulations, and demonstrate that the cumulative form of the halo mass function is independent of the binning scheme. Through the recently finished Kun simulation suite, we propose a generalized framework to construct multiple accurate halo mass function emulators for different halo mass definitions, including $M_{200m}$, $M_{vir}$, and $M_{200c}$. This extends our CSST Emulator to provide fast and accurate halo mass function predictions for halo mass $M\geq 10^{12}\,h^{-1}M_{\odot}$ up to $z=3.0$. For redshifts $z\leq 1.0$, the accuracy is within $2\%$ for $M\leq 10^{13}\,h^{-1}M_{\odot}$, $5\%$ for $M\leq 10^{14}\,h^{-1}M_{\odot}$, and $10\%$ for $M\leq 10^{15}\,h^{-1}M_{\odot}$, which is comparable with the statistical errors of training simulations. This tool is integrated in CSST Emulator and publicly available at https://github.com/czymh/csstemu, providing a fast and accurate theoretical tool to obtain unbiased cosmological constraints of the upcoming CSST survey.</description>

      <title>Milliarcsecond astrometric oscillations in active galactic nuclei as a precursor of multi-messenger gravitational wave events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02146v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) is predicted by various cosmological and evolutionary scenarios for active galactic nuclei. These objects are considered as contributors into the gravitational wave (GW) background and emitters of discrete GW bursts. Yet, SMBHBs remain a rather elusive class of extragalactic objects. Previously we have identified the quasar J2102+6015 as potential SMBHB system based on its oscillating astrometric pattern. We analysed the available VLBI astrometry data and identified another case of astrometric oscillations in the source J0204+1514. We assume these oscillations as manifestations of orbital motion in a binary systems. We estimated parameters of the suspected SMBHB in this source and applied basic theoretical models for projecting its evolution toward coalescence. We also develop a toy model of SMBHB consistent with the discovered astrometric oscillations and give quantitative predictions of GW emission of such the source using the case of J0204+1514 as an example. As an ad hoc result, we also provide a re-assessed estimate of the redshift of J2102+6015, z=1.42. A toy model of the object containing SMBHB with parameters consistent with the observed astrometric oscillations of the source J0204+1514 enabled us to consider GW emission as the cause of the system's orbital evolution. Astrometric VLBI monitoring has an appreciable potential for future detections of SMBHBs as multi-messenger targets for both electromagnetic (in radio domain) and gravitational wave astronomy. To outline the contours of a future physical model connecting SMBHB with detectable GW manifestations, we apply the toy model to the source J0204+1514. We also provide justification for aiming future space-borne VLBI missions toward direct imaging of SMBHBs as a synergistic contribution into future multi-messenger studies involving prospective GW facilities.</description>

      <title>Prior-free cosmological parameter estimation of Cosmicflows-4</title>

Abstract: As tracers of the underlying mass distributions, galaxies' peculiar velocities are valuable probes of the Universe, allowing us to measure the Hubble constant or to map the large scale structure and its dynamics. Yet, catalogs of peculiar velocities are noisy, scarce and prone to various interpretation biases. We aim to measure the bulk flow and the Hubble constant directly from the largest available sample of peculiar velocities, and without imposing a cosmological prior on the velocity field. To address these issues, we analyze the Cosmicflows-4 catalog, the most extensive catalog of galaxy peculiar velocities, reaching a redshift $z=0.1$. Specifically, we construct a forward modeling approach assuming only a flat Universe, which reconstructs the radial and bulk flows of the velocity field directly from measurements of peculiar velocities. Our method accurately recovers cosmological parameters within a radius of $120\ \mathrm{Mpc/h}$ that can then be compared with the predictions from $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$. Apart from a $3\sigma$ tension with $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$ on the magnitude around $120\ \mathrm{Mpc/h}$ associated with a $4\sigma$ tension on the supergalactic $X$ direction, we find a general agreement between the standard model and the observations. Lastly, our analysis suggests a Hubble constant value of approximately $75.8\pm0.4\ \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, exacerbating (or independently confirming) the existing "Hubble tension", however, for the first time accomplished with the largest set of peculiar velocities in existence.</description>

      <title>The Dark Energy Bedrock All-Sky Supernova Program: Cross Calibration, Simulations, and Cosmology Forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have been essential for probing the nature of dark energy; however, most SN analyses rely on the same low-redshift sample, which may lead to shared systematics. In a companion paper (arXiv:2508.10878), we introduce the Dark Energy Bedrock All-Sky Supernova (DEBASS) program, which has already collected more than 500 low-redshift SNe Ia on the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), and present an initial release of 77 SNe Ia within the Dark Energy Survey (DES) footprint observed between 2021 and 2024. Here, we examine the systematics, including photometric calibration and selection effects. We find agreement at the 10 millimagnitude level among the tertiary standard stars of DEBASS, DES, and Pan-STARRS1. Our simulations reproduce the observed distributions of DEBASS SN light-curve properties, and we measure a bias-corrected Hubble residual scatter of $0.08$ mag, which, while small, is found in 10% of our simulations. We compare the DEBASS SN distances to the Foundation sample and find consistency with a median residual offset of $0.016 \pm 0.019$ mag. Selection effects have negligible impacts on distances, but a different photometric calibration solution shifts the median residual $-0.015 \pm 0.019$ mag, highlighting calibration sensitivity. Using conservative simulations, we forecast that replacing historical low-redshift samples with the full DEBASS sample (&gt;400 SNe Ia) will improve the statistical uncertainties on dark energy parameters $w_0$ and $w_a$ by 30% and 24% respectively, enhance the dark energy Figure of Merit by up to 60%, and enable a measurement of $f\sigma_8$ at the 25% level.</description>

      <title>Supercooled phase transitions in conformal dark sectors explain NANOGrav data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11619v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to recent lore, it is difficult to explain the evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background obtained by pulsar timing arrays with supercooled first-order phase transitions (FOPTs). We demonstrate that supercooled FOPTs in dark U(1)' models with a conformal dark sector easily explain the nHz signal at NANOGrav.</description>

      <title>Exploring sub-GeV dark matter via $s$-wave, $p$-wave, and resonance annihilation with CMB data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18263v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit constraints on sub-GeV dark matter (DM) annihilation via $s$-wave, $p$-wave, and resonance processes using current and future CMB data from Planck, FIRAS, and upcoming experiments such as LiteBIRD, CMB-S4, PRISTINE, and PIXIE. For $s$-wave annihilation, we provide updated limits for both $e^{+}e^{-}$ and $\pi\pi$ channels, with the profile likelihood method yielding stronger constraints than the marginal posterior method. In the $p$-wave case, we comprehensively present a model-independent inequality for the 95\% upper limits from FIRAS, PRISTINE, and PIXIE, with future experiments expected to surpass current BBN limits. For resonance annihilation, we report -- for the first time -- the $95\%$ upper limits on the decay branching ratio of the mediator particle, when the resonance peaks during the recombination epoch. Overall, our study highlights the complementary strengths of $\mu$-distortion and CMB anisotropies in probing sub-GeV DM annihilation.</description>

      <title>EDGE: The emergence of dwarf galaxy scaling relations from cosmological radiation-hydrodynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new suite of EDGE (`Engineering Dwarfs at Galaxy formation's Edge') cosmological zoom simulations. The suite includes 15 radiation-hydrodynamical dwarf galaxies covering the ultra-faint to the dwarf irregular regime ($10^4 \leq M_{\star}(z=0) \leq 10^8 \, M_{\odot}$) to enable comparisons with observed scaling relations. Each object in the suite is evolved at high resolution ($\approx 3 \, \text{pc}$) and includes stellar radiation, winds and supernova feedback channels. We compare with previous \textsc{edge} simulations without radiation, finding that radiative feedback results in significantly weaker galactic outflows. This generalizes our previous findings to a wide mass range, and reveals that the effect is most significant at low $M_{\star}$. Despite this difference, stellar masses stay within a factor of two of each other, and key scaling relations of dwarf galaxies (size-mass, neutral gas-stellar mass, gas-phase mass-metallicity) emerge correctly in both simulation suites. Only the stellar mass -- stellar metallicity relation is strongly sensitive to the change in feedback. This highlights how obtaining statistical samples of dwarf galaxy stellar abundances with next-generation spectrographs will be key to probing and constraining the baryon cycle of dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole-star binaries via dynamical friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05564v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a new channel for binary system formation involving stars and stellar-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) embedded in dark matter (DM) minihalos. In this scenario, binaries form when a star passes through the DM minihalo surrounding a PBH and loses sufficient energy due to dynamical friction. The continued energy loss induced by this friction is expected to drive the resulting systems to merge rapidly. We estimate their merger rate and explore the implications for two observables: rapidly decaying X-ray binaries in the Milky Way and gravitational waves sourced by compact object mergers. We find that, for a PBH abundance $\Omega_\text{PBH}/\Omega_\text{DM} = 0.01$, this mechanism naturally produces a population of $\mathcal{O}(1)$ currently observable short-lived X-ray binaries. It also leads to a non-negligible gravitational wave event rate of $\mathcal{O}(0.3)$ Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$, potentially involving high mass ratios and black holes in the lower or upper mass gap. Notably, most mergers arise in low-mass galaxies, making the latter rate sensitive to the low-mass end of the galaxy stellar mass function. The dynamical friction channel thus offers a plausible explanation for several unusual observations reported in recent years across both the X-ray and gravitational wave domains.</description>
