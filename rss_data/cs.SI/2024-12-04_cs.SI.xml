      <title>Identifying Key Nodes for the Influence Spread using a Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification of key nodes in complex networks is an important topic in many network science areas. It is vital to a variety of real-world applications, including viral marketing, epidemic spreading and influence maximization. In recent years, machine learning algorithms have proven to outperform the conventional, centrality-based methods in accuracy and consistency, but this approach still requires further refinement. What information about the influencers can be extracted from the network? How can we precisely obtain the labels required for training? Can these models generalize well? In this paper, we answer these questions by presenting an enhanced machine learning-based framework for the influence spread problem. We focus on identifying key nodes for the Independent Cascade model, which is a popular reference method. Our main contribution is an improved process of obtaining the labels required for training by introducing 'Smart Bins' and proving their advantage over known methods. Next, we show that our methodology allows ML models to not only predict the influence of a given node, but to also determine other characteristics of the spreading process-which is another novelty to the relevant literature. Finally, we extensively test our framework and its ability to generalize beyond complex networks of different types and sizes, gaining important insight into the properties of these methods.</description>

      <title>Strong Friendship Paradox in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The friendship paradox in social networks states that your friends have more friends than you do, on average. Recently, a stronger variant of the paradox was shown to hold for most people within a network: `most of your friends have more friends than you do.' Unlike the original paradox, which arises trivially because a few very popular people appear in the social circles of many others and skew their average friend popularity, the strong friendship paradox depends on features of higher-order network structures. Similar to the original paradox, the strong friendship paradox generalizes beyond popularity. When individuals have traits, many will observe that most of their friends have more of that trait than they do. This can lead to the Majority illusion, in which a rare trait will appear highly prevalent within a network. Understanding how the strong friendship paradox biases local observations within networks can inform better measurements of network structure and our understanding of collective phenomena in networks.</description>

      <title>Towards the efficacy of federated prediction for epidemics on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epidemic prediction is of practical significance in public health, enabling early intervention, resource allocation, and strategic planning. However, privacy concerns often hinder the sharing of health data among institutions, limiting the development of accurate prediction models. In this paper, we develop a general privacy-preserving framework for node-level epidemic prediction on networks based on federated learning (FL). We frame the spatio-temporal spread of epidemics across multiple data-isolated subnetworks, where each node state represents the aggregate epidemic severity within a community. Then, both the pure temporal LSTM model and the spatio-temporal model i.e., Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention Network (STGAT) are proposed to address the federated epidemic prediction. Extensive experiments are conducted on various epidemic processes using a practical airline network, offering a comprehensive assessment of FL efficacy under diverse scenarios. By introducing the efficacy energy metric to measure system robustness under various client configurations, we systematically explore key factors influencing FL performance, including client numbers, aggregation strategies, graph partitioning, missing infectious reports. Numerical results manifest that STGAT excels in capturing spatio-temporal dependencies in dynamic processes whereas LSTM performs well in simpler pattern. Moreover, our findings highlight the importance of balancing feature consistency and volume uniformity among clients, as well as the prediction dilemma between information richness and intrinsic stochasticity of dynamic processes. This study offers practical insights into the efficacy of FL scenario in epidemic management, demonstrates the potential of FL to address broader collective dynamics.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Information Shared by Participants to Coding Challenges: The Case of Advent of Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advent of Code (AoC from now on) is a popular coding challenge requiring to solve programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and levels. AoC follows the advent calendar, therefore it is an annual challenge that lasts for 25 days. AoC participants usually post their solutions on social networks and discuss them online. These challenges are interesting to study since they could highlight the adoption of new tools, the evolution of the developer community, or the technological requirements of well-known companies. For these reasons, we first create a dataset of the 2019-2021 AoC editions containing the discussion threads made on the subreddit {\tt /r/adventofcode}. Then, we propose a model based on stream graphs to best study this context, where we represent its most important actors through time: participants, comments, and programming languages. Thanks to our model, we investigate user participation, adoption of new programming languages during a challenge and between two of them, and resiliency of programming languages based on a Stack Overflow survey. We find that the top-used programming languages are almost the same in the three years, pointing out their importance. Moreover, participants tend to keep the same programming language for the whole challenge, while the ones attending two AoCs usually change it in the next one. Finally, we observe interesting results about the programming languages that are ``Popular'' or ``Loved'' according to the Stack Overflow survey. Firstly, these are the ones adopted for the longest time in an AoC edition, thanks to which users have a high chance of reaching the end of the challenge. Secondly, they are the most chosen when a participant decides to change programming language during the same challenge.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Ensemble-Based Semi-Supervised Learning for Illicit Account Detection in Ethereum DeFi Transactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of smart contracts has enabled the rapid rise of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) on the Ethereum blockchain, offering substantial rewards in financial innovation and inclusivity. However, this growth has also introduced significant security risks, including the proliferation of illicit accounts involved in fraudulent activities. Traditional detection methods are limited by the scarcity of labeled data and the evolving tactics of malicious actors. In this paper, we propose a novel Self-Learning Ensemble-based Illicit account Detection (SLEID) framework to address these challenges. SLEID employs an Isolation Forest for initial outlier detection and a self-training mechanism to iteratively generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled accounts, thereby enhancing detection accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SLEID significantly outperforms traditional supervised approaches and recent semi-supervised models, achieving superior precision, recall, and F1-scores, particularly in detecting illicit accounts. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our approach achieves better detection performance while reducing reliance on labeled data. The results affirm SLEID's efficacy as a robust solution for safeguarding the DeFi ecosystem and mitigating risks posed by malicious accounts.</description>

      <title>Fast maximal clique enumeration in weighted temporal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cliques, groups of fully connected nodes in a network, are often used to study group dynamics of complex systems. In real-world settings, group dynamics often have a temporal component. For example, conference attendees moving from one group conversation to another. Recently, maximal clique enumeration methods have been introduced that add temporal (and frequency) constraints, to account for such phenomena. These methods enumerate so called (delta,gamma)-maximal cliques. In this work, we introduce an efficient (delta,gamma)-maximal clique enumeration algorithm, that extends gamma from a frequency constraint to a more versatile weighting constraint. Additionally, we introduce a definition of (delta,gamma)-cliques, that resolves a problem of existing definitions in the temporal domain. Our approach, which was inspired by a state-of-the-art two-phase approach, introduces a more efficient initial (stretching) phase. Specifically, we reduce the time complexity of this phase to be linear with respect to the number of temporal edges. Furthermore, we introduce a new approach to the second (bulking) phase, which allows us to efficiently prune search tree branches. Consequently, in experiments we observe speed-ups, often by several order of magnitude, on various (large) real-world datasets. Our algorithm vastly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods for temporal networks, while also extending applicability to weighted networks.</description>

      <title>Fairness-Regulated Dense Subgraph Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense subgraph discovery (DSD) is a key graph mining primitive with myriad applications including finding densely connected communities which are diverse in their vertex composition. In such a context, it is desirable to extract a dense subgraph that provides fair representation of the diverse subgroups that constitute the vertex set while incurring a small loss in terms of subgraph density. Existing methods for promoting fairness in DSD have important limitations -- the associated formulations are NP-hard in the worst case and they do not provide flexible notions of fairness, making it non-trivial to analyze the inherent trade-off between density and fairness. In this paper, we introduce two tractable formulations for fair DSD, each offering a different notion of fairness. Our methods provide a structured and flexible approach to incorporate fairness, accommodating varying fairness levels. We introduce the fairness-induced relative loss in subgraph density as a price of fairness measure to quantify the associated trade-off. We are the first to study such a notion in the context of detecting fair dense subgraphs. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods not only match but frequently outperform existing solutions, sometimes incurring even less than half the subgraph density loss compared to prior art, while achieving the target fairness levels. Importantly, they excel in scenarios that previous methods fail to adequately handle, i.e., those with extreme subgroup imbalances, highlighting their effectiveness in extracting fair and dense solutions.</description>

      <title>Towards Data-centric Machine Learning on Directed Graphs: a Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have made significant advances in processing structured data. However, most of them primarily adopted a model-centric approach, which simplifies graphs by converting it into undirected formats and emphasizes model designs. This approach is inherently constrained in real-world applications due to inevitable information loss in simple undirected graphs and data-driven model optimization dilemmas associated with exceeding the upper bounds of representational capacity. As a result, there has been a shift toward data-centric methods that prioritize improving graph quality and representation. Specifically, various types of graphs can be derived from naturally structured data, including heterogeneous graphs, hypergraphs, and directed graphs. Among these, directed graphs offer distinct advantages in topological systems by modeling causal relationships, and directed GNNs have been extensively studied in recent years. However, a comprehensive survey of this emerging topic is still lacking. Therefore, we aim to provide a comprehensive review of directed graph learning, with a particular focus on a data-centric perspective. Specifically, we first introduce a novel taxonomy for existing studies. Subsequently, we re-examine these methods from the data-centric perspective, with an emphasis on understanding and improving data representation. It demonstrates that a deep understanding of directed graphs and its quality plays a crucial role in model performance. Additionally, we explore the diverse applications of directed GNNs across 10+ domains, highlighting their broad applicability. Finally, we identify key opportunities and challenges within the field, offering insights that can guide future research and development in directed graph learning.</description>

      <title>BN-AuthProf: Benchmarking Machine Learning for Bangla Author Profiling on Social Media Texts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Author profiling, the analysis of texts to uncover attributes such as gender and age of the author, has become essential with the widespread use of social media platforms. This paper focuses on author profiling in the Bangla language, aiming to extract valuable insights about anonymous authors based on their writing style on social media. The primary objective is to introduce and benchmark the performance of machine learning approaches on a newly created Bangla Author Profiling dataset, BN-AuthProf. The dataset comprises 30,131 social media posts from 300 authors, labeled by their age and gender. Authors' identities and sensitive information were anonymized to ensure privacy. Various classical machine learning and deep learning techniques were employed to evaluate the dataset. For gender classification, the best accuracy achieved was 80% using Support Vector Machine (SVM), while a Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) classifier achieved the best F1 score of 0.756. For age classification, MNB attained a maximum accuracy score of 91% with an F1 score of 0.905. This research highlights the effectiveness of machine learning in gender and age classification for Bangla author profiling, with practical implications spanning marketing, security, forensic linguistics, education, and criminal investigations, considering privacy and biases.</description>

      <title>CausalMob: Causal Human Mobility Prediction with LLMs-derived Human Intentions toward Public Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale human mobility exhibits spatial and temporal patterns that can assist policymakers in decision making. Although traditional prediction models attempt to capture these patterns, they often interfered by non-periodic public events, such as disasters and occasional celebrations. Since regular human mobility patterns are heavily affected by these events, estimating their causal effects is critical to accurate mobility predictions. Although news articles provide unique perspectives on these events in an unstructured format, processing is a challenge. In this study, we propose a causality-augmented prediction model, called \textbf{CausalMob}, to analyze the causal effects of public events. We first utilize large language models (LLMs) to extract human intentions from news articles and transform them into features that act as causal treatments. Next, the model learns representations of spatio-temporal regional covariates from multiple data sources to serve as confounders for causal inference. Finally, we present a causal effect estimation framework to ensure event features remain independent of confounders during prediction. Based on large-scale real-world data, the experimental results show that the proposed model excels in human mobility prediction, outperforming state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Weisfeiler-Lehman Kernels to Subgraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subgraph representation learning has been effective in solving various real-world problems. However, current graph neural networks (GNNs) produce suboptimal results for subgraph-level tasks due to their inability to capture complex interactions within and between subgraphs. To provide a more expressive and efficient alternative, we propose WLKS, a Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) kernel generalized for subgraphs by applying the WL algorithm on induced $k$-hop neighborhoods. We combine kernels across different $k$-hop levels to capture richer structural information that is not fully encoded in existing models. Our approach can balance expressiveness and efficiency by eliminating the need for neighborhood sampling. In experiments on eight real-world and synthetic benchmarks, WLKS significantly outperforms leading approaches on five datasets while reducing training time, ranging from 0.01x to 0.25x compared to the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>GRAND : Graph Reconstruction from potential partial Adjacency and Neighborhood Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cryptographic approaches, such as secure multiparty computation, can be used to compute in a secure manner the function of a distributed graph without centralizing the data of each participant. However, the output of the protocol itself can leak sensitive information about the structure of the original graph. In particular, in this work we propose an approach by which an adversary observing the result of a private protocol for the computation of the number of common neighbors between all pairs of vertices, can reconstruct the adjacency matrix of the graph. In fact, this can only be done up to co-squareness, a notion we introduce, as two different graphs can have the same matrix of common neighbors. We consider two models of adversary, one who observes the common neighbors matrix only, and a knowledgeable one, that has a partial knowledge of the original graph. Our results demonstrate that secure multiparty protocols are not enough for privacy protection, especially in the context of highly structured data such as graphs. The reconstruction that we propose is interesting in itself from the point of view of graph theory.</description>

Abstract: In this project, we describe a method of modeling semantic leadership across a set of communities associated with the #BlackLivesMatter movement, which has been informed by qualitative research on the structure of social media and Black Twitter in particular. We describe our bespoke approaches to time-binning, community clustering, and connecting communities over time, as well as our adaptation of state-of-the-art approaches to semantic change detection and semantic leadership induction. We find substantial evidence of the leadership role of BLM activists and progressives, as well as Black celebrities. We also find evidence of the sustained engagement of the conservative community with this discourse, suggesting an alternative explanation for how we arrived at the present moment, in which "anti-woke" and "anti-CRT" bills are being enacted nationwide.</description>

      <title>Efficient Graph Matching for Correlated Stochastic Block Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study learning problems on correlated stochastic block models with two balanced communities. Our main result gives the first efficient algorithm for graph matching in this setting. In the most interesting regime where the average degree is logarithmic in the number of vertices, this algorithm correctly matches all but a vanishing fraction of vertices with high probability, whenever the edge correlation parameter $s$ satisfies $s^2 &gt; \alpha \approx 0.338$, where $\alpha$ is Otter's tree-counting constant. Moreover, we extend this to an efficient algorithm for exact graph matching whenever this is information-theoretically possible, positively resolving an open problem of R\'acz and Sridhar (NeurIPS 2021). Our algorithm generalizes the recent breakthrough work of Mao, Wu, Xu, and Yu (STOC 2023), which is based on centered subgraph counts of a large family of trees termed chandeliers. A major technical challenge that we overcome is dealing with the additional estimation errors that are necessarily present due to the fact that, in relevant parameter regimes, the latent community partition cannot be exactly recovered from a single graph. As an application of our results, we give an efficient algorithm for exact community recovery using multiple correlated graphs in parameter regimes where it is information-theoretically impossible to do so using just a single graph.</description>

      <title>Probing the statistical properties of enriched co-occurrence networks</title>

Abstract: Recent studies have explored the addition of virtual edges to word co-occurrence networks using word embeddings to enhance graph representations, particularly for short texts. While these enriched networks have demonstrated some success, the impact of incorporating semantic edges into traditional co-occurrence networks remains uncertain. This study investigates two key statistical properties of text-based network models. First, we assess whether network metrics can effectively distinguish between meaningless and meaningful texts. Second, we analyze whether these metrics are more sensitive to syntactic or semantic aspects of the text. Our results show that incorporating virtual edges can have positive and negative effects, depending on the specific network metric. For instance, the informativeness of the average shortest path and closeness centrality improves in short texts, while the clustering coefficient's informativeness decreases as more virtual edges are added. Additionally, we found that including stopwords affects the statistical properties of enriched networks. Our results can serve as a guideline for determining which network metrics are most appropriate for specific applications, depending on the typical text size and the nature of the problem.</description>

      <title>Gradient flow-based modularity maximization for community detection in multiplex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose two methods for the unsupervised detection of communities in undirected multiplex networks. These networks consist of multiple layers that record different relationships between the same entities or incorporate data from different sources. Both methods are formulated as gradient flows of suitable energy functionals: the first (MPBTV) builds on the minimization of a balanced total variation functional, which we show to be equivalent to multiplex modularity maximization, while the second (DGFM3) directly maximizes multiplex modularity. The resulting non-linear matrix-valued ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are solved efficiently by a graph Merriman--Bence--Osher (MBO) scheme. Key to the efficiency is the approximate integration of the discrete linear differential operators by truncated eigendecompositions in the matrix exponential function. Numerical experiments on several real-world multiplex networks show that our methods are competitive with the state of the art with respect to various metrics. Their major benefit is a significant reduction of computational complexity leading to runtimes that are orders of magnitude faster for large multiplex networks.</description>
