      <title>High-Accuracy Model Predictive Control with Inverse Hysteresis for High-Speed Trajectory Tracking of Piezoelectric Fast Steering Mirror</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Piezoelectric fast steering mirrors (PFSM) are widely utilized in beam precision-pointing systems but encounter considerable challenges in achieving high-precision tracking of fast trajectories due to nonlinear hysteresis and mechanical dual-axis cross-coupling. This paper proposes a model predictive control (MPC) approach integrated with a hysteresis inverse based on the Hammerstein modeling structure of the PFSM. The MPC is designed to decouple the rate-dependent dual-axis linear components, with an augmented error integral variable introduced in the state space to eliminate steady-state errors. Moreover, proofs of zero steady-state error and disturbance rejection are provided. The hysteresis inverse model is then cascaded to compensate for the rate-independent nonlinear components. Finally, PFSM tracking experiments are conducted on step, sinusoidal, triangular, and composite trajectories. Compared to traditional model-free and existing model-based controllers, the proposed method significantly enhances tracking accuracy, demonstrating superior tracking performance and robustness to frequency variations. These results offer valuable insights for engineering applications.</description>

      <title>A Model-free Biomimetics Algorithm for Deterministic Partially Observable Markov Decision Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) is a mathematical framework for modeling decision-making under uncertainty, where the agent's observations are incomplete and the underlying system dynamics are probabilistic. Solving the POMDP problem within the model-free paradigm is challenging for agents due to the inherent difficulty in accurately identifying and distinguishing between states and observations. We define such a difficult problem as a DETerministic Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (DET-POMDP) problem, which is a specific setting of POMDP. In this problem, states and observations are in a many-to-one relationship. The state is obscured, and its relationship is less apparent to the agent. This creates obstacles for the agent to infer the state through observations. To effectively address this problem, we convert DET-POMDP into a fully observable MDP using a model-free biomimetics algorithm called BIOMAP. BIOMAP is based on the MDP Graph Automaton framework to distinguish authentic environmental information from fraudulent data. Thus, it enhances the agent's ability to develop stable policies against DET-POMDP. The experimental results highlight the superior capabilities of BIOMAP in maintaining operational effectiveness and environmental reparability in the presence of environmental deceptions when compared with existing POMDP solvers. This research opens up new avenues for the deployment of reliable POMDP-based systems in fields that are particularly susceptible to DET-POMDP problems.</description>

      <title>TuneS: Patient-specific model-based optimization of contact configuration in deep brain stimulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: The objective of this study is to develop and evaluate a systematic approach to optimize Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) parameters, addressing the challenge of identifying patient-specific settings and optimal stimulation targets for various neurological and mental disorders. Methods: TuneS, a novel pipeline to predict clinically optimal DBS contact configurations based on predefined targets and constraints, is introduced. The method relies upon patient-specific models of stimulation spread and extends optimization beyond traditional neural structures to include automated, model-based targeting of streamlines. Results: Initial findings demonstrate that STN motor streamlines consistently receive a significant portion of the allocated stimulation volume, suggesting that a consistent portion of the stimulation should ideally focus on the STN motor streamlines. At the example of a small cohort of Parkinson's disease patients, the value of model-based contact predictions for assessing stimulation targets while observing constraints is demonstrated. Conclusion: TuneS shows promise as a research tool, enabling systematic assessment of DBS target effectiveness and facilitating constraint-aware optimization of stimulation parameters. Significance: The presented pipeline offers a pathway to improve patient-specific DBS therapies and contributes to the broader understanding of effective DBS targeting strategies.</description>

      <title>Robustness Evaluation of a Physical Internet-based Intermodal Logistic Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Physical Internet (PI) paradigm, which has gained attention in research and academia in recent years, leverages advanced logistics and interconnected networks to revolutionize the way goods are transported and delivered, thereby enhancing efficiency, reducing costs and delays, and minimizing environmental impact. Within this system, PI-hubs function similarly to cross-docks enabling the splitting of PI-containers into smaller modules to be delivered through a network of interconnected hubs, allowing dynamic routing optimization and efficient consolidation of PI-containers. Nevertheless, the impact of the system parameters and of the relevant uncertainties on the performance of this innovative logistics framework is still unclear. For this reason, this work proposes a robustness analysis to understand how the PI logistic framework is affected by how PI-containers are handled, consolidated, and processed at the PI-hubs. To this end, the considered PI logistic system is represented via a mathematical programming model that determines the best allocation of PI-containers in an intermodal setting with different transportation modes. In doing so, four Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are separately considered to investigate different aspects of the PI system's performance and the relevant robustness is assessed with respect to the PI-hubs' processing times and the number of modules per PI-container. In particular, a Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) is considered to evaluate, by means of a case study, the individual relevance of each input parameter on the resulting performance.</description>

      <title>Classification of Linear Observed Systems on Multi-Frame Groups via Automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many navigation problems can be formulated as observer design on linear observed systems with a two-frame group structure, on which an invariant filter can be implemented with guaranteed consistency and stability. It's still unclear how this could be generalized to simultaneous estimation of the poses of multiple frames and the general forms of the linear observed systems involving multiple frames remain unknown. In this letter, we propose a multi-frame group structure by semi-direct product using the two-frame group as building blocks, covering all natural extensions. More importantly, we give a systematic direct calculation to classify all possible forms of linear observed systems including process ODEs and algebraic observations on such multi-frame group through its automorphism structure, in comparison to the existing classification on two-frame groups relying on ingenious construction. Depth-camera inertial odometry with online extrinsics calibration is provided as an application.</description>

      <title>Co-optimization of Vehicle Dynamics and Powertrain Management for Connected and Automated Electric Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) represent the future of transportation, utilizing detailed traffic information to enhance control and decision-making. Eco-driving of CAVs has the potential to significantly improve energy efficiency, and the benefits are maximized when both vehicle speed and powertrain operation are optimized. In this paper, we studied the co-optimization of vehicle speed and powertrain management for energy savings in a dual-motor electric vehicle. Control-oriented vehicle dynamics and electric powertrain models were developed to transform the problem into an optimal control problem specifically designed to facilitate real-time computation. Simulation validation was conducted using real-world data calibrated traffic simulation scenarios in Chattanooga, TN. Evaluation results demonstrated a 12.80-24.52% reduction in the vehicle's power consumption under ideal predicted traffic conditions, while maintaining benefits with various prediction uncertainties, such as Gaussian process uncertainties on acceleration and time-shift effects on predicted speed. The energy savings of the proposed eco-driving strategy are achieved through effective speed control and optimized torque allocation. The proposed model can be extended to various CAV and electric vehicle applications, with potential adaptability to diverse traffic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Novel Conditions for the Finite-Region Stability of 2D-Systems with Application to Iterative Learning Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some recent papers have extended the concept of finite-time stability (FTS) to the context of 2D linear systems, where it has been referred to as finite-region stability (FRS). FRS methodologies make even more sense than the classical FTS approach developed for 1D-systems, since, typically, at least one of the state variables of 2D-systems is a space coordinate, rather than a time variable. Since space coordinates clearly belong to finite intervals, FRS techniques are much more effective than the classical Lyapunov approach, which looks to the asymptotic behavior of the system over an infinite interval. To this regard, the novel contribution of this paper goes in several directions. First, we provide a novel sufficient condition for the FRS of linear time-varying (LTV) discrete-time 2D-systems, which turns out to be less conservative than those ones provided in the existing literature. Then, an interesting application of FRS to the context of iterative learning control (ILC) is investigated, by exploiting the previously developed theory. In particular, a new procedure is proposed so that the tracking errors of the ILC law converges within the desired bound in a finite number of iterations. Finally, a sufficient condition to solve the finite-region stabilization problem is proposed. All the results provided in the paper lead to optimization problems constrained by linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), that can be solved via widely available software. Numerical examples illustrate and validate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.</description>

      <title>A Traffic Adapative Physics-informed Learning Control for Energy Savings of Connected and Automated Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model predictive control has emerged as an effective approach for real-time optimal control of connected and automated vehicles. However, nonlinear dynamics of vehicle and traffic systems make accurate modeling and real-time optimization challenging. Learning-based control offer a promising alternative, as they adapt to environment without requiring an explicit model. For learning control framework, an augmented state space system design is necessary since optimal control depends on both the ego vehicle's state and predicted states of other vehicles. This work develops a traffic adaptive augmented state space system that allows the control strategy to intelligently adapt to varying traffic conditions. This design ensures that while different vehicle trajectories alter initial conditions, the system dynamics remain independent of specific trajectories. Additionally, a physics-informed learning control framework is presented that combines value function from Bellman's equation with derivative of value functions from Pontryagin's Maximum Principle into a unified loss function. This method aims to reduce required training data and time while enhancing robustness and efficiency. The proposed control framework is applied to car-following scenarios in real-world data calibrated simulation environments. The results show that this learning control approach alleviates real-time computational requirements while achieving car-following behaviors comparable to model-based methods, resulting in 9% energy savings in scenarios not previously seen in training dataset.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen in Aviation: Evaluating the Feasibility and Benefits of a Green Fuel Alternative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Growing concerns regarding environmental health have highlighted the aviation industry's impact and potential mitigation strategies. Previous research has indicated hydrogen's significant potential for reducing the industry's environmental impact, yet implementation challenges remain. Through analysis of light aircraft and military applications, we demonstrate that hydrogen-based systems can achieve performance metrics approaching those of traditional fuels while reducing emissions by up to 74.7%. Our findings show that hydrogen's superior energy-to-mass ratio (120 MJ/kg versus 43 MJ/kg for jet fuel) makes it particularly advantageous for aviation applications compared to battery-electric alternatives. Primary implementation challenges involve cryogenic storage systems (-253{\deg}C), tank placement optimization, and fueling infrastructure development. The observed efficiency penalties of only 2.23% in military applications suggest hydrogen's viability as a sustainable aviation fuel alternative.</description>

      <title>Short-term wind forecasting via surface pressure measurements: stochastic modeling and sensor placement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a short-term wind forecasting framework for predicting real-time variations in atmospheric turbulence based on nacelle-mounted anemometer and ground-level air-pressure measurements. Our approach combines linear stochastic estimation and Kalman filtering algorithms to assimilate and process real-time field measurements with the predictions of a stochastic reduced-order model that is confined to a two-dimensional plane at the hub height of turbines. We bridge the vertical gap between the computational plane of the model at hub height and the measurement plane on the ground using a projection technique that allows us to infer the pressure in one plane from the other. Depending on the quality of this inference, we show that customized variants of the extended and ensemble Kalman filters can be tuned to balance estimation quality and computational speed 1-1.5 diameters ahead and behind leading turbines. In particular, we show how synchronizing the sign of estimates with that of velocity fluctuations recorded at the nacelle can significantly improve the ability to follow temporal variations upwind of the leading turbine. We also propose a convex optimization-based framework for selecting a subset of pressure sensors that achieve a desired level of accuracy relative to the optimal Kalman filter that uses all sensing capabilities.</description>

      <title>FaultExplainer: Leveraging Large Language Models for Interpretable Fault Detection and Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning algorithms are increasingly being applied to fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) in chemical processes. However, existing data-driven FDD platforms often lack interpretability for process operators and struggle to identify root causes of previously unseen faults. This paper presents FaultExplainer, an interactive tool designed to improve fault detection, diagnosis, and explanation in the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP). FaultExplainer integrates real-time sensor data visualization, Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-based fault detection, and identification of top contributing variables within an interactive user interface powered by large language models (LLMs). We evaluate the LLMs' reasoning capabilities in two scenarios: one where historical root causes are provided, and one where they are not to mimic the challenge of previously unseen faults. Experimental results using GPT-4o and o1-preview models demonstrate the system's strengths in generating plausible and actionable explanations, while also highlighting its limitations, including reliance on PCA-selected features and occasional hallucinations.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Navigation in Dynamic Human Environments with an Embedded 2D LiDAR-based Person Tracker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of autonomous mobile robots, the emphasis on seamless human-robot interactions has shifted towards autonomous decision-making. This paper delves into the intricate challenges associated with robotic autonomy, focusing on navigation in dynamic environments shared with humans. It introduces an embedded real-time tracking pipeline, integrated into a navigation planning framework for effective person tracking and avoidance, adapting a state-of-the-art 2D LiDAR-based human detection network and an efficient multi-object tracker. By addressing the key components of detection, tracking, and planning separately, the proposed approach highlights the modularity and transferability of each component to other applications. Our tracking approach is validated on a quadruped robot equipped with 270{\deg} 2D-LiDAR against motion capture system data, with the preferred configuration achieving an average MOTA of 85.45% in three newly recorded datasets, while reliably running in real-time at 20 Hz on the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX embedded GPU-accelerated platform. Furthermore, the integrated tracking and avoidance system is evaluated in real-world navigation experiments, demonstrating how accurate person tracking benefits the planner in optimizing the generated trajectories, enhancing its collision avoidance capabilities. This paper contributes to safer human-robot cohabitation, blending recent advances in human detection with responsive planning to navigate shared spaces effectively and securely.</description>

      <title>STRAP: Robot Sub-Trajectory Retrieval for Augmented Policy Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robot learning is witnessing a significant increase in the size, diversity, and complexity of pre-collected datasets, mirroring trends in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision. Many robot learning methods treat such datasets as multi-task expert data and learn a multi-task, generalist policy by training broadly across them. Notably, while these generalist policies can improve the average performance across many tasks, the performance of generalist policies on any one task is often suboptimal due to negative transfer between partitions of the data, compared to task-specific specialist policies. In this work, we argue for the paradigm of training policies during deployment given the scenarios they encounter: rather than deploying pre-trained policies to unseen problems in a zero-shot manner, we non-parametrically retrieve and train models directly on relevant data at test time. Furthermore, we show that many robotics tasks share considerable amounts of low-level behaviors and that retrieval at the "sub"-trajectory granularity enables significantly improved data utilization, generalization, and robustness in adapting policies to novel problems. In contrast, existing full-trajectory retrieval methods tend to underutilize the data and miss out on shared cross-task content. This work proposes STRAP, a technique for leveraging pre-trained vision foundation models and dynamic time warping to retrieve sub-sequences of trajectories from large training corpora in a robust fashion. STRAP outperforms both prior retrieval algorithms and multi-task learning methods in simulated and real experiments, showing the ability to scale to much larger offline datasets in the real world as well as the ability to learn robust control policies with just a handful of real-world demonstrations.</description>

Abstract: The electricity grid has evolved from a physical system to a cyber-physical system with digital devices that perform measurement, control, communication, computation, and actuation. The increased penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) including renewable generation, flexible loads, and storage provides extraordinary opportunities for improvements in efficiency and sustainability. However, they can introduce new vulnerabilities in the form of cyberattacks, which can cause significant challenges in ensuring grid resilience. We propose a framework in this paper for achieving grid resilience through suitably coordinated assets including a network of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. A local electricity market is proposed to identify trustable assets and carry out this coordination. Situational Awareness (SA) of locally available DERs with the ability to inject power or reduce consumption is enabled by the market, together with a monitoring procedure for their trustability and commitment. With this SA, we show that a variety of cyberattacks can be mitigated using local trustable resources without stressing the bulk grid. Multiple demonstrations are carried out using a high-fidelity co-simulation platform, real-time hardware-in-the-loop validation, and a utility-friendly simulator.</description>

      <title>Generative AI as a Service in 6G Edge-Cloud: Generation Task Offloading by In-context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is a promising technique towards 6G networks, and generative foundation models such as large language models (LLMs) have attracted considerable interest from academia and telecom industry. This work considers a novel edge-cloud deployment of foundation models in 6G networks. Specifically, it aims to minimize the service delay of foundation models by radio resource allocation and task offloading, i.e., offloading diverse content generation tasks to proper LLMs at the network edge or cloud. In particular, we first introduce the communication system model, i.e., allocating radio resources and calculating link capacity to support generated content transmission, and then we present the LLM inference model to calculate the delay of content generation. After that, we propose a novel in-context learning method to optimize the task offloading decisions. It utilizes LLM's inference capabilities, and avoids the difficulty of dedicated model training or fine-tuning as in conventional machine learning algorithms. Finally, the simulations demonstrate that the proposed edge-cloud deployment and in-context learning task offloading method can achieve satisfactory generation service quality without dedicated model training or fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Design of Distributed Controller for Discrete-Time Systems Via the Integration of Extended LMI and Clique-Wise Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07666v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study addresses the centralized synthesis of distributed controllers using linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Sparsity constraints on control gains of distributed controllers result in conservatism via the convexification of the existing methods such as the extended LMI method. In order to mitigate the conservatism, we introduce a novel LMI formulation for this problem, utilizing the clique-wise decomposition method from our previous work on continuous-time systems. By reformulating the sparsity constraint on the gain matrix within cliques, this method achieves a broader solution set. Also, the analytical superiority of our method is confirmed through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Shape error prediction in 5-axis machining using graph neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an innovative method for predicting shape errors in 5-axis machining using graph neural networks. The graph structure is defined with nodes representing workpiece surface points and edges denoting the neighboring relationships. The dataset encompasses data from a material removal simulation, process data, and post-machining quality information. Experimental results show that the presented approach can generalize the shape error prediction for the investigated workpiece geometry. Moreover, by modelling spatial and temporal connections within the workpiece, the approach handles a low number of labels compared to non-graphical methods such as Support Vector Machines.</description>

      <title>Temporal Logic Control for Nonlinear Stochastic Systems Under Unknown Disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework to synthesize robust strategies for discrete-time nonlinear systems with random disturbances that are unknown, against temporal logic specifications. The proposed framework is data-driven and abstraction-based: leveraging observations of the system, our approach learns a high-confidence abstraction of the system in the form of an uncertain Markov decision process (UMDP). The uncertainty in the resulting UMDP is used to formally account for both the error in abstracting the system and for the uncertainty coming from the data. Critically, we show that for any given state-action pair in the resulting UMDP, the uncertainty in the transition probabilities can be represented as a convex polytope obtained by a two-layer state discretization and concentration inequalities. This allows us to obtain tighter uncertainty estimates compared to existing approaches, and guarantees efficiency, as we tailor a synthesis algorithm exploiting the structure of this UMDP. We empirically validate our approach on several case studies, showing substantially improved performance compared to the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Carbon-Aware Optimal Power Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03240v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To facilitate effective decarbonization of the electric power sector, this paper introduces the generic Carbon-aware Optimal Power Flow (C-OPF) method for power system decision-making that considers demand-side carbon accounting and emission management. Built upon the classic optimal power flow (OPF) model, the C-OPF method incorporates carbon emission flow equations and constraints, as well as carbon-related objectives, to jointly optimize power flow and carbon flow. In particular, this paper establishes the feasibility and solution uniqueness of the carbon emission flow equations, and proposes modeling and linearization techniques to address the issues of undetermined power flow directions and bilinear terms in the C-OPF model. Additionally, two novel carbon emission models, together with the carbon accounting schemes, for energy storage systems are developed and integrated into the C-OPF model. Numerical simulations demonstrate the characteristics and effectiveness of the C-OPF method, in comparison with OPF solutions.</description>

      <title>Risk-Aware Control of Discrete-Time Stochastic Systems: Integrating Kalman Filter and Worst-case CVaR in Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15638v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes control approaches for discrete-time linear systems subject to stochastic disturbances. It employs Kalman filter to estimate the mean and covariance of the state propagation, and the worst-case conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) to quantify the tail risk using the estimated mean and covariance. The quantified risk is then integrated into a control barrier function (CBF) to derive constraints for controller synthesis, addressing tail risks near safe set boundaries. Two optimization-based control methods are presented using the obtained constraints for half-space and ellipsoidal safe sets, respectively. The effectiveness of the obtained results is demonstrated using numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Decentralized real-time iterations for distributed NMPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents a Real-Time Iteration (RTI) scheme for distributed Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC). The scheme transfers the well-known RTI approach, a key enabler for many industrial real-time NMPC implementations, to the setting of cooperative distributed control. At each sampling instant, one outer iteration of a bi-level decentralized Sequential Quadratic Programming (dSQP) method is applied to a centralized optimal control problem. This ensures that real-time requirements are met and it facilitates cooperation between subsystems. Combining novel dSQP convergence results with RTI stability guarantees, we prove local exponential stability under standard assumptions on the MPC design with and without terminal constraints. The proposed scheme only requires neighbor-to-neighbor communication and avoids a central coordinator. A numerical example with coupled inverted pendulums demonstrates the efficacy of the approach.</description>

      <title>Learning Deep Dissipative Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study challenges strictly guaranteeing ``dissipativity'' of a dynamical system represented by neural networks learned from given time-series data. Dissipativity is a crucial indicator for dynamical systems that generalizes stability and input-output stability, known to be valid across various systems including robotics, biological systems, and molecular dynamics. By analytically proving the general solution to the nonlinear Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov (KYP) lemma, which is the necessary and sufficient condition for dissipativity, we propose a differentiable projection that transforms any dynamics represented by neural networks into dissipative ones and a learning method for the transformed dynamics. Utilizing the generality of dissipativity, our method strictly guarantee stability, input-output stability, and energy conservation of trained dynamical systems. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of our method against out-of-domain input through applications to robotic arms and fluid dynamics.

      <title>Gauss-Newton Dynamics for Neural Networks: A Riemannian Optimization Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the convergence of Gauss-Newton dynamics for training neural networks with smooth activation functions. In the underparameterized regime, the Gauss-Newton gradient flow induces a Riemannian gradient flow on a low-dimensional, smooth, embedded submanifold of the Euclidean output space. Using tools from Riemannian optimization, we prove \emph{last-iterate} convergence of the Riemannian gradient flow to the optimal in-class predictor at an \emph{exponential rate} that is independent of the conditioning of the Gram matrix, \emph{without} requiring explicit regularization. We further characterize the critical impacts of the neural network scaling factor and the initialization on the convergence behavior. In the overparameterized regime, we show that the Levenberg-Marquardt dynamics with an appropriately chosen damping factor yields robustness to ill-conditioned kernels, analogous to the underparameterized regime. These findings demonstrate the potential of Gauss-Newton methods for efficiently optimizing neural networks, particularly in ill-conditioned problems where kernel and Gram matrices have small singular values.</description>
