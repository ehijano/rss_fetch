      <title>Coastal wave refraction in variable currents over a varying bathymetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Refraction is the predominant mechanism causing spatially inhomogeneous surface gravity wave fields. However, the complex interplay between depth- and current-induced wave refraction remains poorly understood. Assuming weak currents and slowly varying bathymetry, we derive an analytical approximation to the wave ray curvature, which is validated by an open-source ray tracing framework. The approximation has the form of linear superposition of a current- and depth-induced component, each depending on the gradients in the ambient fields. This separation enables quantification of their individual and combined contributions to refraction. Through analysis of a few limiting cases, we demonstrate how the sign and magnitude of these components influence the wave refraction, and identify conditions where they either amplify or counteract each other. We also identify which of the two plays a dominant role. These findings provide physically resolved insights into the influence of current- and depth-gradients on wave propagation, and are relevant for applications related to remote sensing and coastal wave forecasting services.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Explosions for Large Scale Carbon Sequestration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Confronting the escalating threat of climate change requires innovative and large-scale interventions. This paper presents a bold proposal to employ a buried nuclear explosion in a remote basaltic seabed for pulverizing basalt, thereby accelerating carbon sequestration through Enhanced Rock Weathering (ERW). By precisely locating the explosion beneath the seabed, we aim to confine debris, radiation, and energy while ensuring rapid rock weathering at a scale substantial enough to make a meaningful dent in atmospheric carbon levels. Our analysis outlines the parameters essential for efficient carbon capture and minimal collateral effects, emphasizing that a yield on the order of gigatons is critical for global climate impact. Although this approach may appear radical, we illustrate its feasibility by examining safety factors, preservation of local ecosystems, political considerations, and financial viability. This work argues for reimagining nuclear technology not merely as a destructive force but as a potential catalyst for decarbonization, thereby inviting further exploration of pioneering solutions in the fight against climate change.</description>

      <title>Identifying atmospheric fronts based on diabatic processes using the dynamic state index (DSI)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.11438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atmospheric fronts are associated with precipitation and strong diabatic processes. Therefore, detecting fronts objectively from reanalyses is a prerequisite for the long-term study of their weather impacts. For this purpose, several algorithms exist, e.g., based on the thermic front parameter (TFP) or the F diagnostic that combines relative vorticity and horizontal temperature gradient. It is shown that both methods have problems to identify weak warm fronts since they are characterized by low baroclinicity. To avoid this inaccuracy, a new algorithm is developed that considers fronts as deviation from an adiabatic and steady state. These deviations can be accurately measured using the dynamic state index (DSI). The DSI shows a coherent dipole structure along fronts and is strongly correlated with precipitation sums. Using the DSI, a new front detection algorithm is developed (called DSI method), which allows to clearly identify the global storm track regions. The properties of the identified fronts depend on the applied front detection method, whereby fronts identified with the DSI method have particularly high specific humidity. Using a simple estimate for front speed, it is shown that also the front speed depends on the front detection method and that fronts identified using the DSI method have a higher front speed than fronts identified with the TFP method. This can be attributed to the dipole structure of the DSI and thus demonstrates the potential of the DSI to inherently indicate the movement speed and direction in atmospheric flows.</description>

      <title>An Earth-System-Oriented View of the S2S Predictability of North American Weather Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is largely agreed that subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) predictability arises from the atmospheric initial state during early lead times and from the land and ocean during intermediate and late lead times. We test this hypothesis for the large-scale mid-latitude atmosphere by training numerous XGBoost models to predict weather regimes (WRs) over North America at 1-to-8-week lead times. Each model uses a different predictor from one Earth system component (atmosphere, ocean, or land) sourced from reanalysis. According to the models, the atmosphere provides more predictability during the first two forecast weeks, and the three components performed similarly afterward. However, the skill and sources of predictability are highly dependent on the season and target WR. Our results show greater WR predictability in fall and winter, particularly for the Pacific Trough and Pacific Ridge regimes, driven primarily by the ocean (e.g., El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation and sea ice). For the Pacific Ridge in winter, the stratosphere also contributes significantly to predictability across most S2S lead times. Additionally, the initial large-scale tropospheric structure (encompassing the tropics and extra-tropics, e.g., Madden-Julian Oscillation) and soil conditions play a relevant role-most notably for the Greenland High regime in winter. This study highlights previously identified sources of predictability for the large-scale atmosphere and gives insight into new sources for future study. Given how closely linked WRs are to surface precipitation and temperature anomalies, storm tracks, and extreme events, the study results contribute to improving S2S prediction of surface weather.</description>

      <title>Winter Noctilucent Clouds Following Sudden Stratospheric Warming: First Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mesospheric structures identical to summer noctilucent clouds were observed during the nights of December 17-19, 2024 in Siberian Russia. Basing on the available photo data, the mean altitude of the clouds 70.1+-1.5 km was measured by umbral colorimetric method. This coincided spatially and temporary with deep temperature minimum below 160K in mesosphere, followed the polar vortex displacement and warming of stratosphere below the clouds. The satellite data on temperature and water vapor is used to study the nature of this unexpected event.</description>
