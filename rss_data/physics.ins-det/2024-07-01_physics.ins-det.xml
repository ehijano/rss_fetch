      <title>Lightweight Thermal Management Strategies for the Silicon Detectors of CBM at FAIR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lightweight thermal management is central to the design of the all-silicon Inner Tracker of the Compressed Baryonic Matter Experiment (CBM) at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR). This experiment aims to study strongly interacting matter at neutron star core densities through fixed-target Au-Au collisions ($\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.9 - 4.9\,$GeV; up to 10$^7$ beam-target interactions per second; polar angular acceptance of $2.5^{\circ} \leq \Theta \leq 25^{\circ}$). Studies with thermal demonstrators for both the pixel-based Micro Vertex Detector and the strip-based Silicon Tracking System have validated their thermal management strategies, preparing them for series production now and global commissioning in 2028.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the architecture for coherent beat note acquisition in LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The laser interferometer space antenna (LISA) senses gravitational waves by measuring distance fluctuations between three spacecraft (SC). These measurements rely on precise tracking of a beat note phase that is formed on a quadrant-photo-diode (QPD) at each SC by interference of a local laser with a laser sent from a distant SC. The crucial prerequisite of the phase tracking is a successful acquisition of the beat note frequency. This article aims to optimize the carrier-to-noise density ratio (CNR) during this process, and to evaluate the resulting probability of detection (PD). CNR is generally lowest during the beat note acquisition process since pointing accuracy relies on coarse acquisition techniques. Based on analytical models, we examine which combinations of QPD segments for the signal read-out yield the highest CNR, i.e., they are least susceptible to pointing errors. We find from simulations that the highest CNR is ensured by taking the maximum of a combination of two segments in vertical and horizontal direction. For pointing errors (3$\sigma$) of 3.9 $\mu$rad and 4.3 $\mu$rad this yields an improvement of around 3.7 dB and 5.6 dB in CNR, respectively, in comparison to a combination of all four segments. In addition, the PD for various configurations of the baselined Fourier peak detection is analyzed. Here we find that the PD is most sensitive to the CNR compared to the design parameters of the acquisition scheme, in particular the FFT length. Moreover, it is shown that aforementioned improvements in CNR can lead to a significant enhancement of the PD.</description>

      <title>Scintillator-SiPM Detector for Tracking and Energy Deposition Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An innovative particle detector that offers a compelling combination of cost-effectiveness and high accuracy is introduced. The detector features plastic scintillators paired with a sparse arrangement of SiPMs, strategically positioned within a unique opto-mechanical framework. This configuration delivers precise measurements of spatial impact position and energy deposition of impinging particles. The manuscript describes the detector's physical model complemented by an analytical representation. These calculations underpin a numerical algorithm, facilitating the estimation of particle impingement position and energy deposition. The results of the numerical calculations are compared with the output of GEANT4 simulations and evaluated by rigorous laboratory testing. An array of these detectors, intended for deployment in a spaceborne experiment, underwent detailed design, manufacturing, and testing. Their performance and alignment with the physical model were validated through meticulously conducted ground-based laboratory experiments, conclusively affirming the detector's properties.</description>

      <title>Spaceborne COTS-Capsule Hodoscope: Detecting and Characterizing Particle Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COTS-Capsule Spaceborne hodoscope was launched into low earth orbit aboard the International Space Station and operated during 2021-2022. The primary objectives of the payload are: measuring and characterizing the radiation environment within the space station; serving as a technology demonstrator for the COTS-Capsule radiation mitigation apparatus; and testing the interaction of high-energy cosmic particles in space with our detectors. The payload features a particle hodoscope equipped with an array of novel detectors based on polyvinyl toluene scintillators and silicon photomultiplier sensors that are used for radiation detection and characterization. This paper provides a comprehensive account of the construction, preflight performance, testing, qualification, and in-orbit calibration of the COTS-Capsule payload. The hodoscope, sensitive to ionizing cosmic particles, facilitates impinging particle track reconstruction, energy deposition estimation, and linear energy transfer estimation. In specific instances, it also provides particle identification and energy deposition estimation.</description>

      <title>First results on monolithic CMOS detector with internal gain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we report on a set of characterisations carried out on the first monolithic LGAD prototype integrated in a customised 110 nm CMOS process having a depleted active volume thickness of 48 $\mu$m. This prototype is formed by a pixel array where each pixel has a total size of 100 $\mu$m $\times$ 250 $\mu$m and includes a high-speed front-end amplifier. After describing the sensor and the electronics architecture, both laboratory and in-beam measurements are reported and described. Optical characterisations performed with an IR pulsed laser setup have shown a sensor internal gain of about 2.5. With the same experimental setup, the electronic jitter was found to be between 50 ps and 150 ps, depending on the signal amplitude. Moreover, the analysis of a test beam performed at the Proton Synchrotron (PS) T10 facility of CERN with 10 GeV/c protons and pions indicated that the overall detector time resolution is in the range of 234 ps to 244 ps. Further TCAD investigations, based on the doping profile extracted from $C(V)$ measurements, confirmed the multiplication gain measured on the test devices. Finally, TCAD simulations were used to tune the future doping concentration of the gain layer implant, targeting sensors with a higher avalanche gain. This adjustment is expected to enhance the timing performance of the sensors of the future productions, in order to cope with the high event rate expected in most of the near future high-energy and high-luminosity physics experiments, where the time resolution will be essential to disentangle overlapping events and it will also be crucial for Particle IDentification (PID).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the planned near-term and potential longer-term upgrades of the Belle II detector at the SuperKEKB electron-positron collider operating at the KEK laboratory in Tsukuba, Japan. These upgrades will allow increasingly sensitive searches for possible new physics beyond the Standard Model in flavor, tau, electroweak and dark sector physics that are both complementary to and competitive with the LHC and other experiments.</description>

      <title>A Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifier and Converter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-fidelity qubit measurement is a critical element of all quantum computing architectures. In superconducting systems, qubits are typically measured by probing a readout resonator with a weak microwave tone which must be amplified before reaching the room temperature electronics. Superconducting parametric amplifiers have been widely adopted as the first amplifier in the chain, primarily because of their low noise performance, approaching the quantum limit. However, they require isolators and circulators to route signals up the measurement chain, as well as to protect qubits from amplified noise. While these commercial components are wideband and very simple to use, their intrinsic loss, size, and magnetic shielding requirements impact the overall measurement efficiency while also limiting prospects for scalable readout in large-scale superconducting quantum computers. Here we demonstrate a parametric amplifier that achieves both broadband forward amplification and backward isolation in a single, compact, non-magnetic circuit that could be integrated on chip with superconducting qubits. It relies on a nonlinear transmission line which supports traveling-wave parametric amplification of forward propagating signals, and isolation via frequency conversion of backward propagating signals. This kind of traveling-wave parametric amplifier and converter is poised to reduce the readout hardware overhead when scaling up the size of superconducting quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Low temperature proton irradiation with DEPFETs for Athena's Wide Field Imager</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Wide Field Imager (WFI), one of two instruments on ESA's next large X-ray mission Athena, is designed for imaging spectroscopy of X-rays in the range of 0.2 to 15 keV with a large field of view and high count rate capability. The focal plane consists of back-illuminated DEPFET (Depleted p-channel field effect transistor) sensors that have a high radiation tolerance and provide a near Fano-limited energy resolution. To achieve this, a very low noise readout is required, about 3 electrons ENC at beginning of life is foreseen. This makes the device very susceptible to any radiation induced worsening of the readout noise. The main mechanism of degradation will be the increase of dark current due to displacement damage caused primarily by high energy protons. To study the expected performance degradation, a prototype detector module with fully representative pixel layout and fabrication technology was irradiated with 62.4 MeV protons at the accelerator facility MedAustron in Wiener Neustadt. A total dose equivalent to 3.3 $\mathrm{10^{9}}$ 10-MeV protons/$\mathrm{cm^{2}}$ was applied in two steps. During, in-between and after the irradiations the detector remained at the operating temperature of 213 K and was fully biased and operated. Data was recorded to analyze the signal of all incident particles. We report on the increase of dark current after the irradiation and present the current related damage rate at 213 K. The effect of low temperature annealing at 213 K , 236 K, 253 K, 273 K, and 289 K is presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design of single chip current source based on a common power operational amplifier is presented and demonstrated for the purpose of controlling applied magnetic fields using bias/shim electromagnets in cold atom experiments. The efficacy of the design is realized via application to red-detuned polarization-gradient cooling of $^{87}$Rb down to 3 $\mu$K. Further, we demonstrate Raman spectroscopy using these devices to apply current and so generate a precise, accurate, and reproducible magnetic field. This work is intended as a short tutorial for new graduate students and postdocs of laser cooling and trapping.</description>

      <title>Upgrade of NaI(Tl) crystal encapsulation for the NEON experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Neutrino Elastic-scattering Observation with NaI(Tl) experiment (NEON) aims to detect coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering~(\cenns) in a NaI(Tl) crystal using reactor anti-electron neutrinos at the Hanbit nuclear power plant complex. A total of 13.3 kg of NaI(Tl) crystals were initially installed in December 2020 at the tendon gallery, 23.7$\pm$0.3\,m away from the reactor core, which operates at a thermal power of 2.8\,GW. Initial engineering operation was performed from May 2021 to March 2022 and observed unexpected photomultiplier-induced noise and a decreased light yield that were caused by leakage of liquid scintillator into the detector due to weakness of detector encapsulation. We upgraded the detector encapsulation design to prevent the leakage of the liquid scintillator. Meanwhile two small-sized detectors were replaced with larger ones resulting in a total mass of 16.7\,kg. With this new design implementation, the detector system has been operating stably since April 2022 for over a year without detector gain drop. In this paper, we present an improved crystal encapsulation design and stability of the NEON experiment.</description>
