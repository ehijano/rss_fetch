      <title>The translation geometry of P\'olya's shires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In his shire theorem, G.~P\'olya proves that the zeros of iterated derivatives of a meromorphic function in the complex plane accumulate on the union of edges of the Voronoi diagram of the poles of this function. By recasting the local arguments of P\'olya into the language of translation surfaces, we prove its generalisation describing the asymptotic distribution of the zeros of a meromorphic function on a compact Riemann surface under the iterations of a linear differential operator $T_\omega: f \mapsto \frac{df}{\omega}$ where $\omega$ is a given meromorphic $1$-form. The accumulation set of these zeros is the union of edges of a generalised Voronoi diagram defined by the initial function $f$ together with the singular flat metric on the Riemann surface induced by $\omega$. This result provides the ground for a novel approach to the problem of finding a flat geometric presentation of a translation surface initially defined in terms of algebraic or complex-analytic data.</description>

      <title>Generalised Biracks and the Birack Polynomial Invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalise the finite biquandle colouring invariant to a polynomial invariant based on labelling a knot diagram with a finite birack that reduces to the biquandle colouring invariant in that case. The polynomial is an invariant of a class of knot theories amenable to a generalisation of theorem of Trace on regular homotopy. We take the opportunity to reprise the relevant generalised knot theory and the theory of generalised biracks in the light of this work and recent developments.</description>

      <title>The Gordon-Litherland pairing and its many applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gordon and Litherland's paper $\textit{On the Signature of a link}$ introduced a bilinear form that simultaneously unifies both the quadratic forms of Trotter and Goeritz. This remarkable pairing of combinatorics and topology has had widespread application in low-dimensional topology. In this expository note, we give a picture proof (via Kirby diagrams) of their main result and discuss the numerous ways their theorem has been put to good use.</description>

      <title>Adjunction inequalities and the Davis hyperbolic four-manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Davis hyperbolic four-manifold $\mathcal{D}$ is not almost-complex, so that its Seiberg-Witten invariants corresponding to zero-dimensional moduli spaces are vanishing by definition. In this paper, we show that all the Seiberg-Witten invariants involving higher-dimensional moduli spaces also vanish. Our proof involves the adjunction inequalities corresponding to 864 genus two totally geodesic surfaces embedded inside $\mathcal{D}$.</description>

      <title>The volumes of the Hitchin-Riemann moduli spaces are infinite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10093v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we prove that the actions of the mapping class groups on a large range of higher Teichm\"uller spaces with a rank of at least two possess infinite Atiyah-Bott-Goldman covolume. This result encompasses $\mathsf{G}$-Hitchin components of a higher rank split real form $\mathsf{G}$ and each component of the space of $\mathsf{Sp}_{2n}(\mathbb{R})$-maximal representations where $n \geq 2$. To achieve this outcome, we employ Goldman flows to find an infinite series of subsets of identical volume, the images of which in the quotient space are all mutually disjoint.</description>

      <title>Patterns of the $V_2$-polynomial of knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03557v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Kashaev and the first author defined a sequence $V_n$ of 2-variable knot polynomials with integer coefficients, coming from the $R$-matrix of a rank 2 Nichols algebra, the first polynomial been identified with the Links--Gould polynomial. In this note we present the results of the computation of the $V_n$ polynomials for $n=1,2,3,4$ and discover applications and emerging patterns, including unexpected Conway mutations that seem undetected by the $V_n$-polynomials as well as by Heegaard Floer Homology and Khovanov Homology. This is an updated version with links to data files.</description>

      <title>Homotopy groups and quantitative Sperner-type lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.08715v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a generalization of Sperner's lemma for a triangulation $T$ of $(m+1)$-discs $D$ whose vertices are colored in $n+2$ colors. A proper coloring of $T$ on the boundary of $D$ determines a simplicial mapping $f:S^m \to S^n$ and the element $x=[f]$ in $\pi_m(S^n)$. For any $x$ in this homotopy group we define a non-negative integer $\mu(x)$. For some cases this invariant can be found explicitly. Namely, if $m=n$ then this number is the Brouwer degree of the mapping $f$. For the case $m=3, n=2$ we found a lower bound for $\mu(x)$, where $x$ is the Hopf invariant, and proved that $\mu(1)=\mu(2)=9$.
  The main result of this paper is the theorem that the number of fully colored $n$-simplexes in $T$ is not less than $\mu([f])$. To prove this theorem we use a generalization of Pontryagin's theorem for manifolds with respect to their boundaries.</description>

      <title>First order rigidity of homeomorphism groups of manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01481v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For every compact, connected manifold $M$, we prove the existence of a sentence $\phi_M$ in the language of groups such that the homeomorphism group of another compact manifold $N$ satisfies $\phi_M$ if and only if $N$ is homeomorphic to $M$. We prove the analogous statement for groups of homeomorphisms preserving an Oxtoby--Ulam probability measure.</description>

      <title>Unimodal Measurable Pseudo-Anosov Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We exhibit a continuously varying family $F_\lambda$ of homeomorphisms of the sphere $S^2$, for which each $F_\lambda$ is a measurable pseudo-Anosov map. Measurable pseudo-Anosov maps are generalizations of Thurston's pseudo-Anosov maps, and also of the generalized pseudo-Anosov maps of [19]. They have a transverse pair of invariant full measure turbulations, consisting of streamlines which are dense injectively immersed lines: these turbulations are equipped with measures which are expanded and contracted uniformly by the homeomorphism. The turbulations need not have a good product structure anywhere, but have some local structure imposed by the existence of tartans: bundles of unstable and stable streamline segments which intersect regularly, and on whose intersections the product of the measures on the turbulations agrees with the ambient measure.
  Each map $F_\lambda$ is semi-conjugate to the inverse limit of the core tent map with slope $\lambda$: it is topologically transitive, ergodic with respect to a background Oxtoby-Ulam measure, has dense periodic points, and has topological entropy $h(F_\lambda) = \log \lambda$ (so that no two $F_\lambda$ are topologically conjugate). For a full measure, dense $G_\delta$ set of parameters, $F_\lambda$ is a measurable pseudo-Anosov map but not a generalized pseudo-Anosov map, and its turbulations are nowhere locally regular.</description>
