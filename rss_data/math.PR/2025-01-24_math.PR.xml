      <title>Likelihood-Based Root State Reconstruction on a Tree: Sensitivity to Parameters and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a broadcasting problem on a tree where a binary digit (e.g., a spin or a nucleotide's purine/pyrimidine type) is propagated from the root to the leaves through symmetric noisy channels on the edges that randomly flip the state with edge-dependent probabilities. The goal of the reconstruction problem is to infer the root state given the observations at the leaves only. Specifically, we study the sensitivity of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to uncertainty in the edge parameters under this model, which is also known as the Cavender-Farris-Neyman (CFN) model. Our main result shows that when the true flip probabilities are sufficiently small, the posterior root mean (or magnetization of the root) under estimated parameters (within a constant factor) agrees with the root spin with high probability and deviates significantly from it with negligible probability. This provides theoretical justification for the practical use of MLE in ancestral sequence reconstruction in phylogenetics, where branch lengths (i.e., the edge parameters) must be estimated. As a separate application, we derive an approximation for the gradient of the population log-likelihood of the leaf states under the CFN model, with implications for branch length estimation via coordinate maximization.</description>

      <title>Intersection density and visibility for Boolean models in hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For Poisson particle processes in hyperbolic space we introduce and study concepts analogous to the intersection density and the mean visible volume, which were originally considered in the analysis of Boolean models in Euclidean space. In particular, we determine a necessary and sufficient condition for the finiteness of the mean visible volume of a Boolean model in terms of the intensity and the mean surface area of the typical grain.</description>

      <title>Synchronization by noise for traveling pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider synchronization by noise for stochastic partial differential equations which support traveling pulse solutions, such as the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation. We show that any two pulse-like solutions which start from different positions but are forced by the same realization of a multiplicative noise, converge to each other in probability on a time scale $\sigma^{-2} \ll t \ll \exp(\sigma^{-2})$, where $\sigma$ is the noise amplitude. The noise is assumed to be Gaussian, white in time, colored and periodic in space, and non-degenerate only in the lowest Fourier mode. The proof uses the method of phase reduction, which allows one to describe the dynamics of the stochastic pulse only in terms of its position. The position is shown to synchronize building upon existing results, and the validity of the phase reduction allows us to transfer the synchronization back to the full solution.</description>

      <title>Linearization of ergodic McKean SDEs and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider McKean stochastic differential equations, as well as their corresponding McKean-Vlasov partial differential equations, which admit a unique stationary state, and we study the linearized It\^o diffusion process that is obtained by replacing the law of the process in the convolution term with the unique invariant measure. We show that the law of this linearized process converges to the law of the nonlinear process exponentially fast in time, both in relative entropy and in Wasserstein distance. We study the problem in both the whole space and the torus. We then show how we can employ the resulting linear (in the sense of McKean) Markov process to analyze properties of the original nonlinear and nonlocal dynamics that depend on their long-time behavior. In particular, we propose a linearized maximum likelihood estimator for the nonlinear process which is asymptotically unbiased, and we study the joint diffusive-mean field limit of the underlying interacting particle system.</description>

      <title>Regularizing random points by deleting a few</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well understood that if one is given a set $X \subset [0,1]$ of $n$ independent uniformly distributed random variables, then $$ \sup_{0 \leq x \leq 1} \left| \frac{\# X \cap [0,x]}{\# X} - x \right| \lesssim \frac{\sqrt{\log{n}}}{ \sqrt{n}} \qquad \mbox{with very high probability.} $$ We show that one can improve the error term by removing a few of the points. For any $m \leq 0.001n$ there exists a subset $Y \subset X$ obtained by deleting at most $m$ points, so that the error term drops from $\sim \sqrt{\log{n}}/\sqrt{n}$ to $ \log{(n)}/m$ with high probability. When $m=cn$ for a small $0 \leq c \leq 0.001$, this achieves the essentially optimal asymptotic order of discrepancy $\log(n)/n$. The proof is constructive and works in an online setting (where one is given the points sequentially, one at a time, and has to decide whether to keep or discard it). A change of variables shows the same result for any random variables on the real line with absolutely continuous density.</description>

      <title>Moments of generalized fractional polynomial processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a moment formula for generalized fractional polynomial processes, i.e., for polynomial-preserving Markov processes time-changed by an inverse L\'evy-subordinator. If the time change is inverse $\alpha$-stable, the time-derivative of the Kolmogorov backward equation is replaced by a Caputo fractional derivative of order $\alpha$, and we demonstrate that moments of such processes are computable, in a closed form, using matrix Mittag-Leffler functions. The same holds true for cross-moments in equilibrium, generalizing results of Leonenko, Meerschaert and Sikorskii from the one-dimensional diffusive case of second-order moments to the multivariate, jump-diffusive case of moments of arbitrary order. We show that also in this more general setting, fractional polynomial processes exhibit long-range dependence, with correlations decaying as a power law with exponent $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Proportion of Nilpotent Subgroups in Finite Groups and Their Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces and investigates the function $J(G) = \frac{\text{Nil}(G)}{L(G)}$, where $\text{Nil}(G)$ denotes the number of nilpotent subgroups and $L(G)$ the total number of subgroups of a finite group $G$. The function $J(G)$, defined over the interval $(0,1]$, serves as a tool to analyze structural patterns in finite groups, particularly within non-nilpotent families such as supersolvable and dihedral groups. Analytical results demonstrate the product density of $J(G)$ values in $(0,1]$, highlighting its distribution across products of dihedral groups. Additionally, a probabilistic analysis was conducted, and based on extensive computational simulations, it was conjectured that the sample mean of $J(G)$ values converges in distribution to the standard normal distribution, in accordance with the Central Limit Theorem, as the sample size increases. These findings expand the understanding of multiplicative functions in group theory, offering novel insights into the structural and probabilistic behavior of finite groups.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Ambiguity Attitudes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a model-free preference under ambiguity, as a primitive trait of behavior, which we apply once as well as repeatedly. Its single and double application yield simple, easily interpretable definitions of ambiguity aversion and ambiguity prudence. We derive their implications within canonical models for decision under risk and ambiguity. We establish in particular that our new definition of ambiguity prudence is equivalent to a positive third derivative of: (i) the capacity in the Choquet expected utility model, (ii) the dual conjugate of the divergence function under variational divergence preferences and (iii) the ambiguity attitude function in the smooth ambiguity model. We show that our definition of ambiguity prudent behavior may be naturally linked to an optimal insurance problem under ambiguity.</description>

      <title>Continuity of the Distribution Function of the argmax of a Gaussian Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An increasingly important class of estimators has members whose asymptotic distribution is non-Gaussian, yet characterizable as the argmax of a Gaussian process. This paper presents high-level sufficient conditions under which such asymptotic distributions admit a continuous distribution function. The plausibility of the sufficient conditions is demonstrated by verifying them in three prominent examples, namely maximum score estimation, empirical risk minimization, and threshold regression estimation. In turn, the continuity result buttresses several recently proposed inference procedures whose validity seems to require a result of the kind established herein. A notable feature of the high-level assumptions is that one of them is designed to enable us to employ the celebrated Cameron-Martin theorem. In a leading special case, the assumption in question is demonstrably weak and appears to be close to minimal.</description>

      <title>Linear extrapolation for the graph of function of single variable based on walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum walk was introduced as a quantum counterpart of the random walk and has been intensively studied since around 2000. Its applications include topological insulators, radioactive waste reduction, and quantum search. The first author in 2019 defined a time-series model based on the measure of the ``discrete-time" and ``discrete-space" quantum walk in one dimension. Inspired by his model, this paper proposes a new model for the graph of a function of a single variable determined by the measure which comes from the weak limit measure of a ``continuous-time or discrete-time" and ``discrete-space" walk. The measure corresponds to a ``continuous-time" and ``continuous-space" walk in one dimension. Moreover, we also presents a method of a linear extrapolation for the graph by our model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We adapt Stein's method of diffusion approximations, developed by Barbour, to the study of chaotic dynamical systems. We establish an error bound in the functional central limit theorem with respect to an integral probability metric of smooth test functions under a functional correlation decay bound. For systems with a sufficiently fast polynomial rate of correlation decay, the error bound is of order $O(N^{-1/2})$, under an additional condition on the linear growth of variance. Applications include a family of interval maps with neutral fixed points and unbounded derivatives, and two-dimensional dispersing Sinai billiards.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations in Switching Diffusion: from Free Cumulants to Dynamical Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the diffusion of a particle with a time-dependent diffusion constant $D(t)$ that switches between random values drawn from a distribution $W(D)$ at a fixed rate $r$. Using a renewal approach, we compute exactly the moments of the position of the particle $\langle x^{2n}(t) \rangle$ at any finite time $t$, and for any $W(D)$ with finite moments $\langle D^n \rangle$. For $t \gg 1$, we demonstrate that the cumulants $\langle x^{2n}(t) \rangle_c$ grow linearly with $t$ and are proportional to the free cumulants of a random variable distributed according to $W(D)$. For specific forms of $W(D)$, we compute the large deviations of the position of the particle, uncovering rich behaviors and dynamical transitions of the rate function $I(y=x/t)$. Our analytical predictions are validated numerically with high precision, achieving accuracy up to $10^{-2000}$.</description>

In particular, we characterize this capacity in the low signal-to-noise ratio regime, as a corollary of the following general result on a moment matching problem: we show that for any continuous random variable with finite moments, the largest number of initial moments that can be matched by a discrete random variable of sufficiently small but positive entropy is three.</description>

      <title>Consistent spectral clustering in sparse tensor block models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-order clustering aims to classify objects in multiway datasets that are prevalent in various fields such as bioinformatics, social network analysis, and recommendation systems. These tasks often involve data that is sparse and high-dimensional, presenting significant statistical and computational challenges. This paper introduces a tensor block model specifically designed for sparse integer-valued data tensors. We propose a simple spectral clustering algorithm augmented with a trimming step to mitigate noise fluctuations, and identify a density threshold that ensures the algorithm's consistency. Our approach models sparsity using a sub-Poisson noise concentration framework, accommodating heavier than sub-Gaussian tails. Remarkably, this natural class of tensor block models is closed under aggregation across arbitrary modes. Consequently, we obtain a comprehensive framework for evaluating the tradeoff between signal loss and noise reduction during data aggregation. The analysis is based on a novel concentration bound for sparse random Gram matrices. The theoretical findings are illustrated through simulation experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a random permutation of $kn$ objects that permutes $n$ disjoint blocks of size $k$ and then permutes elements within each block. Normalizing its cycle lengths by $kn$ gives a random partition of unity, and we derive the limit law of this partition as $k,n \to \infty$. The limit may be constructed via a simple square cutting procedure that generalizes stick breaking in the classical case of uniform permutations ($k=1$). The proof is by coupling, providing upper and lower bounds on the Wasserstein distance. The limit is shown to have a certain self-similar structure that gives the distribution of large cycles and relates to a multiplicative function involving the Dickman function. Along the way we also give the first extension of the Erd\H{o}s-Tur\'an law to a proper permutation subgroup.</description>

      <title>Spikes can transmit neurons' subthreshold membrane potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neurons primarily communicate through the emission of action potentials, or spikes. To generate a spike, a neuron's membrane potential must cross a defined threshold. Does this spiking mechanism inherently prevent neurons from transmitting their subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations to other neurons? We prove that, in theory, it does not. The subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations of a presynaptic population of spiking neurons can be perfectly transmitted to a downstream population of neurons. Mathematically, this surprising result is an example of concentration phenomenon in high dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a streamlined account of two different regularity methods as well as their connections. We consider the coupling method in the context of tug-of-war with noise stochastic games, and consider viscosity solutions of the $p$-Laplace equation in the context of the Ishii-Lions method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with ergodic properties of inhomogeneous Markov processes. Since the transition probabilities depend on initial times, the existing methods to obtain invariant measures for homogeneous Markov processes are not applicable straightforwardly. We impose some appropriate conditions under which invariant measure families for inhomogeneous Markov processes can be studied. Specifically, the existence of invariant measure families is established by either a generalization of the classical Krylov-Bogolyubov method or a Lyapunov criterion. Moreover, the uniqueness and exponential ergodicity are demonstrated under a contraction assumption of the transition probabilities on a large set. Finally, three examples, including Markov chains, diffusion processes and storage processes, are analyzed to illustrate the practicality of our method.</description>

      <title>Local times of anisotropic Gaussian random fields and stochastic heat equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13732v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the local times of a large class of Gaussian random fields satisfying strong local nondeterminism with respect to an anisotropic metric. We establish moment estimates and H\"{o}lder conditions for the local times of the Gaussian random fields. Our key estimates rely on geometric properties of Voronoi partitions with respect to an anisotropic metric and the use of Besicovitch's covering theorem. As a consequence, we deduce sample path properties of the Gaussian random fields that are related to Chung's law of the iterated logarithm and modulus of non-differentiability. Moreover, we apply our results to systems of stochastic heat equations with additive Gaussian noise and determine the exact Hausdorff measure function with respect to the parabolic metric for the level sets of the solutions.</description>

      <title>Ergodic behavior of products of random positive operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is devoted to the study of products of random operators of the form $M_{0,n}=M_0\cdots M_{n-1}$, where $(M_{n})_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is an ergodic sequence of positive operators on the space of signed measures on a space $\mathbb{X}$. Under suitable conditions, in particular, a Doeblin-type minoration suited for non conservative operators, we obtain asymptotic results of the form \[ \mu M_{0,n} \simeq \mu(\tilde{h}) r_n \pi_n,\] where $\tilde{h}$ is a random bounded function, $(r_n)_{n\geq 0}$ is a random non negative sequence and $\pi_n$ is a random probability measure on $\mathbb{X}$. Moreover, $\tilde{h}$, $(r_n)$ and $\pi_n$ do not depend on the choice of the measure $\mu$. We prove additionally that $n^{-1} \log (r_n)$ converges almost surely to the Lyapunov exponent $\lambda$ of the process $(M_{0,n})_{n\geq 0}$ and that the sequence of random probability measures $(\pi_n)$ converges weakly towards a random probability measure. These results are analogous to previous estimates from Hennion in the case of $d\times d$ matrices, that were obtained with different techniques, based on a projective contraction in Hilbert distance. In the case where the sequence $(M_n)$ is i.i.d, we additionally exhibit an expression of the Lyapunov exponent $\lambda$ as an integral with respect to the weak limit of the sequence of random probability measures $(\pi_n)$ and exhibit an oscillation behavior of $r_n$ when $\lambda=0$. We provide a detailed comparison of our assumptions with the ones of Hennion and present some example of applications of our results, in particular in the field of population dynamics.</description>

Abstract: In his 1996 paper, Talagrand highlighted that the Law of Large Numbers (LLN) for independent random variables can be viewed as a geometric property of multidimensional product spaces. This phenomenon is known as the concentration of measure. To illustrate this profound connection between geometry and probability theory, we consider a seemingly intractable geometric problem in multidimensional Euclidean space and solve it using standard probabilistic tools such as the LLN and the Central Limit Theorem (CLT).</description>

      <title>Time-changed Markov processes and coupled non-local equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study coupled fully non-local equations, where a linear non-local operator jointly acts on the time and space variables. We establish existence and uniqueness of the solution. A maximum principle is proved and used to derive uniqueness. Existence is established by providing a stochastic representation based on anomalous processes constructed as a time change via the undershooting of an independent subordinator. This leads to general non-stepped processes with intervals of constancy representing a sticky or trapping effect. Our theory allows these intervals to be dependent on the immediately subsequent jump. These processes include scaling limit of suitable coupled continuous time random walks previously studied in applications, in particular in the context of anomalous diffusion and option pricing. Here we exploit our general theory to obtain a non-local analog of the Black and Scholes equation, addressing the problem of determining the seasoned price of a derivative security, in case the price fluctuations are described by a process whose jumps are dependent on the previous interval.</description>

      <title>Entropy Gain and Information Loss by Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10364</link>
      <description>arXiv:1908.10364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When the quantum entropy (QE) of a system increases due to measurements, it leads to the loss of certain information, part of which may be recoverable. We define Information Loss (IL) as a function of the density matrix through quantum entropy to effectively represent this relationship between gain and loss. For example, if the quantum entropy of a system increases from zero to 2ln2, its information loss rises from zero to 75 percent. We demonstrate that when a pure, unbiased m-qubit state collapses into a maximally mixed state, it acquires the highest possible gain in entropy and the maximal loss of information. We analyze the QE and IL of single qubits, entangled photon pairs in Bell tests, multi-qubit systems such as in quantum teleportation, GHZ and W states, as well as the two-qubit Werner mixed states, focusing on their dependence on parameters like polarization bias. We notice that the data exchange between the two observers in Bell tests can recover some of the lost quantum information even years later, indicating that the associated quantum entropy can be removed years later, which implies a possible explanation linked to quantum non-locality. We show that measuring the Bell, GHZ, and marginally entangled Werner state yields the same minimal entropy gain (ln2) and an equal minimal information loss (50 percent).</description>

      <title>High-Dimensional Canonical Correlation Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16393v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies high-dimensional canonical correlation analysis (CCA) with an emphasis on the vectors that define canonical variables. The paper shows that when two dimensions of data grow to infinity jointly and proportionally, the classical CCA procedure for estimating those vectors fails to deliver a consistent estimate. This provides the first result on the impossibility of identification of canonical variables in the CCA procedure when all dimensions are large. As a countermeasure, the paper derives the magnitude of the estimation error, which can be used in practice to assess the precision of CCA estimates. Applications of the results to cyclical vs. non-cyclical stocks and to a limestone grassland data set are provided.</description>

      <title>Action convergence of general hypergraphs and tensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Action convergence provides a limit theory for linear bounded operators $A_n:L^{\infty}(\Omega_n)\longrightarrow L^1(\Omega_n)$ where $\Omega_n$ are potentially different probability spaces. This notion of convergence emerged in graph limits theory as it unifies and generalizes many notions of graph limits. We generalize the theory of action convergence to sequences of multi-linear bounded operators $A_n:L^{\infty}(\Omega_n)\times \ldots \times L^{\infty}(\Omega_n)\longrightarrow L^1(\Omega_n)$. Similarly to the linear case, we obtain that for a uniformly bounded (under an appropriate norm) sequence of multi-linear operators, there exists an action convergent subsequence. Additionally, we explain how to associate different types of multi-linear operators to a tensor and we study the different notions of convergence that we obtain for tensors and in particular for adjacency tensors of hypergraphs. We obtain several hypergraphs convergence notions and we link these with the hierarchy of notions of quasirandomness for hypergraph sequences. This convergence also covers sparse and inhomogeneous hypergraph sequences and it preserves many properties of adjacency tensors of hypergraphs. Moreover, we explain how to obtain a meaningful convergence for sequences of non-uniform hypergraphs and, therefore, also for simplicial complexes. Additionally, we highlight many connections with the theory of dense uniform hypergraph limits (hypergraphons) and we conjecture the equivalence of this theory with a modification of multi-linear action convergence.</description>

      <title>Two optimization problems for the Loewner energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Jordan curve on the Riemann sphere can be encoded by its conformal welding, a circle homeomorphism. The Loewner energy measures how far a Jordan curve is away from being a circle, or equivalently, how far its welding homeomorphism is away from being a M\"obius transformation. We consider two optimizing problems for the Loewner energy, one under the constraint for the curves to pass through $n$ given points on the Riemann sphere, which is the conformal boundary of hyperbolic $3$-space $\mathbb H^3$; the other under the constraint for $n$ given points on the circle to be welded to another $n$ given points of the circle. The latter problem can be viewed as optimizing positive curves on the boundary of AdS$^3$ space passing through $n$ prescribed points. We observe that the answers to the two problems exhibit interesting symmetries: optimizing the Jordan curve in $\partial_\infty \mathbb H^3$ gives rise to a welding homeomorphism that is the boundary of a pleated plane in AdS$^3$, whereas optimizing the positive curve in $\partial_\infty\!\operatorname{AdS}^3$ gives rise to a Jordan curve that is the boundary of a pleated plane in $\mathbb H^3$.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional analysis of ridge regression for non-identically distributed data with a variance profile</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20200v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional linear regression has been thoroughly studied in the context of independent and identically distributed data. We propose to investigate high-dimensional regression models for independent but non-identically distributed data. To this end, we suppose that the set of observed predictors (or features) is a random matrix with a variance profile and with dimensions growing at a proportional rate. Assuming a random effect model, we study the predictive risk of the ridge estimator for linear regression with such a variance profile. In this setting, we provide deterministic equivalents of this risk and of the degree of freedom of the ridge estimator. For certain class of variance profile, our work highlights the emergence of the well-known double descent phenomenon in high-dimensional regression for the minimum norm least-squares estimator when the ridge regularization parameter goes to zero. We also exhibit variance profiles for which the shape of this predictive risk differs from double descent. The proofs of our results are based on tools from random matrix theory in the presence of a variance profile that have not been considered so far to study regression models. Numerical experiments are provided to show the accuracy of the aforementioned deterministic equivalents on the computation of the predictive risk of ridge regression. We also investigate the similarities and differences that exist with the standard setting of independent and identically distributed data.</description>

      <title>A mixture representation of the spectral distribution of isotropic kernels with application to random Fourier features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rahimi and Recht (2007) introduced the idea of decomposing positive definite shift-invariant kernels by randomly sampling from their spectral distribution. This famous technique, known as Random Fourier Features (RFF), is in principle applicable to any such kernel whose spectral distribution can be identified and simulated. In practice, however, it is usually applied to the Gaussian kernel because of its simplicity, since its spectral distribution is also Gaussian. Clearly, simple spectral sampling formulas would be desirable for broader classes of kernels. In this paper, we prove that the spectral distribution of every positive definite isotropic kernel can be decomposed as a scale mixture of $\alpha$-stable random vectors, and we identify the scaling distribution as a function of the kernel. This constructive decomposition provides a simple and ready-to-use spectral sampling formula for every multivariate positive definite shift-invariant kernel, including exponential power kernels, generalized Mat\'ern kernels, generalized Cauchy kernels, as well as newly introduced kernels such as the Beta, Kummer, and Tricomi kernels. In particular, we show that the spectral distributions of these kernels are scale mixtures of the multivariate Gaussian distribution. This provides a very simple way to adapt existing random Fourier features software based on Gaussian kernels to any positive definite shift-invariant kernel. This result has broad applications for support vector machines, kernel ridge regression, Gaussian processes, and other kernel-based machine learning techniques for which the random Fourier features technique is applicable.</description>
