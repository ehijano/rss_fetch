      <title>Covariance Matrix Analysis for Optimal Portfolio Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In portfolio risk minimization, the inverse covariance matrix of returns is often unknown and has to be estimated in practice. This inverse covariance matrix also prescribes the hedge trades in which a stock is hedged by all the other stocks in the portfolio. In practice with finite samples, however, multicollinearity gives rise to considerable estimation errors, making the hedge trades too unstable and unreliable for use. By adopting ideas from current methodologies in the existing literature, we propose 2 new estimators of the inverse covariance matrix, one which relies only on the l2 norm while the other utilizes both the l1 and l2 norms. These 2 new estimators are classified as shrinkage estimators in the literature. Comparing favorably with other methods (sample-based estimation, equal-weighting, estimation based on Principal Component Analysis), a portfolio formed on the proposed estimators achieves substantial out-of-sample risk reduction and improves the out-of-sample risk-adjusted returns of the portfolio, particularly in high-dimensional settings. Furthermore, the proposed estimators can still be computed even in instances where the sample covariance matrix is ill-conditioned or singular</description>

      <title>Examples and Counterexamples of Cost-efficiency in Incomplete Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a number of examples and counterexamples to illustrate the results on cost-efficiency in an incomplete market obtained in [BS24]. These examples and counterexamples do not only illustrate the results obtained in [BS24], but show the limitations of the results and the sharpness of the key assumptions. In particular, we make use of a simple 3-state model in which we are able to recover and illustrate all key results of the paper. This example also shows how our characterization of perfectly cost-efficient claims allows to solve an expected utility maximization problem in a simple incomplete market (trinomial model) and recover results from [DS06, Chapter 3], there obtained using duality.</description>

      <title>Stopper vs. singular-controller games with degenerate diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study zero-sum stochastic games between a singular controller and a stopper when the (state-dependent) diffusion matrix of the underlying controlled diffusion process is degenerate. In particular, we show the existence of a value for the game and determine an optimal strategy for the stopper. The degeneracy of the dynamics prevents the use of analytical methods based on solution in Sobolev spaces of suitable variational problems. Therefore we adopt a probabilistic approach based on a perturbation of the underlying diffusion modulated by a parameter $\gamma&gt;0$. For each $\gamma&gt;0$ the approximating game is non-degenerate and admits a value $u^\gamma$ and an optimal strategy $\tau^\gamma_*$ for the stopper. Letting $\gamma\to 0$ we prove convergence of $u^\gamma$ to a function $v$, which identifies the value of the original game. We also construct explicitly optimal stopping times $\theta^\gamma_*$ for $u^\gamma$, related but not equal to $\tau^\gamma_*$, which converge almost surely to an optimal stopping time $\theta_*$ for the game with degenerate dynamics.</description>
