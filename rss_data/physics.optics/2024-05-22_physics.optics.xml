      <title>Propagation and material-interface effects in the higher-order harmonic radiation from solid-state samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The propagation-effects reshaping the excitation pulse are known to exhibit a strong influence on the high-harmonic generation (HHG) in solid-state media. Previous measurements showed that the mid-infrared pulse dynamics, most importantly the nonlinear loss and spectral broadening, can dampen or even extinguish the highest harmonic peaks. Despite the importance of these effects, their inclusion in the HHG simulations has been so far restricted to one-dimensional propagation and/or very thin samples. This work demonstrates an approach where the driving pulse is simulated with a full spatial and temporal resolution in samples of realistic thickness while the material interfaces are included as well. We show that the HHG spectrum measured in the transmission geometry is greatly affected by the Fresnel reflections causing interference in the vicinity of the material surface, and we find that different parts of the harmonic spectra originate from different regions of the material sample. Our results underline the importance of realistic and comprehensive simulations in the interpretation of high-harmonic generation from solids in the transmission-geometry.</description>

      <title>Nano-gap electrode dielectrophoresis for tether-free trapping and interferometric-scattering detection of single 20 nm particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate detection and characterization of nanoparticles within confined spaces is crucial for applications ranging from nanofluidics to biotechnology. We present a novel approach that combines interferometric scattering (iSCAT) detection with trapping by dielectrophoresis (DEP) to achieve label-free detection of nanoparticles that are trapped and/or actuated between nano-gap electrodes. DEP utilizes the interaction between the induced dipole of the particle and the applied electric field to create a trapping potential. We demonstrate our method by trapping and label-free detection of down to 20 nm polystyrene nanoparticles. Additionally, we demonstrate that the signal-to-noise ratio of our detection can be boosted up to 20-fold by periodic actuation of the nanoparticle in the trap. This is done by a digital lock-in detection scheme on the modulated scattering signal. Our method holds promise for various applications, including assembly of nanoparticles, single-particle property analysis, and nanofluidic devices.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Structured Light through Nonlinear Frequency Generation in an Optical Enhancement Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of shaped laser beams, or structured light, is of interest in a wide range of fields, from microscopy to fundamental physics. There are several ways to make shaped beams, most commonly using spatial light modulators comprised of pixels of liquid crystals. These methods have limitations on the wavelength, pulse duration, and average power that can be used. Here we present a method to generate shaped light that can be used at any wavelength from the UV to IR, on ultrafast pulses, and a large range of optical powers. By exploiting the frequency difference between higher order modes, a result of the Gouy phase, and cavity mode matching, we can selectively couple into a variety of pure and composite higher order modes. Optical cavities are used as a spatial filter and then combined with sum frequency generation in a nonlinear crystal as the output coupler to the cavity to create ultrafast, frequency comb structured light.</description>

      <title>A silicon photonics waveguide-coupled colloidal quantum dot photodiode sensitive beyond 1.6 um</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon photonics faces a persistent challenge in extending photodetection capabilities beyond the 1.6 um wavelength range, primarily due to the lack of appropriate epitaxial materials. Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) present a promising solution here, offering distinct advantages such as infrared wavelength tunability, cost-effectiveness, and facile deposition. Their unique properties position them as a potential candidate for enabling photodetection in silicon photonics beyond the conventional telecom wavelength, thereby expanding the potential applications and capabilities within this domain. In this study, we have successfully integrated lead sulfide (PbS) colloidal quantum dot photodiodes (QDPDs) onto silicon waveguides using standard process techniques. The integrated photodiodes exhibit a remarkable responsivity of 1.3 A/W (with an external quantum efficiency of 74.8%) at a wavelength of 2.1 um, a low dark current of only 106 nA and a bandwidth of 1.1 MHz under a -3 V bias. To demonstrate the scalability of our integration approach, we have developed a compact 8-channel spectrometer incorporating an array of QDPDs. This achievement marks a significant step toward realizing a cost-effective photodetector solution for silicon photonics, particularly tailored for a wide range of sensing applications around the 2 um wavelength range.</description>

      <title>Continuous wave driving elucidates the desynchronisation dynamics of ultrashort dissipative Raman solitons generated in dispersive Kerr resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase-coherent pulsed driving of passive optical fiber resonators enable the generation of ultrashort dissipative Raman solitons with durations well below 100~fs. The existence and characteristics of such solitons critically depends on the desynchronisation between the pulsed driving source and the resonator roundtrip time, yet the full mechanism through which these dependencies arise remains unclear. Here, we numerically demonstrate that Raman solitons can exist even under conditions of continuous wave driving, and by numerically examining the existence and characteristics of Raman solitons under such conditions, we elucidate the role of desynchronisation in pulse-driven systems. In addition to providing new insights on the existence and characteristics of ultrashort Raman solitons, our analysis yields a qualitative explanation for the range of desynchronisations over which the solitons can exist.</description>

      <title>Tunable Surface Plasmon-Polaritons Interaction in All-Metal Pyramidal Metasurfaces: Unveiling Principles and Significance for Biosensing Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strong coupling of plasmonic resonance modes in conductive pyramidal nanoparticles leads to an increase in the density of free charges on the surface. By ensuring plasmonic coupling in the pyramidal nanoparticle lattice, the achieved field intensity is potentiated. At the same time, a strong coupling between resonant modes is guaranteed, which results in the formation of new hybrid modes. In this manuscript, we demonstrated a tunable double anticrossing interaction that results from the interaction between two Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR) modes and a Surface Plasmon Polariton (SPP) wave. The tuning is done as a function of the variation of the angle of incidence of the input electric field. From the double anticrossing, an increase in field intensity in a blue-shifted LSPR mode located in the red wavelength region is observed. This demonstrates that at certain angles of incidence, the intensity field obtained is strongly favored, which would be beneficial for applications such as Surface Enhancement Raman Spectroscopy (SERS). Nanoparticle-based lattices have been widely used for biosensor applications. However, one of the major limitations of this type of device is the low tolerance to high concentrations of biomolecules, which significantly affects their performance. According to the studies carried out for this manuscript, it was demonstrated that the implemented geometry allows for the observation of an LSPR mode, which is responsible for the control and synchronization of other perceived resonances. This mode remains almost invariant when subjected to structural variations or changes in the angle of incidence of the electric field. These characteristics eliminate the limitation mentioned above, allowing for sensitivities 10^3 times higher than those achieved in conventional systems based on LSPR used to detect P. brasiliensis antigen.</description>

      <title>Molecule-induced surface second-order nonlinearity in an inversion symmetric microcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inversion symmetry eliminates the second-order nonlinear responses in materials commonly used in silicon photonics with electric-dipole approximation. The lack of effective methods to induce the second-order nonlinearity in silicon photonic materials prevents their applications in second-order nonlinear integrated photonics. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a surface second-order nonlinear optics approach for boosting the second harmonic (SH) generation process in a silica microcavity. By leveraging the molecule-induced surface second-order nonlinearity, a record high SH efficiency of about 6.7% W-1 is achieved in a silica microcavity functionalized with a surface asymmetrically-aligned molecular monolayer, which is enhanced of two to four orders of magnitude compared to that before molecule-functionalization. Furthermore, we derive the equations that govern the surface second-order nonlinear process in inversion symmetric microcavities. Our method not only enables high efficiency second-order nonlinear frequency conversions in silica photonics, but also can apply to other inversion symmetric material platforms for integrated photonics.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Discovery for Robust Optimization of Semiconductor Nanowire Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active wavelength-scale optoelectronic components are widely used in photonic integrated circuitry, however coherent sources of light -- namely optical lasers -- remain the most challenging component to integrate. Semiconductor nanowire lasers represent a flexible class of light source where each nanowire is both gain material and cavity; however, strong coupling between these properties and the performance leads to inhomogeneity across the population. While this has been studied and optimized for individual material systems, no architecture-wide insight is available. Here, nine nanowire laser material systems are studied and compared using 55,516 nanowire lasers to provide statistically robust insight into performance. These results demonstrate that, while it may be important to optimise internal quantum efficiency for certain materials, cavity effects are always critical. Our study provides a roadmap to optimize the performance of nanowire lasers made from any material: this can be achieved by ensuring a narrow spread of lengths and end-facet reflectivities.</description>

      <title>On-demand heralded MIR single-photon source using a cascaded quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism for generating single photons in the mid-Infrared (MIR) using a solid-state or molecular quantum emitter. The scheme utilises cavity QED effects to selectively enhance a Frank-Condon transition, deterministically preparing a single Fock state of a polar phonon mode. By coupling the phonon mode to an antenna, the resulting excitation is then radiated to the far field as a single photon with a frequency matching the phonon mode. By combining macroscopic QED calculations with methods from open quantum system theory, we show that optimal parameters to generate these MIR photons occur for modest light-matter coupling strengths, which are achievable with state-of-the-art technologies. Combined, the cascaded system we propose provides a new quasi-deterministic source of heralded single photons in a regime of the electromagnetic spectrum where this previously was not possible.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Broadband Strong-Field Tunnelling in Asymmetric Nanogaps for Time-Resolved Nanoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Femtosecond-fast and nanometre-size pulses of electrons are emerging as unique probes for ultrafast dynamics at the nanoscale. Presently, such pulses are achievable only in highly sophisticated ultrafast electron microscopes or equally complex setups involving few-cycle-pulsed lasers with stable carrier-envelope phase (CEP) and nanotip probes. Here, we show that the generation of femtosecond pulses of nanoscale tunnelling electrons can be achieved in any ultrafast optical laboratory, using any (deep-UV to mid-IR) femtosecond laser in combination with photosensitive asymmetric nanogap (PAN) diodes fabricated via easy-to-scale adhesion lithography. The dominant mechanism producing tunnelling electrons in PANs is strong-field emission, which is easily achievable without CEP locking or external bias voltage. We employ PANs to demonstrate ultrafast nanoscopy of metal-halide perovskite quantum dots immobilised inside a 10-nm Al/Au nanogap and to characterise laser pulses across the entire optical region (266-6700 nm). Short electron pulses in PANs open the way towards scalable on-chip femtosecond electron measurements and novel design approaches for integrated ultrafast sensing nanodevices.</description>

      <title>Defect-assisted reversible phase transition in mono- and few-layer ReS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) materials have attracted substantial interest due to their remarkable excitonic, optical, electrical, and mechanical properties, which are highly dependent on their crystal structure. Controlling the crystal structure of these materials is essential for fine-tuning their performance, $\textit{e.g.}$, linear and nonlinear optical, as well as charge transport properties. While various phase-switching TMD materials, like molybdenum telluride (MoTe$_2$), are available, their transitions are often irreversible. Here, we investigate the mechanism of a light-induced reversible phase transition in mono- and bilayer flakes of rhenium disulfide (ReS$_2$). Our observations, based on scanning transmission electron microscopy, nonlinear spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations, reveal a transition from the ground T$''$ (double distorted T) to the metastable H$'$ (distorted H) phase under femtosecond laser irradiation or influence of highly-energetic electrons. We show that the formation of sulfur vacancies facilitates this phenomenon. Our findings pave the way towards actively manipulating the crystal structure of ReS$_2$ and possibly its heterostructures.</description>

      <title>A low-loss and broadband all-fiber acousto-optic circulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The introduction of low-loss optical fibers probably represents the single most important advance in the growth of our telecommunication system. To meet our needs for secure communications, it is likely that our classical network will soon be operating alongside what is known as a quantum network. The latter is very sensitive to loss and thus poses new constraints to the performance of current fiber components. In particular, recent quantum network prototypes underlined the absence of low-loss non-reciprocal fiber-based devices. Here, we present a solution to this issue by realizing low-loss (0.81 dB), broadband (at least 50 GHz bandwidth) and high-extinction (up to 27 dB) circulators, based on Mach-Zehnder interferometers including so-called fiber null-couplers. The latter are directional couplers, whose splitting-ratio can be controlled by launching acoustic waves along the coupling region. Fabricated from standard single-mode fibers and actuated electrically, these circulators can be made to fit any existing optical fiber networks and could turn out to be key for the transmission and processing of optically encoded quantum information.</description>

Abstract: Heat and disorder are opponents of magnetism. This fact, expressed in Curie's law established more than a century ago, holds even in the highly non-equilibrium interaction of ultra-intense laser pulses with magnetic matter. In contradiction to this, here we demonstrate that optical excitation of a ferromagnet can abrogate the link between temperature and order and observe 100 femtosecond class laser pulses to drive a reduction in spin entropy, concomitant to an increase in spin polarization and magnetic moment persisting after relaxation back to local charge equilibrium. This both establishes disorder as an unexpected resource for magnetic control at ultrafast times and, by the provision of a purely electronic mechanism that does not involve reconfiguration of the crystal lattice, suggests a novel scheme for spin-based signal processing and information storage significantly faster than current methodology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A method to compute the excitation of narrow transitions at hard x-ray energies by short focused x-ray pulses is developed. In particular, the effect of thin-film cavities on the pulse propagation is incorporated via a semi-analytical algorithm requiring the numerical evaluation of only one two- dimensional Fourier transform. We investigate various limiting cases to confirm the reliability of the algorithm. As an application, we show how a focused x-ray pulse propagates in cavity structures utilized in previous theoretical studies and experiments with collimated beams.</description>

      <title>Multiphoton Quantum Imaging using Natural Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is thought that schemes for quantum imaging are fragile against realistic environments in which the background noise is often stronger than the nonclassical signal of the imaging photons. Unfortunately, it is unfeasible to produce brighter quantum light sources to alleviate this problem. Here, we overcome this paradigmatic limitation by developing a quantum imaging scheme that relies on the use of natural sources of light. This is achieved by performing conditional detection on the photon number of the thermal light field scattered by a remote object. Specifically, the conditional measurements in our scheme enable us to extract quantum features of the detected thermal photons to produce quantum images with improved signal-to-noise ratios. This technique shows a remarkable exponential enhancement in the contrast of quantum images. Surprisingly, this measurement scheme enables the possibility of producing images from the vacuum fluctuations of the light field. This is experimentally demonstrated through the implementation of a single-pixel camera with photon-number-resolving capabilities. As such, we believe that our scheme opens a new paradigm in the field of quantum imaging. It also unveils the potential of combining natural light sources with nonclassical detection schemes for the development of robust quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a structured illumination technique for dark-field x-ray microscopy optimized for three-dimensional imaging of ordered materials at sub-micrometer length scales. Our method utilizes a coded aperture to spatially modulate the incident x-ray beam on the sample, enabling the reconstruction of the sample's 3D structure from images captured at various aperture positions. Unlike common volumetric imaging techniques such as tomography, our approach casts a scanning x-ray silhouette of a coded aperture for depth resolution along the axis of diffraction, eliminating any need for sample rotation or rastering, leading to a highly stable imaging modality. This modification provides robustness against geometric uncertainties during data acquisition, particularly for achieving sub-micrometer resolutions where geometric uncertainties typically limit resolution. We introduce the image reconstruction model and validate our results with experimental data on an isolated twin domain within a bulk single crystal of an iron pnictide obtained using a dark-field x-ray microscope. This timely advancement aligns with the enhanced brightness upgrade of the world's synchrotron radiation facilities, opening unprecedented opportunities in imaging.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12813</link>

Abstract: Coded apertures, traditionally employed in x-ray astronomy for imaging celestial objects, are now being adapted for micro-scale applications, particularly in studying microscopic specimens with synchrotron light diffraction. In this paper, we focus on micro-coded aperture imaging and its capacity to accomplish depth-resolved micro-diffraction analysis within crystalline specimens. We study aperture specifications and scanning parameters by assessing characteristics like size, thickness, and patterns. Numerical experiments assist in assessing their impact on reconstruction quality. Empirical data from a Laue diffraction microscope at a synchrotron undulator beamline supports our findings. Overall, our results offer key insights for optimizing aperture design in advancing micro-scale diffraction imaging at synchrotrons. This study contributes insights to this expanding field and suggests significant advancements, especially when coupled with the enhanced flux anticipated from the global upgrades of synchrotron sources.</description>

      <title>Open-Path Detection of Organic Vapors via Quantum Infrared Spectroscopy</title>

Abstract: In recent years, quantum Fourier transform infrared (QFTIR) spectroscopy was proposed as an alternative to conventional spectroscopy in the mid-infrared region of the spectrum. In this way, harnessing induced coherence and spectral entanglement offers perspectives for practical organic gasses detection. Still, little research was conducted in order to bring QFTIR spectrometers closer to domestic or in-field usage. In this work, we first use such a spectrometer for open-path detection of multiple interfering organic gasses in ambient air. The accurate identification of mixtures of acetone, methanol and ethanol vapors is demonstrated with a QFTIR spectrometer. We achieved this breakthrough by using a nonlinear Michelson interferometer with 1.7m-long arms in order to increase the absorption length, coupled with analysis techniques from differential optical absorption spectroscopy. The evolution of different gasses' concentrations in ambient air was measured through time. These results constitute the first use-case of a QFTIR spectrometer as a detector of organic gasses, and thus represent an important milestone towards the development of such detectors in practical situations.</description>

      <title>Scalable and Versatile Linear Computation with Minimalistic Photonic Matrix Processor</title>

Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence demands flexible multimodal data processing with high throughput and energy efficiency. Photonic integrated circuits (PIC) has demonstrated promising potentials in terms of low latency and low power consumption per operation for linear operations such as matrix-vector multiplication. However, the existing schemes face challenges in their scalability due to the use of photonic circuits that expand with the scale of the operants, despite efforts of exploiting the multiple optical parameter dimensions such as time, wavelength and spatial parallelism. They also lacked flexibility and efficiency in switching between different types of operations or tasks and adapting to multimodal data. In this article, we introduce an optical matrix processor (MP) with a minimalistic recursive structure for both multiplications and accumulations. The MP consists of an eletro-optic ring-modulator implemented as a thin-film lithium niobate PIC that allows flexible configurability and time-division multiplexed scheduling. The MP supports not only versatile linear operations including vector/matrix-vector multiplication and single/multi-kernel convolution but also ultrafast task switching and adaptability to data of different sizes, by simply adjusting the data baud rate relative to the ring delay without structural modifications. We demonstrate its capabilities in a optic-electronic convolutional neural network with a computing throughput up to 73.4 billion operations per second. The MP further supports high scalability through appropriate allocation of wavelength and space resources,extending computing parallelism to handle higher data volumes with higher energy efficiency. This novel scheme paves the way for a new class of photonic processorscapable of managing escalating data workloads with unprecedented flexibility, efficiency and scalability.</description>

      <title>Methane sensing in the mid-IR using short wave IR photon counting detectors via non-linear interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.15289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a novel MIR methane sensor shifting measurement wavelength to SWIR (1.55$\mu$m) by using non-linear interferometry. The technique exploits the interference effects seen in three-wave mixing when pump, signal, and idler modes make a double pass through a nonlinear crystal. The method allows sensing at wavelengths where detectors are poor ($&gt;$3$\mu$m) and detection at wavelengths where photon counting sensitivity can be achieved. In a first experimental demonstration, we measured a small methane concentration inside a gas cell with high precision. This interferometer can be built in a compact design for field operations and potentially enable the detection of low concentrations of methane at up to 100m range. Signal-to-noise ratio calculations show that the method can outperform existing short wavelength ($\sim$1.65$\mu$m) integrated path differential absorption direct sensing at high ($&gt;$$10^{-4}$) non-linear gain.</description>

      <title>Transfer learning-assisted inverse modeling in nanophotonics based on mixture density networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The simulation of nanophotonic structures relies on electromagnetic solvers, which play a crucial role in understanding their behavior. However, these solvers often come with a significant computational cost, making their application in design tasks, such as optimization, impractical. To address this challenge, machine learning techniques have been explored for accurate and efficient modeling and design of photonic devices. Deep neural networks, in particular, have gained considerable attention in this field. They can be used to create both forward and inverse models. An inverse modeling approach avoids the need for coupling a forward model with an optimizer and directly performs the prediction of the optimal design parameters values. In this paper, we propose an inverse modeling method for nanophotonic structures, based on a mixture density network model enhanced by transfer learning. Mixture density networks can predict multiple possible solutions at a time including their respective importance as Gaussian distributions. However, multiple challenges exist for mixture density network models. An important challenge is that an upper bound on the number of possible simultaneous solutions needs to be specified in advance. Also, another challenge is that the model parameters must be jointly optimized, which can result computationally expensive. Moreover, optimizing all parameters simultaneously can be numerically unstable and can lead to degenerate predictions. The proposed approach allows overcoming these limitations using transfer learning-based techniques, while preserving a high accuracy in the prediction capability of the design solutions given an optical response as an input. A dimensionality reduction step is also explored. Numerical results validate the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Laser Offset Stabilization with Chip-Scale Atomic Diffractive Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving precise and adjustable control over laser frequency is an essential requirement in numerous applications such as precision spectroscopy, quantum control, and sensing. In many such applications it is desired to stabilize a laser with a variable detuning from an atomic line. In this study, we employ an offset-stabilization scheme by utilizing phase contrast spectroscopy in microfabricated atomic diffractive elements vapor-cells. The spectroscopic response of such a device generates oscillating optical fringes, providing multiple optical frequency stabilization points across a bandwidth of tens of gigahertz, centered around the absorption resonances of Rb. Using this device, we demonstrate laser stabilization at various offset frequencies with instabilities reaching sub-megahertz levels. We further explore the fundamental limitations of our hybrid atomic-photonic device, drawing parallels to birefringent and dichroic spectroscopy apparatuses, which are commonly employed for offset stabilization. Our system showcases a broad offset lock bandwidth, a highly compact footprint, scalability to chip-scale production, and the ability to operate without reliance on magnetic fields. These attributes pave the way for a multitude of applications in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Coherent Quantum Communications Across National Scale Telecommunication Infrastructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum communications harness quantum phenomena like superposition and entanglement to enhance information transfer between remote nodes. Coherent quantum communications, essential for phase-based quantum internet architecture, require optical coherence among nodes and typically involve single-photon interference. Challenges like preserving optical coherence and integrating advanced single-photon detectors have impeded their deployment in existing telecommunication networks. This study introduces innovative approaches to the architecture and techniques supporting coherent quantum communications, marking their first successful integration within a commercial telecom infrastructure between Frankfurt and Kehl, Germany. Employing the Twin Field Quantum Key Distribution protocol, we achieved encryption key distribution at 110 bit/s over 254 km. This system features measurement-device-independent properties and non-cryogenically cooled detectors, and represents the first effective quantum repeater implementation on telecom infrastructure, the longest practical quantum key distribution deployment to date, and validates the feasibility of a phase-based quantum internet architecture.</description>
