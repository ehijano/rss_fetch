      <title>Probing the decay $A^0\to h^0 Z^{(*)}$ in Two-Higgs-Doublet Models in the inverted hierarchy scenario at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searches are being carried out at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) for the decay of the CP-odd scalar ($A^0$) in Two-Higgs-Doublet Models (2HDMs) with Natural Flavour Conservation (NFC) in the channel $A^0\to h^0 Z$, where $h^0$ is either the discovered 125 GeV Higgs boson or is an undiscovered CP-even scalar with a mass below 125 GeV. The latter possibility is called the "inverted hierarchy scenario" (IH) and would provide the opportunity of simultaneous discovery of two scalars. In both searches the selection cuts are optimised for the case of an on-shell $Z$ boson. For the case of the $Z$ boson being off-shell (denoted by $Z^*$, for which $m_{A^0} - m_{h^0}&lt;m_Z$) no limits are set on the relevant 2HDM parameters from this process. It is known that the decay $A^0\to h^0 Z^*$ can have a large branching ratio (BR) in 2HDMs (especially in the Type I structure). In the context of the IH scenario and developing our previous work, we calculate the signal cross section $\sigma(gg\to A^0)\times {\rm BR}(A^0\to h^0Z^{(*)})\times {\rm BR}(h^0\to b\overline b,\tau\overline \tau)$ in the four types of 2HDMs with NFC. We also suggest some selection cuts that could provide sensitivity to $A^0\to h^0 Z^*$ in the IH scenario.</description>

      <title>Model implementations of axion dark matter from kinetic misalignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The axion kinetic misalignment mechanism (KMM) opens the possibility of explaining dark matter for almost any axion mass and decay constant that are not accessible by the standard misalignment mechanism, in particular at low values of the axion decay constant (i.e. large coupling). This is a new opportunity for most axion experiments which could be sensitive to dark matter and probe new regimes of axion cosmology. We scrutinise UV completions that lead to the KMM mechanism. These mainly rely on the early dynamics of the axion partner, the radial mode of the complex scalar field, from which the axion inherits kinetic energy. The damping of the radial-mode energy density is then a necessary ingredient. We study in detail thermal damping from interactions in the plasma. A minimal and rather natural implementation consists of a KSVZ-type model with a nearly-quadratic potential for the radial mode extended by U(1)-breaking higher-dimensional operators. Furthermore, we study Higgs portal interactions as an alternative damping mechanism and improve upon previously proposed implementations based on quartic potentials. These implementations can lead to the QCD axion being dark matter and in the reach of IAXO, while MADMAX, IAXO and ALPS II can be sensitive to a generic Axion-Like-Particle (ALP) as dark matter. Such models typically feature a kination era. We also show that ALP dark matter from KMM points to a particular realization of inflation.</description>

      <title>Cold Dark Matter Based on an Analogy with Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel candidate for cold dark matter consisting of condensed Cooper pairs in a theory of interacting fermions with broken chiral symmetry. Establishing the thermal history from the early radiation era to the present, the fermions are shown to behave like standard radiation at high temperatures, but then experience a critical era decaying faster than radiation, akin to freeze-out that sets the relic abundance. Through a second-order phase transition, fermion - antifermion pairs condense and the system asymptotes towards zero temperature and pressure. By the present era, the non-relativistic, massive condensate decays slightly faster than in the standard scenario -- a unique prediction that may be tested by combined measurements of the cosmic microwave background and large scale structure. We also show that in the case of massive fermions, the phase transition is frustrated, and freeze-out instead leaves a residual, long-lived source of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Impact of Bound State Formation on Baryogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanism behind the generation of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe (BAU) is one of the biggest open questions of (astro-)particle physics. Popular mechanisms to generate the observed baryon asymmetry include CP-violating out-of-equilibrium decays and scatterings of heavy particles. If these heavy non-relativistic particles feature long-range interactions, the formation of bound states can impact the generation of the baryon asymmetry. We outline the general conditions for when bound states are important for decay and scattering dominated baryogenesis and present the necessary Boltzmann equations for the first time. We demonstrate that bound states can impact baryogenesis in three different ways: They (i) strongly impact abundances of particles sourcing the BAU, (ii) act as a source term of the asymmetry, and (iii) mediate additional washout channels.</description>

      <title>Factorized QED Contribution to Lepton-Hadron DIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first calculation of next-to-leading order (NLO) factorized QED contributions to the short-distance hard coefficients of inclusive lepton-hadron deep inelastic scattering (DIS) in a joint QCD and QED factorization approach. We demonstrate how the joint factorization consistently factorize all perturbative collinear sensitivities of partonic scattering in both QCD and QED into corresponding universal hadron and lepton distribution functions without the need of any parameters other than the standard factorization scale. We discuss the necessary modification to DGLAP-type evolution of the parton and lepton distribution functions in this joint factorization approach. We also discuss the potential impact of this joint factorization approach on the extraction of partonic information from lepton-hadron DIS.</description>

      <title>Towards quantitative precision in functional QCD I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional approaches are the only first principle QCD setup that allow for direct computations at finite density. Predictive power and quantitative reliability of the respective results can only be obtained within a systematic expansion scheme with controlled systematic error estimates. Here we set up such a scheme within the functional renormalisation group (fRG) approach to QCD, aiming for full apparent convergence. In the current work we test this setup, using correlation functions and observables in 2+1 flavour vacuum QCD as a natural benchmark case. While the current work includes many evolutionary improvements collected over the past two decades, we also report on three novel important developments: (i) A comprehensive systematic error analysis based on the modular nature of the fRG approach. (ii) The introduction of a fully automated computational framework, allowing for unprecedented access and improvement of the fRG approach to QCD. (iii) The inclusion of the full effective potential of the chiral order parameter. This also gives access to all-order scattering events of pions and to the full momentum dependence of correlation functions, which is a first application of the automated computational framework (ii). The results compare very well to other state-of-the-art results both from functional approaches and lattice simulations, and provide data on general multi-scattering events of pions and the sigma mode for the first time.</description>

      <title>Hidden Charm Decays of $Y(4626)$ in a $D_{s}^{*+}D_{s1}(2536)^{-}$ Molecular Frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the hidden charm decays properties of $Y(4626)$, where $Y(4626)$ is assigned as a $S-$wave $D_{s}^{*+}D_{s1}(2536)^{-}$ molecular state with $J^{PC}=1^{--}$. The partial widths of the processes $Y(4626)\to J/\psi\eta$, $J/\psi\eta^{\prime}$, $\eta_{c}\phi$, and $ \chi_{cJ}\phi,\ (J=\{0,1,2\})$ are estimated by employing the effective Lagrangian approach. The present estimations indicate that the partial widths of the $J/\psi\eta$ and $J/\psi \eta^\prime$ channels are of the order of 1 MeV, while the one of $\chi_{c1}\phi$ is of the order of 0.1 MeV. Thus, we propose to further examine the molecular interpretation of $Y(4626)$ by searching it in the cross sections for the $e^{+}e^{-}\to J/\psi\eta^{(\prime)}$ processes, which should be accessible by the BES III and Belle II.</description>

      <title>Probing right-handed neutrinos via tri-lepton signals at the HL-LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino oscillation experiments have provided direct evidence for the existence of neutrino masses. The seesaw mechanism explains the smallness of these masses through the introduction of heavy right-handed neutrino (RHN) states. These heavy states can exist at the electroweak scale, approximately in the $\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{GeV})$ range, and can be investigated through current and future collider experiments. This scenario, where other new physics interactions occur at scales much higher than the RHN scale, can be described using an effective field theory (EFT) framework known as $N_R$-EFT. This study focuses on constraining the Wilson coefficients of $N_R$-EFT operators, which primarily contribute to tri-lepton production and missing energy signals at the LHC. We examine both the scenarios where the RHN mass $M_N$ is less than and greater than the $W$ boson mass $M_W$, and provide predictions for the High-Luminosity run of the LHC (HL-LHC).</description>

      <title>Parametrically amplified super-radiance towards hot big bang universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism of preheating stage after inflation, using a new idea of parametrically amplified super-radiance. Highly coherent state, characterized by macro-coherence of scalar field coupled to produced massless particle in pairs, is created by parametric resonance effects associated with field oscillation around its potential minimum, within a Hubble volume. The state is described effectively by the simple Dicke-type of super-radiance model, and super-radiant pulse is emitted within a Hubble time, justifying neglect of cosmic expansion. Produced particles are shown to interact to change their energy and momentum distribution to realize thermal hot big bang universe. A long standing problem of heating after inflation may thus be solved. A new dark matter candidate produced at the emergence of thermalized universe is suggested as well.</description>

      <title>Higgs production at NLL accuracy in the BFKL approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision physics in the Higgs sector has been one of the main challenges of particle physics in the recent years. The pure fixed-order calculations entering the collinear factorization framework, which have been pushed up to next-cube-leading-order, are not able to describe the entire kinematic spectrum. In particular sectors, they have to be necessarily enhanced by all-order resummations. In the so-called semi-hard regime, large energy-type logarithms spoil the perturbative convergence of the series and must be resummed to all orders. This resummation is a core ingredient for a correct description of the inclusive hadroproduction of a forward Higgs boson in the limit of small Bjorken $x$, as well as for a precision study of inclusive forward emissions of a Higgs boson in association with a backward identified object. A complete resummation for these processes can be achieved at the at next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy thanks to the Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov approach. In the present work we present and discuss a series of recent phenomenological results within a partial next-to-leading accuracy. They include the analysis of rapidity and azimuthal-angle differential rates for Higgs plus jet and Higgs plus charm reactions in forward and ultraforward directions of rapidity at the LHC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hadron production in lepton-proton scattering (semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering, SIDIS) probes the structure of hadrons at a higher level of detail than fully inclusive processes. A wealth of SIDIS data is available especially from fixed-target experiments. Here we review our calculation for the NNLO corrections to the full set of polarized and unpolarized SIDIS coefficient functions and present some selected analytical expressions. Our results enable for the first time a fully consistent treatment of hadron fragmentation processes in polarized and unpolarized DIS at NNLO and provide the basis for studies of hadron structure, hadron fragmentation and identified particle cross sections at colliders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present novel predictions for rapidity and transverse-momentum distributions sensitive to the emission of a Higgs boson accompanied by a jet in proton collisions, calculated within the NLO fixed order in QCD and matched with the next-to leading energy-logarithmic accuracy. We also highlight first advancements in the extension of our analysis to the $Z$-boson case. We come out with the message that the improvement of fixed-order calculations on Higgs- and $Z$-boson plus jet distributions is a required step to reach the precision level of the description of observables relevant for Higgs and electroweak physics at current LHC energies and nominal FCC ones.</description>

      <title>Self-interacting axion clouds around rotating black holes in binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superradiant instability can form clouds around rotating black holes (BHs) composed of ultralight bosonic fields, such as axions. A BH with such a cloud in a binary system exhibits rich phenomena, and gravitational waves (GWs) from the BH merger provide a means to probe axions. For the first time, we study the evolution of axion clouds in a binary system during the inspiral phase, including axion self-interaction effects. When the self-interaction is significant, unlike in the negligible case, two types of clouds coexist through mode coupling. We examine the evolution of the system considering the effects of dissipation caused by both self-interaction and tidal interaction. For tidal interaction, in addition to the processes of emission to infinity and absorption by the BH, indirect emission via transitions (both resonant and off-resonant) is also considered as a second-order perturbation. Our results demonstrate that the signatures of axion self-interaction are imprinted in the modification of the GW phase. Furthermore, we find the possibility of a dynamical instability called bosenova during the binary inspiral phase.</description>

      <title>Dark matter cooling during early matter-domination boosts sub-earth halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of an early matter-dominated epoch prior to the big bang nucleosynthesis may lead to a scenario where the thermal dark matter cools faster than plasma before the radiation dominated era begins. In the radiation-dominated epoch, dark matter free-streams after it decouples both chemically and kinetically from the plasma. In the presence of an early matter-dominated era, chemical decoupling of the dark matter may succeed by a partial kinetic decoupling before reheating ends, depending upon the contributions of different partial wave amplitudes in the elastic scattering rate of the dark matter. We show that the s-wave scattering is sufficient to partially decouple the dark matter from the plasma, if the entropy injection during the reheating era depends on the bath temperature, while p-wave scattering leads to full decoupling in such cosmological backdrop. The decoupling of dark matter before the end of reheating causes an additional amount of cooling, reducing its free-streaming horizon compared to usual radiation-dominated cosmology. The enhanced matter perturbations for scales entering the horizon prior to the end of reheating, combined with the reduced free-steaming horizon, increase the number density of sub-earth mass halos. Resulting boost in the dark matter annihilation signatures could offer an intriguing probe to differentiate pre-BBN non-standard cosmological epochs. We show that the free-streaming horizon of the dark matter requires to be smaller than a cut-off to ensure boost in the sub-earth halo populations. As case studies we present two examples: one for a scalar dark matter with s-wave elastic scattering and the other one featuring a fermionic dark matter with p-wave elastic scattering. We identify regions of parameter space in both models where the dark matter kinetically decouples during reheating, amplifying small scale structure formation.</description>

      <title>Lifshitz formulas for finite-density Casimir effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lifshitz formula is well known as a theoretical approach to investigate the Casimir effect at finite temperature. In this Letter, we generalize the Lifshitz formula to the Casimir effect originating from quantum fields at finite chemical potential. To demonstrate the versatility of this formula, we discuss the typical phenomena of the Casimir effect at finite chemical potential in various systems, such as some boundary conditions, finite temperatures, arbitrary spatial dimensions, and mismatched chemical potentials. This formula can be applied to the Casimir effect in dense quark matter and Dirac/Weyl semimetals, where the chemical potential is regarded as a parameter to control the Casimir effect.</description>

      <title>Field mixing in a thermal medium: A quantum master equation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We studied the nonequilibrium dynamics of the indirect mixing of two (pseudo-)scalar fields induced by their couplings to common decay channels in a medium. The effective non-Markovian quantum master equation (QME) for the two fields' reduced density matrix is derived to leading order in the couplings of the two fields with the medium, but to all orders of the couplings among degrees of freedom in the medium. The self-energy and noise-kernel in the QME satisfy a fluctuation-dissipation relation. The solutions show that an initial expectation value (condensate) of one field induces a condensate of the other field through the indirect mixing and that the populations and coherence of the two fields thermalize and approach to non-vanishing values asymptotically. The nearly-degenerate field masses and coupling strengths resonantly enhance the quantum beats and asymptotic coherence, and induce a prominent dynamics of the vacuum after the switch-on of the couplings. We argue that a time-dependent definitions of particles due to the changing vacuum must be introduced so as to obtain results consistent with the calculations of equilibrium states in the asymptotic limit. A coupling strength hierarchy breaks down the resonant enhancement in the nearly-degenerate case but leads to different power countings of the coupling strengths in the magnitudes of the observables and time-scales in the evolution, suggesting the possibility of detecting extremely long-lived particles using prepared short-lived particles within a practical experimental period.</description>

      <title>Multimessenger study of baryon-charged QCD matter in heavy-ion collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimessenger studies of heavy-ion collisions, using hadrons and electromagnetic probes, can reveal the properties of the created QCD matter from different perspectives. This study calculates the thermal dilepton invariant mass spectra and thermal photon transverse momentum spectra in Au+Au collisions at low beam energies from the Beam Energy Scan program, using a (3+1)-dimensional multistage hydrodynamic model calibrated by rapidity-dependent hadronic distributions. The effects of thermodynamic rapidity variation, baryon chemical potential, and fluid expansion on the spectra are explored. Methods for extracting temperature from photon and dilepton spectra are examined by comparison with the underlying hydrodynamic temperature. The possibility of combining photon and dilepton spectra to extract radial flow is also investigated. This study provides insights into measuring the thermodynamic properties of the created systems in heavy-ion collisions using multiple messengers through two fundamental interactions within the same framework.</description>

      <title>Roles of electric field/time-dependent Wilson line in toroidal compactification with or without magnetic fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the effects of electric fields along compact directions within (supersymmetric) gauge theory in $\mathbb{R}^{1,3}\times{\mathbb T}^2 (\times{\mathbb T}^2\times{\mathbb T}^2)$. The electric field along compact directions is equivalent to time-dependent homogeneous configuration of Wilson line moduli, which would be relevant to physics in the early universe. In particular, we consider models with and without background magnetic fluxes, which lead to completely different effects of the electric field due to the difference in the Kaluza-Klein (KK) level structure. We show that, in the case without magnetic fluxes, the deceleration of KK momenta may cause non-perturbative KK particle production dubbed as the KK Schwinger effect, whereas in the case with magnetic flux such KK particle production does not take place but flavor structure of low energy effective theory may be affected.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, interest in quantum computing has significantly increased, driven by its potential advantages over classical techniques. Quantum machine learning (QML) exemplifies one of the important quantum computing applications that are expected to surpass classical machine learning in a wide range of instances. This paper addresses the performance of QML in the context of high-energy physics (HEP). As an example, we focus on the top-quark tagging, for which classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been effective but fall short in accuracy when dealing with highly energetic jet images. In this paper, we use a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) for this task and compare its performance with CNN using a classical noiseless simulator. We compare various setups for the QCNN, varying the convolutional circuit, type of encoding, loss function, and batch sizes. For every quantum setup, we design a similar setup to the corresponding classical model for a fair comparison. Our results indicate that QCNN with proper setups tend to perform better than their CNN counterparts, particularly when the convolution block has a lower number of parameters. This suggests that quantum models, especially with appropriate encodings, can hold potential promise for enhancing performance in HEP tasks such as top quark jet tagging.</description>

      <title>Hints of Entanglement Suppression in Hyperon-Nucleon Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyperon ($Y=\Sigma,\Lambda$)-nucleon ($N=n,p$) interactions are crucial for understanding the existence of neutron stars heavier than two solar masses. Amid renewed experimental efforts, we study $YN$ scatterings from the perspective of quantum information, focusing on whether spin entanglement is suppressed in the s-wave channel, which is observed in $np$ scattering and leads to enhanced global symmetries. Using global fits of phase shifts from experimental data, we find hints of entanglement suppression among the eight flavor channels in the strangeness $S=-1$ sector, similar to the $np$ case. One exception is the $\Sigma^+p$ channel, where conflicting global fits lead to inconclusive outcome. We then propose ''quantum'' observables in $\Sigma^+p$ scattering to help resolve the differing global fits.</description>

      <title>Study of angular observables in exclusive semileptonic $B_c$ decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17114v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate angular observables such as the longitudinal polarization of charged leptons, $\tau$-polarization, and forward-backward asymmetry in semileptonic $B_c$ decays. Additionally, we provide predictions for lepton flavor violating observables, the $\mathcal{R}$ ratios in the decay channels $B_c \rightarrow \eta_c (J/\psi) l \nu_l$ and $B_c \rightarrow D (D^*) l \nu_l$ across the entire $q^2$ region. Our analysis is conducted within the Relativistic Independent Quark Model, focusing on the potential model-dependent aspects of these observables. We compare our model predictions with existing lattice predictions, highlighting the strong applicability of our framework in describing $B_c$ decays. Considering the forthcoming experimental upgrades and the Run 3 data results on $B_c$ meson decays, rapid confirmation of these quantities could indicate significant discoveries of physics beyond the Standard Model. This will open up new avenues for understanding the complex flavor dynamics in heavy meson decays.</description>

Abstract: We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for order-2 $CP$ ($CP2$) symmetry in $N$-Higgs-doublet potentials for $N&gt;2$. The conditions, which are formulated as relations between vectors that transform under the adjoint representation of $\mathsf{SU}(N)$ under a change of doublet basis, are representation theoretical in nature. Making use of Lie algebra and representation theory we devise an efficient, computable algorithm which may be applied to decide whether or not a given numerical potential is $CP2$ invariant.</description>

      <title>High-energy neutrinos flavour composition as a probe of neutrino magnetic moments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrino propagation in the Galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields is considered. We extend an approach developed in \cite{Popov:2019nkr} to describe neutrino flavour and spin oscillations on astrophysical baselines using wave packets. The evolution equations for the neutrino wave packets in a uniform and non-uniform magnetic fields are derived. The analytical expressions for neutrino flavour and spin oscillations probabilities accounting for damping due to the wave packet separation are obtained for the case of a uniform magnetic field. It is shown that terms in the flavour oscillations probabilities that depend on the magnetic field strength are characterized by two coherence lengths. One of the coherence lengths coincides with the coherence length for neutrino oscillations in vacuum, while the second one is proportional to the cube of the average neutrino momentum $p_0^3$. The probabilities of flavour and spin oscillations are calculated numerically for neutrino interacting with the non-uniform Galactic magnetic field. It is shown that oscillations on certain frequencies are suppressed on the Galactic scale due to the neutrino wave packets separation. The flavour compositions of high-energy neutrino flux coming from the Galactic centre and ultra-high energy neutrinos from an extragalactic sourse are calculated accounting for neutrino interaction with the magnetic field and decoherence due to the wave packet separation. It is shown that for neutrino magnetic moments $\sim 10^{-13} \mu_B$ and larger these flavour compositions significantly differ from ones predicted by the vacuum neutrino oscillations scenario.}</description>

      <title>Quarkonium fragmentation in a variable-flavor number scheme: Towards NRFF1.0</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report progress on the determination and study of quarkonium production within the fragmentation approximation. Our analyses address the moderate and large transverse-momentum regime, where the collinear fragmentation of a single parton is expected to dominate over the short-distance production, directly from the hard scattering, of the constituent $(Q \bar{Q})$ system. Parton fragmentation channels to pseudoscalar and vector quarkonia are built on the basis of non-Relativistic QCD next-to-leading computations, which we use to model initial-scale fragmentation inputs. Thus, a preliminary family of Variable-Flavor Number-Scheme (VFNS) fragmentation functions, named NRFF1.0, are constructed through standard DGLAP evolution. Statistical uncertainties are obtained from a Monte Carlo, replica-like approach embodying missing higher-order uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Baryon-number-violating nucleon decays in ALP effective field theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for baryon-number-violating (BNV) nucleon decay is an intriguing probe of new physics beyond the SM in future neutrino experiments with enhanced sensitivity. The dark sector states such as an axion or axion-like particle (ALP) can induce nucleon decays with distinct signature and kinematics from the conventional nucleon decays. In this work, we study the ALP effective field theories (EFTs) with baryon number violation and the impact of light ALP on BNV nucleon decays. We revisit the dimension-8 BNV operators in the extended EFTs with an ALP field $a$ respecting shift symmetry. The low-energy EFT operators with $|\Delta (B-L)|=2$ and $|\Delta (B-L)|=0$ are matched to the baryon chiral perturbation theory. We obtain the effective chiral Lagrangian and the BNV interactions between ALP and baryons/mesons. The ALP interactions lead to two-body baryon decays $B\to \ell~({\rm or}~\nu)~a$ and three-body nucleon decays $N\to M~\ell~({\rm or}~\nu)~a$. We obtain the constraints on the UV scale from the invisible $\Lambda^0$ decay search at BESIII, the invisible neutron decay search at KamLAND and proton decay search at Super-K. We also show the projections of some other baryon/nucleon decays and present the distinct distributions of kinematic observable.</description>

      <title>Jet Tagging with More-Interaction Particle Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce the More-Interaction Particle Transformer (MIParT), a novel deep learning neural network designed for jet tagging. This framework incorporates our own design, the More-Interaction Attention (MIA) mechanism, which increases the dimensionality of particle interaction embeddings. We tested MIParT using the top tagging and quark-gluon datasets. Our results show that MIParT not only matches the accuracy and AUC of LorentzNet and a series of Lorentz-equivariant methods, but also significantly outperforms the ParT model in background rejection. Specifically, it improves background rejection by approximately 25% at a 30% signal efficiency on the top tagging dataset and by 3% on the quark-gluon dataset. Additionally, MIParT requires only 30% of the parameters and 53% of the computational complexity needed by ParT, proving that high performance can be achieved with reduced model complexity. For very large datasets, we double the dimension of particle embeddings, referring to this variant as MIParT-Large (MIParT-L). We find that MIParT-L can further capitalize on the knowledge from large datasets. From a model pre-trained on the 100M JetClass dataset, the background rejection performance of the fine-tuned MIParT-L improved by 39% on the top tagging dataset and by 6% on the quark-gluon dataset, surpassing that of the fine-tuned ParT. Specifically, the background rejection of fine-tuned MIParT-L improved by an additional 2% compared to the fine-tuned ParT. The results suggest that MIParT has the potential to advance efficiency benchmarks for jet tagging and event identification in particle physics.</description>

Abstract: Considering an arbitrary dimensional FLRW universe in the framework of a generalized S\'{a}ez--Ballester (SB) theory, we establish a noncommutative (NC) cosmological model. We concentrate on the predictions of NC model and compare them with their commutative counterparts in both the classical and quantum regimes. For the classic case, taking a very small NC parameter, we apply two different methods to analyze the model features. First, we show through numerical analysis that our NC model is a successful inflationary model capable of overcoming the graceful exit and horizon problems. Furthermore, the NC traces are visible the late time, which supports the UV/IR mixing characteristic of the NC models. In the second method, we show that our NC model can correspond to the previously developed NC inflationary models. In the commutative quantum case, we obtain an exact wave function and then use the WKB approximation to show that the solutions of the corresponding classical regime are recovered. Finally, with regard to the NC quantum level, we focus on the special case for which we show that a constant of motion exists. The latter helps us to conveniently transform the corresponding complicated NC-WDW equation into an ordinary differential equation, which can be easily solved numerically for the general case or analytically for some special cases. The resultant solutions show a damping behavior in the wave function associated with the proposed NC model, which may be important in determining the viable initial states for the very early universe.</description>

Abstract: In recent work, we demonstrated a double-copy relation between inclusive gluon radiation in shock wave collisions of ultrarelativistic nuclei and inclusive graviton radiation in trans-Planckian gravitational shock wave collisions. We compute here the corresponding gravitational shock wave propagators in general relativity and demonstrate that they too obey a double copy relation to gluon shock wave propagators computed previously. These results provide key input in a renormalization group approach towards computing the high frequency radiation spectrum in close black hole encounters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to the Born rule, the probability density in quantum theory is determined by the square of the wave function. A generally accepted derivation of this rule has not yet been proposed. In the given work, a simple physical picture is constructed within which the Born rule arises in a natural way. In the proposed scheme, the interaction of a particle with a measuring apparatus is equivalent to creation of a "mirror image" of particle wave function in the space region of interaction. The observable quantity is the product of the particle wave function and its "image". The phase of the latter is reversed due to Newton's third law, thus leading to the Born rule.</description>
