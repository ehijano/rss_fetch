      <title>Torus feeding and outflow launching in the active nucleus of the Circinus galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Most active galactic nuclei (AGN) are believed to be surrounded by a dusty molecular torus on the parsec scale which is often embedded within a larger circumnuclear disk (CND). AGN are fuelled by the inward transport of material through these structures and can launch multi-phase outflows that influence the host galaxy through AGN feedback. Aims: We use the Circinus Galaxy as a nearby laboratory to investigate the physical mechanisms responsible for feeding the torus and launching a multi-phase outflow in this Seyfert-type AGN, as these mechanisms remain poorly understood. Methods: We analysed observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array of the Circinus nucleus at angular resolutions down to 13 mas (0.25 pc). We traced dust and the ionised outflow using 86-665 GHz continuum emission, and studied the morphology and kinematics of the molecular gas. Results: We find that the Circinus CND hosts molecular and dusty spiral arms, two of which connect directly to the torus. We detect inward mass transport along these structures and argue that the non-axisymmetric potential generated by these arms is the mechanism responsible for fuelling the torus. We estimate a feeding rate of 0.3-7.5 M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, implying that over 88% of the inflowing material is expelled in a multi-phase outflow before reaching the accretion disk. The inferred torus feeding time scale (120 kyr - 2.7 Myr) suggests that variability in AGN activity may be driven by changes in torus feeding. On parsec scales, the ionised outflow is traced by optically thin free-free emission. The outflow is stratified, with a slightly wider opening angle in the molecular phase than in the dusty and ionised components. The ionised outflow is launched or collimated by a warped accretion disk at a radius of r ~ 0.16 pc, and its geometry requires an anisotropic launching mechanism.</description>

      <title>MEGATRON: Reproducing the Diversity of High-Redshift Galaxy Spectra with Cosmological Radiation Hydrodynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the MEGATRON suite of cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations following the formation of Milky Way-mass galaxies from the earliest cosmic epochs when Population III stars form to Cosmic Noon. The suite represents the first set of cosmological simulations that couples a vast non-equilibrium thermochemistry network of primordial species, metals, and molecules to multifrequency, on-the-fly radiation transport, allowing us to directly predict the spectral properties of early galaxies. By initializing the simulations at zero metallicity, resolving haloes well below the atomic cooling threshold, reaching parsec-scale resolution, and modeling a Milky Way-mass environment, we aim to address four key science themes: 1) Star formation at cosmic dawn, 2) Galaxy formation and the interstellar medium in the epoch of reionization, 3) The circumgalactic medium towards cosmic noon, and 4) Reionization in a local volume environment and near-field cosmology. In this introductory work, we present an overview of the physical characteristics of high-redshift MEGATRON galaxies and their environment at $z&gt;8$. We present a library of $&gt;175,000$ simulated galaxy spectra and demonstrate how the diversity of galaxy spectra seen by JWST is naturally reproduced in the context of a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. This project represents a step towards making more direct comparisons between simulations and observations and will enable future work to both optimize methods for inferring galaxy properties from observations and to elucidate the physics that governs galaxy formation in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>A systematic meta-analysis of physical parameters of Galactic supernova remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernova remnants (SNRs) are the aftermath of massive stellar explosions or of a white dwarf in a binary system, representing critical phases in the life cycle of stars and playing an important role in galactic evolution. Physical properties of SNRs such as their shock velocity, density and age are important elements for constraining models for their evolution and understanding the physical processes responsible for their morphological appearance and emission processes. Our study provides, for the first time, a comprehensive statistical analysis of the physical parameters in 64 Galactic SNRs both as a population as well as regions within individual objects. These 64 objects represent the subset of the 310 known Galactic SNRs for which there are published optical data, from which we compiled their physical parameters through an exhaustive literature survey. Through a systematic statistical analysis accounting for uncertainties and/or upper and lower limits in these parameters we obtain distributions of the electron density and shock velocity in the studied SNRs and regions within them. This information is combined with constraints on their age and type. Analysis of electron density and shock velocity distributions for the entire sample of SNRs shows that they are consistent with a log-normal distribution and a skewed log-normal distribution, respectively. Within individual remnants, our study reveals that electron density and shock velocity show larger scatter in younger objects, reflecting the varying conditions of the ambient medium immediately surrounding the explosion epicenter and their impact on SNR evolution. Comparison of the dependence of the shock velocity and density on the supernova age with expectations from theoretical models shows good agreement.</description>

      <title>Resolved Profiles of Stellar Mass, Star Formation Rate, and Predicted CO-to-H$_2$ Conversion Factor Across Thousands of Local Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present radial profiles of surface brightness in UV and IR bands, estimate stellar mass surface density ($\Sigma_\star$) and star formation rate surface density ($\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$), and predict the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor ($\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$) for over 5,000 local galaxies with stellar mass $M_\star\,{\geq}\,10^{9.3}\rm\,M_\odot$. We build these profiles and measure galaxy half-light radii using GALEX and WISE images from the $z$0MGS program, with special care given to highly inclined galaxies. From the UV and IR surface brightness profiles, we estimate $\Sigma_\star$ and $\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$ and use them to predict $\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$ with state-of-the-art empirical prescriptions. We validate our (kpc-scale) $\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$ predictions against observational estimates, finding the best agreement when accounting for CO-dark gas as well as CO emissivity and excitation effects. The CO-dark correction plays a primary role in lower-mass galaxies, whereas CO emissivity and excitation effects become more important in higher-mass and more actively star-forming galaxies, respectively. We compare our estimated $\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$ to observed galaxy-integrated SFR to CO luminosity ratio as a function of $M_\star$. A large compilation of literature data suggests that star-forming galaxies with $M_\star = 10^{9.5{-}11}\,M_\odot$ show strong anti-correlations of SFR/$L^\prime_\mathrm{CO(1{-}0)} \propto M_\star^{-0.29}$ and SFR/$L^\prime_\mathrm{CO(2{-}1)} \propto M_\star^{-0.40}$. The estimated $\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$ trends, when combined with a constant molecular gas depletion time $t_\mathrm{dep}$, can only explain ${\approx}1/3$ of these SFR/$L^\prime_\mathrm{CO}$ trends. This suggests that $t_\mathrm{dep}$ being systematically shorter in lower-mass star-forming galaxies is the main cause of the observed SFR/$L^\prime_\mathrm{CO}$ variations. (Abridged)</description>

      <title>EIGER VIII: First stars signatures in the connection between OI absorption and Galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the association between galaxies and neutral OI absorption systems at z~6, which trace metal-enriched gas during the epoch of reionization. We identify 40 galaxies across six quasar fields, residing in 15 overdensities within 300 kpc of the background sightlines. Five OI absorption systems are associated with five of these overdensities, yielding a covering fraction of $0.27^{+0.13}_{-0.10}$ within 300 kpc. The absorption occurs beyond typical virial radii, indicating that the gas traces extended overdensity environments rather than individual galaxy halos, unlike the z~0 CGM which is largely bound to halos. These galaxy-associated absorbers account for $\sim35\%$ of all OI systems seen in blind quasar surveys, implying the remainder arise in lower-mass galaxies below our detection threshold or in dense neutral IGM pockets. The CGM around these galaxies contains $\gtrsim 2\times10^6~M_{\odot}$ of oxygen, comparable to the ISM oxygen mass of the galaxies themselves, suggesting that the surrounding environment holds as much metal mass as the galaxies. All five galaxy-associated systems show significantly higher $\log(N_{\rm CII}/N_{\rm OI})$ ratios than absorbers lacking galaxy associations. Furthermore, relative abundance ratios ([Si/O], [C/O]) reveal that four of the five exhibit enrichment patterns consistent with Population III nucleosynthesis. These rare systems offer a unique window into the role of first-generation stars in shaping the early metal enrichment of galaxies and their environments.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Radial Gas Flows in the Milky Way Disk Revealed by Large Stellar Age Catalogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disk galaxies like the Milky Way are expected to experience gas flows carrying matter toward their centers. This paper investigates the role of these radial gas flows in models of Galactic chemical evolution (GCE). We follow five different parameterizations of the Galactocentric radial velocity, $v_{r,g}$, of the interstellar medium (ISM). Relative to the $v_{r,g}=0$ limit, all models predict stellar metallicity to decline less significantly with age in the outer disk and more significantly in the inner disk. This outcome arises because radial flows cannot remove gas from one region of the Galaxy without placing it elsewhere, leading to opposing effects on enrichment timescales between the inner and outer Galaxy. This prediction is at odds with recent observational constraints, which indicate remarkably minimal decline in metallicity ($\lesssim$$0.1$ dex) between young ($\sim$$0-2$ Gyr) and old populations ($\sim$$8-10$ Gyr) across the \textit{entire} Galactic disk. Radial gas flows cannot be the sole explanation of this result at all Galactocentric radii. Our models reproduce this result at $R\gtrsim6$ kpc if the flow velocity is relatively constant in both radius and time near $v_{r,g}\approx-1$ km/s. In agreement with previous GCE models, all of our flow prescriptions lead to lower metallicities and steeper radial gradients relative to static models. Exploiting this universal outcome, we identify mixing effects and the relative rates of star formation and metal-poor accretion as the processes that establish the ISM metallicity at low redshift. We provide a suite of analytic formulae describing radial metallicity gradient evolution based on this connection.</description>

      <title>MEGATRON: how the first stars create an iron metallicity plateau in the smallest dwarf galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stellar mass-iron metallicity relation of dwarf galaxies in the new high-resolution MEGATRON cosmological radiation-hydrodynamics simulations. These simulations model galaxy formation up to $z\approx8$ in a region that will collapse into a Milky-Way-like galaxy at $z=0$, while self-consistently tracking Population III and II (Pop.~III, Pop.~II) star formation, feedback and chemical enrichment. MEGATRON dwarf galaxies are in excellent agreement with the observed stellar mass-metallicity relation at $z=0$, including an over-abundance of dwarfs along a flat plateau in metallicity ($\langle [\rm{Fe}/\rm{H}] \rangle \approx -2.5$) at low stellar masses ($M_{\star} \leq 10^5 \, \rm{M}_{\odot}$). We tie this feature to the chemical enrichment of dwarf galaxies by Pop.~III pair-instability supernova (PISN) explosions. The strong Lyman-Werner background (LW) from the protogalaxy ensures that PISNe occur in haloes massive enough ($\approx 10^7\, \rm{M}_{\odot}$) to retain their ejecta. We also predict a tail of $\approx 20\%$ of iron-deficient ($\langle [\rm{Fe}/\rm{H}] \rangle \leq - 3$) dwarf galaxies. We show that both plateau and tail (i) are robust to large variations in Pop.~II feedback assumptions, and (ii) survive in bound satellites surrounding the central galaxy at $z=0$.</description>

      <title>Central Massive Black Holes Are Not Ubiquitous in Local Low-Mass Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The black-hole occupation fraction ($f_\mathrm{occ}$) defines the fraction of galaxies that harbor central massive black holes (MBHs), irrespective of their accretion activity level. While it is widely accepted that $f_\mathrm{occ}$ is nearly 100% in local massive galaxies with stellar masses $M_\star \gtrsim 10^{10}~M_\odot$, it is not yet clear whether MBHs are ubiquitous in less-massive galaxies. In this work, we present new constraints on $f_\mathrm{occ}$ based on over 20 years of Chandra imaging data for 1606 galaxies within 50 Mpc. We employ a Bayesian model to simultaneously constrain $f_\mathrm{occ}$ and the specific accretion-rate distribution function, $p(\lambda)$, where the specific accretion rate is defined as $\lambda=L_\mathrm{X}/M_\star$, and $L_\mathrm{X}$ is the MBH accretion luminosity in the 2-10 keV range. Notably, we find that $p(\lambda)$ peaks around $10^{28}~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}~M_\odot^{-1}$; above this value, $p(\lambda)$ decreases with increasing $\lambda$, following a power-law that smoothly connects with the probability distribution of bona-fide active galactic nuclei. We also find that the occupation fraction decreases dramatically with decreasing $M_\star$: in high mass galaxies ($M_\star \approx 10^{11-12}M_\odot$), the occupation fraction is $&gt;93\%$ (a $2\sigma$ lower limit), and then declines to $66_{-7}^{+8}\%$ ($1\sigma$ errors) between $M_\star\approx10^{9-10}M_\odot$, and to $33_{-9}^{+13}\%$ in the dwarf galaxy regime between $M_\star\approx10^{8-9}~M_\odot$. Our results have significant implications for the normalization of the MBH mass function over the mass range most relevant for tidal disruption events, extreme mass ratio inspirals, and MBH merger rates that upcoming facilities are poised to explore.</description>

      <title>Self-interacting dark matter in the center of a Local Group dwarf galaxy and its satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed comparison of a Local Group dwarf galaxy analogue evolved in two cosmological models: the standard $\Lambda$CDM and a self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) model with a velocity-dependent cross-section. Both simulations are run with the high-resolution, hydrodynamical LYRA galaxy formation model, allowing us to explore the global and substructure properties of the dwarf in a consistent context. While the overall halo growth, final mass, and subhalo mass functions remain largely unchanged across models, SIDM produces a central dark matter core extending to $\sim$1 kpc, which does not significantly vary with the inclusion of baryons. Baryonic properties, however, differ notably. The SIDM model leads to a 25% reduction in stellar mass and retains more gas within the stellar half-mass radius due to a prolonged quiescent phase in star formation. The stellar distribution is less centrally concentrated, and a population of in-situ star clusters form at late times. Substructure analysis reveals fewer luminous satellites and more stellar-only systems in SIDM, driven in part by tidal stripping that affects the dark matter more than the stars. A subset of satellites undergoes tidal-triggered core collapse after infall, enhancing the diversity of SIDM satellite rotation curves. These differences offer potential observational signatures of SIDM in low-mass galaxies.</description>

      <title>Ionization Sources of the Local Interstellar Clouds: Two B-stars, Three White Dwarfs, and the Local Hot Bubble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dominant sources of photoionizing radiation in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) incident on the exterior of the local interstellar clouds include two nearby early B-type stars, $\epsilon$ CMa ($124\pm2$ pc) and $\beta$ CMa ($151\pm5$ pc), three hot dwarfs, and the local hot bubble (LHB). Line emission (170-912A) from highly ionized metals (Fe, Ne, Mg) in million-degree LHB plasma may be responsible for the elevated ionization fractions of helium ($n_{\rm HeII}/n_{\rm He} \approx 0.4$) compared to hydrogen ($n_{\rm HII} / n_{\rm H} \approx 0.2$) in the local clouds. We update the stellar parameters and ionizing flux for $\beta$ CMa, after correcting the EUV spectra for intervening HI column density, $N_{\rm HI} = 1.9\pm0.1\times10^{18}~{\rm cm}^{-2}$, and its hotter effective temperature, $T_{\rm eff} \approx 25,000$K vs. 21,000K for $\epsilon$ CMa. These two stars produce a combined H-ionizing photon flux $\Phi_{\rm H} \approx 6800\pm1400$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ at the external surface of the local clouds. The hot bubble could produce comparable fluxes, $\Phi_{\rm H} =$ 2000-9000 cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, depending on the amount of metal depletion into dust grains that survive sputtering. The radial velocities and proper motions of $\beta$ CMa and $\epsilon$ CMa indicate that both stars passed within $10\pm1$ pc of the Sun $4.4\pm0.1$ Myr ago, with 100-200 times higher local ionizing fluxes. At that time, the local clouds were likely farther from the Sun, owing to their transverse motion. Over the last few Myr, EUV radiation from these two stars left a wake of highly ionized gas in a hot, low-density cavity produced by past supernova explosions in the Sco-Cen OB association and connected with the LHB.</description>

      <title>Galaxy sizes and compactness at Cosmic Dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope has found an unexpected population of high-mass galaxies ($\log (M^\star / {\rm M} _\odot) \gtrsim 10$) with extremely small effective radii ($\sim 100\,\rm pc$) at $z \gtrsim 6$. Also, the existence of an unusual size--mass relation has been claimed. These observations are only partially reproduced by current models, and the physics responsible for the observed relations is still under debate. We expect to unveil the formation channels of the observed compact galaxies. We analyse 7605 snapshots for 169 galaxies of the state-of-the-art cosmological simulation suite FirstLight.
  We find that galaxies undergo an expansion--compaction--re-expansion process. This process operates in a specific mass range; compaction starts at $\log (M^\star_ {\rm on} / {\rm M}_\odot) \sim 8.5$ and ends at $\log (M^\star_{\rm off} / \mathrm{M}_\odot) \sim 9.5$. In between these masses, the size--mass relation becomes inverted, with a negative slope. The physical mechanism driving this process in our simulations involves a self-reinforced inflow of gas from the outer regions, that triggers a strong, localised starburst at the centre (within $1\, {\rm kpc}$). This contraction continues until conditions favour star formation in a broader area, and the normal inside-out growth pattern resumes. We present evidence for the existence of a universal wet compaction operating at Cosmic Dawn. This mechanism is driven by spherical accretion triggered by the change of the state of the central matter of galaxies, from dark matter- to baryon-dominated. We also propose an analytical expression for the infall process, suitable for use in semi-analytic models. Contrary to low-redshift galaxies, in high-redshift systems compaction ends without gas depletion and star-formation quenching.</description>

      <title>ILLUSTRating red nugget assembly through observations and simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of massive and compact early-type galaxies provide important constraints on early galaxy formation. Among these, massive relic galaxies, characterized by old stellar populations and minimal late-time accretion, are considered preserved compact galaxies from the high-$z$ Universe. We investigate compact and massive galaxies (CMGs) using the TNG50 cosmological simulation, applying uniform selection criteria matching observational surveys at $z=0$, $z=0.3$, and $z=0.7$, enabling direct comparisons with observed compact galaxies. CMGs are classified according to their stellar mass assembly histories to examine how compactness relates to dynamical properties and chemical enrichment across cosmic time. Our results show that simulated CMGs follow the observed mass-size relation, with the number of objects increasing at higher redshifts, in line with observational trends. Dynamically, while observations suggest relic galaxies are outliers in the stellar mass-velocity dispersion plane, simulated compacts show relatively uniform velocity dispersions across different accretion histories. Observed relics are more metal-rich than other compact galaxies with extended star formation, deviating from the local mass-metallicity relation. In contrast, simulated CMGs are overall more metal-rich than the quiescent population, regardless of accretion history. The deviation from the mass-metallicity relation decreases with redshift. These results suggest that the extreme characteristics of CMGs in TNG50, particularly in metallicity and dynamics, are less pronounced than in observed relics. Nonetheless, these results offer a theoretical framework to assess the properties of such extreme objects from different epochs, highlighting both alignment with and deviations between the models.</description>

      <title>Declining metallicity and extended HeII in the outflow of an epoch of reionization analogue galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present VLT/X-shooter spectroscopy of the extremely metal-poor starburst galaxy SBS 0335-052E, a nearby (D $\sim$54 Mpc) analog of high-redshift systems, probing its outflow up to a distance of $\sim$2.6 kpc. Using direct-method oxygen abundances, we find a complex metallicity profile that generally declines with distance, decreasing by 0.37 dex from the galaxy center out to 2.4 kpc into the outflow. This implies a metal-loading factor roughly an order of magnitude lower than predictions based on the mass-metallicity relation for low-mass galaxies. We also detect extended HeII emission, including a broad, redshifted component beyond 2 kpc, distinct from narrow emission associated with star clusters. No H$\beta$ emission is detected associated with the broad redshifted component, implying extremely high HeII/H$\beta$ ratios (0.7--4.8). Such extreme values, combined with the decreasing metallicity, challenge current models for stellar feedback. The contribution of an intermediate-mass black hole could simultaneously account for the declining metallicity and the unusually extended HeII emission.</description>

      <title>The Prevalence of Bursty Star Formation in Low-Mass Galaxies at z=1-7 from H{\alpha}-to-UV Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of bursty star-formation histories (SFHs) of 346 star-forming galaxies at $1\lesssim z&lt;7$, selected from JWST/NIRSpec G395M and PRISM spectroscopy provided by the CEERS and RUBIES surveys. We analyze the correlation of star-formation rate vs. stellar mass (the star-forming main sequence, SFMS) for our sample and find no significant difference between the intrinsic scatter in the H$\alpha$-based SFMS and the UV-continuum-based SFMS. However, the diagnostic power of the SFMS is limited at high redshift and low stellar mass due to observational biases that exclude faint, quenched galaxies. To more directly probe star-formation variability, we examine the dust-corrected H$\alpha$-to-UV ratio, which is assumed to trace deviations a from constant SFH over the past $\sim100$ Myr. In our sample, $73^{+4}_{-4}$% of galaxies exhibit H$\alpha$-to-UV ratios inconsistent with a constant SFH. We do not observe any statistically significant evolution in the H$\alpha$-to-UV ratio with redshift. Additionally, lower-mass galaxies ($7\leq\text{log}(M_*/M_{\odot})&lt;8.5$) are $30 \pm 1$% more likely to lie above this equilibrium range -- indicative of a recent ($\lesssim 100$ Myr) burst of star formation -- compared to higher-mass systems ($8.5\leq\text{log}(M_*/M_{\odot})\leq10.9$). These results suggest that bursty SFHs are more common in low-mass galaxies at $z\sim 1$-$7$ and that this remains relatively stable across $\sim0.8$-$6$ Gyr after the Big Bang.</description>

      <title>Monitoring of 3C 286 with ALMA, IRAM, and SMA from 2006 to 2025: Stability, Synchrotron Ages, and Frequency-Dependent Polarization Attributed to Core-Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of multi-frequency monitoring of the radio quasar 3C 286, conducted using three instruments: ALMA at 91.5, 103.5, 233.0, and 343.4 GHz, the IRAM 30-m Telescope at 86 and 229 GHz, and SMA at 225 GHz. The IRAM measurements from 2006 to 2024 show that the total flux of 3C 286 is stable within measurement uncertainties, indicating long-term stability up to 229 GHz, when applying a fixed Kelvin-to-Jansky conversion factor throughout its dataset. ALMA data from 2018 to 2024 exhibit a decrease in flux, which up to 4% could be attributed to an apparent increase in the absolute brightness of Uranus, the primary flux calibrator for ALMA with the ESA4 model. Taken together, these results suggest that the intrinsic total flux of 3C 286 has remained stable up to 229 GHz over the monitoring period. The polarization properties of 3C 286 are stable across all observing frequencies. The electric vector position angle (EVPA) gradually rotates as a function of wavelength squared, which is well described by a single power-law over the full frequency range. We therefore propose using the theoretical EVPA values from this model curve for absolute EVPA calibration between 5 and 343.4 GHz. The Faraday rotation measure increases as a function of frequency up to (3.2+/-1.5)x10^4 rad m^-2, following RM proportional to nu^alpha with alpha = 2.05+/-0.06. This trend is consistent with the core-shift effect expected in a conical jet.</description>

      <title>On the Formation of GW231123 in Population III Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GW231123 is a binary black hole merger whose primary component lies within or above the pair-instability mass gap, while the secondary component falls within this gap. The standard theory of stellar evolution is significantly challenged by this event. We investigate the formation of candidate progenitors of GW231123 in Population III (Pop3) star clusters. We find that they could form through stellar mergers, binary black hole mergers, and mixed mergers. The mass distribution of these candidate progenitors covers the component masses of GW231123. Their predicted merger rate density spans the range of $0.001{\rm Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}-0.26{\rm Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$, encompassing that of GW231123. These findings suggest that GW231123 may originate from Pop3 star clusters. Furthermore, such candidate progenitors are expected to be detectable by future gravitational wave detectors LISA/Taiji/TianQin/DECIGO/CE/ET, which would provide valuable insights into the formation scenarios of events like GW231123.</description>

      <title>MEGATRON: the impact of non-equilibrium effects and local radiation fields on the circumgalactic medium at cosmic noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present three cosmological radiation-hydrodynamic zoom simulations of the progenitor of a Milky Way-mass galaxy from the MEGATRON suite. The simulations combine on-the-fly radiative transfer with a detailed non-equilibrium thermochemical network (81 ions and molecules), resolving the cold and warm gas in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) on spatial scales down to 20 pc and on average 200 pc at cosmic noon. Comparing our full non-equilibrium calculation with local radiation to traditional post-processed photoionization equilibrium (PIE) models assuming a uniform UV background (UVB), we find that non-equilibrium physics and local radiation fields fundamentally impact the thermochemistry of the CGM. Recombination lags and local radiation anisotropy shift ions away from their PIE+UVB values and modify covering fractions (for example, HI damped Ly$\alpha$ absorbers differ by up to 40%). In addition, a resolution study with cooling-length refinement allows us to double the resolution in the cold and warm CGM gas, reaching 120 pc on average. When refining on cooling length, the mass of the lightest cold clumps decreases tenfold to $\approx 10^4\,M_\odot$, their boundary layers develop sharper ion stratification, and the warm gas is better resolved, boosting the abundance of warm gas tracers such as CIV and OIII. Together, these results demonstrate that non-equilibrium thermochemistry coupled to radiative transfer, combined with physically motivated resolution criteria, is essential to predict circumgalactic absorption and emission signatures and to guide the design of targeted observations with existing and upcoming facilities.</description>

      <title>Constraints on dark matter models from the stellar cores observed in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies: Self-interacting dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been proposed that the stellar cores observed in ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies reflect underlying dark matter (DM) cores that cannot be formed by stellar feedback acting on collisionless cold dark matter (CDM) halos. Assuming this claim is correct, we investigate the constraints that arise if such cores are produced by self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). We derive the range of SIDM cross-sections (sigma/m) required to reproduce the observed core sizes. These can result from halos in either the core-formation phase (low sigma/m) or the core-collapse phase (high sigma/m), yielding a wide allowed range (sim 0.3 -- 200 cm2/g) consistent with values reported in the literature for more massive galaxies. We also construct a simple model relating stellar mass to core radius - two observables likely connected in SIDM. This model reproduces the stellar core sizes and masses in UFDs with sigma/m consistent with those derived above. It also predicts a trend of increasing core radius with stellar mass, in agreement with observations of more massive dwarf galaxies. The model central DM densities match observations when assuming the SIDM profile to originate from an initial CDM halo that follows the mass-concentration relation. Since stellar feedback is insufficient to form cores in these galaxies, UFDs unbiasedly anchor sigma/m at low velocities. If the core-collapse scenario holds (i.e., high sigma/m), UFD halos are thermalized on kpc scales, approximately two orders of magnitude larger than the stellar cores. These large thermalization scales could potentially influence substructure formation in more massive systems.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of Star Formation Rates by Different Tracers in Nearby Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We utilize a large sample of $\sim$113,000 galaxies ($z &lt; 0.3$) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey with high-quality data to compare star formation rates (SFRs) across multiple diagnostic methods and examine their connection to Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) strength, indicated by Eddington ratio. Our sample encompassed star-forming (SF), composite, Seyfert, and LINER galaxies. Our analysis utilizes various SFRs indicators, including observed infrared flux ($\rm SFR_{FIR}$) from AKARI/Herschel ($\sim$4,100 sources), the MPA-JHU catalog ($\rm SFR_{Dn4000}$), the ANN catalog ($\rm SFR_{ANN}$), the GSWLC catalog ($\rm SFR_{SED}$ and $\rm SFR_{MIR}$), as well as \OII\ and \Ha\ emission lines ($\rm SFR_{[OII]}$ and $\rm SFR_{H\alpha}$). Within SF galaxies, SFRs measurements from different tracers exhibited differences, with offsets and scatter below 0.26 dex and 0.29 dex, respectively. Moreover, non-SF galaxies (composite, Seyfert, and LINER) displayed discrepancies among SFR tracers, particularly for LINER galaxies, with offsets below 0.86 dex and a scatter of 0.57 dex. Additionally, our findings revealed robust correlations between SFRs and specific SFRs (sSFRs) with Eddington ratios. Eddington ratio exhibited gradual transitions in the (s)SFRs-stellar mass diagrams. Galaxies with high Eddington ratios displayed high star formation activity, similar to blue SF galaxies. Furthermore, we observed decreasing sSFR trends from SF galaxies to composite, Seyfert, and LINER galaxies. Our results may provide insight into our understanding of (s)SFRs traced by different approaches and their connection to AGN activities.</description>

      <title>The effect of extended radio emission on SMBH accretion rate estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accretion rates in radio galaxies are typically estimated from optical and total radio flux measurements, incorporating emission from the core, jets, and lobes. These estimates can be used to investigate the link between observed Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) emission properties and the underlying accretion physics of their Super-Massive Black Holes (SMBHs). However, while optical and core radio emission trace the ongoing accretion episode, extended jet and lobe structures may result from past AGN activity. Therefore, accretion rates inferred from spatially unresolved radio observations may be systematically overestimated, a bias whose prevalence and extent have yet to be thoroughly explored. In this study, using a sample of 121 local radio-loud galaxies with spatially resolved radio components, we assess this effect by estimating their \textit{Eddington}-scaled accretion rates ($\lambda$) using both the common methodology which considers total radio fluxes and a simple but novel approach that treats core and extended emission as signatures of distinct accretion phases. Our results show that the former method systematically overestimates the $\lambda$ by a factor of $\sim 3$, affecting the accretion mode classification in approximately $11\%$ of sources. This discrepancy appears to correlate with radio size, with the most extended galaxies indicating a transition in accretion disk mode. Such a bias could affect AGN classification in unresolved high-redshift radio surveys. Our results motivate re-examining accretion rate calculations from AGN radio surveys and align with the AGN unification model for radio galaxies, revealing a clearer link between accretion disk physics and optical spectral properties.</description>

      <title>Accretion, Jets, and Recoil in Merging Supermassive Binary Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulation that captures the full, self-consistent evolution from the late inspiral through merger and subsequent recoil of a supermassive binary black hole (SMBBH) with misaligned spins embedded in an equilibrated circumbinary disk (CBD). Our full numerical simulation follows the final 40 orbits of the inspiral and merger of the binary, following an initial phase of 165 orbits of CBD evolution toward equilibrium. We find that the jets, launched from the minidisks surrounding each black hole, are tilted toward the black hole spin direction close to the individual black holes, but align with the binary's total angular momentum at larger distances. Following the merger, the remnant black hole receives a recoil kick exceeding 1000 km/s. Remarkably, it retains its gravitationally bound CBD as if it were ejected from a galactic nucleus. Furthermore, the jet launched by the recoiling remnant black hole preserves the large-scale orientation established during the late inspiral. We demonstrate that the majority of the luminosity emerges from a region in close proximity to the black hole, suggesting that the accretion disk surrounding the recoiling remnant would remain the most luminous feature postmerger, persisting for long enough to be observable by modern telescopes (hours in the case of LISA sources). These findings introduce a direct, first-principles model for the recoil of supermassive black holes (SMBH) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), offering a comprehensive theoretical basis to support and elucidate both ongoing and future observational efforts.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Fields in the Bones of the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars primarily form in galactic spiral arms within dense, filamentary molecular clouds. The largest and most elongated of these molecular clouds are referred to as ``bones," which are massive, velocity-coherent filaments (lengths ~20 to &gt;100 pc, widths ~1-2 pc) that run approximately parallel and in close proximity to the Galactic plane. While these bones have been generally well characterized, the importance and structure of their magnetic fields (B-fields) remain largely unconstrained. Through the SOFIA Legacy program FIELDMAPS, we mapped the B-fields of 10 bones in the Milky Way. We found that their B-fields are varied, with no single preferred alignment along the entire spine of the bones. At higher column densities, the spines of the bones are more likely to align perpendicularly to the B-fields, although this is not ubiquitous, and the alignment shows no strong correlation with the locations of identified young stellar objects. We estimated the B-field strengths across the bones and found them to be ~30-150 $\mu$G at pc scales. Despite the generally low virial parameters, the B-fields are strong compared to the local gravity, suggesting that B-fields play a significant role in resisting global collapse. Moreover, the B-fields may slow and guide gas flow during dissipation. Recent star formation within the bones may be due to high-density pockets at smaller scales, which could have formed before or simultaneously with the bones.</description>

      <title>Mass loading of outflows from evolving Young Massive Clusters</title>

Abstract: Feedback from Young Massive Clusters (YMCs) is an important driver of galaxy evolution. In the first few Myr, mechanical feedback is dominated by collective effects of the massive stellar winds in the YMC. The mass-loss rates and terminal wind velocities of these stars change by orders of magnitude over pre-SN timescales as the massive stars evolve, and mass-loss rates of Cool Supergiant (CSG) stars in particular are uncertain by a factor $\sim~20$ or more. In this work we perform a first study of the time evolution of average cluster wind velocity $\bar{V}_{\mathrm{cl}}$ as a function of stellar metallicity $Z$, assuming single star evolution. We also check the validity of assuming Wolf-Rayet stars dominate the feedback effects of a YMC, as often done when interpreting X-ray and $\gamma$-ray observations, and test how sensitive $\bar{V}_{\mathrm{cl}}$ is to current uncertainties in mass-loss rates. We use pySTARBURST99 to calculate integrated properties of YMCs for $Z$ in the range of $0.0004-0.02$, representing a range of environments from IZw18 to the Galactic Centre. We find that $\bar{V}_{\mathrm{cl}}$ drops off rapidly for sub-LMC $Z$, and we recommend a value of $500-1000\,~\textrm{km~s}^{-1}$ be used in this regime. We show accounting only for WR stars can overestimate $\bar{V}_{\mathrm{cl}}$ by $500-2000\,~\textrm{km~s}^{-1}$ at $Z \geq Z_\text{LMC}$. We also find that different RSG mass-loss assumptions can change the inferred $\bar{V}_{\mathrm{cl}}$ by $\sim1000\,~\textrm{km~s}^{-1}$, highlighting the need for improved observational constraints for RSGs in YMCs.</description>

      <title>Resolving Star Cluster Formation in Galaxy Simulations with Cosmic Ray Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star clusters host the massive stars responsible for feedback in star-forming galaxies. Stellar feedback shapes the interstellar medium (ISM), affecting the formation of future star clusters. To self-consistently capture the interplay between feedback and star formation, a model must resolve the parsec-scale star formation sites and the multiphase ISM. Additionally, the dynamical impact of cosmic rays (CRs) on star formation rates (SFRs) must also be considered. We present the first simulations of the formation of an ensemble of star clusters with dynamically-coupled CRs, near-individual star particles, and a feedback-regulated ISM. We analyze tallbox simulations performed using the CRISP model in the moving-mesh code AREPO. We apply varied implementations of CR transport under the theory of self-confinement. We find that CRs simultaneously reduce the SFR, the power law slope of the cluster mass function, and the cluster formation efficiency. Each simulation is compatible with observations, and CR feedback tends to move results along observed star cluster relations. We see only modest changes in cluster radius and velocity dispersions, but significant differences in the virial parameters. Ultimately, the primary impact of CRs is to reduce SFRs. Lower SFRs imply fewer supernovae, and consequently a lower turbulent energy budget for gas. Star clusters formed in a CR-regulated ISM have lower velocity dispersions, and are therefore more bound under self-gravity. The effective clustering of SNe is unchanged by CRs. Through this work, we demonstrate the predictive power of the CRISP feedback model, despite this idealized setup.</description>

      <title>PDRs4All XIX. The 6 to 9 $\mu$m region as a probe of PAH charge and size in the Orion Bar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) play a major role in determining the charge balance of their host environments that include photo-dissociation regions (PDRs) in galaxies, planetary nebulae, and rims of molecular clouds. We aim to investigate the distribution and sizes of charged PAHs across the key zones of the Orion Bar PDR. We employ JWST MIRI-MRS observations of the Orion Bar from the Early Release Science program ''PDRs4All'' and synthetic images in the JWST MIRI filters. We investigate the spatial morphology of the AIBs at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.0 $\mu$m that commonly trace PAH cations, and the neutral PAH-tracing 11.2 $\mu$m AIB, their (relative) correlations, and the relationship with existing empirical prescriptions for AIBs. The 6.2. 7.7, 8.6, 11.0, and 11.2 $\mu$m AIBs are similar in spatial morphology, on larger scales. Analyzing three-feature intensity correlations, two distinct groups emerge: the 8.6 and 11.0 $\mu$m vs. the 6.2 and 7.7 $\mu$m AIBs. We attribute these correlations to PAH size. The 6.2 and 7.7 $\mu$m AIBs trace cationic, medium-sized PAHs. Quantum chemical calculations reveal that the 8.6 $\mu$m AIB is carried by large, compact, cationic PAHs, and the 11.0 $\mu$m AIB's correlation to it implies, so is this band. The 6.2/8.6 and 7.7/8.6 PAH band ratios thus probe PAH size. We conclude that the 6.2/11.2 AIB ratio is the most reliable proxy for charged PAHs, within the cohort. We outline JWST MIRI imaging prescriptions that serve as effective tracers of the PAH ionization fraction as traced. This study showcases the efficacy of the 6-9 $\mu$m AIBs to probe the charge state and size distribution of the emitting PAHs, offering insights into the physical conditions of their host environments. JWST MIRI photometry offers a viable alternative to IFU spectroscopy for characterizing this emission in extended objects.</description>

      <title>The Cosmic Infrared Background Experiment-2: An Intensity Mapping Optimized Sounding-rocket Payload to Understand the Near-IR Extragalactic Background Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The background light produced by emission from all sources over cosmic history is a powerful diagnostic of structure formation and evolution. At near-infrared wavelengths, this extragalactic background light (EBL) is comprised of emission from galaxies stretching all the way back to the first-light objects present during the Epoch of Reionization. The Cosmic Infrared Background Experiment 2 (CIBER-2) is a sounding-rocket experiment designed to measure both the absolute photometric brightness of the EBL over 0.5 - 2.0 microns and perform an intensity mapping measurement of EBL spatial fluctuations in six broad bands over the same wavelength range. CIBER-2 comprises a 28.5 cm, 80K telescope that images several square degrees to three separate cameras. Each camera is equipped with an HAWAII-2RG detector covered by an assembly that combines two broadband filters and a linear-variable filter, which perform the intensity mapping and absolute photometric measurements, respectively. CIBER-2 has flown three times: an engineering flight in 2021; a terminated launch in 2023; and a successful science flight in 2024. In this paper, we review the science case for the experiment; describe the factors motivating the instrument design; review the optical, mechanical, and electronic implementation of the instrument; present preflight laboratory characterization measurements; and finally assess the instrument's performance in flight.</description>

      <title>Interpreting anomaly detection of SDSS spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing use of ML in astronomy introduces important questions about interpretability. Due to their complexity and non-linear nature, it can be challenging to understand their decision-making process. While these models can effectively identify unusual spectra, interpreting the physical nature of the flagged outliers remains a major challenge. We aim to bridge the gap between anomaly detection and physical understanding by combining deep learning with interpretable ML (iML) techniques to identify and explain anomalous galaxy spectra from SDSS data. We present a flexible framework that uses a variational autoencoder to compute multiple anomaly scores, including physically-motivated variants of the mean squared error. We adapt the iML LIME algorithm to spectroscopic data, systematically explore segmentation and perturbation strategies, and compute explanation weights that identify the features most responsible for each detection. To uncover population-level trends, we normalize the LIME weights and apply clustering to the top 1\% most anomalous spectra. Our approach successfully separates instrumental artifacts from physically meaningful outliers and groups anomalous spectra into astrophysically coherent categories. These include dusty, metal-rich starbursts; chemically-enriched H\,II regions with moderate excitation; and extreme emission-line galaxies with low metallicity and hard ionizing spectra. The explanation weights align with established emission-line diagnostics, enabling a physically-grounded taxonomy of spectroscopic anomalies. Our work shows that interpretable anomaly detection provides a scalable, transparent, and physically meaningful approach to exploring large spectroscopic datasets. Our framework opens the door for incorporating interpretability tools into quality control, follow-up targeting, and discovery pipelines in current and future surveys.</description>

      <title>Resurging from the ashes: A spectral study of seven candidate revived radio fossils in nearby low-mass galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex energy transfer processes in the intracluster medium (ICM) can revive fossil (with spectral ages $\gg100$ Myr) plasma initially generated by radio galaxies. This leads to the re-ignition of faint radio sources with irregular and filamentary morphologies, and ultra-steep ($\alpha \gtrsim 1.5$) synchrotron spectra, which can be more easily detected at low frequencies ($\sim 100$ MHz). These sources offer the opportunity to investigate the microphysics of the ICM and its interplay with radio galaxies, the origin of seed relativistic electrons, the merging history of the host cluster, and the phenomenology of radio filaments. The study of revived sources has so far been hampered by the requirement of sensitive and high-resolution multi-frequency radio data at low frequencies to characterise their spatial properties and provide a proper classification. We aim to perform the analysis of a sample of candidate revived sources identified among nearby ($z\leq0.35$) and low-mass ($M_{500}\leq5\times 10^{14} M_\odot$) \textit{Planck} clusters in the footprint of LoTSS-DR2. By inspecting LoTSS-DR2 images at 144 MHz, we identified 7 targets with patchy and filamentary morphologies, which have been followed-up with the uGMRT at 400 MHz. By combining LOFAR and uGMRT data, we obtained high-resolution images and spectral index maps, which we used to interpret the nature of the sources. All targets show regions with very steep spectra, confirming the effectiveness of our morphology-based selection in identifying fossil plasma. Based on their morphology, spectral properties, and optical associations, we investigated the origin of the targets. We found a variety of promising revived fossil sources, while also showing that apparently intricate structures can be easily misclassified in the absence of high-resolution and multi-band data.</description>

      <title>Abundance Pattern Fitting with Bayesian Inference: Constraining First Stars' Properties and Their Explosion Mechanism with Extremely Metal-poor Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The abundance patterns of extremely metal-poor stars preserve a fossil record of the Universe's earliest chemical enrichment by the supernova explosions from the evolution of first generation of stars, also referred to as Population III (or Pop III). By applying Bayesian inference to the analysis of abundance patterns of these ancient stars, this study presents a systematic investigation into the properties and explosion mechanism of Pop III stars. We apply NLTE corrections to enhance the reliability of abundance measurements, which significantly reduces the discrepancies in abundances between observations and theoretical yields for odd-Z elements, such as Na and Al. Our Bayesian framework also enables the incorporation of explodability and effectively mitigates biases introduced by varying resolutions across different supernova model grids. In addition to confirming a top-heavy ($\alpha=0.54$) initial mass function for massive Pop III stars, we derive a robust mass--energy relation ($E\propto M^2$) of the first supernovae. These findings demonstrate that stellar abundance analysis provides a powerful and independent approach for probing early supernova physics and the fundamental nature of the first stars.</description>

      <title>Transverse Velocities in Real-Time Cosmology: Position Drift in Relativistic N-Body Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The era of real-time cosmology has begun. It is now possible to directly measure the apparent drift of high-redshift astronomical sources across the sky $\textit{in real time}$. This so-called $\textit{position drift}$ provides a valuable probe of the peculiar velocity field and cosmic structure formation by giving direct access to the transverse velocity that is otherwise currently not measurable and must be statistically reconstructed from the density field in a model-dependent way. To fully exploit this new window into the Universe, it is essential to understand how cosmological structures affect position drift measurements. Here we present the first position drift study based on the general relativistic N-body simulation code $\texttt{gevolution}$. We calculate the position drift directly from the past light cone for ten different observers and compare the results to predictions from linear perturbation theory. At linear order, the position drift is directly proportional to the transverse velocity on the sky. This linear approximation reproduces our non-linear simulation results to within about 5%. We calculate power spectra for the position drift, splitting the signal into an E- and B-mode and compare the former to linear expectations, finding good agreement. The B-mode is suppressed on linear scales, but has similar amplitude as the E-mode on non-linear scales. We further demonstrate that light-cone inhomogeneities induce biases in the dipole of the drift, introducing redshift dependence of both the amplitude and direction. Although our analysis is not yet sufficient for a firm conclusion, our results suggest that these effects alone cannot explain the possible redshift-dependent dipole in Gaia DR3 data reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>Multiprobe constraints on early and late time dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a multiprobe analysis combining cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), ACT CMB lensing, and large-scale structure (LSS) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), including DESI Legacy Imaging Survey (LS) galaxies and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs). We present the first $5\times2$pt analysis of ACT DR6 lensing, DESI LS, and Planck ISW. Within $\Lambda$CDM, this yields $S_8 = \sigma_8(\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5} = 0.819 \pm 0.016$, in good agreement with primary CMB inferences and provides a sound-horizon-free Hubble constant constraint of $H_0 = 70.0 \pm 4.4$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Then, combining with CMB primary and BAO, we reconfirm a CMB-BAO discrepancy in the $\Omega_m$-$\frac{D_v}{r_d}$ plane, which is heightened when combining BAO with the $5\times2$pt data vector. We explore two dark-energy extensions that may reconcile this: an early-time modification, early dark energy (EDE), and late-time dynamical dark energy (DDE) parameterized by $w_0w_a$. For CMB primary+BAO+$5\times2$pt, we find a $3.3\sigma$ preference for DDE over $\Lambda$CDM, while EDE is modestly favoured at $2.3\sigma$. The models address different shortcomings of $\Lambda$CDM: DDE relaxes the neutrino mass bound ($M_\nu&lt;0.17$eV vs. $&lt;0.050$eV under $\Lambda$CDM), making it compatible with neutrino oscillation measurements, while EDE raises the Hubble constant to $H_0=70.5\pm1.2\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, easing the discrepancy with SH0ES. However, neither model resolves both issues simultaneously. Our analysis indicates that both DDE and EDE remain viable extensions of $\Lambda$CDM within current uncertainties and demonstrates the capacity of combined probes to place increasingly stringent constraints on cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>Euclid: Galaxy morphology and photometry from bulge-disc decomposition of Early Release Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The background galaxies in Euclid Early Release Observations images of the Perseus cluster make up a remarkable sample in its combination of 0.57 deg$^2$ area, 25.3 and 23.2 AB mag depth, as well as 0.1" and 0.3" angular resolutions, in optical and near-IR bands, respectively. Towards characterising the history of the Hubble sequence, we perform a morphological analysis of 2445 and 12,786 galaxies with $I_E &lt; 21$ and $I_E &lt; 23$, respectively. We use single-S\'ersic profiles and the sums of a S\'ersic bulge and an exponential disc to model these galaxies with SourceXtractor++ and analyse their parameters in order to assess their consistencies and discrepancies. The fitted galaxies to $I_E &lt; 21$ span the various Hubble types with ubiquitous bulge and disc components, and a bulge-to-total light ratio B/T taking all values from 0 to 1. The effective radius of the single-S\'ersic profile is an intermediate estimate of galaxy size, between the bulge and disc effective radii, depending on B/T. The axis ratio of the single-S\'ersic profile is higher than the disc axis ratio, increasingly so with B/T. The model impacts the photometry with -0.08 to 0.01 mag median systematic $I_E$ offsets between single-S\'ersic and bulge+disc total magnitudes, and a 0.05 to 0.15 mag dispersion, from low to high B/T. We measure a median 0.3 mag bulge-disk colour difference in rest-frame $M_g - M_i$ that originates from the disc-dominated galaxies, whereas bulge-dominated galaxies have similar median colours of their components. Remarkably, we also measure redder-inside disc colour gradients, based on 5 to 10% systematic variations of disc effective radii between the optical and near-IR bands. This analysis demonstrates the usefulness and limitations of single-S\'ersic profile modelling, and the power of bulge-disc decomposition for reliably characterising the morphology of lenticulars and spirals in Euclid images.</description>

      <title>Bursty or heavy? The surprise of bright Population III systems in the Reionization era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature of the first, so-called Population III (Pop III) stars has for long remained largely unconstrained. However, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) finally opened new concrete prospects for their detection during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), notably providing promising observational constraints on the Pop III ultra-violet luminosity function (UVLF) at $z \approx 5.6 - 6.6$. These preliminary data hint towards an unexpected population of UV-bright Pop III sources, which challenges the prevailing view that Pop III star formation is confined to molecular-cooling mini-halos. Here we show that there are two families of models that can explain these surprising observations, either by allowing for late-time Pop III formation within massive, atomic-cooling halos (with halo masses up to $M^\mathrm{III}_\mathrm{up} \gtrsim 10^{10} \, \mathrm{M_\odot}$) or by invoking a highly bursty Pop III star-formation activity (with a stochasticity parameter $\sigma^\mathrm{III}_\mathrm{UV} \gtrsim 1.5$). In these scenarios, Pop III systems would have to be either heavier or burstier than usually assumed, underscoring the need to reconsider common assumptions about Pop III star-formation sites, and the potential implications of JWST candidates for current and future observations.</description>

      <title>What Sets the Metallicity of Ultra-Faint Dwarfs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use intergalactic medium (IGM) metallicity distributions from several state-of-the-art cosmological simulations of Milky Way analogs and a semi-analytic model of ultra-faint dwarf galaxy (UFD) formation to model the stellar metallicities of UFDs in MW-like environments. We study simulations with different treatments of star formation, stellar feedback, and Population III enrichment, and in all cases, we find that only a few percent of the IGM accretable by UFD progenitors is enriched to metallicities $\rm [Fe/H]\ge-4$. When the metallicity of accreted IGM in the semi-analytic galaxy formation model is set using these IGM metallicity distributions, the model underpredicts UFD metallicities and their scatter compared to the observed luminosity--metallicity relation. Our results indicate that IGM enrichment is not the dominant mechanism setting metallicities of UFD stars. Instead, UFD stellar metallicity is determined primarily by the interplay between internal enrichment and metal loss through feedback-driven outflows. We examine models with different values of the maximum outflow mass loading factor $\eta_{\rm max}$ and show that the full range of average stellar metallicities of UFDs at $M_V&lt;-7$ can be reproduced if the maximum mass loading factor varies in the range $200\lesssim\eta_{\rm max}\lesssim 2000$. We also consider stellar metallicity distribution functions (MDFs) within individual model galaxies with different assumptions about IGM enrichment and $\eta_{\rm max}$. We find that all considered models are in reasonable agreement with observed UFD MDFs, with model differences less than the uncertainties of current metallicity measurements.</description>

      <title>Spatial mixing of stellar populations in globular clusters via binary-single star scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The majority of Galactic globular star clusters (GCs) have been reported to contain at least two populations of stars (we use P1 for the primordial and P2 for the chemically-enriched population). Recent observational studies found that dynamically-old GCs have P1 and P2 spatially mixed due to relaxation processes. However, in dynamically-young GCs, where P2 is expected to be more centrally concentrated from birth, the spatial distributions of P1 and P2 are sometimes very different from system to system. This suggests that more complex dynamical processes specific to certain GCs might have shaped those distributions. We aim to investigate the discrepancies between the spatial concentration of P1 and P2 stars in dynamically-young GCs. Our focus is to evaluate whether massive binary stars (e.g. BHs) can cause the expansion of the P2 stars through binary-single interactions in the core, and whether they can mix or even radially invert the P1 and P2 distributions. We use a set of theoretical and empirical arguments to evaluate the effectiveness of binary-single star scattering. We then construct a set of direct N-body models with massive primordial binaries to verify our estimates further and gain more insights into the dynamical processes in GCs. We find that binary-single star scatterings can push the central P2 stars outwards within a few relaxation times. While we do not produce radial inversion of P1 and P2 for any initial conditions we tested, this mechanism systematically produces clusters where P1 and P2 look fully mixed even in projection. The mixing is enhanced 1) in denser GCs, 2) in GCs containing more binary stars, and 3) when the mass ratio between the binary components and the cluster members is higher. Binary-single star interactions seem able to explain the observable properties of some dynamically-young GCs (e.g. NGC4590 or NGC5904) where P1 and P2 are fully radially mixed.</description>

      <title>SMILES Data Release II: Probing Galaxy Evolution during Cosmic Noon and Beyond with NIRSpec Medium-Resolution Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the second data release of the Systematic Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES), focusing on JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution spectroscopy of galaxies across cosmic time. This release includes spectroscopic observations of 166 galaxies spanning $0 &lt; z &lt; 7.5$, sampling star-forming galaxies, quiescent systems, and active galactic nuclei (AGN), with an emphasis on galaxies at cosmic noon ($z \sim 1$-3). We describe the target selection strategy, the observational setup with the G140M/F100LP and G235M/F170LP gratings, and the data calibration process. The final data products include the reduced spectra, redshift catalog, emission-line catalogs produced with \texttt{GELATO} for emission-line galaxies and \texttt{pPXF} fits for quiescent systems, and ancillary spectral energy distribution (SED) fit results derived from multi-band photometry. The SMILES NIRSpec dataset enables investigations of obscured AGN, multi-phase outflows, ionizing properties, and the role of environment in galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Tidal tails in open clusters. Morphology, binary fraction, dynamics, and rotation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context: This research presents unsupervised machine learning and statistical methods to identify and analyze tidal tails in open star clusters using data from the Gaia-DR3 catalog. Aims: We aim to identify member stars, detect and analyze tidal tails in five open clusters, BH 164, Alessi 2, NGC 2281, NGC 2354, and M67, of ages between 60 Myr and 4 Gyr. These clusters were selected based on the previous evidence of extended tidal structures. Methods: We utilized machine learning algorithms such as Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), along with statistical methods to analyze the kinematic, photometric, and astrometric properties of stars. Key characteristics of tidal tails, including radial velocity, color-magnitude diagram, and spatial projections in the tangent plane beyond the cluster's Jacobi radius ($r_J$), were used to detect them. We used N-body simulations to visualize and compare the observables with real data. Further analysis was done on the detected cluster and tail stars to study their internal dynamics and populations, including binary fraction. We also applied the residual velocity method to detect rotational patterns in the clusters and their tails. Results: We identified tidal tails in all five clusters, with detected tails extending farther in some clusters and containing significantly more stars than previously reported (tails ranging from 40 to 100 pc, one to four times the Jacobi radius, with 100 - 200 tail stars). The luminosity functions of the tails and their parent clusters were generally consistent, and tails lacked massive stars. In general, the binary fraction was found to be higher in the tidal tails. Significant rotation was detected in M67 and NGC 2281 for the first time.</description>

      <title>On the Universality of Energy Extraction from Black Hole Spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The launching of astrophysical jets provides the most compelling observational evidence for direct extraction of black hole (BH) spin energy via the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism. Whilst it is known that spinning Kerr BHs within general relativity (GR) follow the BZ jet power relation, the nature of BH energy extraction in general theories of gravity has not been adequately addressed. This study performs the first comprehensive investigation of the BZ jet power relation by utilizing a generalized BH spacetime geometry which describes parametric deviations from the Kerr metric of GR, yet recovers the Kerr metric in the limit that all deviation parameters vanish. Through performing and analyzing an extensive suite of three-dimensional covariant magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations of magnetized gas accretion onto these generalized BH spacetimes we find that the BZ jet power relation still holds, in some instances yielding jet powers far in excess of what can be produced by even extremal Kerr BHs. It is shown that independent variation of the frame-dragging rate of the BH can enhance or suppress the effects of BH spin, and by extension of frame-dragging. This variation greatly enhances or suppresses the observed jet power and underlying photon ring image asymmetry, introducing a previously unexplored yet important degeneracy in BH parameter inference. Finally we show that sufficiently accurate measurements of the jet power, accretion rate and photon ring properties from supermassive BHs can potentially break this degeneracy, highlighting the need of independent investigations of BH frame-dragging from observations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Recoil and Suppression of Super Massive Black Hole Seeds in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of gravitational-wave (GW) recoil on the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early Universe. Forming 10^9 Solar Mass SMBHs by z=6 is challenging and may require hierarchical mergers of smaller seed black holes. We extend a semi-analytic seed model by explicitly incorporating GW recoil physics. Our model includes: (1) recoil velocity formulae calibrated to numerical relativity for spinning, unequal-mass BH binaries (Campanelli2007,Lousto2012); (2) assignment of spin magnitudes and orientations based on seed type (Population III remnant, stellar cluster, or direct-collapse); and (3) a retention probability scheme comparing the recoil speed to the host halo escape velocity. We find that including GW recoil reduces final SMBH masses by approximately 20-30% by z=6 and creates a population of off-nuclear (``wandering'') BHs amounting to a few percent of the total. Observable consequences include spatial offsets approximately 0.1'' and line-of-sight velocity shifts approximately 10^2-10^3 km\s in a few-percent of high-redshift quasars.

      <title>Dust Attenuation of Lyman-Werner Feedback: Reassessing Early Super Massive Black Holes Seed Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of dust shielding on Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation fields and its implications for supermassive black hole (SMBH) seed formation at high redshift. Using a custom-built semi-analytical model developed specifically for this study, we implement a simple dust shielding prescription that accounts for the absorption of LW photons by dust grains. We find that even modest dust enrichment can significantly reduce the effective LW radiation field, allowing H$_2$ cooling to persist in regions previously thought to be affected by LW feedback. This changes the conditions for seed formation, particularly for heavy seeds which require suppression of H$_2$ cooling. Our results suggest that dust shielding extends the redshift range and volume where heavy seeds can form, and significantly alters the relative importance of different seed populations. We discuss the implications for the formation of high-redshift SMBHs and future observations.</description>
