      <title>Thermodynamic Formalism Out of Equilibrium, and Gibbs Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamic formalism of systems where the potential depends randomly on an exterior system. We define the {\em pressure out of equilibrium} for such a family of potentials, and prove a corresponding variational principle. We present an application to random dynamical systems. In particular, we study an open condition for random dynamical systems where the randomness is driven by a Gibbs process, and prove hyperbolicity estimates that were previously only known in the i.i.d setting.</description>

      <title>Confabulation dynamics in a reservoir computer: Filling in the gaps with untrained attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has advanced significantly in recent years thanks to innovations in the design and training of artificial neural networks (ANNs). Despite these advancements, we still understand relatively little about how elementary forms of ANNs learn, fail to learn, and generate false information without the intent to deceive, a phenomenon known as `confabulation'. To provide some foundational insight, in this paper we analyse how confabulation occurs in reservoir computers (RCs): a dynamical system in the form of an ANN. RCs are particularly useful to study as they are known to confabulate in a well-defined way: when RCs are trained to reconstruct the dynamics of a given attractor, they sometimes construct an attractor that they were not trained to construct, a so-called `untrained attractor' (UA). This paper sheds light on the role played by UAs when reconstruction fails and their influence when modelling transitions between reconstructed attractors. Based on our results, we conclude that UAs are an intrinsic feature of learning systems whose state spaces are bounded, and that this means of confabulation may be present in systems beyond RCs.</description>

      <title>Causal Discovery in Symmetric Dynamic Systems with Convergent Cross Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper systematically discusses how the inherent properties of chaotic attractors influence the results of discovering causality from time series using convergent cross mapping, particularly how convergent cross mapping misleads bidirectional causality as unidirectional when the chaotic attractor exhibits symmetry. We propose a novel method based on the k-means clustering method to address the challenges when the chaotic attractor exhibits two-fold rotation symmetry. This method is demonstrated to recover the symmetry of the latent chaotic attractor and discover the correct causality between time series without introducing information from other variables. We validate the accuracy of this method using time series derived from low-dimension and high-dimensional chaotic symmetric attractors for which convergent cross mapping may conclude erroneous results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the weak expansion property of a long iteration of a family of quasi-Blaschke products near the unit circle established recently, we prove that the Julia sets of a number of transcendental entire functions with bounded type Siegel disks are locally connected. In particular, if $\theta$ is of bounded type, then the Julia set of the sine function $S_\theta(z)=e^{2\pi i\theta}\sin(z)$ is locally connected. Moreover, we prove the existence of transcendental entire functions having Siegel disks and locally connected Julia sets with asymptotic values.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behaviour of counting functions over periodic orbits of a skew-product map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we investigate the asymptotic behaviour of certain counting functions, associated to the ergodic sums computed along the periodic orbits of the skew-product map, related to a finitely generated rational semigroup. The results we obtain here are analogous to a version of the prime number theorem and the Mertens' theorem, in number theory, however, in the setting of the dynamical system, under consideration, in this paper.</description>

      <title>Learning dynamically inspired invariant subspaces for Koopman and transfer operator approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transfer and Koopman operator methods offer a framework for representing complex, nonlinear dynamical systems via linear transformations, enabling for a deeper understanding of the underlying dynamics. The spectrum of these operators provide important insights into system predictability and emergent behaviour, although efficiently estimating them from data can be challenging. We tackle this issue through the lens of general operator and representational learning, in which we approximate these linear operators using efficient finite-dimensional representations. Specifically, we machine-learn orthonormal, locally supported basis functions that are dynamically tailored to the system. This learned basis provides a particularly accurate approximation of the operator's action as well as a nearly invariant finite-dimensional subspace. We illustrate our approach with examples that showcase the retrieval of spectral properties from the estimated operator, and emphasise the dynamically adaptive quality of the machine-learned basis.</description>

      <title>The multi-scale KAM persistence without a scaling order for Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The persistence of invariant tori in multi-scale Hamiltonian systems is intrinsically linked to the stability of the N-body problem. However, the existing non-degeneracy conditions in disordered scenarios have been formulated too generally, making them difficult to apply directly to celestial mechanics. In this work, we present a readily verifiable non-degeneracy condition for the persistence of invariant tori in disordered multi-scale Hamiltonian systems.</description>

      <title>Geometric Fault-Tolerant Neural Network Tracking Control of Unknown Systems on Matrix Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a geometric neural network-based tracking controller for systems evolving on matrix Lie groups under unknown dynamics, actuator faults, and bounded disturbances. Leveraging the left-invariance of the tangent bundle of matrix Lie groups, viewed as an embedded submanifold of the vector space $\R^{N\times N}$, we propose a set of learning rules for neural network weights that are intrinsically compatible with the Lie group structure and do not require explicit parameterization. Exploiting the geometric properties of Lie groups, this approach circumvents parameterization singularities and enables a global search for optimal weights. The ultimate boundedness of all error signals -- including the neural network weights, the coordinate-free configuration error function, and the tracking velocity error -- is established using Lyapunov's direct method. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we provide illustrative simulation results for decentralized formation control of multi-agent systems on the Special Euclidean group.</description>

      <title>The Manhattan curve, ergodic theory of topological flows and rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.13451v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For every non-elementary hyperbolic group, we introduce the Manhattan curve associated to any pair of left-invariant hyperbolic metrics which are quasi-isometric to a word metric. It is convex; we show that it is continuously differentiable and moreover is a straight line if and only if the corresponding two metrics are roughly similar, i.e., they are within bounded distance after multiplying by a positive constant. Further, we prove that the Manhattan curve associated to two strongly hyperbolic metrics is twice continuously differentiable. The proof is based on the ergodic theory of topological flows associated to general hyperbolic groups and analyzing the multifractal structure of Patterson-Sullivan measures. We exhibit some explicit examples including a hyperbolic triangle group and compute the exact value of the mean distortion for pairs of word metrics.</description>

      <title>Irrational rotations and 2-filling rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00097v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a skew product transformation associated to an irrational rotation of the circle [0,1]/~. This skew product keeps track of the number of times an orbit of the rotation lands in the two complementary intervals of {0,1/2} in the circle. We show that under certain conditions on the continued fraction expansion of the irrational number defining the rotation, the skew product transformation has certain dense orbits. This is in spite of the presence of numerous non-dense orbits. We use this to construct laminations on infinite type surfaces with exotic properties. In particular, we show that for every infinite type surface with an isolated planar end, there is an infinite clique of 2-filling rays based at that end. These 2-filling rays are relevant to Bavard--Walker's loop graphs.</description>

      <title>Model reduction of nonlinear time-delay systems via ODE approximation and spectral submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-delay dynamical systems inherently embody infinite-dimensional dynamics, thereby amplifying their complexity. This aspect is especially notable in nonlinear dynamical systems, which frequently defy analytical solutions and necessitate approximations or numerical methods. These requirements present considerable challenges for the real-time simulation and analysis of their nonlinear dynamics. To address these challenges, we present a model reduction framework for nonlinear time-delay systems using spectral submanifolds (SSMs). We first approximate the time-delay systems as ordinary differential equations (ODEs) without delay and then compute the SSMs and their associated reduced-order models (ROMs) of the ODE approximations. These SSM-based ROMs successfully predict the nonlinear dynamical behaviors of the time-delay systems, including free and forced vibrations, and accurately identify critical features such as isolated branches in the forced response curves and bifurcations of periodic and quasi-periodic orbits. The efficiency and accuracy of the ROMs are demonstrated through examples of increasing complexity.</description>

      <title>Exact nonlinear state estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The majority of data assimilation (DA) methods in the geosciences are based on Gaussian assumptions. While these assumptions facilitate efficient algorithms, they cause analysis biases and subsequent forecast degradations. Non-parametric, particle-based DA algorithms have superior accuracy, but their application to high-dimensional models still poses operational challenges. Drawing inspiration from recent advances in the field of generative artificial intelligence (AI), this article introduces a new nonlinear estimation theory which attempts to bridge the existing gap in DA methodology. Specifically, a Conjugate Transform Filter (CTF) is derived and shown to generalize the celebrated Kalman filter to arbitrarily non-Gaussian distributions. The new filter has several desirable properties, such as its ability to preserve statistical relationships in the prior state and convergence to highly accurate observations. An ensemble approximation of the new theory (ECTF) is also presented and validated using idealized statistical experiments that feature bounded quantities with non-Gaussian distributions, a prevalent challenge in Earth system models. Results from these experiments indicate that the greatest benefits from ECTF occur when observation errors are small relative to the forecast uncertainty and when state variables exhibit strong nonlinear dependencies. Ultimately, the new filtering theory offers exciting avenues for improving conventional DA algorithms through their principled integration with AI techniques.</description>

Abstract: For quasicrystals of cut-and-project type in $\mathbb{R}^d$, it was proved by Marklof and Str\"ombergsson that the limit local statistical properties of the directions to the points in the set are described by certain $\operatorname{SL}_d(\mathbb{R})$-invariant point processes. In the present paper we make a detailed study of the tail asymptotics of the limiting gap statistics of the directions, for certain specific classes of planar quasicrystals.</description>

      <title>Neural Operators for Predictor Feedback Control of Nonlinear Delay Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predictor feedback designs are critical for delay-compensating controllers in nonlinear systems. However, these designs are limited in practical applications as predictors cannot be directly implemented, but require numerical approximation schemes, which become computationally prohibitive when system dynamics are expensive to compute. To address this challenge, we recast the predictor design as an operator learning problem, and learn the predictor mapping via a neural operator. We prove the existence of an arbitrarily accurate neural operator approximation of the predictor operator. Under the approximated predictor, we achieve semiglobal practical stability of the closed-loop nonlinear delay system. The estimate is semiglobal in a unique sense - one can enlarge the set of initial states as desired, though this increases the difficulty of training a neural operator, which appears practically in the stability estimate. Furthermore, our analysis holds for any black-box predictor satisfying the universal approximation error bound. We demonstrate the approach by controlling a 5-link robotic manipulator with different neural operator models, achieving significant speedups compared to classic predictor feedback schemes while maintaining closed-loop stability.</description>

      <title>Locally homogeneous Axiom A flows II: geometric structures for Anosov subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a non-compact semisimple real Lie group $G$ and an Anosov subgroup $\Gamma$, we utilize the correspondence between $\mathbb R$-valued additive characters on Levi subgroups $L$ of $G$ and $\mathbb R$-affine homogeneous line bundles over $G/L$ to systematically construct families of non-empty domains of proper discontinuity for the $\Gamma$-action. If $\Gamma$ is torsion-free, the analytic dynamical systems on the quotients are Axiom A, and assemble into a single partially hyperbolic multiflow. Each Axiom A system admits global analytic stable/unstable foliations with non-wandering set a single basic set on which the flow is conjugate to Sambarino's refraction flow, establishing that all refraction flows arise in this fashion. Furthermore, the $\mathbb R$-valued additive character is regular if and only if the associated Axiom A system admits a compatible pseudo-Riemannian metric and contact structure, which we relate to the Poisson structure on the dual of the Lie algebra of $G$.</description>
