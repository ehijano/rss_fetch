      <title>Investigating Document Type, Language, Publication Year, and Author Count Discrepancies Between OpenAlex and Web of Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bibliometrics, whether used for research or research evaluation, relies on large multidisciplinary databases of research outputs and citation indices. The Web of Science (WoS) was the main supporting infrastructure of the field for more than 30 years until several new competitors emerged. OpenAlex, a bibliographic database launched in 2022, has distinguished itself for its openness and extensive coverage. While OpenAlex may reduce or eliminate barriers to accessing bibliometric data, one of the concerns that hinders its broader adoption for research and research evaluation is the quality of its metadata. This study aims to assess metadata quality in OpenAlex and WoS, focusing on document type, publication year, language, and number of authors. By addressing discrepancies and misattributions in metadata, this research seeks to enhance awareness of data quality issues that could impact bibliometric research and evaluation outcomes.</description>

      <title>A Bibliometric Analysis of the Scholarly Impact of Early Subaru Telescope-based Publications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bibliometric methods provide valuable tools for assessing scientific productivity and impact across disciplines, yet their application in astronomy journals remains relatively limited. This study conducts a bibliometric analysis of Japanese astronomy publications before and after the commissioning of the Subaru Telescope, a major national investment in observational infrastructure. Using data from Scopus and SciVal, we examine peer-reviewed journal articles published between 1996 and 2007 by authors affiliated with Japanese institutions, focusing on field-normalized citation indicators such as the Field-Weighted Citation Impact (FWCI) and the share of publications in the top 10% most cited globally. Subaru Telescope-based publications are identified through cross-referencing with official telescope publication lists and are compared against national and global benchmarks. The results show that Subaru Telescope-based publications, while accounting for less than 10% of Japan's total scholarly output in astronomy, consistently achieved FWCI values above 2.0 and a significantly higher proportion of highly cited papers. This indicates that the Subaru Telescope substantially enhanced Japan's research visibility and impact, especially during its early operational years. This study demonstrates the utility of bibliometric evaluation in capturing the academic return of large-scale research facilities and contributes to broader discussions on research infrastructure in astronomy.</description>

      <title>Citation Issues in Wave Mechanics Theory of Microwave Absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06522v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The wave mechanics theory of microwave absorption challenges the long-standing impedance-matching and quarter-wavelength paradigms by demonstrating that conventional models mistakenly conflate bulk material parameters with thin-film phenomena. Drawing on a corpus of 35 peer-reviewed papers and preprints, the study performs a citation-pattern analysis and a logical audit of established theory. Results reveal a striking asymmetry in scholarly engagement, only a handful of supportive or neutral citations appear amid widespread silence, alongside critical logical flaws in impedance matching, notably its inconsistent treatment of penetration, reflection, and absorption from film. By re-framing absorption as a wave-mechanics process governed by interference at parallel interfaces, the wave mechanics framework restores energy-conservation consistency and provides experimentally verified design rules for film thickness, phase response, and broadband performance. The paper further situates the citation neglect within broader issues of peer-review bias and paradigm inertia, illustrating how cargo-cult scientific practices can impede theoretical progress. Recommendations are offered for researchers, editors, and institutions to foster open discourse, rigorously test competing models, and update curricula and design tools accordingly.</description>
