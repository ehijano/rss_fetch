      <title>Efficient MoE Serving in the Memory-Bound Regime: Balance Activated Experts, Not Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expert Parallelism (EP) permits Mixture of Experts (MoE) models to scale beyond a single GPU. To address load imbalance across GPUs in EP, existing approaches aim to balance the number of tokens each GPU processes. Surprisingly, we find that this objective degrades performance rather than improving it when processing is memory-bound - a common occurrence in MoE serving, especially in the decode phase. Our analysis reveals that balancing the number of tokens processed per GPU increases the number of activated experts, exacerbating memory pressure in the memory-bound regime.
  We propose Minimum Expert Token ROuting, a novel token-routing algorithm for high-performance expert-parallel MoE serving in the memory-bound regime that balances the number of activated experts per GPU rather than token counts. METRO achieves near-optimal routing quality with minimal computational overhead by jointly optimizing algorithmic efficiency and leveraging the GPU's parallel processing power. To guarantee routing quality, METRO also employs a novel allGather scheme to gather global top-k knowledge, which has minimal overhead compared to conventional allToAll. Our evaluation of METRO against EPLB on both real systems (vLLM over 8 A100 GPUs) and a proprietary simulator (8-16 B200 GPUs) shows that METRO reduces decode latency by 11 - 22%, and total token throughput by 3 - 21% for Qwen3 and DeepSeek-V3 serving, where prefill and decode phases are co-deployed. In addition, by trading latency headroom for throughput, METRO improves decode throughput by up to 4.11x over EPLB at a fixed decode SLO.</description>

      <title>A Distributed Framework for Privacy-Enhanced Vision Transformers on the Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, visual intelligence tools have become ubiquitous, offering all kinds of convenience and possibilities. However, these tools have high computational requirements that exceed the capabilities of resource-constrained mobile and wearable devices. While offloading visual data to the cloud is a common solution, it introduces significant privacy vulnerabilities during transmission and server-side computation. To address this, we propose a novel distributed, hierarchical offloading framework for Vision Transformers (ViTs) that addresses these privacy challenges by design. Our approach uses a local trusted edge device, such as a mobile phone or an Nvidia Jetson, as the edge orchestrator. This orchestrator partitions the user's visual data into smaller portions and distributes them across multiple independent cloud servers. By design, no single external server possesses the complete image, preventing comprehensive data reconstruction. The final data merging and aggregation computation occurs exclusively on the user's trusted edge device. We apply our framework to the Segment Anything Model (SAM) as a practical case study, which demonstrates that our method substantially enhances content privacy over traditional cloud-based approaches. Evaluations show our framework maintains near-baseline segmentation performance while substantially reducing the risk of content reconstruction and user data exposure. Our framework provides a scalable, privacy-preserving solution for vision tasks in the edge-cloud continuum.</description>

      <title>Passing the Baton: High Throughput Distributed Disk-Based Vector Search with BatANN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector search underpins modern information-retrieval systems, including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and search engines over unstructured text and images. As datasets scale to billions of vectors, disk-based vector search has emerged as a practical solution. However, looking to the future, we need to anticipate datasets too large for any single server. We present BatANN, a distributed disk-based approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) system that retains the logarithmic search efficiency of a single global graph while achieving near-linear throughput scaling in the number of servers. Our core innovation is that when accessing a neighborhood which is stored on another machine, we send the full state of the query to the other machine to continue executing there for improved locality. On 100M- and 1B-point datasets at 0.95 recall using 10 servers, BatANN achieves 6.21-6.49x and 2.5-5.10x the throughput of the scatter-gather baseline, respectively, while maintaining mean latency below 6 ms. Moreover, we get these results on standard TCP. To our knowledge, BatANN is the first open-source distributed disk-based vector search system to operate over a single global graph.</description>

      <title>WarmServe: Enabling One-for-Many GPU Prewarming for Multi-LLM Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying multiple models within shared GPU clusters is promising for improving resource efficiency in large language model (LLM) serving. Existing multi-LLM serving systems optimize GPU utilization at the cost of worse inference performance, especially time-to-first-token (TTFT). We identify the root cause of such compromise as their unawareness of future workload characteristics. In contrast, recent analysis on real-world traces has shown the high periodicity and long-term predictability of LLM serving workloads.
  We propose universal GPU workers to enable one-for-many GPU prewarming that loads models with knowledge of future workloads. Based on universal GPU workers, we design and build WarmServe, a multi-LLM serving system that (1) mitigates cluster-wide prewarming interference by adopting an evict-aware model placement strategy, (2) prepares universal GPU workers in advance by proactive prewarming, and (3) manages GPU memory with a zero-overhead memory switching mechanism. Evaluation under real-world datasets shows that WarmServe improves TTFT by up to 50.8$\times$ compared to the state-of-the-art autoscaling-based system, while being capable of serving up to 2.5$\times$ more requests compared to the GPU-sharing system.</description>

      <title>Scalable Construction of Spiking Neural Networks using up to thousands of GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diverse scientific and engineering research areas deal with discrete, time-stamped changes in large systems of interacting delay differential equations. Simulating such complex systems at scale on high-performance computing clusters demands efficient management of communication and memory. Inspired by the human cerebral cortex -- a sparsely connected network of $\mathcal{O}(10^{10})$ neurons, each forming $\mathcal{O}(10^{3})$--$\mathcal{O}(10^{4})$ synapses and communicating via short electrical pulses called spikes -- we study the simulation of large-scale spiking neural networks for computational neuroscience research. This work presents a novel network construction method for multi-GPU clusters and upcoming exascale supercomputers using the Message Passing Interface (MPI), where each process builds its local connectivity and prepares the data structures for efficient spike exchange across the cluster during state propagation. We demonstrate scaling performance of two cortical models using point-to-point and collective communication, respectively.</description>

      <title>PHWSOA: A Pareto-based Hybrid Whale-Seagull Scheduling for Multi-Objective Tasks in Cloud Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Task scheduling is a critical research challenge in cloud computing, a transformative technology widely adopted across industries. Although numerous scheduling solutions exist, they predominantly optimize singular or limited metrics such as execution time or resource utilization often neglecting the need for comprehensive multi-objective optimization. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes the Pareto-based Hybrid Whale-Seagull Optimization Algorithm (PHWSOA). This algorithm synergistically combines the strengths of the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and the Seagull Optimization Algorithm (SOA), specifically mitigating WOA's limitations in local exploitation and SOA's constraints in global exploration. Leveraging Pareto dominance principles, PHWSOA simultaneously optimizes three key objectives: makespan, virtual machine (VM) load balancing, and economic cost. Key enhancements include: Halton sequence initialization for superior population diversity, a Pareto-guided mutation mechanism to avert premature convergence, and parallel processing for accelerated convergence. Furthermore, a dynamic VM load redistribution mechanism is integrated to improve load balancing during task execution. Extensive experiments conducted on the CloudSim simulator, utilizing real-world workload traces from NASA-iPSC and HPC2N, demonstrate that PHWSOA delivers substantial performance gains. Specifically, it achieves up to a 72.1% reduction in makespan, a 36.8% improvement in VM load balancing, and 23.5% cost savings. These results substantially outperform baseline methods including WOA, GA, PEWOA, and GCWOA underscoring PHWSOA's strong potential for enabling efficient resource management in practical cloud environments.</description>

      <title>SynthPix: A lightspeed PIV images generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe SynthPix, a synthetic image generator for Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) with a focus on performance and parallelism on accelerators, implemented in JAX. SynthPix supports the same configuration parameters as existing tools but achieves a throughput several orders of magnitude higher in image-pair generation per second. SynthPix was developed to enable the training of data-hungry reinforcement learning methods for flow estimation and for reducing the iteration times during the development of fast flow estimation methods used in recent active fluids control studies with real-time PIV feedback. We believe SynthPix to be useful for the fluid dynamics community, and in this paper we describe the main ideas behind this software package.</description>

      <title>Straggler Tolerant and Resilient DL Training on Homogeneous GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the popularity of homogeneous GPU-based deep learning (DL) training, the prevalence, causes and impact of stragglers and the effectiveness of existing straggler mitigation approaches are still not well understood in this scenario due to limited research on these questions. To fill this gap, we conducted comprehensive experiments and found that stragglers remain widespread due to CPU and bandwidth usage imbalances. Additionally, existing mitigation methods that switch from synchronous stochastic gradient descent (SSGD) to asynchronous SGD (ASGD) may not improve Time-To-Accuracy (TTA) and can even generate more stragglers due to its higher resource consumption. To address these newly found problems, we propose the Straggler Tolerant And Resilient DL training system (STAR). STAR includes new synchronization modes that group workers for each parameter updating. It has a heuristic and an ML method to choose the optimal synchronization mode for minimizing TTA, and reallocates resources to support the selected mode while minimizing the impact on co-located jobs. Moreover, it proactively prevents stragglers by avoiding overloading the CPU and bandwidth resources in allocating PSs (which consume high CPU and bandwidth) and in gradient transmission. Our trace-driven evaluation on AWS shows that STAR generates 48-84% and 51-70% lower TTA than state-of-the-art systems in the PS and all-reduce architectures, respectively, while maintaining the converged accuracy of SSGD. The code for STAR is open-sourced.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the first transformation that introduces both lock-freedom and recoverability. Our transformation starts with a lock-based implementation, and provides a recoverable, lock-free substitution to lock acquire and lock release operations. The transformation supports nested locks for generality and ensures recoverability without jeopardising the correctness of the lock-based implementation it is applied on.</description>

      <title>Ariel-ML: Computing Parallelization with Embedded Rust for Neural Networks on Heterogeneous Multi-core Microcontrollers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-power microcontroller (MCU) hardware is currently evolving from single-core architectures to predominantly multi-core architectures. In parallel, new embedded software building blocks are more and more written in Rust, while C/C++ dominance fades in this domain. On the other hand, small artificial neural networks (ANN) of various kinds are increasingly deployed in edge AI use cases, thus deployed and executed directly on low-power MCUs. In this context, both incremental improvements and novel innovative services will have to be continuously retrofitted using ANNs execution in software embedded on sensing/actuating systems already deployed in the field. However, there was so far no Rust embedded software platform automating parallelization for inference computation on multi-core MCUs executing arbitrary TinyML models. This paper thus fills this gap by introducing Ariel-ML, a novel toolkit we designed combining a generic TinyML pipeline and an embedded Rust software platform which can take full advantage of multi-core capabilities of various 32bit microcontroller families (Arm Cortex-M, RISC-V, ESP-32). We published the full open source code of its implementation, which we used to benchmark its capabilities using a zoo of various TinyML models. We show that Ariel-ML outperforms prior art in terms of inference latency as expected, and we show that, compared to pre-existing toolkits using embedded C/C++, Ariel-ML achieves comparable memory footprints. Ariel-ML thus provides a useful basis for TinyML practitioners and resource-constrained embedded Rust developers.</description>

      <title>Link-Sharing Backpressure Routing In Wireless Multi-Hop Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Backpressure (BP) routing and scheduling is an established resource allocation method for wireless multi-hop networks, noted for its fully distributed operation and maximum queue stability. Recent advances in shortest path-biased BP routing (SP-BP) mitigate shortcomings such as slow startup and random walks, yet exclusive link-level commodity selection still causes last-packet problem and bandwidth underutilization. By revisiting the Lyapunov drift theory underlying BP, we show that the legacy exclusive commodity selection is unnecessary, and propose a Maximum Utility (MaxU) link-sharing method to expand its performance envelope without increasing control message overhead. Numerical results show that MaxU SP-BP substantially mitigates the last-packet problem and slightly expands the network capacity region.</description>

      <title>Story of Two GPUs: Characterizing the Resilience of Hopper H100 and Ampere A100 GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11901v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study characterizes GPU resilience in Delta, a large-scale AI system that consists of 1,056 A100 and H100 GPUs, with over 1,300 petaflops of peak throughput. We used 2.5 years of operational data (11.7 million GPU hours) on GPU errors. Our major findings include: (i) H100 GPU memory resilience is worse than A100 GPU memory, with 3.2x lower per-GPU MTBE for memory errors, (ii) The GPU memory error-recovery mechanisms on H100 GPUs are insufficient to handle the increased memory capacity, (iii) H100 GPUs demonstrate significantly improved GPU hardware resilience over A100 GPUs with respect to critical hardware components, (iv) GPU errors on both A100 and H100 GPUs frequently result in job failures due to the lack of robust recovery mechanisms at the application level, and (v) We project the impact of GPU node availability on larger-scales and find that significant overprovisioning of 5% is necessary to handle GPU failures.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Partial Computations on the Red-Blue Pebble Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an extension of the well-known red-blue pebble game (RBP) with partial computation steps, inspired by the recent work of Sobczyk. While the original RBP assumes that we need to have all the inputs of an operation in fast memory at the same time, in many concrete computations, the inputs can be aggregated one by one into the final output value. These partial computation steps can enable pebbling strategies with much smaller I/O cost, and in settings where such a step-by-step aggregation is possible, this extended red-blue pebble game offers a much more realistic cost model.
  We establish the fundamental properties of this partial-computing red-blue pebble game (PRBP), and compare it to the original RBP. We begin with some simple examples where allowing partial computations can decrease the optimal I/O cost. It is also shown that the cost can decrease by up to a linear factor this way, but in general, it is NP-hard to decide whether partial computations allow for a smaller cost in a specific DAG. We then discuss how $S$-partitions, a crucial tool for deriving I/O lower bounds in RBP, can be adapted to the PRBP model. These new tools are then used to establish lower bounds on the I/O cost of some prominent computational tasks. Finally, we also adapt a hardness result from RBP, showing that the optimum cost is still NP-hard to approximate in PRBP to any reasonable factor.</description>

Abstract: Many combinatorial optimization problems can be reformulated as finding the ground state of the Ising model. Existing Ising solvers are mostly inspired by simulated annealing. Although annealing techniques offer scalability, they lack convergence guarantees and are sensitive to the cooling schedule. We propose solving the Ising problem by relaxing the binary spins to continuous variables and introducing an attraction potential that steers the solution toward binary spin configurations. A key property of this potential is that its combination with the Ising energy produces a Hamiltonian that can be written as a difference of convex polynomials. This enables us to design efficient iterative algorithms that require a single matrix-vector multiplication per iteration and provide convergence guarantees. We implement our Ising solver on a wide range of GPU platforms, from edge devices to high-performance computing clusters, and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms existing solvers across problem sizes ranging from small ($10^3$ spins) to ultra-large ($10^8$ spins).</description>

Abstract: The proliferation of 100B+ parameter Large Language Models (LLMs) with 100k+ context length support have resulted in increasing demands for on-chip memory to support large KV caches. Techniques such as StreamingLLM and SnapKV demonstrate how to control KV cache size while maintaining model accuracy. Yet, these techniques are not commonly used within industrial deployments using frameworks like vLLM or SGLang. The reason is twofold: on one hand, the static graphs and continuous batching methodology employed by these frameworks make it difficult to admit modifications to the standard multi-head attention algorithm, while on the other hand, the accuracy implications of such techniques on modern instruction-following and reasoning models are not well understood, obfuscating the need for implementing these techniques. In this paper, we explore these accuracy implications on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1, and develop SnapStream, a KV cache compression method that can be deployed at scale. We demonstrate the efficacy of SnapStream in a 16-way tensor-parallel deployment of DeepSeek-671B on SambaNova SN40L accelerators running at 128k context length and up to 1832 tokens per second in a real production setting. SnapStream enables $4\times$ improved on-chip memory usage and introduces minimal accuracy degradation on LongBench-v2, AIME24 and LiveCodeBench. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of sparse KV attention techniques deployed in a production inference system with static graphs and continuous batching.</description>
