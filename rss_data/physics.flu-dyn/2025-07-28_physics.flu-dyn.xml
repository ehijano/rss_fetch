      <title>Eulerian-Lagrangian scaling of the Lyapunov exponent in homogeneous turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a heuristic derivation of the maximal Lyapunov exponent $\gamma$ of homogeneous turbulence which yields two new relations, a sweeping relation and the scaling of the uncertainty field's integral length $L_{\Delta}$. These relations and the maximal Lyapunov exponent's scaling that they imply are confirmed by periodic turbulence simulations. As the Reynolds number $Re_\lammbda$ increases, $L_\Delta$ and $\gamma^{-1}$ decrease towards values smaller than the Kolmogorov length and time scales.</description>

      <title>Near-Wall Scaling and Separation Prediction of a Rotation-Based Subgrid-Scale Stress Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an in-depth analysis of a novel subgrid-scale stress model proposed in 2022, which utilizes the rotational part of the velocity gradient as the velocity scale for computing eddy viscosity. This study investigates the near-wall asymptotic behavior and separation prediction capability of this model for the first time. Two canonical flows--fully-developed turbulent channel flow and periodic hill flow--are selected for analysis. The eddy viscosity predicted by this model correlates well with the visualized vortices and exhibits an asymptotic behavior of O(y) near the walls. The dimensionless eddy viscosity, like that of the Wall-Adapting Local Eddy Viscosity (WALE) subgrid model, remains within a small numerical range of 10^-2 to 10^-4. The power spectral density results reveal the asymptotic behavior of the velocity scale in the dissipation range, following a -10/3 scaling law. Additionally, this model predicts velocity profiles more accurately than the Smagorinsky model, even when using Van Driest damping. For the periodic hill case, this model predicts the reattachment point with only a 6.9% error, compared to 14.0% for the Smagorinsky model and 16.4% for the Smagorinsky model with Van Driest damping. In near-wall regions with separation, this model achieves even greater accuracy in Reynolds stress prediction than the WALE model, demonstrating its superior potential for separated flow simulations.</description>

      <title>Waves in a shear flow: transition between the KH, Holmboe and Miles instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate shear driven wave generation at the interface between two immiscible fluids, using an exponential velocity profile with a sharp density interface representing stable stratification. At low Froude and high Bond numbers, conditions relevant to geophysical and astrophysical flows, we identify a novel transition in the fastest growing mode: from Kelvin Helmholtz (KH) instability at high density ratio (delta = 0.9), to Holmboe (H) instability as delta approaches 0.5, and ultimately to the Miles (1957) critical layer instability as delta approaches 0.001, representative of the air water system. Remarkably, the Miles mode, characterized by a sharp jump in inviscid Reynolds stress (tau) at the critical layer, persists up to delta = 0.01, i.e., ten times the air water value. As delta increases, the vertical variation of tau undergoes a qualitative change, from a sharp jump at the critical layer for delta much less than 1 to a smooth transition through it for delta greater than or equal to 0.5. A theoretical explanation is provided. In the moderate to high density ratio regime, comparison with a piecewise-linear (PL) velocity profile confirms the presence of both H and KH instabilities in the exponential profile. Nonlinear simulations of the incompressible Euler equations with gravity and surface tension show excellent agreement with linear theory for delta = 0.01 up to five wave periods. At delta = 0.1, waves saturate into finite-amplitude structures with capillary ripples, while at delta = 0.5, the waves develop sheared cusps and emit spume, resembling asymmetric Holmboe waves observed experimentally. At delta = 0.9, the waves rapidly evolve into classic KH spirals. Comparisons with the PL profile highlight the role of background curvature and the critical layer. This work presents, for the first time, all three canonical instabilities within a single background state.</description>

      <title>Effect of permeability heterogeneity on reactive convective dissolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of permeability heterogeneity on reactive buoyancy-driven convective dissolution is analyzed numerically in the case of a bimolecular A+B$\to$C reaction across varying Rayleigh numbers. The convective dynamics is compared in homogeneous, horizontally stratified, vertically stratified, and log-normally distributed permeability fields. Key variables, such as the total amount of product, mixing length, front position and width, reaction and scalar dissipation rates, and dissolution fluxes, are strongly influenced by the type of permeability heterogeneity. Vertically stratified and log-normally distributed permeability fields lead to larger values for all parameters compared to homogeneous fields. Horizontally stratified fields act as an obstacle to convective flow, resulting in slower front progression, thicker fingers, wider reaction fronts, and the lowest dissolution fluxes among all cases. When the reaction stabilizes convection, flow stagnation occurs near the extremum of the non-monotonic density profile, even in vertically stratified systems, highlighting the complex interaction between reactions and dissolution-driven convection. In log-normally distributed fields, the flow behavior depends on the permeability structure: smaller horizontal correlation lengths cause fingers to spread more horizontally, while larger horizontal correlation lengths promote more vertical movement with shorter wavelengths. Overall, a shorter horizontal correlation length relative to the vertical one leads to an increase in the value of all aforementioned parameters and thus to a more efficient mixing. These findings reveal how heterogeneity affects convective dynamics by influencing the reaction front, dissolution rates, mixing behavior, and mass transport efficiency, emphasizing the intricate role of permeability structure in reactive convective processes.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Approach for Predicting Hydrodynamic Forces on Spherical Particles Using Volume Fraction Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle-laden flows are simulated at various scales using numerical techniques that range from particle-resolved Direct Numerical Simulations (pr-DNS) for small-scale systems to Lagrange point-particle methods for laboratory-scale problems, and Euler-Euler approaches for larger-scale applications. Recent research has been particularly focused on the development of both physics-based and data-driven closures to enhance the accuracy of the Lagrangian point-particle approach by leveraging highly resolved data from pr-DNS. In this study, a data-driven methodology is presented for the prediction of hydrodynamic forces acting on spherical particles immersed in an ambient flow field, where neighboring particle information is represented by volume fractions. The volume fractions are computed on an auxiliary grid with cell sizes on the order of the particle diameter. The volume fraction values in the vicinity of each particle are used as input features for the data-driven model to predict the corresponding hydrodynamic forces and moments. The training data was generated by a series of pr-DNS of flow through arrays of randomly distributed, fixed-position particles at various Reynolds numbers and particle volume fractions. The data-driven model is built using Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNN). Improved prediction accuracy of hydrodynamic forces and torques is demonstrated in comparison to FCNN models that rely on direct particle position inputs. In addition, the proposed volume-fraction-based approach exhibits greater flexibility than previously introduced models by accommodating systems with particles of different sizes and shapes.</description>

      <title>Passive control of wing tip vortices through a grooved-tip design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the characteristics and control of tip vortices generated by a finite wing, focusing on the impact of the novel grooved-tip designs. Tip vortices can lead to flow loss, noise, vibration and cavitation in hydrodynamic systems. We propose and develop a grooved-tip design, featuring multiple grooves distributed along the wing tip to alter the tip vortex structure and dynamics. Four grooved-tip designs, including tilted and shrinking grooves, were experimentally investigated. Streamwise and cross-flow Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements were employed to visualise the flow fields near the wing tip and along the primary tip vortex trajectory. The PIV results demonstrate that the grooved-tip designs significantly reduce the velocity magnitude within the primary tip vortex. This velocity deficit is attributed to the decreased suction within the vortex core. Furthermore, cross-flow PIV measurements reveal that the tip separation vortex is substantially suppressed, and the strength of the primary tip vortex is significantly mitigated. Downstream of the wing, the grooved tips lead to a reduction in vortex swirling strength and an enlargement of the vortex dimensions, suggesting enhanced diffusion and a reduction of the pressure drop of approximately 40%. Our findings highlight the potential of these grooved-tip designs to effectively modify tip vortex behaviour and mitigate the pressure drop within the tip vortex region, with negligible changes to the lift and drag performance. This work can inform advanced passive vortex control strategies in wing- and blade-based systems, with potential applications in hydrofoils of marine vessels and underwater vehicles, as well as in turbines, propellers, pumps, etc.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of Stable Mode Contributions to Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the presence and impact of stable eigenmodes in Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection that arises due to a temperature gradient within a fluid system. The nonlinear evolution of the canonical convection system is cast in terms of eigenmode amplitudes. The linear modes that play a significant role in the dynamics across a range of Rayleigh numbers are identified. We find that while unstable eigenmodes are a significant contributor, a small number of linearly stable modes grow to large amplitude via nonlinear interactions and are essential in modeling system dynamics. Importantly, the stable eigenmodes are seen to contain the majority of the boundary layer structure that forms in the nonlinear state. We also demonstrate that the scaling of convective heat transport (as quantified by the Nusselt Number) with Rayleigh number can be effectively quantified with only a small fraction of the total number of eigenmodes in the system.</description>

      <title>Microfluidic studies of Salt Precipitation: Influence of Brine Composition, Interfacial Tension, Flow Conditions, and Chemical Additives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the interfacial tension, fluid mobility, and crystallization behavior of various saline and additive-modified solutions in a microfluidic chip environment, simulating pore-scale processes during CO2 injection. The brine compositions included NaCl solutions at different concentrations, surfactant-modified fluids, alcohol-water mixtures, and ammonia solutions. Microfluidic experiments were performed on a range of flow rates and the dynamics of CO2 breakthrough, brine evaporation, and salt precipitation were analyzed.
  The results show that higher NaCl concentrations accelerate crystallization and increase the final fraction of the crystal, though they also introduce spatial variability and localized precipitation. Additives such as alkylbenzene sulfonate and propan-2-ol reduce interfacial tension, promote greater mobility, and suppress salt accumulation. Ammonia-based solutions demonstrate rapid ammonia bicarbonate crystallization immediately upon CO2 contact, leading to elevated water saturation and frequent chip clogging.
  Despite faster brine evaporation and earlier crystal nucleation at higher CO2 flow rates, no significant impact was observed on initial brine saturation or final crystal coverage. Crystal growth occurs within and outside brine pools, driven by capillary flow, with spatial distributions governed by stochastic breakthrough dynamics. The random nature of the residual brine geometry results in heterogeneous crystal patterns, which were found to be repeatable but not deterministic.</description>

      <title>Efficient Adjoint Petrov-Galerkin Reduced Order Models for fluid flows governed by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research paper investigates the Adjoint Petrov-Galerkin (APG) method for reduced order models (ROM) and fluid dynamics governed by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The Adjoint Petrov-Galerkin ROM, derived using the Mori-Zwanzig formalism, demonstrates superior accuracy and stability compared to standard Galerkin ROMs. However, challenges arise due to the time invariance of the test basis vectors, resulting in high computational requirements. To address this, we introduce a new efficient Adjoint Petrov-Galerkin (eAPG) ROM formulation, extending its application to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations by exploiting the polynomial structure inherent in these equations. The offline and online phases partition eliminates the need for repeated test basis vector evaluations. This improves computational efficiency in comparison to the general Adjoint Petrov-Galerkin ROM formulation. A novel approach to augmenting the memory length, a critical factor influencing the stability and accuracy of the APG-ROM, is introduced, employing a data-driven optimization. Numerical results for the 3D turbulent flow around a circular cylinder demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach. Error measures and computational cost evaluations, considering metrics such as floating point operations and simulation time, provide a comprehensive analysis.</description>

      <title>Orbital cluster-based network modelling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel reduced-order methodology to describe complex multi-frequency fluid dynamics from time-resolved snapshot data. Starting point is the Cluster-based Network Model (CNM) thanks to its fully automatable development and human interpretability. Our key innovation is to model the transitions from cluster to cluster much more accurately by replacing snapshot states with short-term trajectories ("orbits") over multiple clusters, thus avoiding nonphysical intra-cluster diffusion in the dynamic reconstruction. The proposed orbital CNM (oCNM) employs functional clustering to coarse-grain the short-term trajectories. Specifically, different filtering techniques, resulting in different temporal basis expansions, demonstrate the versatility and capability of the oCNM to adapt to diverse flow phenomena. The oCNM is illustrated on the Stuart-Landau oscillator and its post-transient solution with time-varying parameters to test its ability to capture the amplitude selection mechanism and multi-frequency behaviours. Then, the oCNM is applied to the fluidic pinball across varying flow regimes at different Reynolds numbers, including the periodic, quasi-periodic, and chaotic dynamics. This orbital-focused perspective enhances the understanding of complex temporal behaviours by incorporating high-frequency behaviour into the kinematics of short-time trajectories while modelling the dynamics of the lower frequencies. In analogy to Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, which marked the transition from spatial-only modes to spatio-temporal ones, this work advances from analysing temporal local states to examining piecewise short-term trajectories, or orbits. By merging advanced analytical methods, such as the functional representation of short-time trajectories with CNM, this study paves the way for new approaches to dissect the complex dynamics characterising turbulent systems.</description>

      <title>On the Energy Analysis of Two-phase Flows Simulated with the Diffuse Interface Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Phase-Field Method (PFM) is employed to simulate two-phase flows with the fully-coupled Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) equations governing the temporal evolution. The methodology minimizes the total energy functional, accounting for diffusive and viscous dissipations. A new perspective is presented by analyzing the interplay between kinetic energy, mixing energy, and viscous dissipation using the temporal evolution of the total energy functional. The classical surface energy is approximated with mixing energy under specific conditions, and the accuracy of this substitution is rigorously evaluated. The energy-based surface tension formulation derived from the Korteweg stress tensor demonstrates exceptional accuracy in capturing variations in the mixing energy. These concepts are demonstrated by considering two benchmark problems: droplet oscillation and capillary thread breakup. Key findings include validating mixing-energy theory for highly deformed interfaces, as well as the discovery of distinct energy dissipation patterns during thread breakup and droplet oscillations. The results highlight the robustness of the free energy-based PFM in accurately capturing complex interfacial dynamics, while maintaining energy conservation.</description>

      <title>Assessment of averaged 1D models for column adsorption with 3D computational experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05029v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present manuscript, we formulate a 3D mathematical model describing the capture of a contaminant in an adsorption column. The novelty of our approach involves the description of mass transfer by adsorption via a nonlinear evolution equation defined on the surface of the porous media, while Stokes flow and an advection-diffusion equation describe the contaminant transport through the interstices. Simulations of 3D models with varying microstructures but identical porosity reveal a minimal impact of the microstructure on contaminant distribution within the column, particularly in the radial direction. Using homogenization theory and a periodic microstructure, we rigorously derive a 1D adsorption model that matches the standard form that is found in the literature, but contains two effective coefficients, the dispersion and the permeability, that explicitly incorporate microstructural details of the porous medium. The 1D model closely reproduces 3D results, the 1D concentration profiles closely match the cross-section averaged 3D profiles, and the outlet breakthrough curves are nearly identical. We also demonstrate how the 3D simulations converge to the solution of the 1D model as the microstructure is refined. Consequently, our model offers a theoretical foundation for the widely used 1D model, confirming its reliability for investigating, optimizing, and aiding in the design of column adsorption processes for practical applications.</description>

      <title>An Insight into Parameter Identifiability Issues in the Carreau-Yasuda Model: a More Consistent Rheological Formulation for Shear-thinning non-Newtonian Inelastic Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14728v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Carreau-Yasuda rheological model is widely employed in both research and industrial applications to describe the shear-thinning behaviour of non-Newtonian inelastic fluids. However, the model parameter traditionally employed to characterize the shear thinning response exhibits only a weak correlation with the actual shear thinning rate observed in experimental data. This limitation leads to intrinsic identifiability issues, which may result in misleading physical interpretations of the model parameters and unreliable flow predictions. Aiming to contribute to overcoming these issues, this paper introduces a novel heuristic rheological formulation for shear-thinning non-Newtonian inelastic fluids, as an alternative to the Carreau-Yasuda model. Analytical results and exemplary numerical case studies demonstrate that the proposed formulation is based on physically meaningful model parameters, whose identifiability is not compromised by the key limitations of the Carreau-Yasuda model. The new approach allows for effective parameter estimation through a straightforward direct identification strategy, eliminating the need for inverse identification procedures based on nonlinear regression techniques. Moreover, the proposed formulation naturally enables the identication of two Carreau numbers based on the two characteristic shear rates of the fluid.</description>

      <title>A Quasi-Analytical Solution for "Carreau-Yasuda-like" Shear-thinning Fluids Flowing in Slightly Tapered Pipes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14991v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a quasi-analytical framework for "Carreau-Yasuda-like" fluids with a viscosity characterized by two constant plateau at low and high shear rates connected by a shear-thinning branch, and flowing in slightly tapered pipes. This setup is common in research and industrial applications since the last century, by assuming both a Newtonian or a non-Newtonian inelastic behaviour. Nevertheless, an analytical solution for "Carreau-Yasuda-like" fluids is still lacking. The expressions have been derived by using the order-of-magnitude analysis and neglecting the inertial terms in the momentum balance equations. The analytical solutions are employed to an extrusion bioprinting process as an application example, and verified through numerical procedures.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Vortex Clusters on a Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the collective dynamics of multivortex assemblies in a two dimensional (2D) toroidal fluid film of distinct curvature and topology. The incompressible and inviscid nature of the fluid allows a Hamiltonian description of the vortices, along with a self-force of geometric origin, arising from the standard Kirchhoff-Routh regularization procedure. The Hamiltonian dynamics is constructed in terms of $q$-digamma functions $\Psi_q(z)$, closely related to the Schottky-Klein prime function known to arise in multiply connected domains. We show the fundamental motion of the two-vortex system and identify five classes of geodesics on the torus for the special case of a vortex dipole, along with subtle distinctions from vortices in quantum superfluids. In multivortex assemblies, we observe that a randomly initialized cluster of vortices of the same sign and strength (chiral cluster) remains geometrically confined on the torus, while undergoing an overall drift along the toroidal direction, exhibiting collective dynamics. A cluster of fast and slow vortices also show the collective toroidal drift, with the fast ones predominantly occupying the core region and the slow ones expelled to the periphery of the revolving cluster. Vortex clusters of mixed sign but zero net circulation (achiral cluster) show unconfined dynamics and scatter all over the surface of the torus. A chiral cluster with an impurity in the form of a single vortex of opposite sign also show similar behavior as a pure chiral cluster, with occasional ``jets" of dipoles leaving and re-entering the revolving cluster. The work serves as a step towards analysis of vortex clusters in models that incorporate harmonic velocities in the Hodge decomposition.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Entanglement-Induced Time-Dependent Solidification of Polymeric Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The structure of polymers at solid interfaces evolves over time, but the corresponding changes in their rheological properties remain poorly understood. Here, using a home-built quartz tuning fork atomic force microscope-based nano-rheometer, we directly measure the time-dependent viscoelasticity of the interfacial fluid. The bottommost layer, closest to the substrate, undergoes solidification over 10 hours, exhibiting an approximately five-fold increase in storage modulus and a two-fold increase in loss modulus. This arises from interfacial entanglement due to the strong binding of polymers to the solid surface driven by solid-wall attractive interactions. In contrast, within the second and third layers, the storage modulus remains nearly constant over time, while the loss modulus shows approximately two-fold increase. In this region, unlike the strongly bound first layer, entropic repulsion dominates, allowing the material to behave fluid-like while becoming increasingly viscous. Notably, as the first layer, where interfacial entanglement occurs, undergoes solidification, the flow boundary for interfacial fluid flow shifts upward away from the substrate, resulting in a negative slip length. This highlights the critical role of nanoscale interfacial structure and properties in governing macroscopic flow behavior.</description>

      <title>Stability of co-annular active and passive confined fluids</title>

Abstract: The translation and shape deformations of a passive viscous Newtonian droplet immersed in an active nematic liquid crystal under circular confinement are analyzed using a linear stability analysis. We focus on the case of a sharply aligned active nematic in the limit of strong elastic relaxation in two dimensions. Using an active liquid crystal model, we employ the Lorentz reciprocal theorem for Stokes flow to study the growth of interfacial perturbations as a result of both active and elastic stresses. Instabilities are uncovered in both extensile and contractile systems, for which growth rates are calculated and presented in terms of the dimensionless ratios of active, elastic, and capillary stresses, as well as the viscosity ratio between the two fluids. We also extend our theory to analyze the inverse scenario, namely, the stability of an active nematic droplet surrounded by a passive viscous layer. Our results highlight the subtle interplay of capillary, active, elastic, and viscous stresses in governing droplet stability. The instabilities uncovered here may be relevant to a plethora of biological active systems, from the dynamics of passive droplets in bacterial suspensions to the organization of subcellular compartments inside the cell and cell nucleus.</description>

      <title>Chemo-mechanical motility modes of partially wetting liquid droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a simple thermodynamically consistent model that captures the self-organized chemo-mechanical coupling resulting from the interplay between autocatalytically reacting surfactants, the Marangoni effect and wetting dynamics. An ambient bath of surfactant acts as a chemostat and provides the system with chemical fuel, thereby driving it away from thermodynamic equilibrium. We find that a positive feedback loop between the local reactions and the Marangoni effect induces surface tension gradients that allow for self-propelled droplets. Besides simple directional motion, we find crawling and shuttling droplets as well as droplets performing random walks, thus exploring the entire substrate. We study the occurring chemo-mechanical motility modes and show how the observed dynamic states emerge from local and global bifurcations. Due to the underlying generic thermodynamic structure, we expect that our results are relevant not only to directly related biomimetic droplet systems but also to structurally similar systems like chemically active phase-separating mixtures.</description>

      <title>Inferring activity from the flow field around active colloidal particles using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active colloidal particles create flow around them due to non-equilibrium process on their surfaces. In this paper, we infer the activity of such colloidal particles from the flow field created by them via deep learning. We first explain our method for one active particle, inferring the $2s$ mode (or the stresslet) and the $3t$ mode (or the source dipole) from the flow field data, along with the position and orientation of the particle. We then apply the method to a system of many active particles. We find excellent agreements between the predictions and the true values of activity. Our method presents a principled way to predict arbitrary activity from the flow field created by active particles.</description>
