      <title>Detectors for next-generation quasi-free scattering experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-free scattering of atomic nuclei away from the stability line has reached several milestones over the past decade. The advent of gamma, charged particles, and neutron detection devices for inverse kinematics, especially in combination with RI beams, has opened new horizons in nuclear physics. Research is progressing with detection devices optimized to explore these new and challenging area of physics. While some of the new detection developments aim for high energy and angular resolution, others focus on the increasing detection efficiency or enhancing large angular acceptance. As high-intensity RI beams become available worldwide, we reflect on past detectors and provide a review of the future development of the detection devices.</description>

      <title>Commissioning of the calorimeter of the SuperNEMO demonstrator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SuperNEMO experiment is searching for neutrinoless double beta decay of \textsuperscript{82}Se, with the unique combination of a tracking detector and a segmented calorimeter. This feature allows to detect the two electrons emitted in the decay and measure their individual energy and angular distribution. The SuperNEMO calorimeter consists of 712 plastic scintillator blocks readout by large PMTs. After the construction of the demonstrator calorimeter underground, we have performed its first commissioning using $\gamma$-particles from calibration sources or from the ambient radioactive background. This article presents the quality assurance tests of the SuperNEMO demonstrator calorimeter and its first time and energy calibrations, with the associated methods.</description>

      <title>Performance Evaluation of a Diamond Quantum Magnetometer for Biomagnetic Sensing: A Phantom Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ a dry-type phantom to evaluate the performance of a diamond quantum magnetometer with a high sensitivity of about $6~\mathrm{pT/\sqrt{Hz}}$ from the viewpoint of practical measurement in biomagnetic sensing. The dry phantom is supposed to represent an equivalent current dipole (ECD) generated by brain activity, emulating an encephalomagnetic field. The spatial resolution of the magnetometer is evaluated to be sufficiently higher than the length of the variation in the encephalomagnetic field distribution. The minimum detectable ECD moment is evaluated to be 0.2 nA m by averaging about 8000 measurements for a standoff distance of 2.4 mm from the ECD. We also discuss the feasibility of detecting an ECD in the measurement of an encephalomagnetic field in humans. We conclude that it is feasible to detect an encephalomagnetic field from a shallow cortex area such as the primary somatosensory cortex.</description>

      <title>Alleviating the trade-off between coincidence time resolution and sensitivity using scalable TOF-DOI detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coincidence time resolution (CTR) in time-of-flight positron emission tomography (TOF-PET) has significantly improved with advancements in scintillators, photodetectors, and readout electronics. Achieving a CTR of 100 ps remains challenging due to the need for sufficiently thick scintillators-typically 20 mm-to ensure adequate sensitivity because the photon transit time spread within these thick scintillators impedes achieving 100 ps CTR. Therefore, thinner scintillators are preferable for CTR better than 100 ps. To address the trade-off between TOF capability and sensitivity, we propose a readout scheme of PET detectors. The proposed scheme utilizes two orthogonally stacked one-dimensional PET detectors, enabling the thickness of the scintillators to be reduced to approximately 13 mm without compromising sensitivity. This is achieved by stacking the detectors along the depth-of-interaction (DOI) axis of a PET scanner. We refer to this design as the cross-stacked detector, or xDetector. Furthermore, the xDetector inherently provides DOI information using the same readout scheme. Experimental evaluations demonstrated that the xDetector achieved a CTR of 175 ps FWHM and an energy resolution of 11% FWHM at 511 keV with 3 x 3 x 12.8 mm3 lutetium oxyorthosilicate crystals, each coupled one-to-one with silicon photomultipliers. In terms of xy-spatial resolution, the xDetector exhibited an asymmetric resolution due to its readout scheme: one resolution was defined by the 3.2 mm readout pitch, while the other was calculated using the center-of-gravity method. The xDetector effectively resolves the trade-off between TOF capability and sensitivity while offering scalability and DOI capability. By integrating state-of-the-art scintillators, photodetectors, and readout electronics with the xDetector scheme, achieving a CTR of 100 ps FWHM alongside high DOI resolution becomes a practical possibility.</description>

      <title>Performance Optimizations and Evaluations for the Small Direct Currents Measurement System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ionization chambers are essential for activity determinations in radionuclide metrology. We have developed a high-precision integrating-differentiating (int-diff) system for measuring small currents. It is anticipated to enhance the ionization current measurement capability of the 4$\pi\gamma$ ionization chamber radioactivity standard at the National Institute of Metrology (NIM), China. Besides, it has broad application prospects in physical experiments and fundamental metrology. The design of the measurement system is optimized through circuit analysis and simulation. The structure of the integrating capacitor array is redesigned to reduce the error of the amplification gain, and a relay is used as the reset switch to achieve improved noise and bias. The digital readout and control module is also enhanced in terms of flexibility and functionality. High-precision test platforms utilizing the standard small current source at NIM China and an ionization chamber were developed to evaluate the performance of the system. The results demonstrate an ultra-low noise floor &lt;1 fA/$\surd$Hz and a low current bias &lt;1 fA, as well as a low temperature coefficient of the amplification gain of 2.1 ppm/{\textdegree}C. The short-term stability and linearity of the gain are also tested and exhibit comparable indicators to those of the Keithley 6430. Reasonable results are obtained in the long-term reproducibility test. Therefore, the system enables high-precision measurements for small direct currents and shows promise for applications in ionization chambers.</description>

      <title>Heterodyne coherent detection of the electric field temporal trace emitted by frequency-modulated comb lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frequency-modulated (FM) combs are produced by mode-locked lasers in which the electric field has a linearly chirped frequency and nearly constant amplitude. This regime of operation occurs naturally in certain laser systems and constitutes a valuable alternative to generate spectra with equidistant modes. Here, we use a low-noise fs-pulse comb as the local oscillator and combine dual comb heterodyne detection with time domain analysis of the multi-heterodyne signal to reveal the temporal trace of both amplitude and phase quadratures of FM comb lasers' electric field. This technique is applied to both a dense and a harmonic mid-infrared free-running quantum cascade laser frequency comb and shows direct evidence of the FM behavior together with the high degree of coherence of these sources. Our results furnish a deeper insight on the origin of the FM combs and pave the way to further improvement and optimization of these devices.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the performance of the event reconstruction algorithms in the JSNS$^2$ experiment using a $^{252}$Cf calibration source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: JSNS$^2$ searches for short baseline neutrino oscillations with a baseline of 24~meters and a target of 17~tonnes of the Gd-loaded liquid scintillator. The correct algorithm on the event reconstruction of events, which determines the position and energy of neutrino interactions in the detector, are essential for the physics analysis of the data from the experiment. Therefore, the performance of the event reconstruction is carefully checked with calibrations using $^{252}$Cf source. This manuscript describes the methodology and the performance of the event reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Metrology requirements for the integrated luminosity measurement using small angle Bhabha scattering at ILC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03024v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precision measurement of the integrated luminosity $\mathcal{L}$ at future Higgs factories, including ILC, is of crucial importance for the cross-section measurements, and in particular for the line-shape measurements at the Z-pole. Since there is no up-to-date estimate of the integrated luminosity uncertainties arising from metrology effects at ILC, here we review the metrology requirements for the targeted precision of $\mathcal{L}$ at foreseen ILC center-of-mass energies: 91.2 GeV, 250 GeV, 500 GeV and 1 TeV, using small-angle Bhabha scattering.</description>
