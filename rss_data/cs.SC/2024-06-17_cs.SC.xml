      <title>Sparse Tensors and Subdivision Methods for Finding the Zero Set of Polynomial Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding the solutions to a system of multivariate polynomial equations is a fundamental problem in mathematics and computer science. It involves evaluating the polynomials at many points, often chosen from a grid.  In most current methods, such as subdivision, homotopy continuation, or marching cube algorithms, polynomial evaluation is treated as a black box, repeating the process for each point. We propose a new approach that partially evaluates the polynomials, allowing us to efficiently reuse computations across multiple points in a grid. Our method leverages the Compressed Sparse Fiber data structure to efficiently store and process subsets of grid points. We integrated our amortized evaluation scheme into a subdivision algorithm. Experimental results show that our approach is efficient in practice. Notably, our software \texttt{voxelize} can successfully enclose curves defined by two trivariate polynomial equations of degree $100$, a problem that was previously intractable.</description>

      <title>Neural Concept Binder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The challenge in object-based visual reasoning lies in generating descriptive yet distinct concept representations. Moreover, doing this in an unsupervised fashion requires human users to understand a model's learned concepts and potentially revise false concepts. In addressing this challenge, we introduce the Neural Concept Binder, a new framework for deriving discrete concept representations resulting in what we term "concept-slot encodings". These encodings leverage both "soft binding" via object-centric block-slot encodings and "hard binding" via retrieval-based inference. The Neural Concept Binder facilitates straightforward concept inspection and direct integration of external knowledge, such as human input or insights from other AI models like GPT-4. Additionally, we demonstrate that incorporating the hard binding mechanism does not compromise performance; instead, it enables seamless integration into both neural and symbolic modules for intricate reasoning tasks, as evidenced by evaluations on our newly introduced CLEVR-Sudoku dataset.</description>
