      <title>Theoretical analysis of a two-dimensional bilayer convection-diffusion-reaction-source problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the two-dimensional thermal behavior of a bilayer medium subject to both internal and external heat sources. The model incorporates diffusion, advection, and temperature-dependent volumetric heat generation or absorption in each layer, as well as general convective conditions on the external boundaries. The influence of interfacial thermal resistance between the two materials is also considered. An analytical solution is developed using Fourier-based techniques, and a stable and convergent finite difference method is proposed to analyze particular scenarios. The theoretical results are validated against known solutions and numerical simulations, demonstrating consistency with the expected physical behavior. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of heat transfer phenomena in layered systems and offer potential insights for optimizing thermal performance in engineering applications involving composite materials.</description>

      <title>Quaternion wavefunction development of incompressible inviscid fluid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quaternion wavefunction formulation that reduces the incompressible Euler equations to a single nonlinear Schr\"odinger-type equation. The velocity field emerges from a complex quaternion wavefunction $\Psi \in \mathbb{C} \otimes \mathbb{H}$ satisfying a constrained Gross-Pitaevskii equation, with incompressibility enforced through a holomorphic constraint on quaternion space. This formulation preserves all conservation laws through a natural Lagrangian structure and reduces the system from four coupled nonlinear equations (three velocity components plus pressure) to one quaternion field equation with an algebraic constraint. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by deriving analytical solutions for three-dimensional flow past a sphere, obtaining the drag coefficient $C_D \approx 0.47$ at Reynolds number Re $= 1000$ and predicting the onset of vortex shedding at $\text{Re}_c \approx 270$, in excellent agreement with experiments. The formulation provides a new mathematical framework for inviscid fluid dynamics and suggests efficient numerical algorithms exploiting quaternion structure.</description>

      <title>Shocks Under Control: Taming Transonic Compressible Flow over an RAE2822 Airfoil with Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active flow control of compressible transonic shock-boundary layer interactions over a two-dimensional RAE2822 airfoil at Re = 50,000 is investigated using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The flow field exhibits highly unsteady dynamics, including complex shock-boundary layer interactions, shock oscillations, and the generation of Kutta waves from the trailing edge. A high-fidelity CFD solver, employing a fifth-order spectral discontinuous Galerkin scheme in space and a strong-stability-preserving Runge-Kutta (5,4) method in time, together with adaptive mesh refinement capability, is used to obtain the accurate flow field. Synthetic jet actuation is employed to manipulate these unsteady flow features, while the DRL agent autonomously discovers effective control strategies through direct interaction with high-fidelity compressible flow simulations. The trained controllers effectively mitigate shock-induced separation, suppress unsteady oscillations, and manipulate aerodynamic forces under transonic conditions. In the first set of experiments, aimed at both drag reduction and lift enhancement, the DRL-based control reduces the average drag coefficient by 13.78% and increases lift by 131.18%, thereby improving the lift-to-drag ratio by 121.52%, which underscores its potential for managing complex flow dynamics. In the second set, targeting drag reduction while maintaining lift, the DRL-based control achieves a 25.62% reduction in drag and a substantial 196.30% increase in lift, accompanied by markedly diminished oscillations. In this case, the lift-to-drag ratio improves by 220.26%.</description>

      <title>Resonant spectral cascade in pulsatile flow triggered by arterial geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing geometric complexity of arteries with age is a well-established risk factor for cardiovascular disease, yet the precise physical mechanisms by which geometry interacts with blood flow remain debated. While complex geometry is known to increase viscous resistance, its active role in modulating flow dynamics is not fully understood. Here we solve a mathematical model to show that arterial geometry can trigger a resonant transfer of energy to short-wavelength components of the flow. The investigation, conducted over a physiological range of Womersley numbers (Wo, a dimensionless measure of pulsation frequency), reveal a dual dynamic. The global wave energy consistently decays, confirmed by a negative growth rate (G &lt; 0), indicating that the flow does not become exponentially unstable. However, a spectral broadening ratio (R), which quantifies the energy in high-wavenumber versus low-wavenumber modes, exhibits a sharp, non-monotonic peak at an intermediate Wo. This result identifies a resonant frequency at which geometry is maximally efficient at generating spectral complexity, even as the overall flow attenuates. These findings reframe the role of arterial geometry from a passive dissipator to an active modulator of the flow's spectral content, suggesting that spectral diagnostics could provide a sensitive marker for vascular health.</description>

      <title>Wave-crests around obstacles in odd viscous liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The values of liquid odd-viscosity coefficients remain largely unknown, with only a single experimental measurement reported to date [Nature Physics 15, 1188 (2019)]. In this work, inspired by the well-known consequences of dispersion surfaces in classical liquids from the work of Lighthill, we theoretically determine the shapes of constant-phase wave crests formed around obstacles moving at constant velocity in two- and three-dimensional odd viscous liquids, which may or may not undergo rigid rotation. From this analysis, we derive parametric relations that the odd-viscosity coefficients must satisfy, providing a framework for their experimental determination.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Regime Diagram of Dynamical Modes of Triple Flickering Buoyant Diffusion Flames: Experimental and Model Investigations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The triple-flame system serves as the fundamental unit for understanding multi-flame interactions, revealing critical coupling mechanisms that scale to complex burner arrays. In this study, we investigated triple flame oscillators, consisting of three flickering laminar buoyant diffusion flames arranged in an isosceles triangular configuration, to construct a comparative regime diagram of dynamical modes. To overcome the limited experimental observability caused by the discretization of geometric parameters, we enabled continuous motion of the vertex flame at a controlled speed V, while independently varying the base length L and the fuel flow rate Q. We conducted a systematic investigation of the triple flame coupling behaviors by varying the triangle size, fuel flow rate, and vertex flame movement velocity. Based on the experimental observations, a comprehensive regime diagram was established to classify the dynamical modes of triple flickering buoyant diffusion flames. Notably, three previously unreported dynamical modes were identified for the first time. To interpret these complex flame interactions, a Stuart-Landau oscillator model with time-delay coupling was employed, which successfully reproduces the experimentally observed dynamical modes. Experimentally observed dynamical modes reveal a bifurcation diagram for the coupled triple Stuart-Landau system, elucidating the transitions between different synchronization modes.</description>

      <title>Soap Film Drainage Under Tunable Gravity Using a Centrifugal Thin Film Balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface bubbles are an abundant source of aerosols, with important implications for climate processes. In this context, we investigate the stability and thinning dynamics of soap films under effective gravity fields. Experiments are performed using a centrifugal thin-film balance capable of generating accelerations from 0.2 up to 100 times standard gravity, combined with thin-film interferometry to obtain time-resolved thickness maps. Across all experimental conditions, the drainage dynamics are shown to be governed by capillary suction and marginal regeneration-a mechanism in which thick regions of the film are continuously replaced by thin film elements (TFEs) formed at the meniscus. We consistently recover a thickness ratio of 0.8 - 0.9 between the TFEs and the adjacent film, in agreement with previous observations under standard gravity. The measured thinning rates also follow the predicted scaling laws. We identified that gravity has three distinct effects: (i) it induces a strong stretching of the initial film, extending well beyond the linear-elastic regime; (ii) it controls the meniscus size, and thereby the amplitude of the capillary suction and the drainage rate; and (iii) it reveals an inertia-to-viscous transition in the motion of TFEs within the film. These results are supported by theoretical modeling and highlight the robustness of marginal regeneration and capillary-driven drainage under extreme gravity conditions.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian chaos and the enstrophy cascade in Ekman-Navier-Stokes two-dimensional turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional turbulence with linear (Ekman) friction exhibits spectral properties that deviate from the classical Kraichnan prediction for the direct enstrophy cascade. In particular, for sufficiently small viscosity and large friction, the enstrophy flux is suppressed in the cascade and, as a consequence, the small-scale vorticity field becomes passively transported by the large-scale, chaotic flow. We numerically address this problem by investigating how the statistics of the Lagrangian Finite Time Lyapunov Exponent in 2D Ekman-Navier-Stokes simulations are affected by the friction coefficient and by the other parameters of the flow. We derive a simple phenomenological model that interpolates the dependence of the Lyapunov exponent on the flow statistics from the large friction limit, where analytical predictions are available, to the small friction region. We find that the distribution of the FTLE around this mean value is always close to a Gaussian, and this allows to make a simple prediction for the correction of the spectral slope of the direct cascade which is in very good agreement with the numerical results.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Backscatter for Grey-Area Mitigation in Hybrid RANS-LES Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A scale-resolving simulation methodology that includes stochastic energy backscatter is incorporated into a proprietary block-structured compressible flow solver. Particular attention is devoted to the discretisation of the convective terms in the averaged/filtered governing equations. The objective is to achieve satisfactory dissipation and dispersion properties, while minimising the number of modifications to be made to the existing RANS solver, which employs, by default, a second-order accurate central scheme with Jameson-Schmidt-Turkel scalar artificial dissipation. A novel blending strategy, combining non-dissipative and strongly dissipative numerical discretisations, is proposed to enhance the overall numerical stability. First of all, the model is calibrated using the classic decay of isotropic homogeneous turbulence. Then, its effectiveness in mitigating the grey area is shown through the simulation of the mixing co-flow between the wake originating downstream of an airfoil at zero angle of attack and the zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layer developing over a flat plate.</description>

      <title>Effect of Turbulence-Closure Consistency on Airfoil Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an inverse flow problem in which the airfoil shape is inferred from its wake signature, namely the velocity field in the wake of a target airfoil. This is an ill-posed problem and highly sensitive to the accuracy and consistency of the employed turbulence closure. We first demonstrate that shape identification based on a single flow condition is ill-posed, whereas incorporating multiple wake signatures obtained at different angles of attack substantially mitigates this ill-posedness. We then compare the inferred geometries obtained using different turbulence closures and find that inconsistencies among the models lead to markedly divergent shapes. These findings underscore that turbulence-closure consistency is essential for reliable shape identification and further suggest that effective turbulence models must ensure not only accurate predictions but also physically consistent sensitivities-a principle that should guide the development of both classical and data-driven closure models.</description>

      <title>Coarse-graining Algorithms for the Eulerian-Lagrangian Simulation of Particle-laden Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present article, novel Coarse-Graining (CG) algorithms for the Eulerian-Lagrangian (EL) simulation of particle-laden flows are proposed. These include different variants of Reproducing Kernel Particle Methods (RKPM) and an extended Diffusion Two-Step Method (DTSM) for highly polydisperse flows. Owing to the dynamic nature of the kernel function in RKPMs, CG algorithms with high-order consistency properties are constructed and the extra physics of the fluid-particle interaction torque effect on the two-way coupling force distributed to the fluid is taken into consideration. To increase the robustness of RKPMs, they are hybridized with other simple CG algorithms in such a way that each model is activated in the range of its validity. The performance of the new CG algorithms is carefully assessed in comparison to other widely-used algorithms by devising four benchmarks and several grid-independence tests. Based on the analyses, the first-order RKPM demonstrates the best performance in terms of 8 attributes, including conservativity, grid-independency, smoothness, etc., among all algorithms and is recommended when the accuracy is of prime importance. However, due to its higher computational cost compared to the extended DTSM, the latter model would be an affordable alternative for large-scale discrete element method problems when the computational cost is critical.</description>

      <title>Wall-Modeled Large-Eddy Simulation of Turbulent Non-Newtonian Power-Law Fluid Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For high-fidelity predictions of turbulent flows in complex practical engineering problems, the Wall-Modeled (WM) Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) has aroused great interest. In the present study, we prove that the conventional Wall-Stress Models (WSMs) developed for WMLES of Newtonian fluids fail to predict the shear-thinning-induced drag reduction in power-law fluids. Therefore, we propose novel algebraic, integrated, and Ordinary-Differential-Equation (ODE) WSMs, for the first time, for WMLES of power-law Non-Newtonian (NN) fluids and assess their performance against reference Wall-Resolved (WR) LES solutions. In addition, the effects of the key model parameters, including the WSM type, sampling height, sampling cell, and axial grid resolution are explored, and it is revealed that turbulent NN flow predictions have a much higher sensitivity to the choice of WSM, compared to their Newtonian counterparts. It is manifested that, in contrast to WRLES, accurate modeling of the mean apparent and subgrid-scale NN viscosities in the NNODE model can improve the predictions considerably. Therefore, closures with lower uncertainties on coarse WMLES grids are sought for these terms. Finally, the best performance for the present test cases is obtained via the integrated NN WSM, sampling at the lower edge of the log layer within the third off-the-wall grid cell. Nevertheless, the new NNODE WSM can have an advantage in the presence of non-equilibrium effects in more complex problems.</description>

      <title>General Implicit Runge-Kutta Integrators for Multifluid Gas-Dust Aerodynamic Drag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of aerodynamic drag is a fundamental step in simulating dust dynamics in hydrodynamical simulations. We propose a novel integration scheme, designed to be compatible with Strang splitting techniques, which allows for the straightforward integration of external forces and hydrodynamic fluxes in general-purpose hydrodynamic simulation codes. Moreover, this solver leverages an analytical solution to the problem of drag acceleration, ensuring linear complexity even in cases with multiple dust grain sizes, as opposed to the cubic scaling of methods that require a matrix inversion step. This new General Implicit Runge-Kutta integrator (GIRK) is evaluated using standard benchmarks for dust dynamics such as DUSTYBOX, DUSTYWAVE, and DUSTYSHOCK. The results demonstrate not only the accuracy of the method but also the expected scalings in terms of accuracy, convergence to equilibrium, and execution time. GIRK can be easily implemented in hydrodynamical simulations alongside hydrodynamical steps and external forces, and is especially useful in simulations with a large number of dust grain sizes.</description>

      <title>Random initial data and average shock time in the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain with long-wavelength random initial data. When the energy per particle is small, thermal equilibrium is not reached on a fast timescale and the system enters prethermalization. The formation of the prethermal state is characterized by the development of a Burgers-type shock and the onset of a turbulent-like spectrum with a time dependent exponent $\zeta(t)$ in the inertial range. We perform a significant step forward by demonstrating that these features are robust under generic long-wavelength random initial conditions. By employing advanced probabilistic techniques inspired by the works of Dudley and Talagrand, we derive a sharp asymptotic expression for the average shock time in the thermodynamic limit. For large $p$, this time scales as $(p \sqrt{\log p})^{-1}$, where $p$ is the number of excited modes proving that it is an intensive quantity up to a logarithmic correction in the size of the system.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Optimization of Multi-Parameter Micromixers Using a Scientific Machine Learning Framework</title>

Abstract: Multidimensional optimization has consistently been a critical challenge in engineering. However, traditional simulation-based optimization methods have long been plagued by significant limitations: they are typically capable of optimizing only a single problem at a time and require substantial computational time for meshing and numerical simulation. This paper introduces a novel framework leveraging cutting-edge Scientific Machine Learning (Sci-ML) methodologies to overcome these inherent drawbacks of conventional approaches. The proposed method provides instantaneous solutions to a spectrum of complex, multidimensional optimization problems. A micromixer case study is employed to demonstrate this methodology. An agent, operating on a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) architecture, serves as the optimizer to explore the relationships between key problem parameters. This optimizer interacts with an environment constituted by a parametric Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), which responds to the agent's actions at a significantly higher speed than traditional numerical methods. The agent's objective, conditioned on the Schmidt number is to discover the optimal geometric and physical parameters that maximize the micromixer's efficiency. After training the agent across a wide range of Schmidt numbers, we analyzed the resulting optimal designs. Across this entire spectrum, the achieved efficiency was consistently greater than the baseline, normalized value. The maximum efficiency occurred at a Schmidt number of 13.3, demonstrating an improvement of approximately 32%. Finally, a comparative analysis with a Genetic Algorithm was conducted under equivalent conditions to underscore the advantages of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic multiphysics modeling reveals how blood pulsation drives CSF flow, pressure, and brain deformation under physiological and injection conditions</title>

Abstract: Intrathecal (IT) injection is an effective way to deliver drugs to the brain bypassing the blood-brain barrier. To evaluate and optimize IT drug delivery, it is necessary to understand the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics in the central nervous system (CNS). In combination with experimental measurements, computational modeling plays an important role in reconstructing CSF flow in the CNS. Existing models have provided valuable insights into the CSF dynamics; however, most neglect the effects of tissue mechanics, focus on partial geometries, or rely on measured CSF flow rates under specific conditions, leaving full-CNS CSF flow field predictions across different physiological states underexplored. Here, we propose a comprehensive multiphysics computational model of the CNS with three key features: (1) it is implemented on a fully closed geometry of CNS; (2) it includes the interaction between CSF and poroelastic tissue as well as the compliant spinal dura mater; (3) it has potential for predictive simulations because it only needs data on cardiac blood pulsation into the brain. Our simulations under physiological conditions demonstrate that our model accurately reconstructs the CSF pulsation and captures both the craniocaudal attenuation and phase shift of CSF flow along the spinal subarachnoid space (SAS). When applied to the simulation of IT drug delivery, our model successfully captures the intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation during injection and subsequent recovery after injections. The proposed multiphysics model provides a unified and extensible framework that allows parametric studies of CSF flow dynamics and optimization of IT injections, serving as a strong foundation for integration of additional physiological mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Dynamics of Roughness-Driven Flow in Soft Interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft lubricated contacts exhibit complex interfacial behaviours governed by the coupled effects of multiscale surface roughness and non-linear fluid-solid interactions. Accurately capturing this interplay across thin-film flows is challenging due to the strong synergy between contact mechanics and hydrodynamic flow, spanning over various spatiotemporal scales. Here, we develop a rigorous computational framework to simulate the frictional behaviour of soft lubricated interfaces; its modularity and the use of optimal solvers provides solutions for realistic configurations in lubrication regimes ranging from direct solid contact to complete fluid separation. Surface roughness is described via Persson's statistical theory as well as a deterministic Conjugate Gradient with Fast Fourier Transform (CG-FFT) approach, while limitations associated with classical half-space models are addressed by developing the Reduced Stiffness Method (RSM) to rigorously model pressure-induced surface responses. The integrated framework captures the full evolution of frictional behaviour, validated against experiments on rough elastomer-glass interfaces, revealing how surface roughness and material compliance together drive the transition from solid contact to fluid-mediated sliding. The developed approach establishes a robust and versatile simulation tool for analysing a plethora of soft interfacial systems shaped by fluid-solid interactions, with potential applications including but not limited to biomechanics, soft robotics and microfluidic systems.</description>

      <title>Generalizable data-driven turbulence closure modeling on unstructured grids with differentiable physics</title>

Abstract: Differentiable physical simulators are proving to be valuable tools for developing data-driven models for computational fluid dynamics (CFD). In particular, these simulators enable end-to-end training of machine learning (ML) models embedded within CFD solvers. This paradigm enables novel algorithms which combine the generalization power and low cost of physics-based simulations with the flexibility and automation of deep learning methods. In this study, we introduce a framework for embedding deep learning models within a finite element solver for incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, specifically applying this approach to learn a subgrid-scale (SGS) closure with a graph neural network (GNN). We first demonstrate the feasibility of the approach on flow over a two-dimensional backward-facing step, using it as a proof of concept to show that solver-consistent training produces stable and physically meaningful closures. Then, we extend this to a turbulent flow over a three-dimensional backward-facing step. In this setting, the GNN-based closure not only attains low prediction errors, but also recovers key turbulence statistics and preserves multiscale turbulent structures. We further demonstrate that the closure can be identified in data-limited learning scenarios as well. Overall, the proposed end-to-end learning paradigm offers a viable pathway toward physically consistent and generalizable data-driven SGS modeling on complex and unstructured domains.</description>

      <title>Marangoni-driven freezing dynamics of supercooled binary droplets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solidification of droplets is of great importance to various technological applications, drawing considerable attention from scientists aiming to unravel the fundamental physical mechanisms. In the case of multicomponent droplets undergoing solidification, the emergence of concentration gradients may trigger significant interfacial flows that dominate the freezing dynamics. Here, we experimentally investigate the fascinating interfacial freezing dynamics of supercooled ethanol-water droplets, accompanied with the migration and growth of massive ice particles. We reveal that these unique freezing dynamics are driven by solidification-induced solutal Marangoni flow within the droplets. Our model, which incorporates the temperature- and concentration-dependent properties of the ethanol-water mixture, quantitatively predicts both the migration velocity and the growth rate of the ice particles. The former is determined by the solutal Marangoni flow velocity, while the latter is governed by a balance between the latent heat release and the enhanced thermal dissipation by the Marangoni flow. Moreover, we show that the final wrapping state of droplets can be modulated by the concentration of ethanol. Our findings may pave the way for novel insights into the physicochemical hydrodynamics of multicomponent liquids undergoing phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Equivalent slip length of flow around a super-hydrophobic cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this research, a two-dimensional numerical simulation is conducted to determine the equivalent wall slip length for flow around a circular cylinder featuring a super-hydrophobic surface. The super-hydrophobic surface is modeled as an alternating distribution of slip and no-slip conditions along the cylinder's surface. The smallest unit of this alternating pattern is referred to as a monomer. The study takes into account the Reynolds number and two critical dimensionless parameters: the gas fraction (GF) and the ratio l/a. GF indicates the proportion of the slip length relative to the total length of the monomer, while l/a denotes the ratio of the monomer length (l) to the cylinder's radius (a). The ranges considered for the Reynolds number, GF, and l/a are from 0.2 to 180, 0.1 to 0.99, and $\pi$/80 to $\pi$/5, respectively. A dimensionless number, the Knudsen number (Kn), is introduced to measure the ratio between the equivalent slip length ($\lambda$) and the cylinder's diameter (D). By equating the integral wall friction resistance on the cylinder surface, a quantitative relationship between the equivalent Kn and the parameters (Re, GF, l/a) is established. A meticulous comparison of flow parameters between the equivalent slip length model and the slip-no-slip scenario reveals that the slip length model is an effective approximation for the slip-no-slip alternating model.</description>

      <title>Long-Time Asymptotics of Passive Scalar Transport in Periodically Modulated Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates the long-time asymptotic behavior of a diffusing passive scalar advected by fluid flow in a straight channel with a periodically varying cross-section. The goal is to derive an asymptotic expansion for the scalar field and estimate the timescale over which this expansion remains valid, thereby generalizing Taylor dispersion theory to periodically modulated channels. By reformulating the eigenvalue problem for the advection-diffusion operator on a unit cell using a Floquet-Bloch-type eigenfunction expansion, we extend the classical Fourier integral of the flat-channel problem to a periodic setting, yielding an integral representation of the scalar field. This representation reveals a slow manifold that governs the algebraically decaying dynamics, while the difference between the scalar field and the slow manifold decays exponentially in time. Building on this, we derive a long-time asymptotic expansion of the scalar field. We show that the validity timescale of the expansion is determined by the real part of the eigenvalues of a modified advection-diffusion operator, which depends solely on the flow and geometry within a single unit cell. This framework offers a rigorous and systematic method for estimating mixing timescales in channels with complex geometries. We show that non-flat channel boundaries tend to increase the timescale, while transverse velocity components tend to decrease it. The approach developed here is broadly applicable and can be extended to derive long-time asymptotics for other systems with periodic coefficients or periodic microstructures.</description>

      <title>Using Optimal Transport Aligned Latent Embeddings for Separated Flow Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantifying differences between flow fields is a key challenge in fluid mechanics, particularly when evaluating the effectiveness of flow control. Traditional vector metrics, such as the Euclidean distance, provide straightforward pointwise comparisons but can fail to distinguish distributional changes in flow fields. To address this limitation, we employ optimal transport (OT) theory, which is a mathematical framework built on probability and measure theory. By aligning Euclidean distances between flow fields in a latent space learned by an autoencoder with the corresponding OT geodesics, we seek to learn low-dimensional representations of flow fields that are interpretable from the perspective of unbalanced OT. As a demonstration, we utilize this OT-based analysis on controlled, separated flows past a NACA 0012 airfoil with a chord-based Reynolds number of 23,000 and a freestream Mach number of 0.3 for two angles of attack of $6^\circ$ and $9^\circ$. For each angle of attack, we identify a two-dimensional embedding that succinctly captures the different effective regimes of flow responses and control performance, characterized by the degree of suppression of the separation bubble and secondary effects from laminarization and trailing-edge separation. The interpretation of the latent representation was found to be consistent across the two angles of attack, suggesting that the OT-based latent encoding was capable of extracting physical relationships that are common across the different suites of cases. This study demonstrates the potential utility of optimal transport in the analysis and interpretation of complex flow fields.</description>

      <title>Assessment of the Gradient Jump Penalisation in Large-Eddy Simulations of Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research investigates the efficacy of the gradient jump penalisation (GJP) in large eddy simulations (LES) when coupled with active subgrid-scale (SGS) models. GJP is a stabilisation method tailored for the continuous Galerkin spectral element method, aiming at mitigating non-physical oscillations induced by discontinuous velocity gradients across element interfaces. We demonstrate that GJP effectively smoothens fields from LES without a salient impact on flow dynamics for the Taylor--Green vortex (TGV) at $Re=1600$, periodic hill flows at bulk Reynolds numbers $Re_b=10595$ and $37000$, as well as turbulent channel flow at $Re_{\tau} \approx 550$. In the TGV case, the application of GJP results in decreased fluctuations at only high wavenumbers compared to simulations without GJP. The periodic hill flow simulations indicate the applicability of GJP in wall-resolved LES (WRLES) involving curved geometries, though it tends to dissipate some of the finer details in the solution. Finally, in the analysis of the canonical turbulent channel flow cases, GJP leads a higher resolved turbulent kinetic energy than simulations without GJP and direct numerical simulations. GJP's mechanism is identified as providing enhanced dissipation at high wavenumbers but accompanied with insufficient dissipation at low wavenumbers, leading to a pronounced spectral cut-off. Non-physical oscillations on element interfaces are reflected as spikes in the power spectral density. By evaluating the sharpness of the strongest spike, GJP is shown to smoothen the spectra, however without completely removing the gradient jumps at low computational resolution.</description>

      <title>Temperature transformation recovering the compressible law of the wall for turbulent channel flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Velocity and temperature distributions are both crucial for modeling compressible wall-bounded turbulent flows. The compressible law of the wall for velocity has been extensively examined through velocity transformations. However, the issue of a well-established temperature transformation remains open. We propose a new temperature transformation for compressible turbulent channel flow. Our approach is based on the analysis of momentum and energy balance equations in the overlap layer. It accounts for the influences of mixing length model, the work of the body force, and the turbulent kinetic energy transport. Two types of temperature transformations are obtained: Van Driest type (VD-type) and semi-local type (SL-type). The performance of these transformations is evaluated using data from direct numerical simulations and wall-resolved large eddy simulations of compressible turbulent channel flow. Both the VD-type and SL-type transformations apply to isothermal and adiabatic walls. The SL-type transformation provides better data collapse in the viscous sublayer and buffer layer, thereby recovering the temperature law of the wall. When a suitable mixing length model is applied, the SL-type transformation yields results that agree with the incompressible temperature profile or exhibit extended logarithmic behavior. Results from the present study highlight careful consideration of the turbulent kinetic energy transport term in different thermal boundary conditions. Applications of the proposed transformation in near-wall modeling and its potential extension to more general configurations are also discussed.</description>

Abstract: We present semi-analytical solutions for the evolution of both the temperature and chemical potentials for viscous Gubser flow with conserved charges. Such a solution can be especially useful in testing numerical codes intended to simulate relativistic fluids with large chemical potentials. The freeze-out hypersurface profiles for constant energy density are calculated, along with the corresponding normal vectors and presented as a new unit test for numerical codes. We also compare the influence of the equation of state on the semi-analytical solutions. We benchmark the newly developed Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code CCAKE that includes both shear viscosity and three conserved charges. The numerical solutions are in excellent agreement with the semi-analytical solution and also are able to accurately reproduce the hypersurface at freeze-out.</description>

      <title>X-ray particle tracking velocimetry for steady-state rheological characterization: Case study of a complex polymer melt flow in material extrusion additive manufacturing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce X-ray Particle Tracking Velocimetry (XPTV) as a promising method to quantitatively resolve the velocity field and associated rheological information of polymer melt flow within the nozzle of a fused filament fabrication (FFF) printer. Employing tungsten powder as tracer particles embedded within a polymer filament, we investigate melt flow dynamics through an aluminum nozzle in a custom setup comparable to commercial printers. The velocity profiles obtained via XPTV reveal significant deviations from classical Newtonian flow, highlighting complex heterogeneous and non-isothermal behavior within the melt. From these measurements, we determine the local infinitesimal strain rate tensor and correlate flow-induced non-Newtonian effects to spatially varying temperature distributions, reflecting incomplete thermal homogenization within the nozzle. We complement the experiments with computational fluid dynamics simulations of the flow inside the printing nozzle, incorporating filament melting through an enthalpy-porosity formulation and treating the air-polymer melt interface using a two-phase approach. The simulated velocity profiles agree closely with the XPTV measurements across the investigated operating conditions, supporting the experimental interpretation. Our findings demonstrate the capability of XPTV to quantify both velocity fields and rheological properties, underscoring its potential as a tool for investigating opaque polymer melt flows in additive manufacturing, industrial processing, and rheology. To our knowledge, this is the first application of XPTV to polymer melt rheology. It enables measurements that are inaccessible to conventional optical methods.</description>

      <title>Efficient Collision Algorithms in DSMC for Rarefied Gas Dynamics: Markovian NTC-Pre-Scan and Bernoulli-Trial Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The collision process is essential to the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method, as it incorporates the fundamental principles of the Boltzmann and Kac stochastic equations. A series of collision algorithms, known as the Bernoulli-trials (BT) family schemes, have been proposed based on the Kac stochastic equation. The primary impetus of this paper is to rectify a long-standing theoretical flaw in the widely used no-time-counter (NTC) collision algorithm. We demonstrate that the standard NTC scheme is fundamentally non-Markovian, relying on a fixed majorant product that introduces a system 'memory' and leads to inaccuracies at low particle counts. We propose a new algorithm, NTC-Pre-Scan, which transforms the scheme into a fully Markovian process. When the repeated collisions are not crucial, our new NTC scheme, called NTC-Pre-Scan, could work accurately with a very low number of particles per cell (PPC), average PPC&lt;1, i.e., PPC=0.01, which means with several empty cells in simulations. This contrasts with the standard NTC schemes, which typically require a PPC greater than 1. Then, a systematic evaluation of different BT-based collision partner selection schemes, including the simplified Bernoulli trials (SBT), generalized Bernoulli trials (GBT), symmetrized and simplified Bernoulli trials (SSBT), and the newly proposed symmetrized and generalized Bernoulli trials (SGBT), is conducted to treat some benchmark rarefied gas dynamics problems. The results show that the BT-based collision algorithms and NTC-Pre-scan successfully maintain the collision frequency as the number of particles per cell decreases.</description>
