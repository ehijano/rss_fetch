      <title>Prediction-sharing During Training and Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two firms are engaged in a competitive prediction task. Each firm has two sources of data -- labeled historical data and unlabeled inference-time data -- and uses the former to derive a prediction model, and the latter to make predictions on new instances. We study data-sharing contracts between the firms. The novelty of our study is to introduce and highlight the differences between contracts that share prediction models only, contracts to share inference-time predictions only, and contracts to share both. Our analysis proceeds on three levels. First, we develop a general Bayesian framework that facilitates our study. Second, we narrow our focus to two natural settings within this framework: (i) a setting in which the accuracy of each firm's prediction model is common knowledge, but the correlation between the respective models is unknown; and (ii) a setting in which two hypotheses exist regarding the optimal predictor, and one of the firms has a structural advantage in deducing it. Within these two settings we study optimal contract choice. More specifically, we find the individually rational and Pareto-optimal contracts for some notable cases, and describe specific settings where each of the different sharing contracts emerge as optimal. Finally, in the third level of our analysis we demonstrate the applicability of our concepts in a synthetic simulation using real loan data.</description>

      <title>On the Pettis Integral Approach to Large Population Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of large population economies with incomplete information often entails the integration of a continuum of random variables. We showcase the usefulness of the integral notion \`a la Pettis (1938) to study such models. We present several results on Pettis integrals, including convenient sufficient conditions for Pettis integrability and Fubini-like exchangeability formulae, illustrated through a running example. Building on these foundations, we conduct a unified analysis of Bayesian games with arbitrarily many heterogeneous agents. We provide a sufficient condition on payoff structures, under which the equilibrium uniqueness is guaranteed across all signal structures. Our condition is parsimonious, as it turns out necessary when strategic interactions are undirected. We further identify the moment restrictions, imposed on the equilibrium action-state joint distribution, which have crucial implications for information designer's problem of persuading a population of strategically interacting agents. To attain these results, we introduce and develop novel mathematical tools, built on the theory of integral kernels and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces in functional analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a general argument against value incomparability, based on a new style of impossibility result. In particular, we show that, against plausible background assumptions, value incomparability creates an incompatibility between two very plausible principles for ranking lotteries: a weak ``negative dominance'' principle (to the effect that Lottery 1 can be better than Lottery 2 only if some possible outcome of Lottery 1 is better than some possible outcome of Lottery 2) and a weak form of ex ante Pareto (to the effect that, if Lottery 1 gives an unambiguously better prospect to some individuals than Lottery 2, and equally good prospects to everyone else, then Lottery 1 is better than Lottery 2). After spelling out our results, and the arguments based on them, we consider which principle the proponent of incomparability ought to reject.</description>
