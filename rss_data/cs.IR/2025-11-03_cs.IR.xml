      <title>Evaluating Perspectival Biases in Cross-Modal Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26861v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal retrieval systems are expected to operate in a semantic space, agnostic to the language or cultural origin of the query. In practice, however, retrieval outcomes systematically reflect perspectival biases: deviations shaped by linguistic prevalence and cultural associations. We study two such biases. First, prevalence bias refers to the tendency to favor entries from prevalent languages over semantically faithful entries in image-to-text retrieval. Second, association bias refers to the tendency to favor images culturally associated with the query over semantically correct ones in text-to-image retrieval. Results show that explicit alignment is a more effective strategy for mitigating prevalence bias. However, association bias remains a distinct and more challenging problem. These findings suggest that achieving truly equitable multimodal systems requires targeted strategies beyond simple data scaling and that bias arising from cultural association may be treated as a more challenging problem than one arising from linguistic prevalence.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Generative Recommendation: Data, Model, and Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems serve as foundational infrastructure in modern information ecosystems, helping users navigate digital content and discover items aligned with their preferences. At their core, recommender systems address a fundamental problem: matching users with items. Over the past decades, the field has experienced successive paradigm shifts, from collaborative filtering and matrix factorization in the machine learning era to neural architectures in the deep learning era. Recently, the emergence of generative models, especially large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models, have sparked a new paradigm: generative recommendation, which reconceptualizes recommendation as a generation task rather than discriminative scoring. This survey provides a comprehensive examination through a unified tripartite framework spanning data, model, and task dimensions. Rather than simply categorizing works, we systematically decompose approaches into operational stages-data augmentation and unification, model alignment and training, task formulation and execution. At the data level, generative models enable knowledge-infused augmentation and agent-based simulation while unifying heterogeneous signals. At the model level, we taxonomize LLM-based methods, large recommendation models, and diffusion approaches, analyzing their alignment mechanisms and innovations. At the task level, we illuminate new capabilities including conversational interaction, explainable reasoning, and personalized content generation. We identify five key advantages: world knowledge integration, natural language understanding, reasoning capabilities, scaling laws, and creative generation. We critically examine challenges in benchmark design, model robustness, and deployment efficiency, while charting a roadmap toward intelligent recommendation assistants that fundamentally reshape human-information interaction.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Deep Text Hashing: Efficient Semantic Text Retrieval with Binary Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of textual content on the Internet, efficient large-scale semantic text retrieval has garnered increasing attention from both academia and industry. Text hashing, which projects original texts into compact binary hash codes, is a crucial method for this task. By using binary codes, the semantic similarity computation for text pairs is significantly accelerated via fast Hamming distance calculations, and storage costs are greatly reduced. With the advancement of deep learning, deep text hashing has demonstrated significant advantages over traditional, data-independent hashing techniques. By leveraging deep neural networks, these methods can learn compact and semantically rich binary representations directly from data, overcoming the performance limitations of earlier approaches. This survey investigates current deep text hashing methods by categorizing them based on their core components: semantic extraction, hash code quality preservation, and other key technologies. We then present a detailed evaluation schema with results on several popular datasets, followed by a discussion of practical applications and open-source tools for implementation. Finally, we conclude by discussing key challenges and future research directions, including the integration of deep text hashing with large language models to further advance the field.

      <title>Traceable Drug Recommendation over Medical Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drug recommendation (DR) systems aim to support healthcare professionals in selecting appropriate medications based on patients' medical conditions. State-of-the-art approaches utilize deep learning techniques for improving DR, but fall short in providing any insights on the derivation process of recommendations -- a critical limitation in such high-stake applications. We propose TraceDR, a novel DR system operating over a medical knowledge graph (MKG), which ensures access to large-scale and high-quality information. TraceDR simultaneously predicts drug recommendations and related evidence within a multi-task learning framework, enabling traceability of medication recommendations. For covering a more diverse set of diseases and drugs than existing works, we devise a framework for automatically constructing patient health records and release DrugRec, a new large-scale testbed for DR.</description>

      <title>Pairwise and Attribute-Aware Decision Tree-Based Preference Elicitation for Cold-Start Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems (RSs) are intelligent filtering methods that suggest items to users based on their inferred preferences, derived from their interaction history on the platform. Collaborative filtering-based RSs rely on users past interactions to generate recommendations. However, when a user is new to the platform, referred to as a cold-start user, there is no historical data available, making it difficult to provide personalized recommendations. To address this, rating elicitation techniques can be used to gather initial ratings or preferences on selected items, helping to build an early understanding of the user's tastes. Rating elicitation approaches are generally categorized into two types: non-personalized and personalized. Decision tree-based rating elicitation is a personalized method that queries users about their preferences at each node of the tree until sufficient information is gathered. In this paper, we propose an extension to the decision tree approach for rating elicitation in the context of music recommendation. Our method: (i) elicits not only item ratings but also preferences on attributes such as genres to better cluster users, and (ii) uses item pairs instead of single items at each node to more effectively learn user preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that both proposed enhancements lead to improved performance, particularly with a reduced number of queries.</description>

      <title>Interact-RAG: Reason and Interact with the Corpus, Beyond Black-Box Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly enhanced LLMs by incorporating external information. However, prevailing agentic RAG approaches are constrained by a critical limitation: they treat the retrieval process as a black-box querying operation. This confines agents' actions to query issuing, hindering its ability to tackle complex information-seeking tasks. To address this, we introduce Interact-RAG, a new paradigm that elevates the LLM agent from a passive query issuer into an active manipulator of the retrieval process. We dismantle the black-box with a Corpus Interaction Engine, equipping the agent with a set of action primitives for fine-grained control over information retrieval. To further empower the agent on the entire RAG pipeline, we first develop a reasoning-enhanced workflow, which enables both zero-shot execution and the synthesis of interaction trajectories. We then leverage this synthetic data to train a fully autonomous end-to-end agent via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), followed by refinement with Reinforcement Learning (RL). Extensive experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate that Interact-RAG significantly outperforms other advanced methods, validating the efficacy of our reasoning-interaction strategy.</description>

      <title>DGAI: Decoupled On-Disk Graph-Based ANN Index for Efficient Updates and Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On-disk graph-based indexes are widely used in approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search systems for large-scale, high-dimensional vectors. However, traditional coupled storage methods, which store vectors within the index, are inefficient for index updates. Coupled storage incurs excessive redundant vector reads and writes when updating the graph topology, leading to significant invalid I/O. To address this issue, we propose a decoupled storage architecture. While a decoupled architecture reduces query performance. To overcome this limitation, we design two tailored strategies: (i) a three-stage query mechanism that leverages multiple PQ compressed vectors to filter invalid I/O and computations, and (ii) an incremental page-level topological reordering strategy that incrementally inserts new nodes into pages containing their most similar neighbors to mitigate read amplification. Together, these techniques substantially reduce both I/O and computational overhead during ANN search. Experimental results show that the decoupled architecture improves update speed by 10.05x for insertions and 6.89x for deletions, while the three-stage query and incremental reordering enhance query efficiency by 2.66x compared to the traditional coupled architecture.</description>

      <title>LeMat-Synth: a multi-modal toolbox to curate broad synthesis procedure databases from scientific literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of synthesis procedures remains a fundamental challenge in materials discovery, with procedural knowledge scattered across decades of scientific literature in unstructured formats that are challenging for systematic analysis. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal toolbox that employs large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) to automatically extract and organize synthesis procedures and performance data from materials science publications, covering text and figures. We curated 81k open-access papers, yielding LeMat-Synth (v 1.0): a dataset containing synthesis procedures spanning 35 synthesis methods and 16 material classes, structured according to an ontology specific to materials science. The extraction quality is rigorously evaluated on a subset of 2.5k synthesis procedures through a combination of expert annotations and a scalable LLM-as-a-judge framework. Beyond the dataset, we release a modular, open-source software library designed to support community-driven extension to new corpora and synthesis domains. Altogether, this work provides an extensible infrastructure to transform unstructured literature into machine-readable information. This lays the groundwork for predictive modeling of synthesis procedures as well as modeling synthesis--structure--property relationships.</description>

      <title>Compass: General Filtered Search across Vector and Structured Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing prevalence of hybrid vector and relational data necessitates efficient, general support for queries that combine high-dimensional vector search with complex relational filtering. However, existing filtered search solutions are fundamentally limited by specialized indices, which restrict arbitrary filtering and hinder integration with general-purpose DBMSs. This work introduces \textsc{Compass}, a unified framework that enables general filtered search across vector and structured data without relying on new index designs. Compass leverages established index structures -- such as HNSW and IVF for vector attributes, and B+-trees for relational attributes -- implementing a principled cooperative query execution strategy that coordinates candidate generation and predicate evaluation across modalities. Uniquely, Compass maintains generality by allowing arbitrary conjunctions, disjunctions, and range predicates, while ensuring robustness even with highly-selective or multi-attribute filters. Comprehensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Compass consistently outperforms NaviX, the only existing performant general framework, across diverse hybrid query workloads. It also matches the query throughput of specialized single-attribute indices in their favorite settings with only a single attribute involved, all while maintaining full generality and DBMS compatibility. Overall, Compass offers a practical and robust solution for achieving truly general filtered search in vector database systems.</description>

      <title>DRAMA: Unifying Data Retrieval and Analysis for Open-Domain Analytic Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manually conducting real-world data analyses is labor-intensive and inefficient. Despite numerous attempts to automate data science workflows, none of the existing paradigms or systems fully demonstrate all three key capabilities required to support them effectively: (1) open-domain data collection, (2) structured data transformation, and (3) analytic reasoning.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose DRAMA, an end-to-end paradigm that answers users' analytic queries in natural language on large-scale open-domain data. DRAMA unifies data collection, transformation, and analysis as a single pipeline. To quantitatively evaluate system performance on tasks representative of DRAMA, we construct a benchmark, DRAMA-Bench, consisting of two categories of tasks: claim verification and question answering, each comprising 100 instances. These tasks are derived from real-world applications that have gained significant public attention and require the retrieval and analysis of open-domain data. We develop DRAMA-Bot, a multi-agent system designed following DRAMA. It comprises a data retriever that collects and transforms data by coordinating the execution of sub-agents, and a data analyzer that performs structured reasoning over the retrieved data. We evaluate DRAMA-Bot on DRAMA-Bench together with five state-of-the-art baseline agents. DRAMA-Bot achieves 86.5% task accuracy at a cost of $0.05, outperforming all baselines with up to 6.9 times the accuracy and less than 1/6 of the cost. DRAMA is publicly available at https://github.com/uiuc-kang-lab/drama.</description>

      <title>Beyond a Million Tokens: Benchmarking and Enhancing Long-Term Memory in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating the abilities of large language models (LLMs) for tasks that require long-term memory and thus long-context reasoning, for example in conversational settings, is hampered by the existing benchmarks, which often lack narrative coherence, cover narrow domains, and only test simple recall-oriented tasks. This paper introduces a comprehensive solution to these challenges. First, we present a novel framework for automatically generating long (up to 10M tokens), coherent, and topically diverse conversations, accompanied by probing questions targeting a wide range of memory abilities. From this, we construct BEAM, a new benchmark comprising 100 conversations and 2,000 validated questions. Second, to enhance model performance, we propose LIGHT-a framework inspired by human cognition that equips LLMs with three complementary memory systems: a long-term episodic memory, a short-term working memory, and a scratchpad for accumulating salient facts. Our experiments on BEAM reveal that even LLMs with 1M token context windows (with and without retrieval-augmentation) struggle as dialogues lengthen. In contrast, LIGHT consistently improves performance across various models, achieving an average improvement of 3.5%-12.69% over the strongest baselines, depending on the backbone LLM. An ablation study further confirms the contribution of each memory component.</description>

      <title>Towards Universal Video Retrieval: Generalizing Video Embedding via Synthesized Multimodal Pyramid Curriculum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prevailing video retrieval paradigm is structurally misaligned, as narrow benchmarks incentivize correspondingly limited data and single-task training. Therefore, universal capability is suppressed due to the absence of a diagnostic evaluation that defines and demands multi-dimensional generalization. To break this cycle, we introduce a framework built on the co-design of evaluation, data, and modeling. First, we establish the Universal Video Retrieval Benchmark (UVRB), a suite of 16 datasets designed not only to measure performance but also to diagnose critical capability gaps across tasks and domains. Second, guided by UVRB's diagnostics, we introduce a scalable synthesis workflow that generates 1.55 million high-quality pairs to populate the semantic space required for universality. Finally, we devise the Modality Pyramid, a curriculum that trains our General Video Embedder (GVE) by explicitly leveraging the latent interconnections within our diverse data. Extensive experiments show GVE achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization on UVRB. In particular, our analysis reveals that popular benchmarks are poor predictors of general ability and that partially relevant retrieval is a dominant but overlooked scenario. Overall, our co-designed framework provides a practical path to escape the limited scope and advance toward truly universal video retrieval.</description>

Abstract: Efficient large-scale retrieval requires representations that are both compact and discriminative. Foundation models provide powerful visual and multimodal embeddings, but nearest neighbor search in these high-dimensional spaces is computationally expensive. Hashing offers an efficient alternative by enabling fast Hamming distance search with binary codes, yet existing approaches often rely on complex pipelines, multi-term objectives, designs specialized for a single learning paradigm, and long training times. We introduce CroVCA (Cross-View Code Alignment), a simple and unified principle for learning binary codes that remain consistent across semantically aligned views. A single binary cross-entropy loss enforces alignment, while coding-rate maximization serves as an anti-collapse regularizer to promote balanced and diverse codes. To implement this, we design HashCoder, a lightweight MLP hashing network with a final batch normalization layer to enforce balanced codes. HashCoder can be used as a probing head on frozen embeddings or to adapt encoders efficiently via LoRA fine-tuning. Across benchmarks, CroVCA achieves state-of-the-art results in just 5 training epochs. At 16 bits, it particularly well-for instance, unsupervised hashing on COCO completes in under 2 minutes and supervised hashing on ImageNet100 in about 3 minutes on a single GPU. These results highlight CroVCA's efficiency, adaptability, and broad applicability.</description>

      <title>CogPlanner: Unveiling the Potential of Agentic Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation with Planning</title>

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (MRAG) systems have shown promise in enhancing the generation capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing MRAG frameworks primarily adhere to rigid, single-step retrieval strategies that fail to address real-world challenges of information acquisition and query reformulation. In this work, we introduce the task of Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation Planning (MRAG Planning) that aims at effective information seeking and integration while minimizing computational overhead. Specifically, we propose CogPlanner, an agentic plug-and-play framework inspired by human cognitive processes, which iteratively determines query reformulation and retrieval strategies to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses. CogPlanner supports parallel and sequential modeling paradigms. Furthermore, we introduce CogBench, a new benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the MRAG Planning task and facilitate lightweight CogPlanner integration with resource-efficient MLLMs, such as Qwen2-VL-7B-Cog. Experimental results demonstrate that CogPlanner significantly outperforms existing MRAG baselines, offering improvements in both accuracy and efficiency with minimal additional computational costs.</description>

      <title>UNGER: Generative Recommendation with A Unified Code via Semantic and Collaborative Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06269v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rise of generative paradigms, generative recommendation has garnered increasing attention. The core component is the item code, generally derived by quantizing collaborative or semantic representations to serve as candidate items identifiers in the context. However, existing methods typically construct separate codes for each modality, leading to higher computational and storage costs and hindering the integration of their complementary strengths. Considering this limitation, we seek to integrate two different modalities into a unified code, fully unleashing the potential of complementary nature among modalities. Nevertheless, the integration remains challenging: the integrated embedding obtained by the common concatenation method would lead to underutilization of collaborative knowledge, thereby resulting in limited effectiveness. To address this, we propose a novel method, named UNGER, which integrates semantic and collaborative knowledge into a unified code for generative recommendation. Specifically, we propose to adaptively learn an integrated embedding through the joint optimization of cross-modality knowledge alignment and next item prediction tasks. Subsequently, to mitigate the information loss caused by the quantization process, we introduce an intra-modality knowledge distillation task, using the integrated embeddings as supervised signals to compensate. Extensive experiments on three widely used benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>R$^2$ec: Towards Large Recommender Models with Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16994v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large recommender models have extended LLMs as powerful recommenders via encoding or item generation, and recent breakthroughs in LLM reasoning synchronously motivate the exploration of reasoning in recommendation. In this work, we propose R$^2$ec, a unified large recommender model with intrinsic reasoning capability. R$^2$ec introduces a dual-head architecture that supports both reasoning chain generation and efficient item prediction in a single model, significantly reducing inference latency. To overcome the lack of annotated reasoning data, we design RecPO, a reinforcement learning framework that optimizes reasoning and recommendation jointly with a novel fused reward mechanism. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that R$^2$ec outperforms traditional, LLM-based, and reasoning-augmented recommender baselines, while further analyses validate its competitive efficiency among conventional LLM-based recommender baselines and strong adaptability to diverse recommendation scenarios.

      <title>OpenZL: A Graph-Based Model for Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Research techniques in the last decade have improved lossless compression ratios by significantly increasing processing time. These techniques have remained obscure because production systems require high throughput and low resource utilization. In practice, application-specific compression algorithms that leverage knowledge of the data structure and semantics are more popular. Application-specific compressor systems outperform even the best generic compressors, but these techniques have some drawbacks. Application-specific compressors are inherently limited in applicability, have high development costs, and are difficult to maintain and deploy.
  In this work, we show that these challenges can be overcome with a new compression strategy. We propose the "graph model" of compression, a new theoretical framework for representing compression as a directed acyclic graph of modular codecs. OpenZL compresses data into a self-describing wire format, any configuration of which can be decompressed by a universal decoder. OpenZL's design enables rapid development of tailored compressors with minimal code; its universal decoder eliminates deployment lag; and its investment in a well-vetted standard component library minimizes security risks. Experimental results demonstrate that OpenZL achieves superior compression ratios and speeds compared to state-of-the-art general-purpose compressors on a variety of real-world datasets. Internal deployments at Meta have also shown consistent improvements in size and/or speed, with development timelines reduced from months to days. OpenZL thus represents a significant advance in practical, scalable, and maintainable data compression for modern data-intensive applications.</description>

      <title>Improving Product Search Relevance with EAR-MP: A Solution for the CIKM 2025 AnalytiCup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multilingual e-commerce search is challenging due to linguistic diversity and the noise inherent in user-generated queries. This paper documents the solution employed by our team (EAR-MP) for the CIKM 2025 AnalytiCup, which addresses two core tasks: Query-Category (QC) relevance and Query-Item (QI) relevance. Our approach first normalizes the multilingual dataset by translating all text into English, then mitigates noise through extensive data cleaning and normalization. For model training, we build on DeBERTa-v3-large and improve performance with label smoothing, self-distillation, and dropout. In addition, we introduce task-specific upgrades, including hierarchical token injection for QC and a hybrid scoring mechanism for QI. Under constrained compute, our method achieves competitive results, attaining an F1 score of 0.8796 on QC and 0.8744 on QI. These findings underscore the importance of systematic data preprocessing and tailored training strategies for building robust, resource-efficient multilingual relevance systems.</description>

      <title>HiRA: A Hierarchical Reasoning Framework for Decoupled Planning and Execution in Deep Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex information needs in real-world search scenarios demand deep reasoning and knowledge synthesis across diverse sources, which traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines struggle to address effectively. Current reasoning-based approaches suffer from a fundamental limitation: they use a single model to handle both high-level planning and detailed execution, leading to inefficient reasoning and limited scalability. In this paper, we introduce HiRA, a hierarchical framework that separates strategic planning from specialized execution. Our approach decomposes complex search tasks into focused subtasks, assigns each subtask to domain-specific agents equipped with external tools and reasoning capabilities, and coordinates the results through a structured integration mechanism. This separation prevents execution details from disrupting high-level reasoning while enabling the system to leverage specialized expertise for different types of information processing. Experiments on four complex, cross-modal deep search benchmarks demonstrate that HiRA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RAG and agent-based systems. Our results show improvements in both answer quality and system efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of decoupled planning and execution for multi-step information seeking tasks.

      <title>LLM Based Long Code Translation using Identifier Replacement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the domain of software development, LLMs have been utilized to automate tasks such as code translation, where source code from one programming language is translated to another while preserving its functionality. However, LLMs often struggle with long source codes that don't fit into the context window, which produces inaccurate translations. To address this, we propose a novel zero-shot code translation method that incorporates identifier replacement. By substituting user-given long identifiers with generalized placeholders during translation, our method allows the LLM to focus on the logical structure of the code, by reducing token count and memory usage, which improves the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of long code translation. Our empirical results demonstrate that our approach preserves syntactical and hierarchical information and produces translation results with reduced tokens.</description>

      <title>E2Rank: Your Text Embedding can Also be an Effective and Efficient Listwise Reranker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text embedding models serve as a fundamental component in real-world search applications. By mapping queries and documents into a shared embedding space, they deliver competitive retrieval performance with high efficiency. However, their ranking fidelity remains limited compared to dedicated rerankers, especially recent LLM-based listwise rerankers, which capture fine-grained query-document and document-document interactions. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective unified framework E2Rank, means Efficient Embedding-based Ranking (also means Embedding-to-Rank), which extends a single text embedding model to perform both high-quality retrieval and listwise reranking through continued training under a listwise ranking objective, thereby achieving strong effectiveness with remarkable efficiency. By applying cosine similarity between the query and document embeddings as a unified ranking function, the listwise ranking prompt, which is constructed from the original query and its candidate documents, serves as an enhanced query enriched with signals from the top-K documents, akin to pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) in traditional retrieval models. This design preserves the efficiency and representational quality of the base embedding model while significantly improving its reranking performance. Empirically, E2Rank achieves state-of-the-art results on the BEIR reranking benchmark and demonstrates competitive performance on the reasoning-intensive BRIGHT benchmark, with very low reranking latency. We also show that the ranking training process improves embedding performance on the MTEB benchmark. Our findings indicate that a single embedding model can effectively unify retrieval and reranking, offering both computational efficiency and competitive ranking accuracy.</description>
