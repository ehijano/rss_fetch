      <title>DustNet: skillful neural network predictions of Saharan dust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suspended in the atmosphere are millions of tonnes of mineral dust which interacts with weather and climate. Accurate representation of mineral dust in weather models is vital, yet remains challenging. Large scale weather models use high power supercomputers and take hours to complete the forecast. Such computational burden allows them to only include monthly climatological means of mineral dust as input states inhibiting their forecasting accuracy. Here, we introduce DustNet a simple, accurate and super fast forecasting model for 24-hours ahead predictions of aerosol optical depth AOD. DustNet trains in less than 8 minutes and creates predictions in 2 seconds on a desktop computer. Created by DustNet predictions outperform the state-of-the-art physics-based model on coarse 1 x 1 degree resolution at 95% of grid locations when compared to ground truth satellite data. Our results show DustNet has a potential for fast and accurate AOD forecasting which could transform our understanding of dust impacts on weather patterns.</description>

      <title>Modeling groundwater levels in California's Central Valley by hierarchical Gaussian process and neural network regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling groundwater levels continuously across California's Central Valley (CV) hydrological system is challenging due to low-quality well data which is sparsely and noisily sampled across time and space. The lack of consistent well data makes it difficult to evaluate the impact of 2017 and 2019 wet years on CV groundwater following a severe drought during 2012-2015. A novel machine learning method is formulated for modeling groundwater levels by learning from a 3D lithological texture model of the CV aquifer. The proposed formulation performs multivariate regression by combining Gaussian processes (GP) and deep neural networks (DNN). The hierarchical modeling approach constitutes training the DNN to learn a lithologically informed latent space where non-parametric regression with GP is performed. We demonstrate the efficacy of GP-DNN regression for modeling non-stationary features in the well data with fast and reliable uncertainty quantification, as validated to be statistically consistent with the empirical data distribution from 90 blind wells across CV. We show how the model predictions may be used to supplement hydrological understanding of aquifer responses in basins with irregular well data. Our results indicate that on average the 2017 and 2019 wet years in California were largely ineffective in replenishing the groundwater loss caused during previous drought years.</description>
