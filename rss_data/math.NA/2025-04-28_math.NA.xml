      <title>Efficient iterative techniques for solving tensor problems with the T-product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents iterative methods for solving tensor equations involving the T-product. The proposed approaches apply tensor computations without matrix construction. For each initial tensor, these algorithms solve related problems in a finite number of iterations, with negligible errors. The theoretical analysis is validated by numerical examples that demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of these algorithms.</description>

      <title>POD-ROM methods: error analysis for continuous parametrized approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the numerical approximation of parametric time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) by proper orthogonal decomposition reduced order models (POD-ROMs). Although many papers in the literature consider reduced order models for parametric equations, a complete error analysis of the methods is still a challenge. We introduce and analyze in this paper a new POD method based on finite differences (respect to time and respect to the parameters that may be considered). We obtain a priori bounds for the new method valid for any value of time in a given time interval and any value of the parameter in a given parameter interval. Our design of the new POD method allow us to prove pointwise-in-time error estimates as opposed to average error bounds obtained typically in POD methods. Most of the papers concerning POD methods for parametric equations are just based on the snapshots computed at different times and parameter values instead of their difference quotients. We show that the error analysis of the present paper can also cover the error analysis of that case (that we call standard). Some numerical experiments compare our new approach with the standard one and support the error analysis.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Newton Interpolation in Downward Closed Spaces Reaches the Optimal Geometric Approximation Rates for Bos--Levenberg--Trefethen Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the univariate Newton interpolation algorithm to arbitrary spatial dimensions and for any choice of downward-closed polynomial space, while preserving its quadratic runtime and linear storage cost. The generalisation supports any choice of the provided notion of non-tensorial unisolvent interpolation nodes, whose number coincides with the dimension of the chosen-downward closed space. Specifically, we prove that by selecting Leja-ordered Chebyshev-Lobatto or Leja nodes, the optimal geometric approximation rates for a class of analytic functions -- termed Bos--Levenberg--Trefethen functions -- are achieved and extend to the derivatives of the interpolants. In particular, choosing Euclidean degree results in downward-closed spaces whose dimension only grows sub-exponentially with spatial dimension, while delivering approximation rates close to, or even matching those of the tensorial maximum-degree case, mitigating the curse of dimensionality. Several numerical experiments demonstrate the performance of the resulting multivariate Newton interpolation compared to state-of-the-art alternatives and validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Real-time inversion of two-dimensional Fresnel experimental database using orthogonality sampling method with single and multiple sources: the case of transverse electric polarized waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns an application of the orthogonality sampling method (OSM) for a real-time identification of small objects from two-dimensional Fresnel experimental dataset in transverse electric polarization. First, we apply the OSM with a single source by designing an indicator function based on the asymptotic expansion formula for the scattered field in the presence of small objects. We demonstrate that the indicator function can be expressed by an infinite series of Bessel functions of integer order of the first kind, the range of the signal receiver, and the location of the emitter. Based on this, we then investigate the applicability and limitations of the designed OSM. Specifically, we find that the imaging performance is strongly dependent on the source and the applied frequency. We then apply the OSM with multiple sources to improve imaging performance. Based on the identified structure of the OSM with a single source, we design an indicator function with multiple sources and demonstrate that it can be expressed by an infinite series of the Bessel function of integer order of the first kind, and we explain that objects can be identified uniquely using the designed OSM. Numerical simulation results obtained with the Fresnel experimental dataset demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages of the OSM with a single source and confirm that the designed OSM with multiple sources improves imaging performance.</description>

      <title>Direct sampling method to retrieve small objects from two-dimensional limited-aperture scattered field data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigated the application of the direct sampling method (DSM) to identify small dielectric objects in a limited-aperture inverse scattering problem. Unlike previous studies, we consider the bistatic measurement configuration corresponding to the transmitter location and design indicator functions for both a single source and multiple sources, and we convert the unknown measurement data to a fixed nonzero constant. To explain the applicability and limitation of object detection, we demonstrate that the indicator functions can be expressed by an infinite series of Bessel functions, the material properties of the objects, the bistatic angle, and the converted constant. Based on the theoretical results, we explain how the imaging performance of the DSM is influenced by the bistatic angle and the converted constant. In addition, the results of our analyses demonstrate that a smaller bistatic angle enhances the imaging accuracy and that optimal selection of the converted constant is crucial to realize reliable object detection. The results of the numerical simulations obtained using a two-dimensional Fresnel dataset validated the theoretical findings and illustrate the effectiveness and limitations of the designed indicator functions for small objects.</description>

      <title>A locking free multiscale method for linear elasticity in stress-displacement formulation with high contrast coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving strongly symmetric stress approximations for linear elasticity problems in high-contrast media poses a significant computational challenge. Conventional methods often struggle with prohibitively high computational costs due to excessive degrees of freedom, limiting their practical applicability. To overcome this challenge, we introduce an efficient multiscale model reduction method and a computationally inexpensive coarse-grid simulation technique for linear elasticity equations in highly heterogeneous, high-contrast media. We first utilize a stable stress-displacement mixed finite element method to discretize the linear elasticity problem and then present the construction of multiscale basis functions for the displacement and the stress. The mixed formulation offers several advantages such as direct stress computation without post-processing, local momentum conservation (ensuring physical consistency), and robustness against locking effects, even for nearly incompressible materials. Theoretical analysis confirms that our method is inf-sup stable and locking-free, with first-order convergence relative to the coarse mesh size. Notably, the convergence remains independent of contrast ratios as enlarging oversampling regions. Numerical experiments validate the method's effectiveness, demonstrating its superior performance even under extreme contrast conditions.</description>

      <title>On the approximation of the von Neumann equation in the semi-classical limit. Part II : numerical analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the numerical analysis of the Hermite spectral method proposed in [14], which provides, in the semi-classical limit, an asymptotic preserving approximation of the von Neumann equation. More precisely, it relies on the use of so-called Weyl's variables to effectively address the stiffness associated to the equation. Then by employing a truncated Hermite expansion of the density operator, we successfully manage this stiffness and provide error estimates by leveraging the propagation of regularity in the exact solution.</description>

      <title>A hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin method with transmission variables for time-harmonic acoustic problems in heterogeneous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the finite element solution of time-harmonic wave propagation problems in heterogeneous media with hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methods. In the case of homogeneous media, it has been observed that the iterative solution of the linear system can be accelerated by hybridizing with transmission variables instead of numerical traces, as performed in standard approaches. In this work, we extend the HDG method with transmission variables, which is called the CHDG method, to the heterogeneous case with piecewise constant physical coefficients. In particular, we consider formulations with standard upwind and general symmetric fluxes. The CHDG hybridized system can be written as a fixed-point problem, which can be solved with stationary iterative schemes for a class of symmetric fluxes. The standard HDG and CHDG methods are systematically studied with the different numerical fluxes by considering a series of 2D numerical benchmarks. The convergence of standard iterative schemes is always faster with the extended CHDG method than with the standard HDG methods, with upwind and scalar symmetric fluxes.</description>

      <title>A finite volume Simo-Reissner beam method for moored floating body dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel finite volume mooring line model based on the geometrically exact Simo-Reissner beam model for analysing the interaction between a floating rigid body and its mooring lines. The coupled numerical model is implemented entirely within a finite volume-based discretisation framework using a popular computational fluid dynamics C++ toolbox, OpenFOAM. Unlike existing methods for modelling mooring lines, which rely on lumped mass models or finite element-based approaches, this work simulates the mooring cables using non-linear beam models implemented in a finite volume framework to account for bending, tensile, and torsional loading. This advancement makes the current work particularly valuable for simulating extreme sea conditions. The coupled model developed in this study has been validated and verified using experimental and numerical data for a floating box moored with four catenary mooring lines under regular wave conditions featuring different wave heights and periods. The results demonstrate strong agreement with both experimental and numerical data, highlighting the model's accuracy in capturing mooring dynamics and floating body motion.</description>

      <title>Stable localized orthogonal decomposition in Raviart-Thomas spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a computational multiscale method for the mixed formulation of a second-order linear elliptic equation subject to a homogeneous Neumann boundary condition, based on a stable localized orthogonal decomposition (LOD) in Raviart-Thomas finite element spaces. In the spirit of numerical homogenization, the construction provides low-dimensional coarse approximation spaces that incorporate fine-scale information from the heterogeneous coefficients by solving local patch problems on a fine mesh. The resulting numerical scheme is accompanied by a rigorous error analysis, and it is applicable beyond periodicity and scale-separation in spatial dimensions two and three. In particular, this novel realization circumvents the presence of pollution terms observed in a previous LOD construction for elliptic problems in mixed formulation. Finally, various numerical experiments are provided that demonstrate the performance of the method.</description>

      <title>Outlier-aware Tensor Robust Principal Component Analysis with Self-guided Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor Robust Principal Component Analysis (TRPCA) is a fundamental technique for decomposing multi-dimensional data into a low-rank tensor and an outlier tensor, yet existing methods relying on sparse outlier assumptions often fail under structured corruptions. In this paper, we propose a self-guided data augmentation approach that employs adaptive weighting to suppress outlier influence, reformulating the original TRPCA problem into a standard Tensor Principal Component Analysis (TPCA) problem. The proposed model involves an optimization-driven weighting scheme that dynamically identifies and downweights outlier contributions during tensor augmentation. We develop an efficient proximal block coordinate descent algorithm with closed-form updates to solve the resulting optimization problem, ensuring computational efficiency. Theoretical convergence is guaranteed through a framework combining block coordinate descent with majorization-minimization principles. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, including face recovery, background subtraction, and hyperspectral denoising, demonstrate that our method effectively handles various corruption patterns. The results show the improvements in both accuracy and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Numerical method for the inverse scattering by random periodic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to manufacturing defects or wear and tear, industrial components may have uncertainties. In order to evaluate the performance of machined components, it is crucial to quantify the uncertainty of the scattering surface. This brings up an important class of inverse scattering problems for random interface reconstruction. In this paper, we present an efficient numerical algorithm for the inverse scattering problem of acoustic-elastic interaction with random periodic interfaces. The proposed algorithm combines the Monte Carlo technique and the continuation method with respect to the wavenumber, which can accurately reconstruct the key statistics of random periodic interfaces from the measured data of the acoustic scattered field. In the implementation of our algorithm, a key two-step strategy is employed: Firstly, the elastic displacement field below the interface is determined by Tikhonov regularization based on the dynamic interface condition; Secondly, the profile function is iteratively updated and optimised using the Landweber method according to the kinematic interface condition. Such a algorithm does not require a priori information about the stochastic structures and performs well for both stationary Gaussian and non-Gaussian stochastic processes. Numerical experiments demonstrate the reliability and effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Convergence analysis of Lie and Strang splitting for operator-valued differential Riccati equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential Riccati equations (DREs) are semilinear matrix- or operator-valued differential equations with quadratic non-linearities. They arise in many different areas, and are particularly important in optimal control of linear quadratic regulators, where they provide the optimal feedback control laws. In the context of control of partial differential equations, these Riccati equations are operator-valued. To approximate their solutions, both spatial and temporal discretizations are needed. While the former have been well analyzed in the literature, there are very few rigorous convergence analyses of time stepping methods applied to DREs, particularly in the infinite-dimensional, operator-valued setting. In view of this, we analyze two numerical time-stepping schemes, the Lie and Strang splitting methods, in such a setting. The analysis relies on the assumption that the uncontrolled system evolves via an operator that generates an analytic semigroup, and that either the initial condition is sufficiently smooth, or the nonlinearity in the DRE is sufficiently smoothing. These assumptions are mild, in the sense that they are not enough to even guarantee continuity in operator-norm of the exact solution to the DRE. However, they imply certain regularity in a pointwise sense, which can be leveraged to prove convergence in operator-norm with the classical orders. The results are illustrated by four numerical experiments, where convergence with the expected order is correlated with the relevant assumptions being fulfilled. The experiments also demonstrate that matrix-valued DREs which arise as spatial discretizations of operator-valued DREs behave similarly, unless the discretization is coarse.</description>

Abstract: We use generalized Chebyshev polynomials, associated with the root system $A_2$, to provide a new semi-iterative method for accelerating simple iterative methods for solving linear systems. We apply this semi-iterative method to the Jacobi method, and give an example. There are certain restrictions but the resulting acceleration is rather high.</description>

      <title>PODNO: Proper Orthogonal Decomposition Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Proper Orthogonal Decomposition Neural Operators (PODNO) for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) dominated by high-frequency components. Building on the structure of Fourier Neural Operators (FNO), PODNO replaces the Fourier transform with (inverse) orthonormal transforms derived from the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) method to construct the integral kernel. Due to the optimality of POD basis, the PODNO has potential to outperform FNO in both accuracy and computational efficiency for high-frequency problems. From analysis point of view, we established the universality of a generalization of PODNO, termed as Generalized Spectral Operator (GSO). In addition, we evaluate PODNO's performance numerically on dispersive equations such as the Nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation and the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation.</description>

      <title>Robust semi-implicit multilevel SDC methods for conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-implicit multilevel spectral deferred correction (SI-MLSDC) methods provide a promising approach for high-order time integration for nonlinear evolution equations including conservation laws. However, existing methods lack robustness and often do not achieve the expected advantage over single-level SDC. This work adopts the novel SI time integrators from [44] for enhanced stability and extends the single-level SI-SDC method with a multilevel approach to increase computational efficiency. The favourable properties of the resulting SI-MLSDC method are shown by linear temporal stability analysis for a convection-diffusion problem. The robustness and efficiency of the fully discrete method involving a high-order discontinuous Galerkin SEM discretization are demonstrated through numerical experiments for the convection-diffusion, Burgers, Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. The method is shown to yield substantial reductions in fine-grid iterations compared to single-level SI-SDC across a broad range of test cases. Finally, current limitations of the SI-MLSDC framework are identified and discussed, providing guidance for future improvements.</description>

      <title>Model Error Covariance Estimation for Weak Constraint Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State estimates from weak constraint 4D-Var data assimilation can vary significantly depending on the data and model error covariances. As a result, the accuracy of these estimates heavily depends on the correct specification of both model and observational data error covariances. In this work, we assume that the data error is known and and focus on estimating the model error covariance by framing weak constraint 4D-Var as a regularized inverse problem, where the inverse model error covariance serves as the regularization matrix. We consider both isotropic and non-isotropic forms of the model error covariance. Using the representer method, we reduce the 4D-Var problem from state space to data space, enabling the efficient application of regularization parameter selection techniques. The Representer method also provides an analytic expression for the optimal state estimate, allowing us to derive matrix expressions for the three regularization parameter selection methods i.e. the L-curve, generalized cross-validation (GCV), and the Chi-square method. We validate our approach by assimilating simulated data into a 1D transport equation modeling wildfire smoke transport under various observational noise and forward model perturbations. In these experiments the goal is to identify the model error covariances that accurately capture the influence of observational data versus model predictions on assimilated state estimates. The regularization parameter selection methods successfully estimate hyperparameters for both isotropic and non-isotropic model error covariances, that reflect whether the first guess model predictions are more or less reliable than the observational data. The results further indicate that isotropic variances are sufficient when the first guess is more accurate than the data whereas non-isotropic covariances are preferred when the observational data is more reliable.</description>

      <title>Kalman-Langevin dynamics : exponential convergence, particle approximation and numerical approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Langevin dynamics has found a large number of applications in sampling, optimization and estimation. Preconditioning the gradient in the dynamics with the covariance - an idea that originated in literature related to solving estimation and inverse problems using Kalman techniques - results in a mean-field (McKean-Vlasov) SDE. We demonstrate exponential convergence of the time marginal law of the mean-field SDE to the Gibbs measure with non-Gaussian potentials. This extends previous results, obtained in the Gaussian setting, to a broader class of potential functions. We also establish uniform in time bounds on all moments and convergence in $p$-Wasserstein distance. Furthermore, we show convergence of a weak particle approximation, that avoids computing the square root of the empirical covariance matrix, to the mean-field limit. Finally, we prove that an explicit numerical scheme for approximating the particle dynamics converges, uniformly in number of particles, to its continuous-time limit, addressing non-global Lipschitzness in the measure.</description>

      <title>Randomly sparsified Richardson iteration: A dimension-independent sparse linear solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17270v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a class of algorithms combining classical fixed point iterations with repeated random sparsification of approximate solution vectors has been successfully applied to eigenproblems with matrices as large as $10^{108} \times 10^{108}$. So far, a complete mathematical explanation for their success has proven elusive.
  The family of methods has not yet been extended to the important case of linear system solves. In this paper we propose a new scheme based on repeated random sparsification that is capable of solving sparse linear systems in arbitrarily high dimensions. We provide a complete mathematical analysis of this new algorithm. Our analysis establishes a faster-than-Monte Carlo convergence rate and justifies use of the scheme even when the solution vector itself is too large to store.</description>

      <title>On the Loewner framework, the Kolmogorov superposition theorem, and the curse of dimensionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00495v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Loewner framework is an interpolatory approach for the approximation of linear and nonlinear systems. The purpose here is to extend this framework to linear parametric systems with an arbitrary number n of parameters. To achieve this, a new generalized multivariate rational function realization is proposed. Then, we introduce the n-dimensional multivariate Loewner matrices and show that they can be computed by solving a set of coupled Sylvester equations. The null space of these Loewner matrices allows the construction of the multivariate barycentric rational function. The principal result of this work is to show how the null space of the n-dimensional Loewner matrix can be computed using a sequence of 1-dimensional Loewner matrices, leading to a drastic reduction of the computational burden. Equally importantly, this burden is alleviated by avoiding the explicit construction of large-scale n-dimensional Loewner matrices of size $N \times N$. Instead, the proposed methodology achieves decoupling of variables, leading to (i) a complexity reduction from $O(N^3)$ to below $O(N^{1.5})$ when $n &gt; 5$ and (ii) to memory storage bounded by the largest variable dimension rather than their product, thus taming the curse of dimensionality and making the solution scalable to very large data sets. This decoupling of the variables leads to a result similar to the Kolmogorov superposition theorem for rational functions. Thus, making use of barycentric representations, every multivariate rational function can be computed using the composition and superposition of single-variable functions. Finally, we suggest two algorithms (one direct and one iterative) to construct, directly from data, multivariate (or parametric) realizations ensuring (approximate) interpolation. Numerical examples highlight the effectiveness and scalability of the method.</description>

      <title>p and hp Spectral Element Methods for Elliptic Boundary Layer Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we propose p and hp least-squares spectral element methods for one-dimensional elliptic boundary layer problems. Stability estimates are derived and we design numerical schemes based on minimizing the residuals in the sense of least-squares in appropriate Sobolev norms. We prove parameter robust uniform error estimates i.e. error in the approximation is independent of the boundary layer parameter. For the p-version we prove a robust uniform convergence rate of O(sqrt(log W)/W), where W denotes the polynomial order used in approximation and for the hp-version the convergence rate is shown to be O(e^(-W/logW)). Numerical results are presented for a number of model elliptic boundary layer problems confirming the theoretical estimates and uniform convergence results for the p and hp versions.</description>

      <title>Projection-based Reduced Order Modelling for Unsteady Parametrized Optimal Control Problems in 3D Cardiovascular Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20828v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a projection-based reduced order modelling (ROM) framework for unsteady parametrized optimal control problems (OCP$_{(\mu)}$s) arising from cardiovascular (CV) applications. In real-life scenarios, accurately defining outflow boundary conditions in patient-specific models poses significant challenges due to complex vascular morphologies, physiological conditions, and high computational demands. These challenges make it difficult to compute realistic and reliable CV hemodynamics by incorporating clinical data such as 4D magnetic resonance imaging. To address these challenges, we focus on controlling the outflow boundary conditions to optimize CV flow dynamics and minimize the discrepancy between target and computed flow velocity profiles. The fluid flow is governed by unsteady Navier--Stokes equations with physical parametric dependence, i.e. the Reynolds number. Numerical solutions of OCP$_{(\mu)}$s require substantial computational resources, highlighting the need for robust and efficient ROMs to perform real-time and many-query simulations. Here, we aim at investigating the performance of a projection-based reduction technique that relies on the offline-online paradigm, enabling significant computational cost savings. The Galerkin finite element method is used to compute the high-fidelity solutions in the offline phase. We implemented a nested-proper orthogonal decomposition (nested-POD) for fast simulation of OCP$_{(\mu)}$s that encompasses two stages: temporal compression for reducing dimensionality in time, followed by parametric-space compression on the precomputed POD modes. We tested the efficacy of the methodology on vascular models, namely an idealized bifurcation geometry and a patient-specific coronary artery bypass graft, incorporating stress control at the outflow boundary, observing consistent speed-up with respect to high-fidelity strategies.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Inference Time Scaling via Simulation-Calibrated Scientific Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) pose significant computational challenges across fields ranging from quantum chemistry to economics and finance. Although scientific machine learning (SciML) techniques offer approximate solutions, they often suffer from bias and neglect crucial physical insights. Inspired by inference-time scaling strategies in language models, we propose Simulation-Calibrated Scientific Machine Learning (SCaSML), a physics-informed framework that dynamically refines and debiases the SCiML predictions during inference by enforcing the physical laws. SCaSML leverages derived new physical laws that quantifies systematic errors and employs Monte Carlo solvers based on the Feynman-Kac and Elworthy-Bismut-Li formulas to dynamically correct the prediction. Both numerical and theoretical analysis confirms enhanced convergence rates via compute-optimal inference methods. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that SCaSML reduces errors by 20-50% compared to the base surrogate model, establishing it as the first algorithm to refine approximated solutions to high-dimensional PDE during inference. Code of SCaSML is available at https://github.com/Francis-Fan-create/SCaSML.</description>

      <title>Continuum limit of $p$-biharmonic equations on graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the $p$-biharmonic equation on graphs, which arises in point cloud processing and can be interpreted as a natural extension of the graph $p$-Laplacian from the perspective of hypergraph. The asymptotic behavior of the solution is investigated when the random geometric graph is considered and the number of data points goes to infinity. We show that the continuum limit is an appropriately weighted $p$-biharmonic equation with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. The result relies on the uniform $L^p$ estimates for solutions and gradients of nonlocal and graph Poisson equations. The $L^\infty$ estimates of solutions are also obtained as a byproduct.</description>

      <title>Mixed Convection and Entropy Generation Analysis of Carbon Nanotube-Water Nanofluid in a Square Cavity with Cylinders and Flow Deflectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17625v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores the mixed convection of carbon nanotube (CNT)-water nanofluid within a square cavity containing heated cylinders under the influence of a magnetic field, focusing on three geometric configurations: a single heated cylinder, two heated cylinders, and two heated cylinders with a flow deflector. The impact of various parameters, including Reynolds number ($Re$), Richardson number ($Ri$), Hartmann number ($Ha$), wavy wall peaks ($n$), nanoparticle volume fraction ($\phi$), Hartmann angle ($\gamma$), rotational speed ($\omega$), and inclination angle ($\alpha$), on thermal and fluid dynamic behaviors is analyzed. MWCNT nanofluids exhibit up to a 19.1% increase in $Nu_{\text{ave}}$ compared to SWCNT nanofluids, confirming their superior heat transfer performance. Adding a second heated cylinder increases $Nu_{\text{ave}}$ by approximately 71.7% compared to a single-cylinder configuration, while the inclusion of a flow deflector modifies vortex structures, further enhancing convective transport. Increasing wavy wall peaks ($n$) enhances heat transfer by intensifying vortex formation and disrupting thermal boundary layers, leading to a more uniform temperature distribution. SWCNT nanofluids exhibit Bejan numbers up to 58.7% higher than MWCNT nanofluids, indicating greater thermal irreversibility. These findings provide valuable insights for optimizing thermal management systems in engineering applications, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate nanofluids, geometric configurations, and magnetic field parameters to achieve optimal thermal performance and fluid stability.</description>
