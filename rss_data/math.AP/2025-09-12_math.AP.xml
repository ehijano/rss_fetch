      <title>Logarithmic wave decay for short range wavespeed perturbations with radial regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish logarithmic local energy decay for wave equations with a varying wavespeed in dimensions two and higher, where the wavespeed is assumed to be a short range perturbation of unity with mild radial regularity. The key ingredient is H\"older continuity of the weighted resolvent for real frequencies $\lambda$, modulo a logarithmic remainder in dimension two as $\lambda \to 0$. Our approach relies on a study of the resolvent in two distinct frequency regimes. In the low frequency regime, we derive an expansion for the resolvent using a Neumann series and properties of the free resolvent. For frequencies away from zero, we establish a uniform resolvent estimate by way of a Carleman estimate.</description>

      <title>Mountain Pass Critical Points of the Liquid Drop Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Gamow's liquid drop functional, $\mathcal{E}$, on $\mathbb{R}^3$ and construct non-minimizing, volume constrained, critical points for volumes $3.512 \cong \alpha_0 &lt; V &lt; 10$. In this range, we establish a mountain pass set up between a ball of volume $V$ and two balls of volume $V/2$ infinitely far apart. Intuitively, our critical point corresponds to the maximal energy configuration of an atom of volume $V$ as it undergoes fission into two atoms of volume $V/2$. Our proof relies on geometric measure theoretical methods from the min-max construction of minimal surfaces, and along the way, we address issues of non-compactness, ``pull tight" with a volume constraint, and multiplicity.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence of Solutions for the Ginzburg-Landau Equation and System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(u_\varepsilon)$ be a family of solutions of the Ginzburg--Landau equation with boundary condition $u_\varepsilon = g$ on $\partial \Omega$ and of degree $0$. Let $u_0$ denote the harmonic map satisfying $u_0 = g$ on $\partial \Omega$. We show that, if there exists a constant $C_1 &gt; 0$ such that for $\varepsilon$ sufficiently small we have $\frac{1}{2} \int_\Omega |\nabla u_\ve|^2 dx \leq C_1 \leq \frac{1}{2} \int_\Omega |\nabla u_0|^2 dx,$ then $C_1 = \frac{1}{2} \int_\Omega |\nabla u_0|^2 dx$ and
  $u_\ve ~\to ~ u_0 \qin H^1(\Om)$.
  We also prove that if there is a constant $C_2$ such that for $\ve$ small enough we have $ \frac12 \int_\Om |\nabla u_\ve|^2 dx \geq C_2 &gt; \frac12 \int_\Om |\nabla u_0|^2 dx,$ then $|u_{\ve}|$ does not converge uniformly to $1$ on $\overline{\Om} $. We obtain analogous results for both symmetric and non-symmetric two-component Ginzburg--Landau systems. </description>

      <title>Functions of bounded Musielak-Orlicz-type deformation and anisotropic Total Generalized Variation for image-denoising problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first part of this paper we introduce the space of bounded deformation fields with generalized Orlicz growth. We establish their main properties, provide a modular representation, and characterize a decomposition of the modular into an absolutely continuous part and a singular part weighted via a recession function. A further analysis in the variable exponent case is also provided. The second part of the paper contains a notion of Musielak-Orlicz anisotropic Total Generalized Variation. We establish a duality representation, and show well-posedness of the corresponding image reconstruction problem.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of the homogeneous Landau equation: approximation, error estimates and simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a numerical solution to the spatially homogeneous Landau equation with Coulomb potential on a domain $D_L$ with N retained Fourier modes. By deriving an explicit error estimate in terms of $L$ and $N$, we demonstrate that for any prescribed error tolerance and fixed time interval $[0, T ]$, there exist choices of $D_L$ and $N$ satisfying explicit conditions such that the error between the numerical and exact solutions is below the tolerance. Specifically, the estimate shows that sufficiently large $L$ and $N$ (depending on initial data parameters and $T$) can reduce the error to any desired level. Numerical simulations based on this construction are also presented. The results in particular demonstrate the mathematical validity of the spectral method proposed in the referenced literature.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of stationary 2D and 3D convective Brinkman-Forchheimer extended Darcy Hemivariational inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses the well-posedness of a hemivariational inequality derived from the convective Brinkman-Forchheimer extended Darcy (CBFeD) model in both two and three dimensions. The CBFeD model describes the behavior of incompressible viscous fluid flow through a porous medium, incorporating the effects of convection, damping, and nonlinear resistance. The mathematical framework captures steady-state flow conditions under a no-slip boundary assumption, with a non-monotone boundary condition that links the total fluid pressure and the velocity's normal component through a Clarke subdifferential formulation. To facilitate the analysis, we introduce an auxiliary hemivariational inequality resembling a nonlinear Stokes-type problem with damping and pumping terms, which serves as a foundational tool in establishing the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions for the CBFeD model. The analytical strategy integrates techniques from convex minimization theory with fixed-point methods, specifically employing either the Banach contraction mapping principle or Schauder's fixed point theorem. The Banach-based approach, in particular, leads to a practical iterative algorithm that solves the original nonlinear hemivariational inequality by sequentially solving Stokes-type problems, ensuring convergence of the solution sequence. Additionally, we derive equivalent variational formulations in terms of minimization problems. These formulations lay the groundwork for the design of efficient and stable numerical schemes tailored to simulate flows governed by the CBFeD model.</description>

      <title>New Homogeneous Solutions for the One-Phase Free Boundary Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For each sufficiently large integer $k$, we construct a domain in the round $2$-sphere with $k$ boundary components which is the link of a cone in $\mathbb{R}^3$ admitting a homogeneous solution to the one-phase free boundary problem. This answers a question of Jerison-Kamburov, and also disproves a conjecture of Souam left open in earlier work. The method exploits a new connection with minimal surfaces, which we also use to construct an infinite family of homogeneous solutions in dimension four.</description>

      <title>Optimal convergence rates in multiscale elliptic homogenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the quantitative homogenization of multiscale elliptic operator $-\nabla\cdot A_\varepsilon \nabla$, where $A_\varepsilon(x) = A(x/\varepsilon_1, x/\varepsilon_2,\cdots, x/\varepsilon_n)$, $\varepsilon = (\varepsilon_1, \varepsilon_2,\cdots, \varepsilon_n) \in (0,1]^n$ and $\varepsilon_i &gt; \varepsilon_{i+1}$. We assume that $A(y_1,y_2,\cdots, y_n)$ is 1-periodic in each $y_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$ and real analytic. Classically, the method of reiterated homogenization has been applied to study this multiscale elliptic operator, which leads to a convergence rate limited by the ratios $\max \{ \varepsilon_{i+1}/\varepsilon_i: 1\le i\le n-1\}$. In the present paper, under the assumption of real analytic coefficients, we introduce the so-called multiscale correctors and more accurate effective operators, and improve the ratio part of the convergence rate to $\max \{ e^{-c\varepsilon_{i}/\varepsilon_{i+1}}: 1\le i\le n-1 \}$. This convergence rate is optimal in the sense that $c&gt;0$ cannot be replaced by a larger constant. As a byproduct, the uniform Lipschitz estimate is established under a mild double-log scale-separation condition.</description>

      <title>Microlocal analysis of the non-relativistic limit of the Klein--Gordon equation: Estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the more technical half of a two-part work in which we introduce a robust microlocal framework for analyzing the non-relativistic limit of relativistic wave equations with time-dependent coefficients, focusing on the Klein--Gordon equation. Two asymptotic regimes in phase space are relevant to the non-relativistic limit: one corresponding to what physicists call ``natural'' units, in which the PDE is approximable by the free Klein--Gordon equation, and a low-frequency regime in which the equation is approximable by the usual Schrodinger equation. Combining the analyses in the two regimes gives global estimates which are uniform as the speed of light goes to infinity. The companion paper gives applications. Our main technical tools are three new pseudodifferential calculi, $\Psi_{\natural}$ (a variant of the semiclassical scattering calculus), $\Psi_{\natural\mathrm{res}}$, and $\Psi_{\natural2\mathrm{res}}$, the latter two of which are created by ``second microlocalizing'' the first at certain locations. This paper and the companion paper can be read in either order, since the latter treats the former as a black box.</description>

      <title>Sharp bilinear eigenfunction estimate, $L^\infty_{x_2}L^p_{t,x_1}$-type Strichartz estimate, and energy-critical NLS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish sharp bilinear and multilinear eigenfunction estimates for the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the standard three-sphere $\mathbb{S}^3$, eliminating the logarithmic loss that has persisted in the literature since the pioneering work of Burq, G\'erard, and Tzvetkov over twenty years ago. This completes the theory of multilinear eigenfunction estimates on the standard spheres. Our approach relies on viewing $\mathbb{S}^3$ as the compact Lie group $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and exploiting its representation theory, especially the properties of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Motivated by application to the energy-critical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$, we also prove a refined Strichartz estimate of mixed-norm type $L^\infty_{x_2}L^4_{t,x_1}$ on the cylindrical space $\mathbb{R}_{x_1} \times \mathbb{T}_{x_2}$, adapted to certain spectrally localized functions. Combining these two ingredients, we derive a refined bilinear Strichartz estimate on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$, which in turn yields small data global well-posedness for the above mentioned NLS in the energy space.</description>

      <title>Stability and asymptotic behaviour of one-dimensional solutions in cylinders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider positive one-dimensional solutions of a Lane-Emden relative Dirichlet problem in a cylinder and study their stability/instability properties as the energy varies with respect to domain perturbations. This depends on the exponent $p &gt;1$ of the nonlinearity and we obtain results for $p$ close to 1 and for $p$ large. This is achieved by a careful asymptotic analysis of the one-dimensional solution as $p \to 1$ or $p \to \infty$, which is of independent interest. It allows to detect the limit profile and other qualitative properties of these solutions.</description>

      <title>Numerical Approximation and Bifurcation Results for an Elliptic Problem with Superlinear Subcritical Nonlinearity on the Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop numerical algorithms to approximate positive solutions of elliptic boundary value problems with superlinear subcritical nonlinearity on the boundary of the form $-\Delta u + u = 0$ in $\Omega$ with $\frac{\partial u}{\partial \eta} = \lambda f(u)$ on $\partial\Omega$ as well as an extension to a corresponding system of equations. While existence, uniqueness, nonexistence, and multiplicity results for such problems are well-established, their numerical treatment presents computational challenges due to the absence of comparison principles and complex bifurcation phenomena. We present finite difference formulations for both single equations and coupled systems with cross-coupling boundary conditions, establishing admissibility results for the finite difference method. We derive principal eigenvalue analysis for the linearized problems to determine unique bifurcation points from trivial solutions. The eigenvalue analysis provides additional insight into the theoretical properties of the problem while also providing intuition for computing approximate solutions based on the proposed finite difference formulation. We combine our finite difference methods with continuation methods to trace complete bifurcation curves, validating established existence and uniqueness results and consistent with the results of the principle eigenvalue analysis.</description>

      <title>Complex dynamics and pattern formation in a diffusive epidemic model with an infection-dependent recovery rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A diffusive epidemic model with an infection-dependent recovery rate is formulated in this paper.
  Multiple constant steady states and spatially homogeneous periodic solutions are first proven by bifur cation analysis of the reaction kinetics. It is shown that the model exhibits diffusion-driven instability,
  where the infected population acts as an activator and the susceptible population functions as an in hibitor. The faster movement of the susceptible class will induce the spatial and spatiotemporal patterns,
  which are characterized by k-mode Turing instability and (k1,k2)-mode Turing-Hopf bifurcation. The
  transient dynamics from a purely temporal oscillatory regime to a spatial periodic pattern are discov ered. The model reveals key transmission dynamics, including asynchronous disease recurrence, spa tially patterned waves, and the formation of localized hotspots. The study suggests that spatially targeted
  strategies are necessary to contain disease waves that vary regionally and cyclically.</description>

      <title>The role of communication delays in the optimal control of spatially invariant systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study optimal proportional feedback controllers for spatially invariant systems when the controller has access to delayed state measurements received from different spatial locations. We analyze how delays affect the spatial locality of the optimal feedback gain leveraging the problem decoupling in the spatial frequency domain. For the cases of expensive control and small delay, we provide exact expressions of the optimal controllers in the limit for infinite control weight and vanishing delay, respectively. In the expensive control regime, the optimal feedback control law decomposes into a delay-aware filtering of the delayed state and the optimal controller in the delay-free setting. Under small delays, the optimal controller is a perturbation of the delay-free one which depends linearly on the delay. We illustrate our analytical findings with a reaction-diffusion process over the real line and a multi-agent system coupled through circulant matrices, showing that delays reduce the effectiveness of optimal feedback control and may require each subsystem within a distributed implementation to communicate with farther-away locations.</description>

      <title>Optimal decay rates to the contact wave for 1-D compressible Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the decay rates of the contact wave in one-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations. We study two cases of perturbations, with and without zero mass condition, i.e., the integration of initial perturbations is zero and non-zero, respectively. For the case without zero mass condition, we obtain the optimal decay rate $(1+t)^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ for the perturbation in $L^\infty$ norm, which provides a positive answer to the conjecture in \cite{HMX}. We applied the anti-derivative method, introducing the diffusion wave to carry the initial excess mass, diagonalizing the integrated system, and estimating the energy of perturbation in the diagonalized system. Precisely, due to the presence of diffusion waves, the decay rates for errors of perturbed system are too poor to get the optimal decay rate. We find the dissipation structural in the diagonalized system, see \cref{ds}. This observation makes us able to fully utilize the fact that the sign of the derivative of the contact wave is invariant and to control the terms with poor decay rates in energy estimates. For the case with zero mass condition, there are also terms with poor decay rates. In this case, note that there is a cancellation in the linearly degenerate field so that the terms with poor decay rates will not appear in the second equation of the diagonalized system. Thanks to this cancellation and a Poincar\'e type of estimate obtained by a critical inequality introduced by \cite{HLM}, we get the decay rate of $\ln^{\frac{1}{2}} (2+t)$ for $L^2$ norm of anti-derivatives of perturbation and $(1+t)^{-\frac{1}{2}}\ln^{\frac{1}{2}}(2+t)$ for the $L^2$ norm of perturbation itself, the decay rates are optimal, which is consistent with the results obtained by using pointwise estimate in \cite{XZ} for the system with artificial viscosity.</description>

      <title>On the semi-additivity of the $1/2$-symmetric caloric capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01195v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study properties of a variant of the $1/2$-caloric capacity, called $1/2$-symmetric caloric capacity. The latter is associated simultaneously with the $1/2$-fractional heat equation and its conjugate. We establish its semi-additivity in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ and, moreover, we compute explicitly the $1/2$-symmetric caloric capacity of rectangles, which illustrates its anisotropic behavior.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic stability of the composite wave of rarefaction wave and contact wave to nonlinear viscoelasticity model with non-convex flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the wave propagations of viscoelastic materials, which has been derived by Taiping-Liu to approximate the viscoelastic dynamic system with fading memory (see [T.P.Liu(1988)\cite{LiuTP}]) by the Chapman-Enskog expansion. By constructing a set of linear diffusion waves coupled with the high-order diffusion waves to achieve cancellations to approximate the viscous contact wave well and explicit expressions, the nonlinear stability of the composite wave is obtained by a continuum argument.
  It emphasis that, the stress function in our paper is a general non-convex function, which leads to several essential differences from strictly hyperbolic systems such as the Euler system. Our method is completely new and can be applied to more general systems and a new weighted Poincar\'e type of inequality is established, which is more challenging compared to the convex case and this inequality plays an important role in studying systems with non-convex flux.</description>

Abstract: In this survey we prove H\"older regularity results for viscosity solutions of fully nonlinear nonlocal uniformly elliptic second order differential equations with local gradient terms. This extends the nonlocal counterpart of the work of G. Barles, E. Chasseigne and C. Imbert in JEMS, 2011, to fully nonlinear extremal nonlocal operators.</description>

      <title>Propagation of Love waves in linear elastic isotropic Cosserat materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the propagation of Love waves in an isotropic half-space modelled as a linear {elastic isotropic} Cosserat material. To this aim, we show that a method commonly used to study Rayleigh wave propagation is also applicable to the analysis of Love wave propagation. This approach is based on the explicit solution of an algebraic Riccati equation, which operates independently of the traditional Stroh formalism. The method provides a straightforward numerical algorithm to determine the wave amplitudes and speed{s}. Beyond its numerical simplicity, the method guarantees the existence and uniqueness of a subsonic wave speed, addressing a problem that remains unresolved in most Cosserat solids generalised {continua} theories. Although often overlooked, proving the existence of an admissible solution is, in fact, the key point that validates or invalidates the entire analytical approach used to derive the equation determining the wave speed. Interestingly, it is confirmed that the Love waves do not need the artificial introduction of a surface layer, as indicated in the literature.</description>

      <title>A note on Wang's conjecture for harmonic functions with nonlinear boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain some Liouville type theorems for positive harmonic functions on compact Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature and strictly convex boundary and partially verifies Wang's conjecture (J. Geom. Anal. 31 (2021)).
  For the specific manifold $\mathbb{B}^n$, we present a new proof of this conjecture, which has been resolved by Gu-Li (Math. Ann. 391(2025)). Our proof is based on a general principle of applying the P-function method to such Liouville type results. As a further application of this method, we obtain some classification results for nonnegative solutions of some semilinear elliptic equations with a nonlinear boundary condition.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Stability of multi-solitons for $1$d Supercritical NLS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the one-dimensional $L^2$ supercritical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation \begin{equation} i\partial_{t}\psi+\partial^{2}_{x}\psi+\vert \psi\vert^{2k}\psi=0 \text{, $k&gt;2$}. \end{equation} It is well known that solitary waves for this equation are unstable. In the pioneering work of Krieger and Schlag \cite{KriegerSchlag}, the asymptotic stability of a solitary wave was established on a codimension-one center-stable manifold. In the present paper, using linear estimates developed for one-dimensional matrix charge transfer models in our previous work, \cite{dispanalysis1}, we prove asymptotic stability of multi-solitons on a finite-codimension manifold for $k&gt;\frac{11}{4}$, provided that the soliton velocities are sufficiently separated.</description>

      <title>Blow-up for a Nonlocal Diffusion Equation with Time Regularly Varying Nonlinearity and Forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Cauchy problem for a semilinear parabolic equation driven by a mixed local-nonlocal diffusion operator of the form \[ \partial_t u - (\Delta - (-\Delta)^{\mathsf{s}})u = \mathsf{h}(t)|x|^{-b}|u|^p + t^\varrho \mathbf{w}(x), \qquad (x,t)\in \mathbb{R}^N\times (0,\infty), \] where $\mathsf{s}\in (0,1)$, $p&gt;1$, $b\geq 0$, and $\varrho&gt;-1$. The function $\mathsf{h}(t)$ is assumed to belong to the generalized class of regularly varying functions, while $\mathbf{w}$ is a prescribed spatial source. We first revisit the unforced case and establish sharp blow-up and global existence criteria in terms of the critical Fujita exponent, thereby extending earlier results to the wider class of time-dependent coefficients. For the forced problem, we derive nonexistence of global weak solutions under suitable growth conditions on $\mathsf{h}$ and integrability assumptions on $\mathbf{w}$. Furthermore, we provide sufficient smallness conditions on the initial data and the forcing term ensuring global-in-time mild solutions. Our analysis combines semigroup estimates for the mixed operator, test function methods, and asymptotic properties of regularly varying functions. To our knowledge, this is the first study addressing blow-up phenomena for nonlinear diffusion equations with such a class of time-dependent coefficients.</description>

      <title>Localization and global dynamics in the long-range discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study localization, pinning, and mobility in the fractional discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (fDNLS) with generalized power-law coupling. A finite-dimensional spatial-dynamics reduction of the nonlocal recurrence yields onsite and offsite stationary profiles; their asymptotic validity, orbital stability of onsite solutions, and $\ell^2$ proximity to the exact lattice solutions are established. Using the explicit construction of localized states, it is shown that the spatial tail behavior is algebraic for all $\alpha$ &gt; 0. The Peierls-Nabarro barrier (PNB) is computed, and the parameter regimes are identified where it nearly vanishes; complementary numerical simulations explore mobility/pinning across parameters and exhibit scenarios consistent with near-vanishing PNB. We also analyze modulational instability of plane waves, locate instability thresholds, and discuss the role of nonlocality in initiating localization. Finally, we establish small-data scattering, and quantify how fDNLS dynamics approximates the nearest-neighbor DNLS on bounded times while exhibiting distinct global behavior for any large $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Topology of closed asymptotic curves on negatively curved surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by Nirenberg's problem on isometric rigidity of tight surfaces, we study closed asymptotic curves $\Gamma$ on negatively curved surfaces $M$ in Euclidean $3$-space. In particular, using C\u{a}lug\u{a}reanu's theorem, we obtain a formula for the linking number $Lk(\Gamma,n)$ of $\Gamma$ with the normal $n$ of $M$. It follows that when $Lk(\Gamma, n)=0$, $\Gamma$ cannot have any locally star-shaped planar projections with vanishing crossing number, which extends observations of Kovaleva, Panov and Arnold. These results hold also for curves with nonvanishing torsion and their binormal vector field. Furthermore we construct an example where $n$ is injective but $Lk(\Gamma, n)\neq 0$, and discuss various restrictions on $\Gamma$ when $n$ is injective.</description>

Abstract: This paper focuses on finding an approximate solution of a kind of Fokker-Planck equation with time-dependent perturbations. A formulation of the approximate solution of the equation is constructed, and then the existence of the formulation is proved. The related Hamiltonian dynamical system explains the estimations. Our work provides a more comprehensive understanding of the behaviour of systems described by this Fokker-Planck equation and the corresponding stochastic differential equation.</description>

      <title>Beyond separability: convergence rate of vanishing viscosity approximations to mean field games via FBSDE stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the vanishing viscosity approximation to mean field games (MFGs) in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with a nonlocal and possibly non-separable Hamiltonian. We prove that the value function converges at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\beta)$, where $\beta^2$ is the diffusivity constant, which matches the classical convergence rate of vanishing viscosity for Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equations. The same rate is also obtained for the approximation of the distribution of players as well as for the gradient of the value function. The proof is a combination of probabilistic and analytical arguments by first analyzing the forward-backward stochastic differential equation associated with the MFG, and then applying a general stability result for HJ equations. Applications of our result to $N$-player games, mean field control, and policy iteration for solving MFGs are also presented.</description>

      <title>Mixed Christoffel-Minkowski problems for bodies of revolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mixed Christoffel-Minkowski problem asks for necessary and sufficient conditions for a Borel measure on the Euclidean unit sphere to be the mixed area measure of some convex bodies, one of which, appearing multiple times, is free and the rest are fixed. In the case where all bodies involved are symmetric around a common axis, we provide a complete solution to this problem, without assuming any regularity. In particular, we refine Firey's classification of area measures of figures of revolution.
  In our argument, we introduce an easy way to transform mixed area measures and mixed volumes involving axially symmetric bodies, and we significantly improve Firey's estimate on the local behavior of area measures. As a secondary result, we obtain a family of Hadwiger type theorems for convex valuations that are invariant under rotations around an axis.</description>
