      <title>Cauchy Problem for the Dirac operator on spatially non-compact spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a globally hyperbolic manifold with complete spacelike Cauchy hypersurface $\Sigma$. We prove well-posedness of the Cauchy problem for the Dirac operator on globally hyperbolic manifolds with complete Cauchy hypersurfaces. This result is needed as preparation in showing a Fredholmness result in the manner, provided by B\"ar and Strohmaier, for certain non-compact Cauchy hypersurfaces in future work. The results already have been published for a simpler setting in arxiv:2107.0853(2). This version is only focused on the Cauchy problem for a slightly modified setting.</description>

      <title>Conformally K\"ahler structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a one-to-one correspondence between K\"ahler metrics in a given conformal class and parallel sections of a certain vector bundle with conformally invariant connection, where the parallel sections satisfy a set of non--linear algebraic constraints that we describe. The vector bundle captures 2-form prolongations and is isomorphic to $\Lambda^3(\cT)$, where ${\cT}$ is the tractor bundle of conformal geometry, but the resulting connection differs from the normal tractor connection by curvature terms.
  Our analysis leads to a set of obstructions for a Riemannian metric to be conformal to a K\"ahler metric. In particular we find an explicit algebraic condition for a Weyl tensor which must hold if there exists a conformal Killing-Yano tensor, which is a necessary condition for a metric to be conformal to K\"ahler. This gives an invariant characterisation of algebraically special Riemannian metrics of type $D$ in dimensions higher than four.</description>

      <title>The $\mathcal{C}$-connection and the 4-dimensional Einstein spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new family of operators in 4-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifolds with a non-vanishing Weyl scalar (non-degenerate spaces) that keep the conformal covariance of \emph{conformally covariant tensor concomitants}. A particular case that arises naturally is the $\mathcal{C}$-connection that is a Weyl connection that keeps \emph{conformal invariance}. Using the $\mathcal{C}-$connection we give a new characterization of non-degenerate spaces that are conformal to an Einstein space.</description>

      <title>Connected Components on Lie Groups and Applications to Multi-Orientation Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop and analyze a new algorithm to find the connected components of a compact set I from a Lie group G endowed with a left-invariant Riemannian distance. For a given delta&gt;0, the algorithm finds the largest cover of I such that all sets in the cover are separated by at least distance delta. We call the sets in the cover the delta-connected components of I. The grouping relies on an iterative procedure involving morphological dilations with Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-kernels on G and notions of delta-thickened sets. We prove that the algorithm converges in finitely many iteration steps, and we propose a strategy to find an optimal value for delta based on persistence homology arguments. We also introduce the concept of affinity matrices. This allows grouping delta-connected components based on their local proximity and alignment.
  Among the many different applications of the algorithm, in this article, we focus on illustrating that the method can efficiently identify (possibly overlapping) branches in complex vascular trees on retinal images. This is done by applying an orientation score transform to the images that allows us to view them as functions from L_2(G) where G=SE(2), the Lie group of positions and orientations. By applying our algorithm in this Lie group, we illustrate that we obtain delta-connected components that differentiate between crossing structures and that group well-aligned, nearby structures. This contrasts standard connected component algorithms in R^2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a rigorous analysis of the generalized Jang equation in the asymptotically anti-de Sitter setting modelled on constant time slices of anti-de Sitter spacetimes in dimensions $3\leq n \leq 7$ for a very general class of asymptotics. Potential applications to spacetime positive mass theorems for asymptotically anti-de Sitter initial data sets are discussed.</description>

      <title>Residue currents of cohesive modules and the generalized Poincar\'{e}-Lelong formula on complex manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cohesive module provides a tool to study coherent sheaves on complex manifolds by global analytic methods. In this paper we develop the theory of residue currents for cohesive modules on complex manifolds. In particular we prove that they have the duality principle and satisfy the comparison formula. As an application, we prove a generalized version of the Poincar\'{e}-Lelong formula for cohesive modules, which applies to coherent sheaves without globally defined locally free resolutions.</description>

      <title>Classification and stability of penalized pinned elasticae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers critical points of the length-penalized elastic bending energy among planar curves whose endpoints are fixed. We classify all critical points with an explicit parametrization. The classification strongly depends on a special penalization parameter $\hat{\lambda}\simeq 0.70107$. Stability of all the critical points is also investigated, and again the threshold $\hat{\lambda}$ plays a decisive role. In addition, our explicit parametrization is applied to compare the energy of critical points, leading to uniqueness of minimal nontrivial critical points. As an application we obtain eventual embeddedness of elastic flows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider entire solutions $\omega\in\dot H^1(\mathbb R^2;\mathbb R^3)$ of the $H$-system $\Delta\omega=2\omega_x\wedge\omega_y,$ which we refer to as bubbles. Surprisingly, and contrary to conjectures raised in the literature, we find that bubbles with degree at least three can be degenerate: the linearized $H$-system around a bubble can admit solutions that are not tangent to the smooth family of bubbles. We then give a complete algebraic characterization of degenerate bubbles.</description>

      <title>Nonnegative cross-curvature in infinite dimensions: synthetic definition and spaces of measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonnegative cross-curvature (NNCC) is a geometric property of a cost function defined on a product space that originates in optimal transportation and the Ma-Trudinger-Wang theory. Motivated by applications in optimization, gradient flows and mechanism design, we propose a variational formulation of nonnegative cross-curvature on c-convex domains applicable to infinite dimensions and nonsmooth settings. The resulting class of NNCC spaces is closed under Gromov-Hausdorff convergence and for this class, we extend many properties of classical nonnegative cross-curvature: stability under generalized Riemannian submersions, characterization in terms of the convexity of certain sets of c-concave functions, and in the metric case, it is a subclass of positively curved spaces in the sense of Alexandrov. One of our main results is that Wasserstein spaces of probability measures inherit the NNCC property from their base space. Additional examples of NNCC costs include the Bures-Wasserstein and Fisher-Rao squared distances, the Hellinger-Kantorovich squared distance (in some cases), the relative entropy on probability measures, and the 2-Gromov-Wasserstein squared distance on metric measure spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10432v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Sasakian quasi-Killing spinor (SqK-spinor), which is a generalization of a Killing spinor on Sasakian manifolds, was defined in \cite{Kim Friedrich 2000}.The purpose of this paper is to study in detail SqK-spinors on three-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian Sasakian space-form.We briefly review some results on SqK-spinors and then investigate some geometric properties.First, we demonstrate that the Reeb vector field is described by a specific SqK-spinor. Then we establish that the motion of a charged particle in the presence of a contact Maxwell field can be depicted using an SqK-spinor. urthermore, we find that almost all SqK-spinors provide solutions to the Einstein-Dirac system with a non-zero cosmological constant.Additionally, we reveal that a particular SqK-spinor in conjunction with a contact Maxwell field satisfies the Einstein-Dirac-Maxwell systems.Finally, we show explicit formulae of SqK-spinors in terms of elementary functions with respect to a certain frame.</description>

Abstract: We prove a scalar-mean rigidity theorem for compact Riemannian manifolds with boundary in dimension less than five by extending Schoen-Yau dimension reduction argument. As a corollary, we prove the sharp spherical radius rigidity theorem and best NNSC fill-in in terms of the mean curvature. Additionally, we prove a (Lipschitz) Listing type scalar-mean comparison rigidity theorem for these dimensions. Our results remove the spin assumption.</description>

      <title>The Klein quartic maximizes the multiplicity of the first positive eigenvalue of the Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.14699v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that Klein quartic maximizes the multiplicity of the first positive eigenvalue of the Laplacian among all closed hyperbolic surfaces of genus $3$, with multiplicity equal to $8$. We also obtain partial results in genus $2$, where we find that the maximum multiplicity is between $3$ and $6$. Along the way, we show that for every $g\geq 2$, there exists some $\delta_g&gt;0$ such that the multiplicity of any eigenvalue of the Laplacian on a closed hyperbolic surface of genus $g$ in the interval $[0,1/4+\delta_g]$ is at most $2g-1$ despite the fact that this interval can contain arbitrarily many eigenvalues. This extends a result of Otal to a larger interval but with a weaker bound, which nevertheless improves upon the general upper bound of S\'evennec.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.13164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study axisymmetric solutions to the wave equation on extremal Kerr backgrounds and obtain integrated local energy decay (or Morawetz estimates) through an analysis \textit{exclusively in physical-space}. Boundedness of the energy and Morawetz estimates for axisymmetric waves in extremal Kerr were first obtained by Aretakis through the construction of frequency-localized currents used in particular to express the trapping degeneracy. Here we extend to extremal Kerr a method introduced by Stogin in the sub-extremal case, simplifying Aretakis' derivation of Morawetz estimates through purely classical currents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to prove the existence of Hadamard states for the Maxwell equations on any globally hyperbolic spacetime. This will be achieved by introducing a new gauge fixing condition, the Cauchy radiation gauge, that will allow to suppress all the unphysical degrees of freedom. The key ingredient for achieving this gauge is a new Hodge decomposition for differential k-forms in Sobolev spaces on complete (possibly non-compact) Riemannian manifolds.</description>

      <title>An extension to non-nilpotent groups of Rothschild-Stein lifting method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19619v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In their celebrated paper of 1976, Rothschild and Stein prove a lifting procedure that locally reduces to a free nilpotent Lie algebra any family of smooth vector fields $X_1,\dots,X_q$, over a manifold $M$. Then, a large class of differential operators can be lifted, and fundamental solutions on the lifted space can be re-projected to fundamental solutions of the given operators on $M$. In case that the Lie algebra $\mathfrak g=\mbox{Lie}(X_1,\dots,X_q)$ is finite dimensional but not nilpotent, this procedure could introduce a strong tilting of the space. In this paper we represent a global construction of a Lie group $G$ associated to $\mathfrak g$ that avoid this tilting problem. In particular $\mbox{Lie}(G)\cong\mathfrak g$ and a right $G$-action exists over $M$, faithful and transitive, inducing a natural projection $E\colon G\to M$. We represent the group $G$ as a direct product $M\times G^z$ where the model fiber $G^z$ has a group structure. We prove that for any simply connected manifold $M$ -- and a vast class of non-simply connected manifolds -- a fundamental solution for a differential operator $L=\sum_{\alpha\in\mathbb N^q} r_\alpha\cdot X^\alpha$ of finite degree over $M$ can be obtained, via a saturation method, from a fundamental solution for the associated lifted operator over the group $G$. This is a generalization of Biagi and Bonfiglioli analogous result for homogeneous vector fields over $M=\mathbb R^n$.</description>
