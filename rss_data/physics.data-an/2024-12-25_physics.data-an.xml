      <title>Exact closed-form recurrence probabilities for biased random walks at any step number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a closed-form expression for the survival probability of a discrete 1D biased random walk to not return to its origin after N steps. Our expression is exact for any N, including the elusive intermediate range, thereby allowing one to study its convergence to the large N limit. In that limit we recover Polya's recurrence probability, i.e. the survival probability equals the magnitude of the bias. We then obtain a closed-form expression for the probability of last return. In contrast to the bimodal behavior for the unbiased case, we show that the probability of last return decays monotonically throughout the walk beyond a critical bias. We obtain a simple expression for the critical bias as a function of the walk length, and show that it saturates at $1/\sqrt{3}$ for infinitely long walks. This property is missed when using expressions developed for the large N limit. Finally, we discuss application to molecular motors' biased random walks along microtubules, which are of intermediate step number.</description>

      <title>An information theoretic limit to data amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years generative artificial intelligence has been used to create data to support science analysis. For example, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been trained using Monte Carlo simulated input and then used to generate data for the same problem. This has the advantage that a GAN creates data in a significantly reduced computing time. N training events for a GAN can result in GN generated events with the gain factor, G, being more than one. This appears to violate the principle that one cannot get information for free. This is not the only way to amplify data so this process will be referred to as data amplification which is studied using information theoretic concepts. It is shown that a gain of greater than one is possible whilst keeping the information content of the data unchanged. This leads to a mathematical bound which only depends on the number of generated and training events. This study determines conditions on both the underlying and reconstructed probability distributions to ensure this bound. In particular, the resolution of variables in amplified data is not improved by the process but the increase in sample size can still improve statistical significance. The bound is confirmed using computer simulation and analysis of GAN generated data from the literature.</description>
