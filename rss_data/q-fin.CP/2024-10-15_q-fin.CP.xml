      <title>Can GANs Learn the Stylized Facts of Financial Time Series?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the financial sector, a sophisticated financial time series simulator is essential for evaluating financial products and investment strategies. Traditional back-testing methods have mainly relied on historical data-driven approaches or mathematical model-driven approaches, such as various stochastic processes. However, in the current era of AI, data-driven approaches, where models learn the intrinsic characteristics of data directly, have emerged as promising techniques. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have surfaced as promising generative models, capturing data distributions through adversarial learning. Financial time series, characterized 'stylized facts' such as random walks, mean-reverting patterns, unexpected jumps, and time-varying volatility, present significant challenges for deep neural networks to learn their intrinsic characteristics. This study examines the ability of GANs to learn diverse and complex temporal patterns (i.e., stylized facts) of both univariate and multivariate financial time series. Our extensive experiments revealed that GANs can capture various stylized facts of financial time series, but their performance varies significantly depending on the choice of generator architecture. This suggests that naively applying GANs might not effectively capture the intricate characteristics inherent in financial time series, highlighting the importance of carefully considering and validating the modeling choices.</description>

      <title>European Option Pricing in Regime Switching Framework via Physics-Informed Residual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we employ physics-informed residual learning (PIRL) and propose a pricing method for European options under a regime-switching framework, where closed-form solutions are not available. We demonstrate that the proposed approach serves an efficient alternative to competing pricing techniques for regime-switching models in the literature. Specifically, we demonstrate that PIRLs eliminate the need for retraining and become nearly instantaneous once trained, thus, offering an efficient and flexible tool for pricing options across a broad range of specifications and parameters.</description>

      <title>Modeling News Interactions and Influence for Financial Market Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diffusion of financial news into market prices is a complex process, making it challenging to evaluate the connections between news events and market movements. This paper introduces FININ (Financial Interconnected News Influence Network), a novel market prediction model that captures not only the links between news and prices but also the interactions among news items themselves. FININ effectively integrates multi-modal information from both market data and news articles. We conduct extensive experiments on two datasets, encompassing the S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ 100 indices over a 15-year period and over 2.7 million news articles. The results demonstrate FININ's effectiveness, outperforming advanced market prediction models with an improvement of 0.429 and 0.341 in the daily Sharpe ratio for the two markets respectively. Moreover, our results reveal insights into the financial news, including the delayed market pricing of news, the long memory effect of news, and the limitations of financial sentiment analysis in fully extracting predictive power from news data.</description>

      <title>MLP, XGBoost, KAN, TDNN, and LSTM-GRU Hybrid RNN with Attention for SPX and NDX European Call Option Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06724v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the performance of various artificial neural network architectures, including a multilayer perceptron (MLP), Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN), LSTM-GRU hybrid recursive neural network (RNN) models, and a time-delay neural network (TDNN) for pricing European call options. In this study, we attempt to leverage the ability of supervised learning methods, such as ANNs, KANs, and gradient-boosted decision trees, to approximate complex multivariate functions in order to calibrate option prices based on past market data. The motivation for using ANNs and KANs is the Universal Approximation Theorem and Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem, respectively. Specifically, we use S\&amp;P 500 (SPX) and NASDAQ 100 (NDX) index options traded during 2015-2023 with times to maturity ranging from 15 days to over 4 years (OptionMetrics IvyDB US dataset). Black \&amp; Scholes's (BS) PDE \cite{Black1973} model's performance in pricing the same options compared to real data is used as a benchmark. This model relies on strong assumptions, and it has been observed and discussed in the literature that real data does not match its predictions. Supervised learning methods are widely used as an alternative for calibrating option prices due to some of the limitations of this model. In our experiments, the BS model underperforms compared to all of the others. Also, the best TDNN model outperforms the best MLP model on all error metrics. We implement a simple self-attention mechanism to enhance the RNN models, significantly improving their performance. The best-performing model overall is the LSTM-GRU hybrid RNN model with attention. Also, the KAN model outperforms the TDNN and MLP models. We analyze the performance of all models by ticker, moneyness category, and over/under/correctly-priced percentage.</description>
