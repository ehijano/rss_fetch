      <title>Direct Radiative Impacts of Stratospheric Aerosols on the Tropical Troposphere: Clouds, Precipitation, and Circulation in Convection-Resolving and Global Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A concern for stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) is that stratospheric aerosols could inadvertently alter rain and winds through mechanisms independent of the intended surface cooling. We here use a multi-model framework to investigate how the tropical troposphere responds to SAI when sea surface temperatures are held fixed. By performing convection-resolving simulations in small-domains and in mock-Walker setups, and contrasting these with global climate model simulations, we trace how stratospheric aerosols radiatively heat the troposphere, and in turn alter convection, clouds, and rainfall. Our simulations show an SAI-induced reduction in tropical mean precipitation, yet decreased cloud radiative heating moderates this effect and complicates its predictability. Regional rainfall anomalies within the tropics can be substantial. However, surface-temperature-independent effects on tropical circulation are found to be negligible, indicating that stratospheric aerosols do not inherently alter the tropical overturning circulation as previously suggested. These results clarify the mechanisms governing SAI hydroclimate impacts and show that key uncertainties arise from cloud processes that models are unable to constrain. Consequently, near-term SAI deployment would carry the risk of being implemented without the ability to reliably predict its hydroclimate impacts.</description>

      <title>How do cold pools influence the size of tropical cyclone embryos?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The size of tropical cyclone (TC) embryos is an essential predictor of TC genesis. Recent studies have identified cold pools and planetary rotation as factors that increase and decrease TC embryo size. While the planetary rotation effect has been depicted using a quasi-geostrophic (QG) model, the cold pool effect still lacks a theoretical model. This paper presents a cloud chain model to derive the length scale regarding the influence of cold pools on the TC embryo vortex. Within the model, the amount of rain evaporation during a single convective event determines the wind speed and humidity at the cold pool edge, influencing the amount of sub-cloud moisture convergence for the next-generation convection and, therefore, the intensity of the next-generation cold pool. A perturbation analysis shows that cold pools exhibit a nonlocal dependence on air-column humidity, with the influence range determined by the cold pool size and a convective memory weight. The memory weight relies on the sum of the contributions of mechanical lifting and thermodynamic forcing to convective initiation. A crucial parameter is the ratio of rain evaporation to surface evaporation in a cold pool. By coupling the cloud chain model with the QG equation, an analytical expression for the TC embryo size is obtained. The theory captures the trend but overestimates the TC embryo size in cloud-permitting simulations. The deviation might be due to the oversimplification in estimating the fractional contribution of cold pools to convective initiation.</description>

      <title>Extending Integrated Assessment Model scenarios until 2150 using an emulation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whereas there is growing interest in exploring longer-term climate, including tipping elements, beyond 2100, most Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) generate emissions scenarios only till 2100. Here we propose a framework to extend scenarios until 2150 using an emulator of IAMs. Our framework offers a potential interim solution for developing very long-term scenarios, such as the Scenario Model Intercomparison Project (ScenarioMIP), circumventing the challenges of fully simulating IAMs beyond 2100.</description>

      <title>Compression-driven jamming in porous cohesive aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I investigate the compression-driven jamming behavior of two-dimensional porous aggregates composed of cohesive, frictionless disks. Three types of initial aggregates are prepared using different aggregation procedures, namely, reaction-limited aggregation (RLA), ballistic particle-cluster aggregation (BPCA), and diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA), to elucidate the influence of aggregate morphology. Using distinct-element-method simulations with a shrinking circular boundary, I numerically obtain the pressure as a function of the packing fraction $\phi$. For the densest RLA and the intermediate BPCA aggregates, a clear jamming transition is observed at a critical packing fraction $\phi_{\rm J}$, below which the pressure vanishes and above which a finite pressure emerges; the transition is less distinct for the most porous DLA aggregates. The jamming threshold depends on the initial structure and, when extrapolated to infinite system size, approaches $\phi_{\rm J} = 0.765 \pm 0.004$ for RLA, $0.727 \pm 0.004$ for BPCA, and $0.602 \pm 0.023$ for DLA, where the errors denote the standard error. Above $\phi_{\rm J}$, the pressure follows $P \approx A {( \phi - \phi_{\rm J} )}^{2}$, which implies that the bulk modulus $K$ of jammed aggregates is proportional to $\phi - \phi_{\rm J}$. Rigid-cluster analysis of jammed aggregates shows that the average coordination number within the largest rigid cluster increases linearly with $\phi - \phi_{\rm J}$. Taken together, these relations suggest that the elastic response of compressed porous aggregates is analogous to that of random spring networks.</description>

      <title>Bridging CORDEX and CMIP6: Machine Learning Downscaling for Wind and Solar Energy Droughts in Central Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable regional climate information is essential for assessing the impacts of climate change and for planning in sectors such as renewable energy; yet, producing high-resolution projections through coordinated initiatives like CORDEX that run multiple physical regional climate models is both computationally demanding and difficult to organize. Machine learning emulators that learn the mapping between global and regional climate fields offer a promising way to address these limitations. Here we introduce the application of such an emulator: trained on CMIP5 and CORDEX simulations, it reproduces regional climate model data with sufficient accuracy. When applied to CMIP6 simulations not seen during training, it also produces realistic results, indicating stable performance. Using CORDEX data, CMIP5 and CMIP6 simulations, as well as regional data generated by two machine learning models, we analyze the co-occurrence of low wind speed and low solar radiation and find indications that the number of such energy drought days is likely to decrease in the future. Our results highlight that downscaling with machine learning emulators provides an efficient complement to efforts such as CORDEX, supplying the higher-resolution information required for impact assessments.</description>

      <title>Sea ice floe segmentation in close-range optical imagery using active contour and foundation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06641v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The size of sea ice floes in the marginal ice zone (MIZ) is a key factor influencing ice coverage, albedo, wave propagation, and ocean--atmosphere energy exchanges. Floe size can be observed by processing visual-range imagery from ships, aircraft, or satellites. However, autonomously capturing floe boundaries remains challenging, particularly due to sea ice heterogeneity, which impairs boundary definition and reduces image clarity. This study evaluates the accuracy of sea ice floe segmentation using the gradient vector flow (GVF) active contour method, the deep learning-based Segment Anything Model (SAM), and a hybrid approach combining GVF and SAM. Methods are evaluated on a representative subset of a large dataset of close-range, high-resolution imagery collected from cameras aboard an icebreaker during an Antarctic winter expedition. Spanning a wide range of ice conditions and image clarity in the MIZ, the subset provides a rigorous segmentation test bed. Performance is assessed in terms of floe detection accuracy, size distribution, and ice concentration, with results compared against a manually segmented benchmark. Results indicate SAM, in prompt-driven mode, offers the best balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. Its strong performance in estimating sea ice concentration and detecting floes, while maintaining close agreement with benchmark floe size distributions, makes it suitable for real-time applications and scalable analyses of large imagery datasets. Compared with SAM, the combined SAM-GVF method provides more accurate floe boundary delineation, although at much higher computational cost, and is therefore better suited for analyses requiring precise floe shapes.</description>

      <title>EnsAI: An Emulator for Atmospheric Chemical Ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensemble-based methods for data assimilation and emission inversions are a popular way to encode flow-dependency within the model error covariance. While most ensemble methods do not require the use of an adjoint model, the need to repeatedly run a geophysical model to generate the ensemble can be a significant computational burden. In this paper, we introduce EnsAI, a new AI-based ensemble generation system for atmospheric chemical constituents. When trained on an existing ensemble for ammonia generated by the GEM-MACH air quality model, it was shown that the ensembles produced by EnsAI can accurately reproduce the meteorology-dependent features of the original ensemble, while generating the ensemble 3,300 times faster than the original GEM-MACH ensemble. While EnsAI requires an upfront cost for generating an ensemble used for training, as well as the training itself, the long term computational savings can greatly exceed these initial computational costs. When used in an emissions inversion system, EnsAI produced similar inversion results to those in which the original GEM-MACH ensemble was used while using significantly less computational resources.</description>

      <title>Parameter estimation for land-surface models using Neural Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Neural Physics approach is used to determine the parameters of a simple land-surface model using PyTorch's backpropagation engine to carry out the optimisation. In order to test the inverse model, a synthetic dataset is created by running the model in forward mode with known parameter values to create soil temperature time series that can be used as observations for the inverse model. We show that it is not possible to obtain a reliable parameter estimation using a time series of soil temperature observed at a single depth. Using measurements at two depths, reliable parameter estimates can be obtained although it is not possible to differentiate between latent and sensible heat fluxes. We apply the inverse model to urban flux tower data in Phoenix, United States, and show that the thermal conductivity, volumetric heat capacity and the combined sensible-latent heat transfer coefficient can be reliably estimated using an observed value for the effective surface albedo. The resulting model accurately predicts the outgoing longwave radiation, conductive soil fluxes and the combined sensible-latent heat fluxes.</description>

      <title>EnScale: Temporally-consistent multivariate generative downscaling via proper scoring rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The practical use of future climate projections from global circulation models (GCMs) is often limited by their coarse spatial resolution, requiring downscaling to generate high-resolution data. Regional climate models (RCMs) provide this refinement, but are computationally expensive. To address this issue, machine learning models can learn the downscaling function, mapping coarse GCM outputs to high-resolution fields. Among these, generative approaches aim to capture the full conditional distribution of RCM data given coarse-scale GCM data, which is characterized by large variability and thus challenging to model accurately. We introduce EnScale, a generative machine learning framework that emulates the full GCM-to-RCM map by training on multiple pairs of GCM and corresponding RCM data. It first adjusts large-scale mismatches between GCM and coarsened RCM data, followed by a super-resolution step to generate high-resolution fields. Both steps employ generative models optimized with the energy score, a proper scoring rule. Compared to state-of-the-art ML downscaling approaches, our setup reduces computational cost by about one order of magnitude. EnScale jointly emulates multiple variables -- temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, and wind -- spatially consistent over an area in Central Europe. In addition, we propose a variant EnScale-t that enables temporally consistent downscaling. We establish a comprehensive evaluation framework across various categories including calibration, spatial structure, extremes, and multivariate dependencies. Comparison with diverse benchmarks demonstrates EnScale's strong performance and computational efficiency. EnScale offers a promising approach for accurate and temporally consistent RCM emulation.</description>

      <title>Calibrating Geophysical Predictions under Constrained Probabilistic Distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has shown significant promise in studying complex geophysical dynamical systems, including turbulence and climate processes. Such systems often display sensitive dependence on initial conditions, reflected in positive Lyapunov exponents, where even small perturbations in short-term forecasts can lead to large deviations in long-term outcomes. Thus, meaningful inference requires not only accurate short-term predictions, but also consistency with the system's long-term attractor that is captured by the marginal distribution of state variables. Existing approaches attempt to address this challenge by incorporating spatial and temporal dependence, but these strategies become impractical when data are extremely sparse. In this work, we show that prior knowledge of marginal distributions offers valuable complementary information to short-term observations, motivating a distribution-informed learning framework. We introduce a calibration algorithm based on normalization and the Kernelized Stein Discrepancy (KSD) to enhance ML predictions. The method here employs KSD within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space to calibrate model outputs, improving their fidelity to known physical distributions. This not only sharpens pointwise predictions but also enforces consistency with non-local statistical structures rooted in physical principles. Through synthetic experiments-spanning offline climatological CO2 fluxes and online quasi-geostrophic flow simulations-we demonstrate the robustness and broad utility of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>XiChen: An observation-scalable fully AI-driven global weather forecasting system with 4D variational knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven models have the potential to revolutionize weather forecasting, but still rely on initial conditions generated by costly Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) systems. Although recent end-to-end forecasting models attempt to bypass NWP systems, these methods lack scalable assimilation of new types of observational data. Here, we introduce XiChen, an observation-scalable fully AI-driven global weather forecasting system, wherein the entire pipeline, from Data Assimilation (DA) to medium-range forecasting, can be accomplished within only 15 seconds. XiChen is built upon a foundation model that is pre-trained for weather forecasting and subsequently fine-tuned to serve as both observation operators and DA models, thereby enabling the scalable assimilation of conventional and raw satellite observations. Furthermore, the integration of Four-Dimensional Variational (4DVar) knowledge ensures XiChen to achieve DA and medium-range forecasting accuracy comparable to operational NWP systems, with skillful forecasting lead time beyond 8.75 days. A key feature of XiChen is its ability to maintain physical balance constraints during DA, enabling observed variables to correct unobserved ones effectively. In single-point perturbation DA experiments, XiChen exhibits flow-dependent characteristics similar to those of traditional 4DVar systems. These results demonstrate that XiChen holds strong potential for fully AI-driven weather forecasting independent of NWP systems.</description>
