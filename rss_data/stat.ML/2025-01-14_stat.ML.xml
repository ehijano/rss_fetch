      <title>Counterfactually Fair Reinforcement Learning via Sequential Data Preprocessing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06366v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When applied in healthcare, reinforcement learning (RL) seeks to dynamically match the right interventions to subjects to maximize population benefit. However, the learned policy may disproportionately allocate efficacious actions to one subpopulation, creating or exacerbating disparities in other socioeconomically-disadvantaged subgroups. These biases tend to occur in multi-stage decision making and can be self-perpetuating, which if unaccounted for could cause serious unintended consequences that limit access to care or treatment benefit. Counterfactual fairness (CF) offers a promising statistical tool grounded in causal inference to formulate and study fairness. In this paper, we propose a general framework for fair sequential decision making. We theoretically characterize the optimal CF policy and prove its stationarity, which greatly simplifies the search for optimal CF policies by leveraging existing RL algorithms. The theory also motivates a sequential data preprocessing algorithm to achieve CF decision making under an additive noise assumption. We prove and then validate our policy learning approach in controlling unfairness and attaining optimal value through simulations. Analysis of a digital health dataset designed to reduce opioid misuse shows that our proposal greatly enhances fair access to counseling.</description>

      <title>Computational and Statistical Asymptotic Analysis of the JKO Scheme for Iterative Algorithms to update distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06408v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The seminal paper of Jordan, Kinderlehrer, and Otto introduced what is now widely known as the JKO scheme, an iterative algorithmic framework for computing distributions. This scheme can be interpreted as a Wasserstein gradient flow and has been successfully applied in machine learning contexts, such as deriving policy solutions in reinforcement learning. In this paper, we extend the JKO scheme to accommodate models with unknown parameters. Specifically, we develop statistical methods to estimate these parameters and adapt the JKO scheme to incorporate the estimated values. To analyze the adopted statistical JKO scheme, we establish an asymptotic theory via stochastic partial differential equations that describes its limiting dynamic behavior. Our framework allows both the sample size used in parameter estimation and the number of algorithmic iterations to go to infinity. This study offers a unified framework for joint computational and statistical asymptotic analysis of the statistical JKO scheme. On the computational side, we examine the scheme's dynamic behavior as the number of iterations increases, while on the statistical side, we investigate the large-sample behavior of the resulting distributions computed through the scheme. We conduct numerical simulations to evaluate the finite-sample performance of the proposed methods and validate the developed asymptotic theory.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Causal Structure Discovery and Causal Effect Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To represent the causal relationships between variables, a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is widely utilized in many areas, such as social sciences, epidemics, and genetics. Many causal structure learning approaches are developed to learn the hidden causal structure utilizing deep-learning approaches. However, these approaches have a hidden assumption that the causal relationship remains unchanged over time, which may not hold in real life. In this paper, we develop a new framework to model the dynamic causal graph where the causal relations are allowed to be time-varying. We incorporate the basis approximation method into the score-based causal discovery approach to capture the dynamic pattern of the causal graphs. Utilizing the autoregressive model structure, we could capture both contemporaneous and time-lagged causal relationships while allowing them to vary with time. We propose an algorithm that could provide both past-time estimates and future-time predictions on the causal graphs, and conduct simulations to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method. We also apply the proposed method for the covid-data analysis, and provide causal estimates on how policy restriction's effect changes.</description>

      <title>Variable Selection Methods for Multivariate, Functional, and Complex Biomedical Data in the AI Age</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many problems within personalized medicine and digital health rely on the analysis of continuous-time functional biomarkers and other complex data structures emerging from high-resolution patient monitoring. In this context, this work proposes new optimization-based variable selection methods for multivariate, functional, and even more general outcomes in metrics spaces based on best-subset selection. Our framework applies to several types of regression models, including linear, quantile, or non parametric additive models, and to a broad range of random responses, such as univariate, multivariate Euclidean data, functional, and even random graphs. Our analysis demonstrates that our proposed methodology outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and, especially, in speed-achieving several orders of magnitude improvement over competitors across various type of statistical responses as the case of mathematical functions. While our framework is general and is not designed for a specific regression and scientific problem, the article is self-contained and focuses on biomedical applications. In the clinical areas, serves as a valuable resource for professionals in biostatistics, statistics, and artificial intelligence interested in variable selection problem in this new technological AI-era.</description>

      <title>Automatic Double Reinforcement Learning in Semiparametric Markov Decision Processes with Applications to Long-Term Causal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double reinforcement learning (DRL) enables statistically efficient inference on the value of a policy in a nonparametric Markov Decision Process (MDP) given trajectories generated by another policy. However, this approach necessarily requires stringent overlap between the state distributions, which is often violated in practice. To relax this requirement and extend DRL, we study efficient inference on linear functionals of the $Q$-function (of which policy value is a special case) in infinite-horizon, time-invariant MDPs under semiparametric restrictions on the $Q$-function. These restrictions can reduce the overlap requirement and lower the efficiency bound, yielding more precise estimates. As an important example, we study the evaluation of long-term value under domain adaptation, given a few short trajectories from the new domain and restrictions on the difference between the domains. This can be used for long-term causal inference. Our method combines flexible estimates of the $Q$-function and the Riesz representer of the functional of interest (e.g., the stationary state density ratio for policy value) and is automatic in that we do not need to know the form of the latter - only the functional we care about. To address potential model misspecification bias, we extend the adaptive debiased machine learning (ADML) framework of \citet{van2023adaptive} to construct nonparametrically valid and superefficient estimators that adapt to the functional form of the $Q$-function. As a special case, we propose a novel adaptive debiased plug-in estimator that uses isotonic-calibrated fitted $Q$-iteration - a new calibration algorithm for MDPs - to circumvent the computational challenges of estimating debiasing nuisances from min-max objectives.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Kernelized Contextual Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of contextual kernel bandits with stochastic contexts, where the underlying reward function belongs to a known Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). We study this problem under the additional constraint of joint differential privacy, where the agents needs to ensure that the sequence of query points is differentially private with respect to both the sequence of contexts and rewards. We propose a novel algorithm that improves upon the state of the art and achieves an error rate of $\mathcal{O}\left(\sqrt{\frac{\gamma_T}{T}} + \frac{\gamma_T}{T \varepsilon}\right)$ after $T$ queries for a large class of kernel families, where $\gamma_T$ represents the effective dimensionality of the kernel and $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ is the privacy parameter. Our results are based on a novel estimator for the reward function that simultaneously enjoys high utility along with a low-sensitivity to observed rewards and contexts, which is crucial to obtain an order optimal learning performance with improved dependence on the privacy parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07145v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The signature kernel is a positive definite kernel for sequential and temporal data that has become increasingly popular in machine learning applications due to powerful theoretical guarantees, strong empirical performance, and recently introduced various scalable variations. In this chapter, we give a short introduction to $\texttt{KSig}$, a $\texttt{Scikit-Learn}$ compatible Python package that implements various GPU-accelerated algorithms for computing signature kernels, and performing downstream learning tasks. We also introduce a new algorithm based on tensor sketches which gives strong performance compared to existing algorithms. The package is available at https://github.com/tgcsaba/ksig.</description>

      <title>Pairwise Comparisons without Stochastic Transitivity: Model, Theory and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most statistical models for pairwise comparisons, including the Bradley-Terry (BT) and Thurstone models and many extensions, make a relatively strong assumption of stochastic transitivity. This assumption imposes the existence of an unobserved global ranking among all the players/teams/items and monotone constraints on the comparison probabilities implied by the global ranking. However, the stochastic transitivity assumption does not hold in many real-world scenarios of pairwise comparisons, especially games involving multiple skills or strategies. As a result, models relying on this assumption can have suboptimal predictive performance. In this paper, we propose a general family of statistical models for pairwise comparison data without a stochastic transitivity assumption, substantially extending the BT and Thurstone models. In this model, the pairwise probabilities are determined by a (approximately) low-dimensional skew-symmetric matrix. Likelihood-based estimation methods and computational algorithms are developed, which allow for sparse data with only a small proportion of observed pairs. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed estimator achieves minimax-rate optimality, which adapts effectively to the sparsity level of the data. The spectral theory for skew-symmetric matrices plays a crucial role in the implementation and theoretical analysis. The proposed method's superiority against the BT model, along with its broad applicability across diverse scenarios, is further supported by simulations and real data analysis.</description>

      <title>Synthesis and Analysis of Data as Probability Measures with Entropy-Regularized Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07446v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider synthesis and analysis of probability measures using the entropy-regularized Wasserstein-2 cost and its unbiased version, the Sinkhorn divergence. The synthesis problem consists of computing the barycenter, with respect to these costs, of $m$ reference measures given a set of coefficients belonging to the $m$-dimensional simplex. The analysis problem consists of finding the coefficients for the closest barycenter in the Wasserstein-2 distance to a given measure $\mu$. Under the weakest assumptions on the measures thus far in the literature, we compute the derivative of the entropy-regularized Wasserstein-2 cost. We leverage this to establish a characterization of regularized barycenters as solutions to a fixed-point equation for the average of the entropic maps from the barycenter to the reference measures. This characterization yields a finite-dimensional, convex, quadratic program for solving the analysis problem when $\mu$ is a barycenter. It is shown that these coordinates, as well as the value of the barycenter functional, can be estimated from samples with dimension-independent rates of convergence, a hallmark of entropy-regularized optimal transport, and we verify these rates experimentally. We also establish that barycentric coordinates are stable with respect to perturbations in the Wasserstein-2 metric, suggesting a robustness of these coefficients to corruptions. We employ the barycentric coefficients as features for classification of corrupted point cloud data, and show that compared to neural network baselines, our approach is more efficient in small training data regimes.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Algorithmic Developments in Optimal Transport Problem with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimal Transport (OT) has established itself as a robust framework for quantifying differences between distributions, with applications that span fields such as machine learning, data science, and computer vision. This paper offers a detailed examination of the OT problem, beginning with its theoretical foundations, including the classical formulations of Monge and Kantorovich and their extensions to modern computational techniques. It explores cutting-edge algorithms, including Sinkhorn iterations, primal-dual strategies, and reduction-based approaches, emphasizing their efficiency and scalability in addressing high-dimensional problems. The paper also highlights emerging trends, such as integrating OT into machine learning frameworks, the development of novel problem variants, and ongoing theoretical advancements. Applications of OT are presented across a range of domains, with particular attention to its innovative application in time series data analysis via Optimal Transport Warping (OTW), a robust alternative to methods like Dynamic Time Warping. Despite the significant progress made, challenges related to scalability, robustness, and ethical considerations remain, necessitating further research. The paper underscores OT's potential to bridge theoretical depth and practical utility, fostering impactful advancements across diverse disciplines.</description>

      <title>Cluster Catch Digraphs with the Nearest Neighbor Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new method for clustering based on Cluster Catch Digraphs (CCDs). The new method addresses the limitations of RK-CCDs by employing a new variant of spatial randomness test that employs the nearest neighbor distance (NND) instead of the Ripley's K function used by RK-CCDs. We conduct a comprehensive Monte Carlo analysis to assess the performance of our method, considering factors such as dimensionality, data set size, number of clusters, cluster volumes, and inter-cluster distance. Our method is particularly effective for high-dimensional data sets, comparable to or outperforming KS-CCDs and RK-CCDs that rely on a KS-type statistic or the Ripley's K function. We also evaluate our methods using real and complex data sets, comparing them to well-known clustering methods. Again, our methods exhibit competitive performance, producing high-quality clusters with desirable properties.

      <title>Uncertainty Estimation for Path Loss and Radio Metric Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research leverages Conformal Prediction (CP) in the form of Conformal Predictive Systems (CPS) to accurately estimate uncertainty in a suite of machine learning (ML)-based radio metric models [1] as well as in a 2-D map-based ML path loss model [2]. Utilizing diverse difficulty estimators, we construct 95% confidence prediction intervals (PIs) that are statistically robust. Our experiments demonstrate that CPS models, trained on Toronto datasets, generalize effectively to other cities such as Vancouver and Montreal, maintaining high coverage and reliability. Furthermore, the employed difficulty estimators identify challenging samples, leading to measurable reductions in RMSE as dataset difficulty decreases. These findings highlight the effectiveness of scalable and reliable uncertainty estimation through CPS in wireless network modeling, offering important potential insights for network planning, operations, and spectrum management.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the statistical complexity of offline decision-making with function approximation, establishing (near) minimax-optimal rates for stochastic contextual bandits and Markov decision processes. The performance limits are captured by the pseudo-dimension of the (value) function class and a new characterization of the behavior policy that \emph{strictly} subsumes all the previous notions of data coverage in the offline decision-making literature. In addition, we seek to understand the benefits of using offline data in online decision-making and show nearly minimax-optimal rates in a wide range of regimes.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust Nonlinear Subspace Clustering: A Kernel Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kernel-based subspace clustering, which addresses the nonlinear structures in data, is an evolving area of research. Despite noteworthy progressions, prevailing methodologies predominantly grapple with limitations relating to (i) the influence of predefined kernels on model performance; (ii) the difficulty of preserving the original manifold structures in the nonlinear space; (iii) the dependency of spectral-type strategies on the ideal block diagonal structure of the affinity matrix. This paper presents DKLM, a novel paradigm for kernel-induced nonlinear subspace clustering. DKLM provides a data-driven approach that directly learns the kernel from the data's self-representation, ensuring adaptive weighting and satisfying the multiplicative triangle inequality constraint, which enhances the robustness of the learned kernel. By leveraging this learned kernel, DKLM preserves the local manifold structure of data in a nonlinear space while promoting the formation of an optimal block-diagonal affinity matrix. A thorough theoretical examination of DKLM reveals its relationship with existing clustering paradigms. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>On the Partial Identifiability in Reward Learning: Choosing the Best Reward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Reward Learning (ReL), we are given feedback on an unknown *target reward*, and the goal is to use this information to find it. When the feedback is not informative enough, the target reward is only *partially identifiable*, i.e., there exists a set of rewards (the feasible set) that are equally-compatible with the feedback. In this paper, we show that there exists a choice of reward, non-necessarily contained in the feasible set that, *depending on the ReL application*, improves the performance w.r.t. selecting the reward arbitrarily among the feasible ones. To this aim, we introduce a new *quantitative framework* to analyze ReL problems in a simple yet expressive way. We exemplify the framework in a *reward transfer* use case, for which we devise three provably-efficient ReL algorithms.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of "Spontaneous" Topic Changes in Next Token Prediction with Self-Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human cognition can spontaneously shift conversation topics, often triggered by emotional or contextual signals. In contrast, self-attention-based language models depend on structured statistical cues from input tokens for next-token prediction, lacking this spontaneity. Motivated by this distinction, we investigate the factors that influence the next-token prediction to change the topic of the input sequence. We define concepts of topic continuity, ambiguous sequences, and change of topic, based on defining a topic as a set of token priority graphs (TPGs). Using a simplified single-layer self-attention architecture, we derive analytical characterizations of topic changes. Specifically, we demonstrate that (1) the model maintains the priority order of tokens related to the input topic, (2) a topic change occurs only if lower-priority tokens outnumber all higher-priority tokens of the input topic, and (3) unlike human cognition, longer context lengths and overlapping topics reduce the likelihood of spontaneous redirection. These insights highlight differences between human cognition and self-attention-based models in navigating topic changes and underscore the challenges in designing conversational AI capable of handling "spontaneous" conversations more naturally. To our knowledge, this is the first work to address these questions in such close relation to human conversation and thought.</description>

      <title>Mathematics of Digital Twins and Transfer Learning for PDE Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a digital twin (DT) of a physical system governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) as a model for real-time simulations and control of the system behavior under changing conditions. We construct DTs using the Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve Neural Network (KL-NN) surrogate model and transfer learning (TL). The surrogate model allows fast inference and differentiability with respect to control parameters for control and optimization. TL is used to retrain the model for new conditions with minimal additional data. We employ the moment equations to analyze TL and identify parameters that can be transferred to new conditions. The proposed analysis also guides the control variable selection in DT to facilitate efficient TL.
  For linear PDE problems, the non-transferable parameters in the KL-NN surrogate model can be exactly estimated from a single solution of the PDE corresponding to the mean values of the control variables under new target conditions. Retraining an ML model with a single solution sample is known as one-shot learning, and our analysis shows that the one-shot TL is exact for linear PDEs. For nonlinear PDE problems, transferring of any parameters introduces errors. For a nonlinear diffusion PDE model, we find that for a relatively small range of control variables, some surrogate model parameters can be transferred without introducing a significant error, some can be approximately estimated from the mean-field equation, and the rest can be found using a linear residual least square problem or an ordinary linear least square problem if a small labeled dataset for new conditions is available. The former approach results in a one-shot TL while the latter approach is an example of a few-shot TL. Both methods are approximate for the nonlinear PDEs.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Framework for Reinsurance Optimization: Integrating Generative Models and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinsurance optimization is critical for insurers to manage risk exposure, ensure financial stability, and maintain solvency. Traditional approaches often struggle with dynamic claim distributions, high-dimensional constraints, and evolving market conditions. This paper introduces a novel hybrid framework that integrates {Generative Models}, specifically Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), with {Reinforcement Learning (RL)} using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The framework enables dynamic and scalable optimization of reinsurance strategies by combining the generative modeling of complex claim distributions with the adaptive decision-making capabilities of reinforcement learning.
  The VAE component generates synthetic claims, including rare and catastrophic events, addressing data scarcity and variability, while the PPO algorithm dynamically adjusts reinsurance parameters to maximize surplus and minimize ruin probability. The framework's performance is validated through extensive experiments, including out-of-sample testing, stress-testing scenarios (e.g., pandemic impacts, catastrophic events), and scalability analysis across portfolio sizes. Results demonstrate its superior adaptability, scalability, and robustness compared to traditional optimization techniques, achieving higher final surpluses and computational efficiency.
  Key contributions include the development of a hybrid approach for high-dimensional optimization, dynamic reinsurance parameterization, and validation against stochastic claim distributions. The proposed framework offers a transformative solution for modern reinsurance challenges, with potential applications in multi-line insurance operations, catastrophe modeling, and risk-sharing strategy design.</description>

      <title>Reliable Imputed-Sample Assisted Vertical Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is a well-known FL variant that enables multiple parties to collaboratively train a model without sharing their raw data. Existing VFL approaches focus on overlapping samples among different parties, while their performance is constrained by the limited number of these samples, leaving numerous non-overlapping samples unexplored. Some previous work has explored techniques for imputing missing values in samples, but often without adequate attention to the quality of the imputed samples. To address this issue, we propose a Reliable Imputed-Sample Assisted (RISA) VFL framework to effectively exploit non-overlapping samples by selecting reliable imputed samples for training VFL models. Specifically, after imputing non-overlapping samples, we introduce evidence theory to estimate the uncertainty of imputed samples, and only samples with low uncertainty are selected. In this way, high-quality non-overlapping samples are utilized to improve VFL model. Experiments on two widely used datasets demonstrate the significant performance gains achieved by the RISA, especially with the limited overlapping samples, e.g., a 48% accuracy gain on CIFAR-10 with only 1% overlapping samples.</description>

      <title>Learning dynamical systems with hit-and-run random feature maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how random feature maps can be used to forecast dynamical systems with excellent forecasting skill. We consider the tanh activation function and judiciously choose the internal weights in a data-driven manner such that the resulting features explore the nonlinear, non-saturated regions of the activation function. We introduce skip connections and construct a deep variant of random feature maps by combining several units. To mitigate the curse of dimensionality, we introduce localization where we learn local maps, employing conditional independence. Our modified random feature maps provide excellent forecasting skill for both single trajectory forecasts as well as long-time estimates of statistical properties, for a range of chaotic dynamical systems with dimensions up to 512. In contrast to other methods such as reservoir computers which require extensive hyperparameter tuning, we effectively need to tune only a single hyperparameter, and are able to achieve state-of-the-art forecast skill with much smaller networks.</description>

      <title>Tab-Shapley: Identifying Top-k Tabular Data Quality Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an unsupervised method for aggregating anomalies in tabular datasets by identifying the top-k tabular data quality insights. Each insight consists of a set of anomalous attributes and the corresponding subsets of records that serve as evidence to the user. The process of identifying these insight blocks is challenging due to (i) the absence of labeled anomalies, (ii) the exponential size of the subset search space, and (iii) the complex dependencies among attributes, which obscure the true sources of anomalies. Simple frequency-based methods fail to capture these dependencies, leading to inaccurate results. To address this, we introduce Tab-Shapley, a cooperative game theory based framework that uses Shapley values to quantify the contribution of each attribute to the data's anomalous nature. While calculating Shapley values typically requires exponential time, we show that our game admits a closed-form solution, making the computation efficient. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through empirical analysis on real-world tabular datasets with ground-truth anomaly labels.</description>

      <title>Identification and Estimation of Simultaneous Equation Models Using Higher-Order Cumulant Restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying structural parameters in linear simultaneous equation models is a fundamental challenge in economics and related fields. Recent work leverages higher-order distributional moments, exploiting the fact that non-Gaussian data carry more structural information than the Gaussian framework. While many of these contributions still require zero-covariance assumptions for structural errors, this paper shows that such an assumption can be dispensed with. Specifically, we demonstrate that under any diagonal higher-cumulant condition, the structural parameter matrix can be identified by solving an eigenvector problem. This yields a direct identification argument and motivates a simple sample-analogue estimator that is both consistent and asymptotically normal. Moreover, when uncorrelatedness may still be plausible -- such as in vector autoregression models -- our framework offers a transparent way to test for it, all within the same higher-order orthogonality setting employed by earlier studies. Monte Carlo simulations confirm desirable finite-sample performance, and we further illustrate the method's practical value in two empirical applications.</description>

      <title>Doubly Robust Inference on Causal Derivative Effects for Continuous Treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statistical methods for causal inference with continuous treatments mainly focus on estimating the mean potential outcome function, commonly known as the dose-response curve. However, it is often not the dose-response curve but its derivative function that signals the treatment effect. In this paper, we investigate nonparametric inference on the derivative of the dose-response curve with and without the positivity condition. Under the positivity and other regularity conditions, we propose a doubly robust (DR) inference method for estimating the derivative of the dose-response curve using kernel smoothing. When the positivity condition is violated, we demonstrate the inconsistency of conventional inverse probability weighting (IPW) and DR estimators, and introduce novel bias-corrected IPW and DR estimators. In all settings, our DR estimator achieves asymptotic normality at the standard nonparametric rate of convergence. Additionally, our approach reveals an interesting connection to nonparametric support and level set estimation problems. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our proposed estimators through simulations and a case study of evaluating a job training program.</description>

      <title>Monotone Curve Estimation via Convex Duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06975v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A principal curve serves as a powerful tool for uncovering underlying structures of data through 1-dimensional smooth and continuous representations. On the basis of optimal transport theories, this paper introduces a novel principal curve framework constrained by monotonicity with rigorous theoretical justifications. We establish statistical guarantees for our monotone curve estimate, including expected empirical and generalized mean squared errors, while proving the existence of such estimates. These statistical foundations justify adopting the popular early stopping procedure in machine learning to implement our numeric algorithm with neural networks. Comprehensive simulation studies reveal that the proposed monotone curve estimate outperforms competing methods in terms of accuracy when the data exhibits a monotonic structure. Moreover, through two real-world applications on future prices of copper, gold, and silver, and avocado prices and sales volume, we underline the robustness of our curve estimate against variable transformation, further confirming its effective applicability for noisy and complex data sets. We believe that this monotone curve-fitting framework offers significant potential for numerous applications where monotonic relationships are intrinsic or need to be imposed.</description>

      <title>Advancing Single-Snapshot DOA Estimation with Siamese Neural Networks for Sparse Linear Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-snapshot signal processing in sparse linear arrays has become increasingly vital, particularly in dynamic environments like automotive radar systems, where only limited snapshots are available. These arrays are often utilized either to cut manufacturing costs or result from unintended antenna failures, leading to challenges such as high sidelobe levels and compromised accuracy in direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation. Despite deep learning's success in tasks such as DOA estimation, the need for extensive training data to increase target numbers or improve angular resolution poses significant challenges. In response, this paper presents a novel Siamese neural network (SNN) featuring a sparse augmentation layer, which enhances signal feature embedding and DOA estimation accuracy in sparse arrays. We demonstrate the enhanced DOA estimation performance of our approach through detailed feature analysis and performance evaluation. The code for this study is available at https://github.com/ruxinzh/SNNS_SLA.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Agreement: How to find the Ideal Number of Anomaly Classes in Correlated, Multivariate Time Series Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting and classifying abnormal system states is critical for condition monitoring, but supervised methods often fall short due to the rarity of anomalies and the lack of labeled data. Therefore, clustering is often used to group similar abnormal behavior. However, evaluating cluster quality without ground truth is challenging, as existing measures such as the Silhouette Score (SSC) only evaluate the cohesion and separation of clusters and ignore possible prior knowledge about the data. To address this challenge, we introduce the Synchronized Anomaly Agreement Index (SAAI), which exploits the synchronicity of anomalies across multivariate time series to assess cluster quality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SAAI by showing that maximizing SAAI improves accuracy on the task of finding the true number of anomaly classes K in correlated time series by 0.23 compared to SSC and by 0.32 compared to X-Means. We also show that clusters obtained by maximizing SAAI are easier to interpret compared to SSC.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Guarantees on Automated Precision Weeding using Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precision agriculture in general, and precision weeding in particular, have greatly benefited from the major advancements in deep learning and computer vision. A large variety of commercial robotic solutions are already available and deployed. However, the adoption by farmers of such solutions is still low for many reasons, an important one being the lack of trust in these systems. This is in great part due to the opaqueness and complexity of deep neural networks and the manufacturers' inability to provide valid guarantees on their performance. Conformal prediction, a well-established methodology in the machine learning community, is an efficient and reliable strategy for providing trustworthy guarantees on the predictions of any black-box model under very minimal constraints. Bridging the gap between the safe machine learning and precision agriculture communities, this article showcases conformal prediction in action on the task of precision weeding through deep learning-based image classification. After a detailed presentation of the conformal prediction methodology and the development of a precision spraying pipeline based on a ''conformalized'' neural network and well-defined spraying decision rules, the article evaluates this pipeline on two real-world scenarios: one under in-distribution conditions, the other reflecting a near out-of-distribution setting. The results show that we are able to provide formal, i.e. certifiable, guarantees on spraying at least 90% of the weeds.</description>

      <title>Generalizable Graph Neural Networks for Robust Power Grid Topology Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The energy transition necessitates new congestion management methods. One such method is controlling the grid topology with machine learning (ML). This approach has gained popularity following the Learning to Run a Power Network (L2RPN) competitions. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a class of ML models that reflect graph structure in their computation, which makes them suitable for power grid modeling. Various GNN approaches for topology control have thus been proposed. We propose the first GNN model for grid topology control that uses only GNN layers. Additionally, we identify the busbar information asymmetry problem that the popular homogeneous graph representation suffers from, and propose a heterogeneous graph representation to resolve it. We train both homogeneous and heterogeneous GNNs and fully connected neural networks (FCNN) baselines on an imitation learning task. We evaluate the models according to their classification accuracy and grid operation ability. We find that the heterogeneous GNNs perform best on in-distribution networks, followed by the FCNNs, and lastly, the homogeneous GNNs. We also find that both GNN types generalize better to out-of-distribution networks than FCNNs.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel deep clustering method that integrates Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) into the Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework. Our approach models the probability distribution of each cluster with a VAE and alternates between updating model parameters by maximizing the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) of the log-likelihood and refining cluster assignments based on the learned distributions. This enables effective clustering and generation of new samples from each cluster. Unlike existing VAE-based methods, our approach eliminates the need for a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) prior or additional regularization techniques. Experiments on MNIST and FashionMNIST demonstrate superior clustering performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Derivation of effective gradient flow equations and dynamical truncation of training data in Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive explicit equations governing the cumulative biases and weights in Deep Learning with ReLU activation function, based on gradient descent for the Euclidean cost in the input layer, and under the assumption that the weights are, in a precise sense, adapted to the coordinate system distinguished by the activations. We show that gradient descent corresponds to a dynamical process in the input layer, whereby clusters of data are progressively reduced in complexity ("truncated") at an exponential rate that increases with the number of data points that have already been truncated. We provide a detailed discussion of several types of solutions to the gradient flow equations. A main motivation for this work is to shed light on the interpretability question in supervised learning.</description>

      <title>Communication-Efficient, 2D Parallel Stochastic Gradient Descent for Distributed-Memory Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed-memory implementations of numerical optimization algorithm, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD), require interprocessor communication at every iteration of the algorithm. On modern distributed-memory clusters where communication is more expensive than computation, the scalability and performance of these algorithms are limited by communication cost. This work generalizes prior work on 1D $s$-step SGD and 1D Federated SGD with Averaging (FedAvg) to yield a 2D parallel SGD method (HybridSGD) which attains a continuous performance trade off between the two baseline algorithms. We present theoretical analysis which show the convergence, computation, communication, and memory trade offs between $s$-step SGD, FedAvg, 2D parallel SGD, and other parallel SGD variants. We implement all algorithms in C++ and MPI and evaluate their performance on a Cray EX supercomputing system. Our empirical results show that HybridSGD achieves better convergence than FedAvg at similar processor scales while attaining speedups of $5.3\times$ over $s$-step SGD and speedups up to $121\times$ over FedAvg when used to solve binary classification tasks using the convex, logistic regression model on datasets obtained from the LIBSVM repository.</description>

      <title>disco: Distributional Synthetic Controls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The method of synthetic controls is widely used for evaluating causal effects of policy changes in settings with observational data. Often, researchers aim to estimate the causal impact of policy interventions on a treated unit at an aggregate level while also possessing data at a finer granularity. In this article, we introduce the new disco command, which implements the Distributional Synthetic Controls method introduced in Gunsilius (2023). This command allows researchers to construct entire synthetic distributions for the treated unit based on an optimally weighted average of the distributions of the control units. Several aggregation schemes are provided to facilitate clear reporting of the distributional effects of the treatment. The package offers both quantile-based and CDF-based approaches, comprehensive inference procedures via bootstrap and permutation methods, and visualization capabilities. We empirically illustrate the use of the package by replicating the results in Van Dijcke et al. (2024).</description>

      <title>Geometric Scattering on Measure Spaces</title>

Abstract: The scattering transform is a multilayered, wavelet-based transform initially introduced as a model of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that has played a foundational role in our understanding of these networks' stability and invariance properties. Subsequently, there has been widespread interest in extending the success of CNNs to data sets with non-Euclidean structure, such as graphs and manifolds, leading to the emerging field of geometric deep learning. In order to improve our understanding of the architectures used in this new field, several papers have proposed generalizations of the scattering transform for non-Euclidean data structures such as undirected graphs and compact Riemannian manifolds without boundary.
  In this paper, we introduce a general, unified model for geometric scattering on measure spaces. Our proposed framework includes previous work on geometric scattering as special cases but also applies to more general settings such as directed graphs, signed graphs, and manifolds with boundary. We propose a new criterion that identifies to which groups a useful representation should be invariant and show that this criterion is sufficient to guarantee that the scattering transform has desirable stability and invariance properties. Additionally, we consider finite measure spaces that are obtained from randomly sampling an unknown manifold. We propose two methods for constructing a data-driven graph on which the associated graph scattering transform approximates the scattering transform on the underlying manifold. Moreover, we use a diffusion-maps based approach to prove quantitative estimates on the rate of convergence of one of these approximations as the number of sample points tends to infinity. Lastly, we showcase the utility of our method on spherical images, directed graphs, and on high-dimensional single-cell data.</description>

      <title>Integral Probability Metrics Meet Neural Networks: The Radon-Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02422v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integral probability metrics (IPMs) constitute a general class of nonparametric two-sample tests that are based on maximizing the mean difference between samples from one distribution $P$ versus another $Q$, over all choices of data transformations $f$ living in some function space $\mathcal{F}$. Inspired by recent work that connects what are known as functions of $\textit{Radon bounded variation}$ (RBV) and neural networks (Parhi and Nowak, 2021, 2023), we study the IPM defined by taking $\mathcal{F}$ to be the unit ball in the RBV space of a given smoothness degree $k \geq 0$. This test, which we refer to as the $\textit{Radon-Kolmogorov-Smirnov}$ (RKS) test, can be viewed as a generalization of the well-known and classical Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test to multiple dimensions and higher orders of smoothness. It is also intimately connected to neural networks: we prove that the witness in the RKS test -- the function $f$ achieving the maximum mean difference -- is always a ridge spline of degree $k$, i.e., a single neuron in a neural network. We can thus leverage the power of modern neural network optimization toolkits to (approximately) maximize the criterion that underlies the RKS test. We prove that the RKS test has asymptotically full power at distinguishing any distinct pair $P \not= Q$ of distributions, derive its asymptotic null distribution, and carry out experiments to elucidate the strengths and weaknesses of the RKS test versus the more traditional kernel MMD test.</description>

      <title>Replicability is Asymptotically Free in Multi-armed Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a replicable stochastic multi-armed bandit algorithm that ensures, with high probability, that the algorithm's sequence of actions is not affected by the randomness inherent in the dataset. Replicability allows third parties to reproduce published findings and assists the original researcher in applying standard statistical tests. We observe that existing algorithms require $O(K^2/\rho^2)$ times more regret than nonreplicable algorithms, where $K$ is the number of arms and $\rho$ is the level of nonreplication. However, we demonstrate that this additional cost is unnecessary when the time horizon $T$ is sufficiently large for a given $K, \rho$, provided that the magnitude of the confidence bounds is chosen carefully. Therefore, for a large $T$, our algorithm only suffers $K^2/\rho^2$ times smaller amount of exploration than existing algorithms. To ensure the replicability of the proposed algorithms, we incorporate randomness into their decision-making processes. We propose a principled approach to limiting the probability of nonreplication. This approach elucidates the steps that existing research has implicitly followed. Furthermore, we derive the first lower bound for the two-armed replicable bandit problem, which implies the optimality of the proposed algorithms up to a $\log\log T$ factor for the two-armed case.</description>

Abstract: It is well-known that randomly initialized, push-forward, fully-connected neural networks weakly converge to isotropic Gaussian processes, in the limit where the width of all layers goes to infinity. In this paper, we propose to use the angular power spectrum of the limiting field to characterize the complexity of the network architecture. In particular, we define sequences of random variables associated with the angular power spectrum, and provide a full characterization of the network complexity in terms of the asymptotic distribution of these sequences as the depth diverges. On this basis, we classify neural networks as low-disorder, sparse, or high-disorder; we show how this classification highlights a number of distinct features for standard activation functions, and in particular, sparsity properties of ReLU networks. Our theoretical results are also validated by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Rough Transformers: Lightweight and Continuous Time Series Modelling through Signature Patching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20799v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-series data in real-world settings typically exhibit long-range dependencies and are observed at non-uniform intervals. In these settings, traditional sequence-based recurrent models struggle. To overcome this, researchers often replace recurrent architectures with Neural ODE-based models to account for irregularly sampled data and use Transformer-based architectures to account for long-range dependencies. Despite the success of these two approaches, both incur very high computational costs for input sequences of even moderate length. To address this challenge, we introduce the Rough Transformer, a variation of the Transformer model that operates on continuous-time representations of input sequences and incurs significantly lower computational costs. In particular, we propose multi-view signature attention, which uses path signatures to augment vanilla attention and to capture both local and global (multi-scale) dependencies in the input data, while remaining robust to changes in the sequence length and sampling frequency and yielding improved spatial processing. We find that, on a variety of time-series-related tasks, Rough Transformers consistently outperform their vanilla attention counterparts while obtaining the representational benefits of Neural ODE-based models, all at a fraction of the computational time and memory resources.</description>

      <title>Learning Spectral Methods by Transformers</title>

Abstract: Transformers demonstrate significant advantages as the building block of modern LLMs. In this work, we study the capacities of Transformers in performing unsupervised learning. We show that multi-layered Transformers, given a sufficiently large set of pre-training instances, are able to learn the algorithms themselves and perform statistical estimation tasks given new instances. This learning paradigm is distinct from the in-context learning setup and is similar to the learning procedure of human brains where skills are learned through past experience. Theoretically, we prove that pre-trained Transformers can learn the spectral methods and use the classification of bi-class Gaussian mixture model as an example. Our proof is constructive using algorithmic design techniques. Our results are built upon the similarities of multi-layered Transformer architecture with the iterative recovery algorithms used in practice. Empirically, we verify the strong capacity of the multi-layered (pre-trained) Transformer on unsupervised learning through the lens of both the PCA and the Clustering tasks performed on the synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1912.00043v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose to study neural networks' loss surfaces by methods of topological data analysis. We suggest to apply barcodes of Morse complexes to explore topology of loss surfaces. An algorithm for calculations of the loss function's barcodes of local minima is described. We have conducted experiments for calculating barcodes of local minima for benchmark functions and for loss surfaces of small neural networks. Our experiments confirm our two principal observations for neural networks' loss surfaces. First, the barcodes of local minima are located in a small lower part of the range of values of neural networks' loss function. Secondly, increase of the neural network's depth and width lowers the barcodes of local minima. This has some natural implications for the neural network's learning and for its generalization properties.</description>

      <title>Statistical and Computational Efficiency for Smooth Tensor Estimation with Unknown Permutations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.04681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of structured tensor denoising in the presence of unknown permutations. Such data problems arise commonly in recommendation system, neuroimaging, community detection, and multiway comparison applications. Here, we develop a general family of smooth tensor models up to arbitrary index permutations; the model incorporates the popular tensor block models and Lipschitz hypergraphon models as special cases. We show that a constrained least-squares estimator in the block-wise polynomial family achieves the minimax error bound. A phase transition phenomenon is revealed with respect to the smoothness threshold needed for optimal recovery. In particular, we find that a polynomial of degree up to $(m-2)(m+1)/2$ is sufficient for accurate recovery of order-$m$ tensors, whereas higher degree exhibits no further benefits. This phenomenon reveals the intrinsic distinction for smooth tensor estimation problems with and without unknown permutations. Furthermore, we provide an efficient polynomial-time Borda count algorithm that provably achieves optimal rate under monotonicity assumptions. The efficacy of our procedure is demonstrated through both simulations and Chicago crime data analysis.</description>

      <title>Change-point Detection and Segmentation of Discrete Data using Bayesian Context Trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.04341v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new Bayesian modelling framework is introduced for piece-wise homogeneous variable-memory Markov chains, along with a collection of effective algorithmic tools for change-point detection and segmentation of discrete time series. Building on the recently introduced Bayesian Context Trees (BCT) framework, the distributions of different segments in a discrete time series are described as variable-memory Markov chains. Inference for the presence and location of change-points is then performed via Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The key observation that facilitates effective sampling is that, using one of the BCT algorithms, the prior predictive likelihood of the data can be computed exactly, integrating out all the models and parameters in each segment. This makes it possible to sample directly from the posterior distribution of the number and location of the change-points, leading to accurate estimates and providing a natural quantitative measure of uncertainty in the results. Estimates of the actual model in each segment can also be obtained, at essentially no additional computational cost. Results on both simulated and real-world data indicate that the proposed methodology performs better than or as well as state-of-the-art techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04611v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current AI-assisted protein design mainly utilizes protein sequential and structural information. Meanwhile, there exists tremendous knowledge curated by humans in the text format describing proteins' high-level functionalities. Yet, whether the incorporation of such text data can help protein design tasks has not been explored. To bridge this gap, we propose ProteinDT, a multi-modal framework that leverages textual descriptions for protein design. ProteinDT consists of three subsequent steps: ProteinCLAP which aligns the representation of two modalities, a facilitator that generates the protein representation from the text modality, and a decoder that creates the protein sequences from the representation. To train ProteinDT, we construct a large dataset, SwissProtCLAP, with 441K text and protein pairs. We quantitatively verify the effectiveness of ProteinDT on three challenging tasks: (1) over 90% accuracy for text-guided protein generation; (2) best hit ratio on 12 zero-shot text-guided protein editing tasks; (3) superior performance on four out of six protein property prediction benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07886v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the nonconvex optimization problem associated with the decomposition of a real symmetric tensor into a sum of rank one terms. Use is made of the rich symmetry structure to construct infinite families of critical points represented by Puiseux series in the problem dimension, and so obtain precise analytic estimates on the value of the objective function and the Hessian spectrum. The results allow an analytic characterization of various obstructions to using local optimization methods, revealing in particular a complex array of saddles and minima differing by their symmetry, structure and analytic properties. A~desirable phenomenon, occurring for all critical points considered, concerns the number of negative Hessian eigenvalues increasing with the value of the objective function. Our approach makes use of Newton polyhedra as well as results from real algebraic geometry, notably the Curve Selection Lemma, to determine the extremal character of degenerate critical points, establishing in particular the existence of infinite families of third-order saddles which can significantly slow down the optimization process.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies iterative schemes for measure transfer and approximation problems, which are defined through a slicing-and-matching procedure. Similar to the sliced Wasserstein distance, these schemes benefit from the availability of closed-form solutions for the one-dimensional optimal transport problem and the associated computational advantages. While such schemes have already been successfully utilized in data science applications, not too many results on their convergence are available. The main contribution of this paper is an almost sure convergence proof for stochastic slicing-and-matching schemes. The proof builds on an interpretation as a stochastic gradient descent scheme on the Wasserstein space. Numerical examples on step-wise image morphing are demonstrated as well.</description>

      <title>Neural Bayes Estimators for Irregular Spatial Data using Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02600v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural Bayes estimators are neural networks that approximate Bayes estimators in a fast and likelihood-free manner. Although they are appealing to use with spatial models, where estimation is often a computational bottleneck, neural Bayes estimators in spatial applications have, to date, been restricted to data collected over a regular grid. These estimators are also currently dependent on a prescribed set of spatial locations, which means that the neural network needs to be re-trained for new data sets; this renders them impractical in many applications and impedes their widespread adoption. In this work, we employ graph neural networks to tackle the important problem of parameter point estimation from data collected over arbitrary spatial locations. In addition to extending neural Bayes estimation to irregular spatial data, our architecture leads to substantial computational benefits, since the estimator can be used with any configuration or number of locations and independent replicates, thus amortising the cost of training for a given spatial model. We also facilitate fast uncertainty quantification by training an accompanying neural Bayes estimator that approximates a set of marginal posterior quantiles. We illustrate our methodology on Gaussian and max-stable processes. Finally, we showcase our methodology on a data set of global sea-surface temperature, where we estimate the parameters of a Gaussian process model in 2161 spatial regions, each containing thousands of irregularly-spaced data points, in just a few minutes with a single graphics processing unit.</description>

      <title>Improving the Performance of Echo State Networks Through State Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computing, using nonlinear dynamical systems, offers a cost-effective alternative to neural networks for complex tasks involving processing of sequential data, time series modeling, and system identification. Echo state networks (ESNs), a type of reservoir computer, mirror neural networks but simplify training. They apply fixed, random linear transformations to the internal state, followed by nonlinear changes. This process, guided by input signals and linear regression, adapts the system to match target characteristics, reducing computational demands. A potential drawback of ESNs is that the fixed reservoir may not offer the complexity needed for specific problems. While directly altering (training) the internal ESN would reintroduce the computational burden, an indirect modification can be achieved by redirecting some output as input. This feedback can influence the internal reservoir state, yielding ESNs with enhanced complexity suitable for broader challenges. In this paper, we demonstrate that by feeding some component of the reservoir state back into the network through the input, we can drastically improve upon the performance of a given ESN. We rigorously prove that, for any given ESN, feedback will almost always improve the accuracy of the output. For a set of three tasks, each representing different problem classes, we find that with feedback the average error measures are reduced by $30\%-60\%$. Remarkably, feedback provides at least an equivalent performance boost to doubling the initial number of computational nodes, a computationally expensive and technologically challenging alternative. These results demonstrate the broad applicability and substantial usefulness of this feedback scheme.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Forecasting of Irregular Time Series via Conditional Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06293v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic forecasting of irregularly sampled multivariate time series with missing values is an important problem in many fields, including health care, astronomy, and climate. State-of-the-art methods for the task estimate only marginal distributions of observations in single channels and at single timepoints, assuming a fixed-shape parametric distribution. In this work, we propose a novel model, ProFITi, for probabilistic forecasting of irregularly sampled time series with missing values using conditional normalizing flows. The model learns joint distributions over the future values of the time series conditioned on past observations and queried channels and times, without assuming any fixed shape of the underlying distribution. As model components, we introduce a novel invertible triangular attention layer and an invertible non-linear activation function on and onto the whole real line. We conduct extensive experiments on four datasets and demonstrate that the proposed model provides $4$ times higher likelihood over the previously best model.</description>

      <title>Fast and reliable uncertainty quantification with neural network ensembles for industrial image classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10182v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image classification with neural networks (NNs) is widely used in industrial processes, situations where the model likely encounters unknown objects during deployment, i.e., out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Worryingly, NNs tend to make confident yet incorrect predictions when confronted with OOD data. To increase the models' reliability, they should quantify the uncertainty in their own predictions, communicating when the output should (not) be trusted. Deep ensembles, composed of multiple independent NNs, have been shown to perform strongly but are computationally expensive. Recent research has proposed more efficient NN ensembles, namely the snapshot, batch, and multi-input multi-output ensemble. This study investigates the predictive and uncertainty performance of efficient NN ensembles in the context of image classification for industrial processes. It is the first to provide a comprehensive comparison and it proposes a novel Diversity Quality metric to quantify the ensembles' performance on the in-distribution and OOD sets in one single metric. The results highlight the batch ensemble as a cost-effective and competitive alternative to the deep ensemble. It matches the deep ensemble in both uncertainty and accuracy while exhibiting considerable savings in training time, test time, and memory storage.</description>

      <title>A rescaling-invariant Lipschitz bound based on path-metrics for modern ReLU network parameterizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lipschitz bounds on neural network parameterizations are important to establish generalization, quantization or pruning guarantees, as they control the robustness of the network with respect to parameter changes. Yet, there are few Lipschitz bounds with respect to parameters in the literature, and existing ones only apply to simple feedforward architectures, while also failing to capture the intrinsic rescaling-symmetries of ReLU networks. This paper proves a new Lipschitz bound in terms of the so-called path-metrics of the parameters. Since this bound is intrinsically invariant with respect to the rescaling symmetries of the networks, it sharpens previously known Lipschitz bounds. It is also, to the best of our knowledge, the first bound of its kind that is broadly applicable to modern networks such as ResNets, VGGs, U-nets, and many more.</description>

      <title>Improving Linear System Solvers for Hyperparameter Optimisation in Iterative Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18457v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scaling hyperparameter optimisation to very large datasets remains an open problem in the Gaussian process community. This paper focuses on iterative methods, which use linear system solvers, like conjugate gradients, alternating projections or stochastic gradient descent, to construct an estimate of the marginal likelihood gradient. We discuss three key improvements which are applicable across solvers: (i) a pathwise gradient estimator, which reduces the required number of solver iterations and amortises the computational cost of making predictions, (ii) warm starting linear system solvers with the solution from the previous step, which leads to faster solver convergence at the cost of negligible bias, (iii) early stopping linear system solvers after a limited computational budget, which synergises with warm starting, allowing solver progress to accumulate over multiple marginal likelihood steps. These techniques provide speed-ups of up to $72\times$ when solving to tolerance, and decrease the average residual norm by up to $7\times$ when stopping early.</description>

      <title>Modeling Latent Neural Dynamics with Gaussian Process Switching Linear Dynamical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03330v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how the collective activity of neural populations relates to computation and ultimately behavior is a key goal in neuroscience. To this end, statistical methods which describe high-dimensional neural time series in terms of low-dimensional latent dynamics have played a fundamental role in characterizing neural systems. Yet, what constitutes a successful method involves two opposing criteria: (1) methods should be expressive enough to capture complex nonlinear dynamics, and (2) they should maintain a notion of interpretability often only warranted by simpler linear models. In this paper, we develop an approach that balances these two objectives: the Gaussian Process Switching Linear Dynamical System (gpSLDS). Our method builds on previous work modeling the latent state evolution via a stochastic differential equation whose nonlinear dynamics are described by a Gaussian process (GP-SDEs). We propose a novel kernel function which enforces smoothly interpolated locally linear dynamics, and therefore expresses flexible -- yet interpretable -- dynamics akin to those of recurrent switching linear dynamical systems (rSLDS). Our approach resolves key limitations of the rSLDS such as artifactual oscillations in dynamics near discrete state boundaries, while also providing posterior uncertainty estimates of the dynamics. To fit our models, we leverage a modified learning objective which improves the estimation accuracy of kernel hyperparameters compared to previous GP-SDE fitting approaches. We apply our method to synthetic data and data recorded in two neuroscience experiments and demonstrate favorable performance in comparison to the rSLDS.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Interpretation of Adaptive Low-Rank Adaptation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the sensitivity-based importance score of the adaptive low-rank adaptation (AdaLoRA), we utilize more theoretically supported metrics, including the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), along with the Improved Variational Online Newton (IVON) optimizer, for adaptive parameter budget allocation. The resulting Bayesian counterpart not only has matched or surpassed the performance of using the sensitivity-based importance metric but is also a faster alternative to AdaLoRA with Adam. Our theoretical analysis reveals a significant connection between the two metrics, providing a Bayesian perspective on the efficacy of sensitivity as an importance score. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the magnitude, rather than the variance, is the primary indicator of the importance of parameters.</description>

      <title>Q-Distribution guided Q-learning for offline reinforcement learning: Uncertainty penalized Q-value via consistency model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: ``Distribution shift'' is the main obstacle to the success of offline reinforcement learning. A learning policy may take actions beyond the behavior policy's knowledge, referred to as Out-of-Distribution (OOD) actions. The Q-values for these OOD actions can be easily overestimated. As a result, the learning policy is biased by using incorrect Q-value estimates. One common approach to avoid Q-value overestimation is to make a pessimistic adjustment. Our key idea is to penalize the Q-values of OOD actions associated with high uncertainty. In this work, we propose Q-Distribution Guided Q-Learning (QDQ), which applies a pessimistic adjustment to Q-values in OOD regions based on uncertainty estimation. This uncertainty measure relies on the conditional Q-value distribution, learned through a high-fidelity and efficient consistency model. Additionally, to prevent overly conservative estimates, we introduce an uncertainty-aware optimization objective for updating the Q-value function. The proposed QDQ demonstrates solid theoretical guarantees for the accuracy of Q-value distribution learning and uncertainty measurement, as well as the performance of the learning policy. QDQ consistently shows strong performance on the D4RL benchmark and achieves significant improvements across many tasks.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Aleatoric Uncertainty of the Treatment Effect: A Novel Orthogonal Learner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating causal quantities from observational data is crucial for understanding the safety and effectiveness of medical treatments. However, to make reliable inferences, medical practitioners require not only estimating averaged causal quantities, such as the conditional average treatment effect, but also understanding the randomness of the treatment effect as a random variable. This randomness is referred to as aleatoric uncertainty and is necessary for understanding the probability of benefit from treatment or quantiles of the treatment effect. Yet, the aleatoric uncertainty of the treatment effect has received surprisingly little attention in the causal machine learning community. To fill this gap, we aim to quantify the aleatoric uncertainty of the treatment effect at the covariate-conditional level, namely, the conditional distribution of the treatment effect (CDTE). Unlike average causal quantities, the CDTE is not point identifiable without strong additional assumptions. As a remedy, we employ partial identification to obtain sharp bounds on the CDTE and thereby quantify the aleatoric uncertainty of the treatment effect. We then develop a novel, orthogonal learner for the bounds on the CDTE, which we call AU-learner. We further show that our AU-learner has several strengths in that it satisfies Neyman-orthogonality and, thus, quasi-oracle efficiency. Finally, we propose a fully-parametric deep learning instantiation of our AU-learner.</description>

      <title>A cohomology-based Gromov-Hausdorff metric approach for quantifying molecular similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce, for the first time, a cohomology-based Gromov-Hausdorff ultrametric method to analyze 1-dimensional and higher-dimensional (co)homology groups, focusing on loops, voids, and higher-dimensional cavity structures in simplicial complexes, to address typical clustering questions arising in molecular data analysis. The Gromov-Hausdorff distance quantifies the dissimilarity between two metric spaces. In this framework, molecules are represented as simplicial complexes, and their cohomology vector spaces are computed to capture intrinsic topological invariants encoding loop and cavity structures. These vector spaces are equipped with a suitable distance measure, enabling the computation of the Gromov-Hausdorff ultrametric to evaluate structural dissimilarities. We demonstrate the methodology using organic-inorganic halide perovskite (OIHP) structures. The results highlight the effectiveness of this approach in clustering various molecular structures. By incorporating geometric information, our method provides deeper insights compared to traditional persistent homology techniques.</description>

Abstract: Simulation methods have always been instrumental in finance, and data-driven methods with minimal model specification, commonly referred to as generative models, have attracted increasing attention, especially after the success of deep learning in a broad range of fields. However, the adoption of these models in financial applications has not kept pace with the growing interest, probably due to the unique complexities and challenges of financial markets. This paper aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the limitations of generative models, particularly in portfolio and risk management. To this end, we begin by presenting theoretical results on the importance of initial sample size, and point out the potential pitfalls of generating far more data than originally available. We then highlight the inseparable nature of model development and the desired use case by touching on a paradox: generic generative models inherently care less about what is important for constructing portfolios (in particular the long-short ones). Based on these findings, we propose a pipeline for the generation of multivariate returns that meets conventional evaluation standards on a large universe of US equities while being compliant with stylized facts observed in asset returns and turning around the pitfalls we previously identified. Moreover, we insist on the need for more delicate evaluation methods, and suggest, through an example of mean-reversion strategies, a method designed to identify poor models for a given application based on regurgitative training, i.e. retraining the model using the data it has itself generated, which is commonly referred to in statistics as identifiability.</description>
