      <title>Two Optimizations on the St\aa lmarck Procedure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce StalmarckSAT, the a modern re-implementation of the St\aa lmarck Procedure for SAT solving, and present two novel strategies to improve the Procedure, Cardinality Driven Branching (CDB) and Deductive Priority Ordering (DPO). CDB is a heuristic to improve branching with the dilemma rule, and DPO intelligently orders simple rules based on their deductive potential. Our results demonstrate improved solve times with both strategies.</description>

      <title>Beyond Monads and Biproducts: A Uniform Interpretation of Parallelism in Intuitionistic Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16102v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional approaches to modelling parallelism and algebraic structure in lambda calculi often rely on monads$\unicode{x2013}$as in Moggi's framework$\unicode{x2013}$or on rich categorical structures such as biproducts$\unicode{x2013}$as used in certain models of linear logic. In this work, we propose a minimal alternative that captures both parallelism and weighted parallelism (linear combinations) within the setting of intuitionistic propositional logic, without resorting to monads or assuming the existence of biproducts.
  We introduce two lambda calculi: a parallel lambda calculus and an algebraic lambda calculus, both extending full propositional intuitionistic logic. Their semantics are given in two categories: ${\mathbf{Mag}_{\mathbf{Set}}}$, whose objects are magmas and arrows are functions in $\mathbf{Set}$; and ${\mathbf{AMag}^{\mathcal{S}}_{\mathbf{Set}}}$, whose objects are action magmas.
  The key technical challenge addressed is the interpretation of disjunction in the presence of parallel and algebraic operators. Since the usual coproduct structure is unavailable in our minimal setting, we propose a novel set-theoretic interpretation based on the union of the disjoint union and the Cartesian product. This allows for the construction of sound and adequate models for both calculi.
  Our results offer a unified and structurally lightweight framework for modelling parallelism and algebraic effects in intuitionistic logic, opening the way to alternatives beyond the traditional monadic or linear logic approaches.</description>

      <title>FLARE: Faithful Logic-Aided Reasoning and Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11900v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern Question Answering (QA) and Reasoning approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) commonly use prompting techniques, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), assuming the resulting generation will have a more granular exploration and reasoning over the question space and scope. However, such methods struggle with generating outputs that are faithful to the intermediate chain of reasoning produced by the model. On the other end of the spectrum, neuro-symbolic methods such as Faithful CoT (F-CoT) propose to combine LLMs with external symbolic solvers. While such approaches boast a high degree of faithfulness, they usually require a model trained for code generation and struggle with tasks that are ambiguous or hard to formalise strictly. We introduce $\textbf{F}$aithful $\textbf{L}$ogic-$\textbf{A}$ided $\textbf{R}$easoning and $\textbf{E}$xploration ($\textbf{FLARE}$), a novel interpretable approach for traversing the problem space using task decompositions. We use the LLM to plan a solution, soft-formalise the query into facts and predicates using a logic programming code and simulate that code execution using an exhaustive multi-hop search over the defined space. Our method allows us to compute the faithfulness of the reasoning process w.r.t. the generated code and analyse the steps of the multi-hop search without relying on external solvers. Our methods achieve SOTA results on $\mathbf{7}$ out of $\mathbf{9}$ diverse reasoning benchmarks. We also show that model faithfulness positively correlates with overall performance and further demonstrate that $\textbf{FLARE}$ allows pinpointing the decisive factors sufficient for and leading to the correct answer with optimal reasoning during the multi-hop search.</description>

      <title>FSLI: An Interpretable Formal Semantic System for One-Dimensional Ordering Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a system for solving logical deduction one-dimensional ordering problems by transforming natural language premises and candidate statements into first-order logic. Building on Heim and Kratzer's syntax-based compositional semantic rules which utilizes lambda calculus, we develop a semantic parsing algorithm with abstract types, templated rules, and a dynamic component for interpreting entities within a context constructed from the input. The resulting logical forms are executed via constraint logic programming to determine which candidate statements can be logically deduced from the premises.
  The symbolic system, the Formal Semantic Logic Inferer (FSLI), provides a formally grounded, linguistically driven system for natural language logical deduction. We evaluate it on both synthetic and derived logical deduction problems. FSLI achieves 100% accuracy on BIG-bench's logical deduction task and 88% on a syntactically simplified subset of AR-LSAT outperforming an LLM baseline, o1-preview.
  While current research in natural language reasoning emphasizes neural language models, FSLI highlights the potential of principled, interpretable systems for symbolic logical deduction in NLP.</description>

      <title>Learning Verified Monitors for Hidden Markov Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05963v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Runtime monitors assess whether a system is in an unsafe state based on a stream of observations. We study the problem where the system is subject to probabilistic uncertainty and described by a hidden Markov model. A stream of observations is then unsafe if the probability of being in an unsafe state is above a threshold. A correct monitor recognizes the set of unsafe observations. The key contribution of this paper is the first correct-by-construction synthesis method for such monitors, represented as finite automata. The contribution combines four ingredients: First, we establish the coNP-hardness of checking whether an automaton is a correct monitor, i.e., a monitor without misclassifications. Second, we provide a reduction that reformulates the search for misclassifications into a standard probabilistic system synthesis problem. Third, we integrate the verification routine into an active automata learning routine to synthesize correct monitors. Fourth, we provide a prototypical implementation that shows the feasibility and limitations of the approach on a series of benchmarks.</description>

      <title>k-Planar and Fan-Crossing Drawings and Transductions of Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a two-way connection between FO transductions (first-order logical transformations) of planar graphs, and a certain variant of fan-crossing (fan-planar) drawings of graphs which for bounded-degree graphs essentially reduces to being k-planar for fixed k. For graph classes, this connection allows to derive non-transducibility results from nonexistence of the said drawings and, conversely, from nonexistence of a transduction to derive nonexistence of the said drawings. For example, the class of 3D-grids is not k-planar for any fixed k. We hope that this connection will help to draw a path to a possible proof that not all toroidal graphs are transducible from planar graphs.
  Our characterization can be extended to any fixed surface instead of the plane. The result is based on a very recent characterization of weakly sparse FO transductions of classes of bounded expansion by [Gajarsk\'y, G{\l}adkowski, Jedelsk\'y, Pilipczuk and Toru\'nczyk, arXiv:2505.15655].</description>

      <title>Transition-based vs stated-based acceptance for automata over infinite words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automata over infinite objects are a well-established model with applications in logic and formal verification. Traditionally, acceptance in such automata is defined based on the set of states visited infinitely often during a run. However, there is a growing trend towards defining acceptance based on transitions rather than states.
  In this survey, we analyse the reasons for this shift and advocate using transition-based acceptance in the context of automata over infinite words. We present a collection of problems where the choice of formalism has a major impact and discuss the causes of these differences.</description>
