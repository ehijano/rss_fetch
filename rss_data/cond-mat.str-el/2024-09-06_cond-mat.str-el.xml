      <title>The landscape of symmetry enhancement in tight-binding models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Band structures are ubiquitous in condensed matter physics and their symmetries constrain possible degeneracies, topology and response functions across a broad range of different systems. Here we address the question: given a parent crystal, what is the symmetry of hopping models on that lattice at a given shell number? We find that the parent structure does not, in general, determine the symmetry of the tight-binding model. Instead, the symmetry is dependent on the hopping range. The key to symmetry breakdown on the lattice is the existence of different {\it bond equivalence classes} whose number is related to group-subgroup indices for a broad classes of cases. We find all bond equivalence classes for $s$-wave hopping out to 20th neighbor across the different space groups and Wyckoff positions and the symmetries of the associated tight-binding models. These observations naturally lead to the definition of a {\it bond complex} $-$ the possible classes of networks of bonds to which symmetries may be enhanced from a given parent structure.</description>

      <title>Entanglement content of kink excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum one-dimensional systems in their ordered phase admit kinks as elementary excitations above their symmetry-broken vacua. While the scattering properties of the kinks resemble those of quasiparticles, they have distinct locality features that are manifest in their entanglement content. In this work, we study the entanglement entropy of kink excitations. We first present detailed calculations for specific states of a spin-1/2 chain to highlight the salient features of these excitations. Second, we provide a field-theoretic framework based on the algebraic relations between the twist fields and the semilocal fields associated with the excitations, and we compute the R\'enyi entropies in this framework. We obtain universal predictions for the entropy difference between the excited states with a finite number of kinks and the symmetry-broken ground states, which do not depend on the microscopic details of the model in the limit of large regions. Finally, we discuss some consequences of the Kramers-Wannier duality, which relates the ordered and disordered phases of the Ising model, and we explain why, counterintuitively, no explicit relations between those phases are found at the level of entanglement.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Charge Density Wave and Magnetism on the Kagom\'e Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of charge density wave (CDW) order in the magnetic kagom\'e metal FeGe, we study the single-orbital $t$-$U$-$V_1$-$V_2$ model on the kagom\'e lattice, where $U$, $V_1$, and $V_2$ are the onsite, nearest neighbor, and next-nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsions, respectively. When the Fermi level lies in the flat band, the instability toward ferromagnetic (FM) order gives rise to a FM half-metal at sufficiently large onsite $U$. Intriguingly, at band filling $n=17/24$, the Fermi level crosses the van Hove singularity of the spin-minority bands of the half-metal. We show that, due to the unique geometry and sublattice interference on the kagom\'e lattice at van Hove singularity, the intersite Coulomb interactions $V_1$ and $V_2$ drive a real and an imaginary bond-ordered $2a_0 \times 2a_0$ CDW instability, respectively. The FM loop current CDW with complex bond orders is a spin-polarized Chern insulator exhibiting the quantum anomalous Hall effect. The bond fluctuations are found to be substantially enhanced compared to the corresponding nonmagnetic kagom\'e metals at van Hove filling, providing a concrete model realization of the bond-ordered CDWs, including the FM loop current CDW, over the onsite charge density ordered states. When the spins are partially polarized, we find that the formation of bond-ordered CDWs enhances substantially the ordered magnetic moments. These findings provide physical insights for the emergence of loop-current and bond-ordered CDW and their interplay with magnetism on the kagom\'e lattice, with possible connections to the magnetic kagom\'e metal FeGe.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Resonant Scattering from uranium systems at the U M4 edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have conducted a series of scattering experiments at the uranium M4 absorption edge on low-symmetry uranium compounds (U2N3 and U3O8) produced as epitaxial films. At weak and forbidden reflections, we find a resonant signal, independent of temperature, with an energy dependence resembling the imaginary part of the scattering factor. Theory, using the FDMNES code, shows that these results can be reliably reproduced assuming that they originate from aspherical 5f electron charge distributions around the U nucleus. Such effects arise from the intrinsic anisotropy of the 5f shell and from the mixing of the 5f electrons of uranium with the outer 2p electrons of the anions. The good agreement between theory and experiment includes azimuthal scattering dependencies, as well as polarization states of the scattered photons. The methodology reported here opens the way for a deeper understanding of the role of the 5f electrons in the bonding in actinide compounds.</description>

      <title>Crystal-field magnetostriction of the spin ice under ultrahigh magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the magnetoelastic properties of the Ising pyrochlore oxide HoTi$_{2}$O$_{7}$, known as spin ice, by means of high-field magnetostriction measurements and numerical calculations. When a magnetic field is applied along the crystallographic &lt;111&gt; axis, the longitudinal magnetostriction exhibits a broad maximum in the low-field regime around 30 T, followed by a dramatic lattice contraction due to crystal-field (CF) level crossing at $B_{\rm cf} \sim 65$ T. The transverse magnetostriction exhibits a contrasting behavior, highlighting the anisotropic nature of the CF striction. We identify distinct timescales of spin dynamics and CF-phonon dynamics by applying a magnetic field with different field-sweep rates. Our mean-field calculations, based on a point-charge model, successfully reproduce the overall magnetostriction behavior, revealing the competition between the exchange striction and CF striction. A signature of the CF level crossing is also observed through adiabatic magnetocaloric-effect measurements, consistent with our magnetostriction data.</description>

      <title>Infrared spectroscopy study of kagome material CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kagome material CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$, which is isostructural to the extensively studied charge density wave (CDW) compound CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, exhibits intriguing electronic features within its two-dimensional kagome lattices of titanium atoms. Here, we perform optical spectroscopic measurements together with the first-principles calculations on single-crystalline CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ to investigate its electronic properties comprehensively. It is found that the overall optical spectra are very similar to those of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, but the existence of CDW instability is ruled out in CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$. Via careful comparison to the optical responses of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, we attribute this difference to a significant reduction in the itinerant carrier density of CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$, which is associated with the absence of van Hove singularity near the Fermi level at $M$ point. This result supports the scenario that the CDW in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ is driven by the nesting of van Hove singularity. Additionally, we unveil some exotic low-lying absorption features, which provide clear evidence of flat bands in CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of exotic phenomena in CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ and provide valuable insights into the role of van Hove singularity in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuits based on topological pumping in optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gate operations composed in quantum circuits form the basis of digital quantum simulation and quantum processing. While two-qubit gates generally operate between nearest neighbours, many circuits require non-local connectivity, necessitating some form of quantum information transport, such as the repeated application of SWAP gates or qubit shuttling. Preserving motional coherence during such transport remains a key challenge to improve gate fidelity and qubit connectivity, as well as to connect local fermionic modes. Here we combine tuneable gate operations between fermionic potassium-40 atoms - based on superexchange interaction - with their bidirectional transport via topological Thouless pumping in an optical lattice. We demonstrate shuttling of atomic singlet pairs with a single-shift fidelity of 99.57(4)% over 50 lattice sites. We spatially and coherently split a large number of randomly distributed fermionic spin singlet pairs and show $($SWAP$)^\alpha$-gate operations between atoms encountering each other during transport. As a signature of entanglement between fermions separated over large distances and interwoven with each other, we observe multi-frequency singlet-triplet oscillations. Topological pumping is generally applicable to long-lived atomic and molecular states, and specifically overcomes lifetime limitations inherent to transport using state-dependent optical lattices. Our work opens up new avenues for transport of quantum information and offers unprecedented possibilities for engineering connectivity in quantum circuits, including approaches based on fermionic modes, as well as for atom interferometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trapped ions offer long coherence times and high fidelity, programmable quantum operations, making them a promising platform for quantum simulation of condensed matter systems, quantum dynamics, and problems related to high-energy physics. We review selected developments in trapped-ion qubits and architectures and discuss quantum simulation applications that utilize these emerging capabilities. This review emphasizes developments in digital (gate-based) quantum simulations that exploit trapped-ion hardware capabilities, such as flexible qubit connectivity, selective mid-circuit measurement, and classical feedback, to simulate models with long-range interactions, explore non-unitary dynamics, compress simulations of states with limited entanglement, and reduce the circuit depths required to prepare or simulate long-range entangled states.</description>

      <title>Ephemeral Superconductivity Atop the False Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A many body system in the vicinity of a first-order phase transition may get trapped in a local minimum of the free energy landscape. These so-called false-vacuum states may survive for exceedingly long times if the barrier for their decay is high enough. The rich phase diagram obtained in graphene multilayer devices presents a unique opportunity to explore transient superconductivity on top of a correlated false vacuum. Specifically, we consider superconductors which are terminated by an apparent first-order phase transition to a correlated phase with different symmetry. We propose that quenching across this transition leads to a non-equilibrium ephemeral superconductor, readily detectable using straightforward transport measurements. Besides enabling a simple detection scheme, the transient superconductor also generically enhances the false vacuum lifetime, potentially by orders of magnitude. In several scenarios, the complimentary effect takes place as well: superconductivity is temporarily emboldened in the false vacuum, albeit ultimately decaying. We demonstrate the applicability of these claims for two different instances of superconductivity terminated by a first order transition in rhombohedral graphene. The obtained decay timescales position this class of materials as a promising playground to unambiguously realize and measure non-equilibrium superconductivity.</description>

      <title>An effective framework for strange metallic transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semi-holography, originally proposed as a model for conducting lattice electrons coupled to a holographic critical sector, leads to an effective theory of non-Fermi liquids with only a few relevant interactions on the Fermi surface in the large $N$ limit. A refined version of such theories has only two effective couplings which give holographic and Fermi-liquid-like contributions to the self-energy, respectively. We show that a low co-dimension sub-manifold exists in the space of refined semi-holographic theories in which strange metallic behavior is manifested, and which can be obtained just by tuning the ratio of the two couplings. On this sub-manifold, the product of the spectral function and the temperature is approximately independent of the critical exponent, the Fermi energy, and the temperature at all frequencies and near the Fermi surface when expressed in terms of suitably scaled momentum and frequency variables. This quasi-universal behavior leads to linear-in-$T$ dc resistivity and Planckian dissipation over a large range of temperatures, and we also obtain $T^{-3}$ scaling of the Hall conductivity at higher temperatures. The quasi-universal spectral function also fits well with photoemission spectroscopic data without varying the critical exponent with the doping. Combining with the results for optical conductivity, we construct a generalized version of Drude phenomenology for strange-metallic behavior which satisfies non-trivial consistency tests. Finally, we discuss a possible dynamical mechanism for the fine-tuning of the ratio of the two couplings necessary to realize the strange metallic behavior in a typical state.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Enhanced Fractional Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly interacting electrons in a topologically non trivial band may form exotic phases of matter. An especially intriguing example of which is the fractional quantum anomalous Hall phase, recently discovered in twisted transition metal dichalcogenides and in moir\'e graphene multilayers. However, it has been shown to be destabilized in certain filling factors at sub-100 mK temperatures in pentalayer graphene, in favor of a novel integer quantum anomalous Hall phase [Z. Lu et al., arXiv:2408.10203 ]. We propose that the culprit stabilizing the fractional phase at higher temperatures is its rich edge state structure. Possessing a multiplicity of chiral modes on its edge, the fractional phase has lower free energy at higher temperatures due to the excess edge modes entropy. We make distinct predictions under this scenario, including the system-size dependency of the fractional phase entropic enhancement, and how the phase boundaries change as a function of temperature.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Spin Stripe Domains in Bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure has motivated the investigation of a parent spin density wave (SDW) state which could provide the underlying pairing interaction. Here, we employ resonant soft x-ray scattering and polarimetry on thin films of bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ to determine that the magnetic structure of the SDW forms unidirectional diagonal spin stripes with moments lying within the NiO$_2$ plane and perpendicular to $\mathbf{Q}_{SDW}$, but without the strong charge disproportionation typically associated with other nickelates. These stripes form anisotropic domains with shorter correlation lengths perpendicular versus parallel to $\mathbf{Q}_{SDW}$, revealing nanoscale rotational and translational symmetry breaking analogous to the cuprate and Fe-based superconductors, with Bloch-like antiferromagnetic domain walls separating orthogonal domains.</description>

      <title>Recent advances in understanding and manipulating magnetic and electronic properties of Eu$M_2X_2$ ($M$ = Zn, Cd; $X$ = P, As)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past five years, significant progress has been made in understanding the magnetism and electronic properties of CaAl$_2$Si$_2$-type Eu$M_2X_2$ ($M$ = Zn, Cd; $X$ = P, As) compounds. Prior theoretical work and experimental studies suggested that EuCd$_2$As$_2$ had the potential to host rich topological phases, particularly an ideal magnetic Weyl semimetal state when the spins are polarized along the c axis. However, this perspective is challenged by recent experiments utilizing samples featuring ultra-low carrier densities, as well as meticulous calculations employing various approaches. Nonetheless, the Eu$M_2X_2$ family still exhibit numerous novel properties that remain to be satisfactorily explained, such as the giant nonlinear anomalous Hall effect and the colossal magnetoresistance effect. Moreover, Eu$M_2X_2$ compounds can be transformed from semiconducting antiferromagnets to metallic ferromagnets by introducing a small number of carriers or applying external pressure, and a further increase in the ferromagnetic transition temperature can be achieved by reducing the unit cell volume. These features make the Eu$M_2X_2$ family a fertile platform for studying the interplay between magnetism and charge transport, and an excellent candidate for applications in spintronics. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the magnetic and transport behaviors of Eu$M_2X_2$ compounds with varying carrier densities, as well as the current insights into these characteristics. An outlook for future research opportunities is also provided.</description>

Abstract: Quantum complexity has emerged as a central concept in diverse areas of physics, ranging from quantum computing to the theory of black holes. We perform a systematic study of complexity in random quantum circuits with and without measurements. We observe that complexity grows linearly before saturating to a constant value. For $N$ qubits without measurements, the saturation value scales as $2^{N-1}$, and the saturation time scales as $2^N$. This behaviour remains identical in the presence of random measurements with different probabilities, indicating that this notion of complexity is insensitive to the rate of measurement. We also study the behaviour of complexity in two variants of the random unitary floquet circuit, where we observe that complexity acts as a novel probe of Anderson localization and many-body localization.</description>

      <title>Quantum reservoir computing on random regular graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) is a low-complexity learning paradigm that combines the inherent dynamics of input-driven many-body quantum systems with classical learning techniques for nonlinear temporal data processing. Optimizing the QRC process and computing device is a complex task due to the dependence of many-body quantum systems to various factors. To explore this, we introduce a strongly interacting spin model on random regular graphs as the quantum component and investigate the interplay between static disorder, interactions, and graph connectivity, revealing their critical impact on quantum memory capacity and learnability accuracy. We tackle linear quantum and nonlinear classical tasks, and identify optimal learning and memory regimes through studying information localization, dynamical quantum correlations, and the many-body structure of the disordered Hamiltonian. In particular, we uncover the role of previously overlooked network connectivity and demonstrate how the presence of quantum correlations can significantly enhance the learning performance. Our findings thus provide guidelines for the optimal design of disordered analog quantum learning platforms.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Terahertz Probes of Quantum Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multidimensional spectroscopy has a long history originating from nuclear magnetic resonance, and has now found widespread application at infrared and optical frequencies as well. However, the energy scales of traditional multidimensional probes have been ill-suited for studying quantum materials. Recent technological advancements have now enabled extension of these multidimensional techniques to the terahertz frequency range, in which collective excitations of quantum materials are typically found. This Perspective introduces the technique of two-dimensional terahertz spectroscopy (2DTS) and the unique physics of quantum materials revealed by 2DTS spectra, accompanied by a selection of the rapidly expanding experimental and theoretical literature. While 2DTS has so far been primarily applied to quantum materials at equilibrium, we provide an outlook for its application towards understanding their dynamical non-equilibrium states and beyond.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Oscillator-Qubit Quantum Processors: Simulating Fermions, Bosons, and Gauge Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a hybrid oscillator-qubit processor framework for quantum simulation of strongly correlated fermions and bosons that avoids the boson-to-qubit mapping overhead encountered in qubit hardware. This framework gives exact decompositions of particle interactions such as density-density terms and gauge-invariant hopping, as well as approximate methods based on the Baker-Campbell Hausdorff formulas including the magnetic field term for the $U(1)$ quantum link model in $(2+1)$D. We use this framework to show how to simulate dynamics using Trotterisation, perform ancilla-free partial error detection using Gauss's law, measure non-local observables, estimate ground state energies using a oscillator-qubit variational quantum eigensolver as well as quantum signal processing, and we numerically study the influence of hardware errors in circuit QED experiments. To show the advantages over all-qubit hardware, we perform an end-to-end comparison of the gate complexity for the gauge-invariant hopping term and find an improvement of the asymptotic scaling with the boson number cutoff $S$ from $\mathcal{O}(\log(S)^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$ in our framework as well as, for bosonic matter, a constant factor improvement of better than $10^4$. We also find an improvement from $\mathcal{O}(\log(S))$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$ for the $U(1)$ magnetic field term. While our work focusses on an implementation in superconducting hardware, our framework can also be used in trapped ion, and neutral atom hardware. This work establishes digital quantum simulation with hybrid oscillator-qubit hardware as a viable and advantageous method for the study of qubit-boson models in materials science, chemistry, and high-energy physics.</description>

Abstract: Rydberg atom arrays have emerged as a powerful platform to simulate a number of exotic quantum ground states and phase transitions. To verify these capabilities numerically, we develop a versatile quantum Monte Carlo sampling technique which operates in the reduced Hilbert space generated by enforcing the constraint of a Rydberg blockade. We use the framework of stochastic series expansion and show that in the restricted space, the configuration space of operator strings can be understood as a hard rod gas in $d+1$ dimensions. We use this mapping to develop cluster algorithms which can be visualized as various non-local movements of rods. We study the efficiency of each of our updates individually and collectively. To elucidate the utility of the algorithm, we show that it can efficiently generate the phase diagram of a Rydberg atom array, to temperatures much smaller than all energy scales involved, on a Kagom\'e link lattice. This is of broad interest as the presence of a $Z_2$ spin liquid has been hypothesized recently.</description>

      <title>Magnetic correlations of a doped and frustrated Hubbard model: benchmarking the two-particle self-consistent theory against a quantum simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently a quantum simulator for the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model on an anisotropic triangular lattice has been realized, where both geometrical frustration and doping can be continuously tuned. Here we provide a comprehensive comparison between the magnetic correlations calculated by the two-particle self-consistent (TPSC) theory and those measured in this quantum simulator, at temperatures comparable to the spin exchange energy and Hubbard interactions comparable to the bandwidth. We find overall excellent agreements between the TPSC calculations and the measurements from the quantum simulator at all levels of frustration and doping. This is quite remarkable considering that the Hubbard model is already in the intermediate to strong coupling regime, for which very few methods yield reliable results. Our work showcases the potential of TPSC as a theoretical approach capable of providing reasonably accurate descriptions of the Hubbard model even at fairly strong interactions and when the frustration is present.</description>

      <title>The nature of low-temperature spin-freezing in frustrated Kitaev magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The subtle interplay between competing degrees of freedom, anisotropy, and spin correlations in frustrated Kitaev quantum materials offers an ideal platform to host non-trivial quantum states with exotic fractional excitations. The signature of spin-freezing behavior of these spin-orbit-driven frustrated magnets is characterized by a bifurcation of zero-field-cooled and field-cooled magnetic susceptibility at low temperatures much below the characteristic interaction energy scale of spins. The temperature dependence of magnetic specific heat exhibits Cm~ T^2 dependence near the freezing temperature. The field-independent behavior of Cm below the freezing temperature implies the presence of exotic low-energy excitations. The aging and memory effect experiments in the Kitaev magnets suggest a non-hierarchical free energy distribution, which differs from the hierarchical organization of conventional spin-freezing. Furthermore, the NMR spin-lattice relaxation rate follows a power law behavior below the spin-freezing temperature, suggesting the persistence of unconventional spin excitation spectra. Herein, we demonstrate that the observed low-temperature spin-freezing phenomena in a few representative Kitaev quantum materials can be effectively explained by the Halperin and Saslow (HS) hydrodynamic modes relevant for non-trivial spin glass materials. The linearly dispersive HS modes are hypothesized to account for instigating non-abelian defect propagation, thereby inducing a spin jam state in the low-temperature regime in frustrated Kitaev magnets. Our investigation reveals that HS modes capture the essence of unconventional spin-freezing ascribed to topological origin in two-dimensional (2D) Kitaev magnets decorated on a honeycomb lattice and its 3D analog hyperhoneycomb that offers a viable ground to extend this framework to a large class of frustrated quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Charge Collective Modes in Correlated Electron Systems: Plasmons Beyond the Random Phase Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06541v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elucidating the impact of strong electronic interactions on the collective excitations of metallic systems has been of longstanding interest, mainly due to the inadequacy of the random phase approximation (RPA) in the strongly correlated regime. Here, we adopt our newly developed radial Kotliar and Ruckenstein slave boson representation to analyze the charge excitation spectrum of a Hubbard model, extended with long range interactions. Working on the face centered cubic lattice, at half filling, and in different coupling regimes ranging from uncorrelated to the metal-to-insulator transition, we compare our results to conventional RPA as a benchmark. We focus on the influence of the local and long range couplings on the particle-hole excitation continuum and the plasmon and upper Hubbard band collective modes. Beyond the weak coupling regime, we find numerous quantitative and even qualitative discrepancies between our method and standard RPA. Our work thus deepens the understanding of charge collective modes in correlated systems, and lays the foundations for future studies of a broad series of materials.</description>

      <title>Spin and charge dynamics of doped one-dimensional Mott insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) for a newly discovered doped one-dimensional (1D) Mott insulator Ba$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_{3+\delta}$ proposed the presence of attractive charge interactions between neighboring sites if an 1D Hubbard model is employed to describe the material. On the other hand, long-range repulsive charge interactions were proposed to be crucial for understanding optical excitations of undoped 1D Mott insulators. Motivated by these contrasting proposals, we perform density-matrix renormalization group calculations of the single-particle spectral function as well as dynamical spin and charge structure factors for two kinds of extended 1D Hubbard models. The spectral function for the long-range repulsive model less agrees with the ARPES data as compared with that for the attractive one. The dynamical spin and charge structure factors also exhibit contrasting behaviors between the two models: the attractive model shows less momentum dependence of the integrated weight in the dynamical spin structure factor and more accumulation of the weight on the upper edge of particle-hole-type excitation in the dynamical charge structure factor. These features give a good criterion of an appropriate model for doped 1D Mott insulators, which can be judged by resonant-inelastic x-ray scattering experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06698v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a large class of classical field theories with continuous translation symmetry. In the quantum theory, a new anomaly explicitly breaks this translation symmetry to a discrete symmetry. Furthermore, this discrete translation symmetry is extended by a $d-2$-form global symmetry. All these theories can be described as $U(1)$ gauge theories where Gauss law states that the system has nonzero charge density. Special cases of such systems can be phrased as theories with a compact phase space. Examples are ferromagnets and lattices in the lowest Landau level. In some cases, the broken continuous translation symmetry can be resurrected as a noninvertible symmetry. We clarify the relation between the discrete translation symmetry of the continuum theory and the discrete translation symmetry of an underlying lattice model. Our treatment unifies, clarifies, and extends earlier works on the same subject.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of a spin-1/2 Heisenberg ladder with a chirality-chirality interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A spin-1/2 Heisenberg model with a chirality-chirality interaction (CCI) on a two-leg ladder offers a minimal setup to study an interplay between spin and chirality degrees of freedom. This model is potentially relevant to understanding the effects of a four-spin ring exchange and a phonon-mediated interaction on a ladder. By applying the Abelian bosonization and two types of spin-chirality duality, we derive a rich phase diagram of this model that includes previously unexplored cases of a ferromagnetic rung exchange $J_\perp&lt;0$ or a negative CCI $K_{\rm ch}&lt;0$. The phase diagram consists of the rung singlet (RS) phase, the Haldane phase, and three non-magnetic ordered phases. Furthermore, the RS and Haldane phases consist of several regions with different dominant correlations in terms of spin, dimer, or chirality. We perform numerical simulations to confirm the predicted phase structure and critical properties.</description>

      <title>Kondo-Heisenberg toy models: Comparison of exact results and spin wave expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study a class of exactly solvable Kondo-Heisenberg toy models in one dimension, with the goal of comparing the exact low-energy excitations of the ferromagnetic ground state to the approximate solution obtained from spin wave theory. In doing so we employ a recently introduced strong coupling $1/S$ spin wave expansion, which effectively describes excitations of the total spin $S\pm 1/2$ on a given site (i.e., sum of local moment and electron spin). We further make use of the fact that the ground state of Kondo lattice models with quantum spins and a single electron is a ferromagnet, and that the magnetic excitations of the ferromagnet can be exactly determined. We demonstrate that the energies and eigenstates of the spin waves are in full agreement with the exact solution order-by-order in $1/S$ and $t/J_K$, the strong coupling expansion parameter. In the specific case of antiferromagnetic Kondo coupling, when the exact ground state wave function describes spin polaron, we show that the electron operators of the spin wave formalism precisely correspond to the spin polaron states. More broadly, the study of Kondo-Heisenberg toy models is shown to provide insight into the fundamental distinction between itinerant Kondo magnets and Heisenberg magnets.</description>

      <title>Signatures of polarized chiral spin disproportionation in rare earth nickelates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In rare earth nickelates (RENiO$_3$), electron-lattice coupling drives a concurrent metal-to-insulator and bond disproportionation phase transition whose microscopic origin has long been the subject of active debate. Of several proposed mechanisms, here we test the hypothesis that pairs of self-doped ligand holes spatially condense to provide local spin moments that are antiferromagnetically coupled to Ni spins. These singlet-like states provide a basis for long-range bond and spiral spin order. Using magnetic resonant X-ray scattering on NdNiO$_3$ thin films, we observe the chiral nature of the spin-disproportionated state, with spin spirals propagating along the crystallographic (101)$_\mathrm{ortho}$ direction. These spin spirals are found to preferentially couple to X-ray helicity, establishing the presence of a hitherto-unobserved macroscopic chirality. The presence of this chiral magnetic configuration suggests a potential multiferroic coupling between the noncollinear magnetic arrangement and improper ferroelectric behavior as observed in prior studies on NdNiO$_3$ (101)$_\mathrm{ortho}$ films and RENiO$_3$ single crystals. Experimentally constrained theoretical double-cluster calculations confirm the presence of an energetically stable spin-disproportionated state with Zhang-Rice singlet-like combinations of Ni and ligand moments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Typical dualities in arbitrary dimensions are understood through a Hilbert-space extension method. By these results, we rigorously dualize the quantum ingappabilities to discrete height model in one dimension which is inaccessible by earlier work such as flux-insertion arguments. It turns out that the ingappabilities of quantum discrete height model is protected by an exotic "modulating" translation symmetry, which is a combination of modulating internal symmetry transformation and the conventional lattice translation. It can be also generalize to higher-form gauge fields in arbitrary dimensions, e.g., $\mathbb{Z}$-gauge theory in two dimensions with $\mathbb{Z}$ one-form symmetry and a modulating translation symmetry.</description>

      <title>Metastable Photo-Induced Superconductivity far above $T_{\textrm{c}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the striking discovery of metastable superconductivity in $\mathrm{K}_3\mathrm{C}_{60}$ at 100K, far above $T_{\textrm{c}}=20K$, we discuss possible mechanisms for long-lived, photo-induced superconductivity. Starting from a model of optically-driven Raman phonons coupled to inter-band electronic transitions, we develop a microscopic mechanism for photo-controlling the pairing interaction. Leveraging this mechanism, we first investigate long-lived superconductivity arising from the thermodynamic metastable trapping of the driven phonon. We then propose an alternative route, where the superconducting gap created by an optical drive leads to a dynamical bottleneck in the equilibration of quasi-particles. We conclude by discussing implications of both scenarios for experiments that can be used to discriminate between them. Our work provides falsifiable explanations for the nanosecond-scale photo-induced superconductivity found in $\mathrm{K}_3\mathrm{C}_{60}$, while simultaneously offering a theoretical basis for exploring metastable superconductivity in other quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hall and Light Responses in a 2D Topological Semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13922v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have recently identified a protected topological semimetal in graphene which presents a zero-energy edge mode robust to disorder and interactions. Here, we address the characteristics of this semimetal and show that the $\mathbb{Z}$ topological invariant of the Hall conductivity associated to the lowest energy band can be equivalently measured from the resonant response to circularly polarized light resolved at the Dirac points. The (non-quantized) conductivity responses of the intermediate energy bands, including the Fermi surface, also give rise to a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant. We emphasize on the bulk-edge correspondence as a protected topological half metal, i.e. one spin-population polarized in the plane is in the insulating phase related to the robust edge mode while the other is in the metallic regime. The quantized transport at the edges is equivalent to a $\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{2}$ conductance for spin polarizations along $z$ direction. We also build a parallel between the topological Hall response and a pair of half numbers (half Skyrmions) through the light response locally resolved in momentum space and on the sphere.</description>

      <title>Confinement and Kink Entanglement Asymmetry on a Quantum Ising Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08601v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the interplay of confinement, string breaking and entanglement asymmetry on a 1D quantum Ising chain. We consider the evolution of an initial domain wall and show that, surprisingly, while the introduction of confinement through a longitudinal field typically suppresses entanglement, it can also serve to increase it beyond a bound set for free particles. Our model can be tuned to conserve the number of domain walls, which gives an opportunity to explore entanglement asymmetry associated with link variables. We study two approaches to deal with the non-locality of the link variables, either directly or following a Kramers-Wannier transformation that maps bond variables (kinks) to site variables (spins). We develop a numerical procedure for computing the asymmetry using tensor network methods and use it to demonstrate the different types of entanglement and entanglement asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Controlling the dynamics of atomic correlations via the coupling to a dissipative cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the relaxation dynamics in an open system, composed by a quantum gas of bosons in a lattice interacting via both contact and global interactions. We report the onset of periodic oscillations of the atomic coherences exhibiting hallmarks of synchronization after a quantum quench. The dynamical behavior exhibits the many-body collapse and revival of atomic coherences and emerges from the interplay of the quantum dissipative nature of the cavity field and the presence of a (approximate) strong symmetry in the dissipative system. We further show that the approximate symmetry can dynamically self-organize. We argue that the approximate symmetry can be tailored to obtain long-lived coherences. These insights provide a general recipe to engineer the dynamics of globally-interacting systems.</description>

      <title>Topology and $\mathcal{PT}$ Symmetry in a Non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Chain with Periodic Hopping Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of periodic but commensurate hopping modulation on a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain with an additional onsite staggered imaginary potential. Such dissipative, non-Hermitian (NH) extension amply modifies the features of the topological trivial phase (TTP) and the topological nontrivial phase (TNP) of the SSH chain, more so with the periodic hopping distribution. Generally a weak potential can respect the parity-time (PT ) symmetry keeping the energy eigenvalues real, while a strong potential breaks PT conservation leading to imaginary end state and complex bulk state energies in the system. We find that this PT breaking with imaginary potential strength \gamma show interesting dependence on the hopping modulation \Delta for different hoping modulations. In-gap states, that appear also in the \gamma = 0 limit, take either purely real or purely imaginary eigenvalues depending on the strength of both \gamma and \Delta. The localization of end states (in-gap states) at the boundaries are investigated which show extended nature not only near topological transitions (further away from |\Delta/t| = 1) but also near the unmodulated limit of \Delta = 0. Moreover, localization of the bulk states is observed at the maximally dimerized limit of |\Delta/t| = 1, which also have a {\gamma} dependence. Analyzing further the dissipation caused by the complex eigenvalues in this problem with different hopping periodicity can be essential in modulating the gain-loss contrast in optical systems or in designing various quantum information processing and storage devices.</description>

      <title>Electric field-induced nonreciprocal directional dichroism in a time-reversal-odd antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Antiferromagnets with broken time-reversal (T) symmetry (T-odd antiferromagnets) have gained extensive attention, mainly due to their ferromagnet-like behavior despite the absence of net magnetization. However, certain types of T-odd antiferromagnets remain inaccessible by the typical ferromagnet-like phenomena (e.g., anomalous Hall effect). One such system is characterized by a T-odd scalar quantity, the magnetic toroidal monopole. To access the broken T symmetry in such a system, we employ a unique nonreciprocal optical phenomenon, electric field-induced nonreciprocal directional dichroism (E-induced NDD). We successfully detected signals of E-induced NDD in a T-odd antiferromagnet, Co2SiO4, whose magnetic structure is characterized by the magnetic toroidal monopole. Furthermore, by spatially resolving the E-induced NDD, we visualized spatial distributions of a pair of domain states related to one another by the T operation. The domain imaging revealed the inversion of the domain pattern by applying a magnetic field, which is explained by trilinear coupling attributed to the piezomagnetic effect. Our observation of E-induced NDD provides a unique approach to accessing the order parameter in T-odd antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Multichannel Dyson equation: derivation and analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent letter [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 216401] we presented the multichannel Dyson equation (MCDE) in which two or more many-body Green's functions are coupled. In this work we will give further details of the MCDE approach. In particular we will discuss: 1) the derivation of the MCDE and the definition of the space in which it is to be solved; 2) the rationale of the approximation to the multichannel self-energy; 3) a diagrammatic analysis of the MCDE; 4) the recasting of the MCDE on an eigenvalue problem with an effective Hamiltonian that can be solved using standard numerical techniques. This work mainly focuses on the coupling between the one-body Green's function and the three-body Green's function to describe photoemission spectra, but the MCDE method can be generalized to the coupling of other many-body Green's functions and to other spectroscopies.</description>

      <title>Adaptive variational quantum computing approaches for Green's functions and nonlinear susceptibilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present and benchmark quantum computing approaches for calculating real-time single-particle Green's functions and nonlinear susceptibilities of Hamiltonian systems. The approaches leverage adaptive variational quantum algorithms for state preparation and propagation. Using automatically generated compact circuits, the dynamical evolution is performed over sufficiently long times to achieve adequate frequency resolution of the response functions. We showcase accurate Green's function calculations using a statevector simulator on classical hardware for Fermi-Hubbard chains of 4 and 6 sites, with maximal ansatz circuit depths of 65 and 424 layers, respectively, and for the molecule LiH with a maximal ansatz circuit depth of 81 layers. Additionally, we consider an antiferromagnetic quantum spin-1 model that incorporates the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction to illustrate calculations of the third-order nonlinear susceptibilities, which can be measured in two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy experiments. These results demonstrate that real-time approaches using adaptive parameterized circuits to evaluate linear and nonlinear response functions can be feasible with near-term quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity Discovered in Niobium Polyhydride at High Pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05726v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Niobium polyhydride was synthesized at high pressure and high temperature conditions by using diamond anvil cell combined with in situ high pressure laser heating techniques. High pressure electric transport experiments demonstrate that superconducting transition occurs with critical temperature(Tc) 42 K at 187 GPa. The shift of Tc as function of external applied magnetic field is in consistent to the nature of superconductivity while the upper critical field at zero temperature Hc2(0) is estimated to~16.8 Tesla while the GL coherent length ~57 angstrom is estimated. The structure investigation using synchrotron radiation implies that the observed superconductivity may come from Fm-3m phase of NbH3.</description>
