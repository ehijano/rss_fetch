      <title>Market Reactions and Information Spillovers in Bank Mergers: A Multi-Method Analysis of the Japanese Banking Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Major bank mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) transform the financial market structure, but their valuation and spillover effects remain open to question. This study examines the market reaction to two M&amp;A events: the 2005 creation of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group following the Financial Big Bang in Japan, and the 2018 merger involving Resona Holdings after the global financial crisis. The multi-method analysis in this research combines several distinct methods to explore these M&amp;A events. An event study using the market model, the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), and the Fama-French three-factor model is implemented to estimate cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) for valuation purposes. Vector autoregression (VAR) models are used to test for Granger causality and map dynamic effects using impulse response functions (IRFs) to investigate spillovers. Propensity score matching (PSM) helps provide a causal estimate of the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT). The analysis detected a significant positive market reaction to the mergers. The findings also suggest the presence of prolonged positive spillovers to other banks, which may indicate a synergistic effect among Japanese banks. Combining these methods provides a unique perspective on M&amp;A events in the Japanese banking sector, offering valuable insights for investors, managers, and regulators concerned with market efficiency and systemic stability</description>

      <title>Dynamically optimal portfolios for monotone mean--variance preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monotone mean-variance (MMV) utility is the minimal modification of the classical Markowitz utility that respects rational ordering of investment opportunities. This paper provides, for the first time, a complete characterization of optimal dynamic portfolio choice for the MMV utility in asset price models with independent returns. The task is performed under minimal assumptions, weaker than the existence of an equivalent martingale measure and with no restrictions on the moments of asset returns. We interpret the maximal MMV utility in terms of the monotone Sharpe ratio (MSR) and show that the global squared MSR arises as the nominal yield from continuously compounding at the rate equal to the maximal local squared MSR. The paper gives simple necessary and sufficient conditions for mean-variance (MV) efficient portfolios to be MMV efficient. Several illustrative examples contrasting the MV and MMV criteria are provided.</description>

      <title>A 4% withdrawal rate for American retirement spending, derived from a discrete-time model of stochastic returns on assets and their sample moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What grounds the rule of thumb that a(n American) retiree can safely withdraw 4% of their initial retirement wealth in their first year of retirement, then increase that rate of consumption with inflation? I address that question with a discrete-time model of returns to a retirement portfolio consumed at a rate that grows by $s$ per period. The model's key parameter is $\gamma$, an $s$-adjusted rate of return to wealth, derived from the first 2-4 moments of the portfolio's probability distribution of returns; for a retirement lasting $t$ periods the model recommends a rate of consumption of $\gamma / (1 - (1 - \gamma)^t)$. Estimation of $\gamma$ (and hence of the implied rate of spending in retirement) reveals that the 4% rule emerges from adjusting high expected rates of return down for: consumption growth, the variance in (and kurtosis of) returns to wealth, the longevity risk of a retiree potentially underestimating $t$, and the inclusion of bonds in retirement portfolios without leverage. The model supports leverage of retirement portfolios dominated by the S&amp;P 500, with leverage ratios $&gt; 1.6$ having been historically optimal under the model's approximations. Historical simulations of 30-year retirements suggest that the model proposes withdrawal rates having roughly even odds of success, that leverage greatly improves those odds for stocks-heavy portfolios, and that investing on margin could have allowed safe withdrawal rates $&gt; 6$% per year.</description>
