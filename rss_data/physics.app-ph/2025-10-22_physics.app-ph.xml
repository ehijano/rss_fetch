      <title>Energy-based interpretation of the dispersion coefficient of the constant phase element</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dispersion coefficient of the constant phase element (CPE) is typically treated as an empirical fitting parameter in the analysis of impedance spectroscopy data, with no clear physical meaning. Here we seek to establish a energy-based interpretation for this coefficient by linking it to the ratio of the dissipated or stored energy in the CPE relative to that supplied by the input source. Using the $RC$ network equivalency of a CPE, we decompose the total input energy into a contribution stored in the capacitive modes and another dissipated in the resistive modes. Analytical expressions are derived for three test examples: (i) a constant voltage, (ii) a voltage ramp, and (iii) a quadratic input of the form $v(t)=\lambda t^2$. In all cases we found that the ratios of any two of these energy quantities reduce to pure functions of the dispersion coefficient of the CPE, independent of excitation amplitude or material parameters. This result provides a new perspective of the CPE's dispersion coefficient from a thermodynamic/energetic basis, with direct implications for supercapacitor characterization, battery modeling, as well as for the analysis of other electrochemical systems and devices exhibiting the CPE behavior.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Design Assistant for the Simulation of Inertial Fusion Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inertial fusion energy promises nearly unlimited, clean power if it can be achieved. However, the design and engineering of fusion systems requires controlling and manipulating matter at extreme energies and timescales; the shock physics and radiation transport governing the physical behavior under these conditions are complex requiring the development, calibration, and use of predictive multiphysics codes to navigate the highly nonlinear and multi-faceted design landscape. We hypothesize that artificial intelligence reasoning models can be combined with physics codes and emulators to autonomously design fusion fuel capsules. In this article, we construct a multi-agent system where natural language is utilized to explore the complex physics regimes around fusion energy. The agentic system is capable of executing a high-order multiphysics inertial fusion computational code. We demonstrate the capacity of the multi-agent design assistant to both collaboratively and autonomously manipulate, navigate, and optimize capsule geometry while accounting for high fidelity physics that ultimately achieve simulated ignition via inverse design.</description>

      <title>Impact of Switching Layer Architecture on Power Consumption in RRAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work demonstrates that porous helical WOx architectures enable a distinct low-power regime for planar ITO/WOx/ITO resistive random-access devices. While thin film and helical devices behave similarly at a 5 mA compliance, only helical devices sustain reproducible operation at 500 uA, where RESET voltages reduce by ~60%, switching currents decrease by 68-75%, and SET/RESET power drops by ~89% and ~83%. With helical devices operating at 500 uA, the memory window expands 400-600% due to selective suppression of high- resistive-state leakage, yielding both lower-power and improved read margin in a regime inaccessible to thin film devices. These results highlight geometry-driven field enhancement and confinement as practical design principles for low-power, high-margin resistive memories and point toward opportunities in transparent, flexible, and high-surface-area material systems.</description>

      <title>Robust interpretation of electrochemical impedance spectra using numerical complex analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) is a non-invasive technique widely used for understanding charge transfer and charge transport processes in electrochemical systems and devices. Standard approaches for the interpretation of EIS data involve starting with a hypothetical circuit model for the physical processes in the device based on experience/intuition, and then fitting the EIS data to this circuit model. This work explores a mathematical approach for extracting key characteristic features from EIS data by relying on fundamental principles of complex analysis. These characteristic features can ascertain the presence of inductors and constant phase elements (non-ideal capacitors) in circuit models and enable us to answer questions about the identifiability and uniqueness of equivalent circuit models. In certain scenarios such as models with only resistors and capacitors, we are able to enumerate all possible families of circuit models. Finally, we apply the mathematical framework presented here to real-world electrochemical systems and highlight results using impedance measurements from a lithium-ion battery coin cell.</description>

      <title>The origins of the leakage currents of p-n junction and Schottky diodes in all kinds of materials: A novel explanation based on impurity-photovoltaic-effect due to the self-absorption of the room-temperature infrared emission from materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A p-n junction is the basic building block for various semiconductor devices. A Schottky diode has characteristics that are essentially similar to those of the p-n junction diode. As is known, the leakage currents of p-n and Schottky junctions affect the overall performance of the devices and reduce the reliability of the devices. In order to achieve optimum device design, it is essential to fully understand the physical principle of the leakage currents. In traditional theory, defects provide a path for leakage current to travel. In this study, a novel theoretical model based on impurity-photovoltaic-effect is proposed to explain the leakage currents. It is well known that any object at a room-temperature emits infrared (IR) photons due to blackbody radiation. As is also well known, there is no absolutely pure material, and any material contains unavoidable defects associated with impurities. The self-absorption of the IR emission could be achieved through the sub-band-gap excitations due to defect-related intermediate levels in forbidden energy band-gap, creating carriers (electrons and holes). Some of the carriers diffuse into the built-in electric field of the junction. The built-in field then sweeps out electrons and holes in opposite directions, forming IR-generated photocurrent. Therefore, the leakage current is regarded as photocurrent. In addition to p-n junctions, some junctions exist in many semiconductor devices such as p-i-n diode and charge-coupled device (CCD), and these junctions also have built-in field due to contact potential difference. In fact, every semiconductor device contains at least one junction. The novel model is expected to explain the leakage for all kinds of junctions with semiconductor built-in fields.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Field Exposure Assessment and Mitigation Strategies for Wireless Power Transfer Systems: A Review and Future Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless power transfer (WPT) technologies are increasingly being applied in fields ranging from consumer electronics and electric vehicles to space-based energy systems and medical implants. While WPT offers contactless power delivery, it introduces electromagnetic field (EMF) emissions, necessitating careful assessment to address safety and public health concerns. Exposure guidelines developed by ICNIRP and IEEE define frequency-dependent limits based on internal quantities, such as electric field strength and specific absorption rate, intended to prevent tissue nerve stimulation &lt; 100 kHz and heating &gt; 100 kHz, respectively. Complementing these guidelines, assessment standards including the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)/IEEE 63184 and IEC Technical Report 63377, provide practical procedures for evaluating the EMF exposure in WPT systems. This review offers a comparative overview of major WPT modalities, with a focus on recent developments in computational dosimetry and standardized assessment techniques for the complex, non-uniform fields typical of WPT environments. It also discusses electromagnetic interference with medical devices and exposure scenarios involving partial body proximity and various postures. A notable observation across modalities is the considerable variability, often spanning an order of magnitude, in the allowable transfer power, depending on the field distribution and assessment approach. Remaining challenges include the lack of harmonized guidance for intermediate frequencies and localized exposure, underscoring the importance of further coordination in international standardization efforts. Addressing these issues is essential for the safe and widespread deployment of WPT technologies.</description>

      <title>A fiber integrated N-V diamond magnetometer compatible with commercial endoscopic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (N-V) center in diamond provides a robust, solid-state platform for magnetic field measurements at room temperature. To harness its potential in inspecting inaccessible regions, here we present a compact endoscopic configuration of an N-V diamond-based magnetometer. The endoscopic magnetometer was developed by integrating a large-core optical fiber with a bulk N-V diamond for laser excitation and photoluminescence (PL) collection. The diamond and fiber were specially shaped to enhance PL collection through the fiber. Additionally, a 3D-printed endoscope head was employed to facilitate alignment of the bias magnetic field along the N-V axis. A magnetic field sensitivity of approximately 3 nT/Hz$^{1/2}$ was achieved by using cw-magnetometry measurements. The endoscope diameter was restricted to 10 mm to match the dimensions of most commercial endoscopes. The magnetic field non-uniformity caused by the small separation between the diamond and the magnet in the endoscope head limited the overall sensitivity. It could be further improved to 0.85 nT/Hz$^{1/2}$ by using a magnet placed at a sufficient distance outside the endoscope head. Our endoscopic design is mechanically stable and provides additional opportunities for integrating other functionalities into the probe head as needed.</description>

      <title>Frequency multiplication in Terahertz band using AlGaN/GaN plasmonic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The plasma oscillations in high-mobility field-effect transistors (HEMTs) have emerged as a key physical mechanism for manipulating electromagnetic radiation in the sub-terahertz (sub-THz) and THz frequency ranges. These collective electron excitations can be excited and tuned electrically offering a compelling route to compact, integrable components for a wide range of next-generation technologies, including sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, high-resolution biomedical and chemical spectroscopy, industrial process monitoring, and advanced security and defense systems. For these applications, plasmonic crystals -- periodic arrays of many strongly coupled FET channels-- are particularly promising. In this work, we report on a new class of collective excitations in plasmonic crystals termed rotonic plasmons, which arise at plasmonic mode crossings and exhibit a parabolic dispersion law reminiscent of soft-mode and roton-like spectra. We show that uniform gate modulation across plasmonic crystal unit cells induces periodic variations in the sheet carrier concentration and, consequently, in the plasma frequency. This time-periodic modulation drives nonlinear plasmonic parametric resonances enabling RF-to-THz conversion. By solving the generalized Mathieu equation with damping, we demonstrate that high-amplitude gate pumping enables frequency multiplication and, at cryogenic temperatures (77K) leads to parametric instabilities due to enhanced electron mobility. In plasmonic crystals with lower mobility, RF-to-THz conversion can instead be realized via periodic short-pulse excitation, a regime we introduce as Time-Domain Frequency Multiplication (TDFM). Investigation of AlGaN/GaN low-high plasmonic crystals confirm their potential as tunable, compact THz sources.</description>

      <title>How Do Water Filled Traffic Barriers Shake a Suspension Bridge?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present study stems from the realization that the general problem relating to the analysis of wind-induced vibrations in suspension bridges still requires significant attention. Sidewalk railings, overhaul tracks, and deflectors are known to largely affect such dynamics. Here, the influence of a row of water-filled traffic barriers on the response of a sample suspension bridge is investigated numerically. It is shown that the existence of water barriers causes flow separation and non-negligible vortices with respect to the condition with no water barriers. The vortex shedding frequency at the far end is around 41.30 Hz, relatively close to the real vibration frequency. It is also shown how different incoming angles of attack can change the flow field around the bridge cross-section and the vortex detachment frequency.</description>

      <title>Applying voxel-based analysis to oropharyngeal cancer proton therapy patients: a correlation study on radiation-induced acute dysphagia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Voxel-based analysis (VBA) is an analytic approach to evaluate correlations between local dose and the development of different toxicities. DVHs are used for toxicity prediction as well. Compared with DVH, no contours are required for VBA technique and results tell specific voxels that may be related to the toxicity instead of the whole contoured area. The VBA has been used on different cancer sites and for different toxicities. Most of these studies included patients treated with photon, all published studies were based on planned dose and VBA tools used were developed in house. In our study, patient cohort were treated with proton, our VBA tool was developed based on RayStation and doses fed to the VBA tool were delivered doses with constant and two variable RBE models.</description>

      <title>Geometric Manifold Statistics of Turbulence-Impacted Beam Propagation and Compensation in Optical Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present study extends the analysis of turbulence-affected beam statistics through a manifold-based statistical framework that unifies probabilistic modeling with geometric interpretation. The spatial intensity distributions, distorted by dynamic turbulence, are represented using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), whose probability landscapes are refined via Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) applied to pixel-level intensity data across temporal frames. The temporal evolution of turbulence is quantified by monitoring the variation of the unnormalized volumetric integrals under the GMM surfaces, providing a continuous measure of power redistribution within the optical field. Experimental investigations were carried out under four propagation conditions: turbulence-free reference, turbulence only, turbulence with a single PMMA compensator, and turbulence with dual PMMA compensators. To assess statistical dissimilarity, Affine-Invariant Riemannian Metric (AIRM) distances were computed between the covariance representations of successive frames, capturing the geometric evolution of beam topology in the space of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices. Complementary topological distance analyses, performed with respect to the initial frame of each set, revealed distinct signatures of turbulence-induced aberrations and their progressive mitigation through dielectric compensation. The observed reduction in inter-frame distance metrics confirms the ability of coupled dipole interactions within PMMA slabs to partially restore statistical coherence in turbulence-distorted optical beams.</description>

      <title>GaN-based Resonant Cavity LEDs Fabricated by Photo-Electrochemical Etching and Micro-Transfer Printing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resonant cavity LEDs (RCLEDs) exhibit excellent temporal and spatial coherence with narrow spectral linewidth and small divergence angle, which is of great importance for micro-displays. In this paper, we demonstrate a novel method to create GaN-based RCLEDs by using photo-electrochemical etching and micro-transfer printing (MTP) technology. Through systematic optimizing of the etching conditions, highly selective etching of an InGaN multiple quantum well sacrificial layer is achieved with parasitic etching of adjacent layers being completely suppressed. The roughness of the underside of the exfoliated GaN film is only 3.3 nm. Raman spectroscopy shows that the residual stress in the released material is reduced from 0.74 GPa for the as-grown sample to -0.15 GPa. Using the MTP method, GaN coupons with a deposited upper dielectric mirror were transferred onto target substrates covered with either an Al mirror or dielectric distributed Bragg reflector to form two types of blue RCLEDs. The electroluminescence spectra of the two RCLEDs show a much narrower linewidth, reduced from 32 nm in the conventional LED to ~5 nm, together with stable peak wavelength with increasing current density, with the shift reduced from 9.3 nm to less than 1 nm. The far-field pattern is influenced by the bottom mirror, and the far-field divergence angle can be decreased to only 52{\deg} by matching the cavity and the quantum well exciton modes. This scalable approach is highly promising for the realization of compact resonant cavity devices and their use in displays and in communications.</description>

      <title>Characterization of a kerosene liquid jet injected in a high temperature Mach 2 supersonic crossflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near field liquid structures and penetration of a kerosene jet injected in a Mach 2 crossflow were studied experimentally in the LAPCAT-II Dual Mode Ramjet Combustor at Onera, using high spatial and temporal resolution imaging techniques. The experiments performed in this study provide measurements in high temperature conditions, with kerosene as liquid fuel to bring new data in these conditions. The fuel spray is injected through a single orifice, perpendicularly to the supersonic flow, at temperatures from ambient to 1500 K and jet-to-crossflow momentum flux ratio from 3.1 to 8.6. Five different test cases are defined to show independently the influence of the injection ratio and the supersonic flow temperature on the liquid jet atomization. A high spatial resolution imaging system is used to detail the characteristic spatial scales of this atomization process in the supersonic crossflow. The surface waves and droplets produced in the windward side of the liquid jet are characterized qualitatively. High-resolution visualizations bring a new insight of the droplet trajectories in the leeward region of the jet. Schlieren imaging is used to detail the complex shock wave structures in such a supersonic flow. Penetration of the kerosene jet is measured by shadowgraphy and schlieren imaging in five test cases and compared to other studies of the literature whenever it is possible. High-speed schlieren performed at 210 kHz is also performed to capture the temporal dynamics of the shocks and measure the liquid jet velocity.</description>

      <title>Impact of Surface Passivation on the Efficiency and High-speed Modulation of III-V GaAs/AlGaAs Nanopillar Array LEDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: III-V semiconductor nanolight sources with deep-subwavelength dimensions ($&lt;&lt;$1 ${\mu}$m) are essential for miniaturized photonic devices such as nanoLEDs and nanolasers. However, these nanoscale emitters suffer from substantial non-radiative recombination at room temperature, resulting in low efficiency and ultrashort lifetimes ($&lt;$100 ps). Previous works have predominantly studied surface passivation of nanoLEDs under optical pumping conditions, while practical applications require electrically driven nanoLEDs. Here, we investigate the influence of surface passivation on the efficiency and high-speed modulation response of electrically pumped III-V GaAs/AlGaAs nanopillar array LEDs. Surface passivation was performed using ammonium sulphide chemical treatment followed by encapsulation with a 100 nm silicon nitride layer deposited via low-frequency plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition. Time-resolved electroluminescence measurements reveal differential carrier lifetimes (${\tau}$) of ~0.61 ns for nanoarray LEDs with pillar diameters of ~440 nm, a record-long lifetime for electrically driven GaAs-based nanopillar arrays. Under low injection conditions, the devices exhibited carrier lifetimes of ~0.41 ns, indicating successful suppression of non-radiative effects and a low surface velocity, ranging from $S$~0.7$\times$10$^4$ cm/s to 2.7$\times$10$^4$ cm/s. This reveals a potential high internal quantum efficiency $IQE$~0.45 for our nanoLEDs operating under very high injection conditions, limited only by Auger recombination and self-heating effects at high current density. These miniaturized nanoLEDs with high radiative recombination efficiency and sub-ns modulation response pave the way for optical data communications, energy efficient optical interconnects, AR/VR displays, and neuromorphic computing applications.</description>

      <title>Analysis of optical pattern formation on glass: exploring light phenomena in the International Physicists Tournament</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by a problem from the 2023 International Physicists' Tournament, we investigate the formation of particular patterns when light passes through glass. Experimentally, we use various glass plates, registering each reflected and transmitted outcome. Thus, we find the condition to form a common pattern, namely, randomly scratched plates produce the halos. We engineer other optical patterns by means of the specular holography method. Using the Defocusing Microscopy technique, we study the geometric properties of the glass, establishing the physical and mathematical model for a simulation. Our computational results agree well with the experimental ones, leading us to conclude that the pattern formation is governed by specular reflection on various points along the scratches. Our findings give an initial explanation for the pattern formation on glass, in particular for the halo design. We also show that the IPT open questions help students learn physics concepts and develop research skills.</description>

      <title>Measuring vacancy-type defect density in monolayer semiconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18637v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted wide-spread interest due to their unique and tunable properties. Their optoelectronic, mechanical, and thermal properties are greatly influenced by crystal defects, which are, in turn, used to control these properties. However, experimental quantification of the density of defects, whether deliberately introduced or inherent, is very difficult in these atomically thin materials. Here we show that helium atom micro-diffraction can be used to measure the defect density in 15x20um monolayer MoS2, a prototypical 2D semiconductor, quickly and easily compared to standard methods. We present a simple analytic model, the lattice gas equation, that fully captures the relationship between atomic Bragg diffraction intensity and defect density. The model, combined with ab initio scattering calculations, shows that our technique can immediately be applied to a wide range of 2D materials, independent of sample chemistry or structure. Additionally, wafer-scale characterization is immediately possible.</description>

      <title>Analog dual classifier via a time-modulated neuromorphic metasurface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A neuromorphic metasurface embodies mechanical intelligence by realizing physical neural architectures. It exploits guided wave scattering to conduct computations in an analog manner. Through multiple tuned waveguides, the neuromorphic system recognizes the features of an input signal and self-identifies its classification label. The computational input is introduced to the system through mechanical excitations at one edge, generating elastic waves that traverse multiple layers of resonant metasurfaces. These metasurfaces possess a tunable phase akin to trainable parameters in deep learning algorithms. While early efforts have been promising, the well-established constraints on wave propagation in finite media limit such systems to single-task realizations. In this work, we devise a dual classifier neuromorphic metasurface and demonstrate its effectiveness in carrying out two completely independent classification problems that are concurrently carried out in parallel, thus addressing a major bottleneck in physical computing systems. Parallelization is achieved through smart multiplexing of the carrier computational frequency, enabled by prescribed temporal modulations of the embedded waveguides. The presented theory and results pave the way for new paradigms in wave-based computing systems, which have been elusive thus far.</description>

      <title>Scalable, Non-contact Determination of Electric Properties of Nanostructures via Electro-Rotation in Water Solution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Breakthroughs in nanotechnology have enabled the large-scale fabrication of nanoparticles with varied compositions and structures. Yet, evaluating their electrical conductivities remains challenging due to high volume and individual variability. We report a rapid, non-contact, and parallel method to characterize longitudinal nanostructures, including insulators, semiconductors, and conducting metal oxides by using MoO3, MoS2/MoO2, and MoS2 nanoribbons, produced at different fabrication stages, as a model system. Leveraging our semi-quantitative model based on Maxwell-Wagner and electrical double-layer polarization, electric conductivities of various nanoparticles are determined from their distinct electro-rotation behaviors in water, spanning six orders of magnitude. The results agree well with standard four-probe measurements. The technique, measuring multiple nanoparticles at once, without the use of electrical contact, can be easily scaled up for parallel determination of particles electric conductivities. These findings highlight a non-destructive, rapid, and simple characterization method promising to bring nanomaterials closer to practical applications in electronics, optics, sensing, catalysis, and robotics.</description>

      <title>Systematic Study of Amorphous ABC Heterostructures at the Atomic Scale as a Nonlinear Optical Metamaterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21583v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The systematic exploration of ABC type heterostructures reveals that nanoscale morphological modification markedly improves nonlinear optical properties to maximize the artificial bulk second-order susceptibility. These amorphous birefringent heterostructures are fabricated through cyclic plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition of three oxides, effectively breaking centrosymmetry. We observe a dependence of optical nonlinearity on the thickness variation of three constituent materials: SiO$_2$ (A), TiO$_2$ (B), and Al$_2$O$_3$ (C), ranging from tens of nanometers to the atomic scale, and these materials exhibit second-order susceptibility at their interfaces. Our findings reveal that the enhancement of nonlinear optical properties is strongly correlated with a high density of layers and superior interface quality, where the interface second-order nonlinearity transitions to bulk-like second-harmonic generation. An effective bulk second-order susceptibility of $\chi_{zzz}\nobreakspace{}=\nobreakspace{}2.0\nobreakspace{}\pm\nobreakspace{}0.2$ pm/V is achieved, comparable to typical values for conventional monocrystalline nonlinear materials.</description>

      <title>Layered Bimetal Nanoporous Platforms for SERS Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanoporous metals are extensively investigated as platforms for applications in plasmonics. They present high surface areas and strong local electric fields that can be tuned at different energies, playing with the choice of the metals and the morphology of the porous layers. Until recently, research in the field of plasmonics has primarily focused on porous metals composed of a single element, with limited attention given to the impact of alloy composition. The investigation of bi-metallic systems has only just begun to emerge in the literature. In particular, combining two or more different plasmonic metals, it could be possible to explore the interactions between two metals excited at specific energies. This involves plasmonic coupling, electron transfer, band hybridization at the interface, electromagnetic field interactions, and possibly thermal and electronic energy transfer depending on separation, size, and materials involved. The analysis of bi-metal systems can also be interesting in biomolecule detection, such as in the case of Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS). Here we report, for the first time, a detailed study (comprising morphological analyses, numerical modelling, and optical spectroscopies) on bi-metal nanoporous platforms prepared with a dry-synthesis method enabling the easy and controllable fabrication of bilayers combining different metals such as Au, Ag, and Cu.</description>

      <title>Ion-Beam-Sputtered Mid-Infrared Coatings for Hybrid Supermirrors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the development of low-loss ion-beam-sputtered (IBS) mid-infrared coatings for hybrid supermirrors. Two highly reflective designs were realized: HR1, a 4-period a-Si/SiO$_2$ DBR with an Al$_2$O$_3$ bonding layer, and HR2, a 6-period a-Si/Ta$_2$O$_5$ DBR with an a-Si terminating layer for bonding. Combined with a GaAs/AlGaAs crystalline mirror, HR2-based hybrids yielded a total loss of 9.3 ppm and excess loss of 6.8 ppm at 4.45 $\mu$m, with cavity finesse up to 396000. For the first time, we used IBS-deposited a-Si directly as a bonding layer, verified its sub-angstrom roughness, and demonstrated excellent performance. This establishes a clear path toward scalable coatings for longer mid-infrared wavelengths, building on prior results in Nat. Commun. 14, 7846 (2023).</description>

      <title>A 2-bit Ku-band Digital Metasurface with Infinitely Scalable Capability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we present the design and implementation of a 2-bit digaital metasurface operating in the Ku-band, engineered to exhibit advanced polarization conversion characteristics and support dual-polarization control for both X- and Y-polarizations. To address the challenge of array size scalability hindered by extensive DC control routing in 2-bit metasurfaces, we propose a novel RF-DC separation architecture. This approach integrates the metasurface and DC control circuitry onto separate printed circuit boards (PCBs), interconnected via pin cascading, enabling theoretically unlimited two-dimensional array expansion. To validate this design, a ${4\times16 \times 16}$ metasurface prototype was fabricated and experimentally evaluated, which can achieve a gain of 28.3dB and an aperture efficiency of 21.02\%, confirming the scalability and performance of the proposed architecture. The developed 2-bit high-gain metasurface offers significant reference value for applications in long-distance communication and radar detection. Furthermore, the RF-DC separation architecture introduces a pioneering framework for large-scale metasurface deployment in practical engineering scenarios, enhancing design flexibility and scalability.</description>

      <title>Automotive Crash Dynamics Modeling Accelerated with Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crashworthiness assessment is a critical aspect of automotive design, traditionally relying on high-fidelity finite element (FE) simulations that are computationally expensive and time-consuming. This work presents an exploratory comparative study on developing machine learning-based surrogate models for efficient prediction of structural deformation in crash scenarios using the NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo framework. Given the limited prior work applying machine learning to structural crash dynamics, the primary contribution lies in demonstrating the feasibility and engineering utility of the various modeling approaches explored in this work. We investigate two state-of-the-art neural network architectures for modeling crash dynamics: MeshGraphNet, and Transolver. Additionally, we examine three strategies for modeling transient dynamics: time-conditional, the standard Autoregressive approach, and a stability-enhanced Autoregressive scheme incorporating rollout-based training. The models are evaluated on a comprehensive Body-in-White (BIW) crash dataset comprising 150 detailed FE simulations using LS-DYNA. The dataset represents a structurally rich vehicle assembly with over 200 components, including 38 key components featuring variable thickness distributions to capture realistic manufacturing variability. Each model utilizes the undeformed mesh geometry and component characteristics as inputs to predict the spatiotemporal evolution of the deformed mesh during the crash sequence. Evaluation results show that the models capture the overall deformation trends with reasonable fidelity, demonstrating the feasibility of applying machine learning to structural crash dynamics. Although not yet matching full FE accuracy, the models achieve orders-of-magnitude reductions in computational cost, enabling rapid design exploration and early-stage optimization in crashworthiness evaluation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A neuroevolution potential (NEP) for the ternary $\alpha$-Fe--C--H system was developed based on a database generated from spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations, achieving empirical potential efficiency with DFT accuracy. At the same power consumption, simulation speeds using NEP are comparable to, or even faster than, those with bond order potentials. The NEP achieves DFT-level accuracy across a wide range of scenarios commonly encountered in studies of $\alpha$-Fe- and $\alpha$-Fe--C under hydrogen environments. The NEP enables large-scale atomistic simulations with DFT-level accuracy at the cost of empirical potentials, offering a practical tool to study hydrogen embrittlement in steel.</description>
