      <title>Teaching Astronomy with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of LLM integration in final-year undergraduate astronomy education, examining how students develop AI literacy through structured guidance and documentation requirements. We developed AstroTutor, a domain-specific astronomy tutoring system enhanced with curated arXiv content, and deployed it alongside general-purpose LLMs in the course. Students documented their AI usage through homework reflections and post-course surveys. We analyzed student evolution in AI interaction strategies and conducted experimental comparisons of LLM-assisted versus traditional grading methods. LLM grading showed strong correlation with human evaluation while providing more detailed and consistent feedback. We also piloted LLM-facilitated interview-based examinations as a scalable alternative to traditional assessments, demonstrating potential for individualized evaluation that addresses common testing limitations. Students experienced decreased rather than increased reliance on LLMs over the semester, developing critical evaluation skills and strategic tool selection. They evolved from basic assistance-seeking to verification workflows, with documentation requirements fostering metacognitive awareness. Students developed effective prompting strategies, contextual enrichment techniques, and cross-verification practices. Our findings suggest that structured LLM integration with transparency requirements and domain-specific tools can enhance astronomy education while building essential AI literacy skills. We provide implementation guidelines for educators and make our AstroTutor repository freely available.</description>

      <title>Pendulum Tracker -- SimuF\'isica: A Web-based Tool for Real-time Measurement of Oscillatory Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Pendulum Tracker, a computer vision-based application that enables real-time measurement of the oscillatory motion of a physical pendulum. Integrated into the educational platform SimuF\'isica, the system uses the OpenCV.js library and runs directly in the browser, working on computers, tablets, and smartphones. The application automatically detects the pendulum's position via the device's camera, displaying in real time the angle-versus-time graph and estimates of the oscillation period. Experimental case studies demonstrate its effectiveness in measuring the period, determining gravitational acceleration, and analyzing damped oscillations. The results show excellent agreement with theoretical predictions, confirming the system's accuracy and its applicability in educational contexts. The accessible interface and the ability to export raw data make Pendulum Tracker a versatile tool for experimental physics teaching.</description>

      <title>Teaching special relativity in elementary physics or upper high school courses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to provide teachers with a tool to teach the essential features of special relativity, considering the students' difficulties highlighted by numerous studies. Our proposal presents special relativity as the solution to the troubles of Newtonian dynamics, exemplified by the infinities of Newtonian uniformly accelerated motion. The paper's main section uses thought experiments with the exchange of flashes of light of null duration between two inertial reference frames to derive the kinematics effect of special relativity (time dilation, length contraction, Doppler effect, relativity of simultaneity, and Lorentz transformations). Simulations illustrate the results of the simple calculations. The discussion of experimental corroborations of the kinematics effects of special relativity complements the theoretical treatments. The Doppler effect, typically treated within the wave description of light, is addressed as an application of energy and linear momentum conservation during the emission or absorption of a photon by an atom (or a nucleus). When opportune, the paper suggests implementing teaching practices in the topics developed for teachers. Two of us' preliminary tests in the classroom ask for a wider one, including standard evaluation procedures of students' learning.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the role of vector potential in the Aharonov-Bohm effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The most popular interpretation of the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect is that the electromagnetic potential locally affects the complex phase of a charged particle's wave function in the magnetic field free region. However, since the vector potential is a gauge-variant quantity, not a few researchers suspect that it is just a convenient tool for calculating the force field. This motivates them to explain the AB effect without using the vector potential, which inevitably leads to some sort of non-locality. This frustrating situation is shortly summarized by the statement of Aharonov et al. that the AB effect may be due to a local gauge potential or due to non-local gauge-invariant fields. In the present paper, we shall give several convincing arguments, which support the viewpoint that the vector potential is not just a convenient mathematical tool with little physical entity. Despite its gauge arbitrariness, the vector potential certainly contains a gauge-invariant piece, which solely explains the observed AB phase shift. Importantly, this component has a property such that it is basically unique and cannot be eliminated by any regular gauge transformations. To make the discussion complete, we also discuss the role of remaining gauge arbitrariness still contained in the entire vector potential.</description>

      <title>Breaking Barriers: Investigating Gender Dynamics in Introductory Physics Lab Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15049v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The persistent underrepresentation of women and other gender minorities in physical science fields has been an ongoing concern. This study investigates gender dynamics in introductory physics laboratory courses, focusing on whether students of different gender identities exhibit equal inclination and confidence in conducting lab experiments, and whether they face barriers that impact their participation. Conducted across three institutions and involving non-physics STEM students enrolled in algebra-based and calculus-based physics courses, the study found mixed results, with two institutions showing no significant gender-based differences in participation levels during lab activities, while one institution demonstrated significant differences. Chi-square tests revealed no significant association between gender and task preference or comfortability, though the small dataset suggests the need for further investigation. While quantitative analysis provided limited evidence of systematic barriers, qualitative feedback revealed that some female students experienced challenges related to gender dynamics, such as perceived assumptions about competence, being overlooked during discussions, and hesitation to voice opinions in male-dominated groups. These findings highlight the complex influence of gender and institutional factors on laboratory experiences and underscore the need for creating inclusive environments that promote equitable engagement and participation for all gender identities in STEM education.</description>

      <title>Visual relativistic mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article shows how to express relativistic concepts in a visual manner using the full power of hyperbolic trigonometric functions. Minkowski diagrams in energy-momentum space are used in conjunction with hyperbolic triangles. Elegant new derivations of the relativistic rocket equation and the relativistic Doppler effect are presented that use this visual approach.</description>
