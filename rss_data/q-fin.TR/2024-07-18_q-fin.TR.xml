      <title>Beyond Trend Following: Deep Learning for Market Trend Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trend following and momentum investing are common strategies employed by asset managers. Even though they can be helpful in the proper situations, they are limited in the sense that they work just by looking at past, as if we were driving with our focus on the rearview mirror. In this paper, we advocate for the use of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques to predict future market trends. These predictions, when done properly, can improve the performance of asset managers by increasing returns and reducing drawdowns.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Pricing in Securities Lending Market: Application in Revenue Optimization for an Agent Lender Portfolio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Securities lending is an important part of the financial market structure, where agent lenders help long term institutional investors to lend out their securities to short sellers in exchange for a lending fee. Agent lenders within the market seek to optimize revenue by lending out securities at the highest rate possible. Typically, this rate is set by hard-coded business rules or standard supervised machine learning models. These approaches are often difficult to scale and are not adaptive to changing market conditions. Unlike a traditional stock exchange with a centralized limit order book, the securities lending market is organized similarly to an e-commerce marketplace, where agent lenders and borrowers can transact at any agreed price in a bilateral fashion. This similarity suggests that the use of typical methods for addressing dynamic pricing problems in e-commerce could be effective in the securities lending market. We show that existing contextual bandit frameworks can be successfully utilized in the securities lending market. Using offline evaluation on real historical data, we show that the contextual bandit approach can consistently outperform typical approaches by at least 15% in terms of total revenue generated.</description>

      <title>Deep learning for quadratic hedging in incomplete jump market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a deep learning approach to study the minimal variance pricing and hedging problem in an incomplete jump diffusion market. It is based upon a rigorous stochastic calculus derivation of the optimal hedging portfolio, optimal option price, and the corresponding equivalent martingale measure through the means of the Stackelberg game approach. A deep learning algorithm based on the combination of the feedforward and LSTM neural networks is tested on three different market models, two of which are incomplete. In contrast, the complete market Black-Scholes model serves as a benchmark for the algorithm's performance. The results that indicate the algorithm's good performance are presented and discussed.
  In particular, we apply our results to the special incomplete market model studied by Merton and give a detailed comparison between our results based on the minimal variance principle and the results obtained by Merton based on a different pricing principle. Using deep learning, we find that the minimal variance principle leads to typically higher option prices than those deduced from the Merton principle. On the other hand, the minimal variance principle leads to lower losses than the Merton principle.</description>

      <title>Equity auction dynamics: latent liquidity models with activity acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Equity auctions display several distinctive characteristics in contrast to continuous trading. As the auction time approaches, the rate of events accelerates causing a substantial liquidity buildup around the indicative price. This, in turn, results in a reduced price impact and decreased volatility of the indicative price. In this study, we adapt the latent/revealed order book framework to the specifics of equity auctions. We provide precise measurements of the model parameters, including order submissions, cancellations, and diffusion rates. Our setup allows us to describe the full dynamics of the average order book during closing auctions in Euronext Paris. These findings support the relevance of the latent liquidity framework in describing limit order book dynamics. Lastly, we analyze the factors contributing to a sub-diffusive indicative price and demonstrate the absence of indicative price predictability.</description>
