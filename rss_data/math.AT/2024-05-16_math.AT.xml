      <title>Bistellar Cluster Algebras and Piecewise Linear Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the ideas and techniques used in the study of cluster algebras we construct a new class of algebras, called bistellar cluster algebras, from closed oriented triangulated even-dimensional manifolds by performing middle-dimensional bistellar moves. This class of algebras exhibit the algebraic behaviour of middle-dimensional bistellar moves but do not satisfy the classical cluster algebra axiom: "every cluster variable in every cluster is exchangeable". Thus the construction of bistellar cluster algebras is quite different from that of a classical cluster algebra. Secondly, using bistellar cluster algebras and the techniques of combinatorial topology, we construct a direct system associated with a set of PL homeomorphic PL manifolds of dimension 2 or 4, and show that the limit of this direct system is a PL invariant.</description>

      <title>Contractibility of the Rips complexes of Integer lattices via local domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for each positive integer $n$, the Rips complexes of the $n$-dimensional integer lattice in the $d_1$ metric (i.e., the Manhattan metric, also called the natural word metric in the Cayley graph) are contractible at scales above $n^2(2n-1)^2$, with the bounds arising from the Jung's constants. We introduce a new concept of locally dominated vertices in a simplicial complex, upon which our proof strategy is based. This allows us to deduce the contractibility of the Rips complexes from a local geometric condition called local crushing. In the case of the integer lattices in dimension $n$ and a fixed scale $r$, this condition entails the comparison of finitely many distances to conclude that the corresponding Rips complex is contractible. In particular, we are able to verify that for $n=1,2,3$, the Rips complex of the $n$-dimensional integer lattice at scale greater or equal to $n$ is contractible. We conjecture that the same proof strategy can be used to extend this result to all dimensions $n$</description>

      <title>Parallel computation of interval bases for persistence module decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.11884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A persistence module $M$, with coefficients in a field $\mathbb{F}$, is a finite-dimensional linear representation of an equioriented quiver of type $A_n$ or, equivalently, a graded module over the ring of polynomials $\mathbb{F}[x]$. It is well-known that $M$ can be written as the direct sum of indecomposable representations or as the direct sum of cyclic submodules generated by homogeneous elements. An interval basis for $M$ is a set of homogeneous elements of $M$ such that the sum of the cyclic submodules of $M$ generated by them is direct and equal to $M$. We introduce a novel algorithm to compute an interval basis for $M$. Based on a flag of kernels of the structure maps, our algorithm is suitable for parallel or distributed computation and does not rely on a presentation of $M$. This algorithm outperforms the approach via the presentation matrix and Smith Normal Form. We specialize our parallel approach to persistent homology modules, and we close by applying the proposed algorithm to tracking harmonics via Hodge decomposition.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Persistent Homology Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.05243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The combinatorial interpretation of the persistence diagram as a M\"obius inversion was recently shown to be functorial. We employ this discovery to recast the Persistent Homology Transform of a geometric complex as a representation of a cellulation on $\mathbb{S}^n$ to the category of combinatorial persistence diagrams. Detailed examples are provided. We hope this recasting of the PH transform will allow for the adoption of existing methods from algebraic and topological combinatorics to the study of shapes.</description>

      <title>On the deformation theory of $\mathbb{E}_\infty$-coalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of formally \'etale $\mathbb{E}_{\infty}$-coalgebras and show that they admit essentially unique, functorial lifts along square zero extensions of $\mathbb{E}_{\infty}$-rings. Using this, we show that for a perfect $\mathbb{F}_p$-algebra $k$, Weil restriction along the augmentation $\mathbb{W}(k)\to k$ induces a fully faithful functor from formally \'etale, connective $\mathbb{E}_{\infty}$-coalgebras in $k$-modules to connective $\mathbb{E}_{\infty}$-coalgebras in $p$-complete modules over the spherical Witt vectors $\mathbb{W}(k)$. Finally, we prove that for any connected space $X$, the $k$-homology $k[X]$ is a formally \'etale $\mathbb{E}_\infty$-coalgebra in $k$-modules. This shows that $\mathbb{W}(k)[X]^{\wedge}_p$ can be recovered as the essentially unique lift of $k[X]$ to a connective coalgebra in $p$-complete $\mathbb{W}(k)$-modules.</description>

      <title>A Weiss-Williams theorem for spaces of embeddings and the homotopy type of spaces of long knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a pseudoisotopy result for embedding spaces in the line of that of Weiss and Williams for diffeomorphism groups. In other words, for $P\subset M$ a codimension at least three embedding, we describe the difference in a range of homotopical degrees between the spaces of block and ordinary embeddings of $P$ into $M$ as a certain infinite loop space involving the relative algebraic $K$-theory of the pair $(M,M-P)$. This range of degrees is the so-called concordance embedding stable range, which, by recent developments of Goodwillie-Krannich-Kupers, is far beyond that of the aforementioned theorem of Weiss-Williams.
  We use this result to give a full description of the homotopy type (away from 2 and up to the concordance embedding stable range) of the space of long knots of codimension at least 3. In doing so, we carry out an extensive analysis of certain geometric involutions in algebraic $K$-theory that may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Smooth generalized symmetries of quantum field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical quantum field theories (QFTs), such as those in which spacetimes are equipped with a metric and/or a field in the form of a smooth map to a target manifold, can be formulated axiomatically using the language of $\infty$-categories. According to a geometric version of the cobordism hypothesis, such QFTs collectively assemble themselves into objects in an $\infty$-topos of smooth spaces. We show how this allows one to define and study generalized global symmetries of such QFTs. The symmetries are themselves smooth, so the `higher-form' symmetry groups can be endowed with, e.g., a Lie group structure.
  Among the more surprising general implications for physics are, firstly, that QFTs in spacetime dimension $d$, considered collectively, can have $d$-form symmetries, going beyond the known $(d-1)$-form symmetries of individual QFTs and, secondly, that a global symmetry of a QFT can be anomalous even before we try to gauge it, due to a failure to respect either smoothness (in that a symmetry of an individual QFT does not smoothly extend to QFTs collectively) or locality (in that a symmetry of an unextended QFT does not extend to an extended one).
  Smoothness anomalies are shown to occur even in 2-state systems in quantum mechanics (here formulated axiomatically by equipping $d=1$ spacetimes with a metric, an orientation, and perhaps some unitarity structure). Locality anomalies are shown to occur even for invertible QFTs defined on $d=1$ spacetimes equipped with an orientation and a smooth map to a target manifold. These correspond in physics to topological actions for a particle moving on the target and the relation to an earlier classification of such actions using invariant differential cohomology is elucidated.</description>
