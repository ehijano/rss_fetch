      <title>One-winged butterflies: mode selection for azimuthal magnetorotational instability by thermal convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effects of thermal convection on turbulence in accretion discs, and particularly its interaction with the magnetorotational instability (MRI), are of significant astrophysical interest. Despite extensive theoretical and numerical studies, such interactions have not been explored experimentally. We conduct linear analysis of the azimuthal version of MRI (AMRI) in the presence of convection and compare our findings with the experimental data. We show that AMRI sets in at lower critical Hartmann numbers ($Ha$) in the presence of convection. Importantly, convection breaks symmetry between the $m = \pm 1$ modes ($m$ is the azimuthal wavenumber). This preference for one mode over the other makes the AMRI-wave look like a "one-winged butterfly" observed in the experiments.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Absolute Parameters of W UMa-type Binary Stars Using Gaia DR3 Parallax</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accuracy of absolute parameters' estimation in contact binary systems is important for investigating their evolution and solving some challenges. The Gaia DR3 parallax is one of the methods used for estimating the absolute parameters, in cases where photometric data is the only one that is available. The use of this method includes advantages and limitations that we have described and examined in this study. We selected 48 contact binary systems whose mass ratios were mostly obtained by spectroscopic data, in addition to a number of photometric studies. The target systems were suitable for A_V and the Re-normalised Unit Weight Error (RUWE), and their absolute parameters were calculated based on Gaia DR3 parallax, observational information, orbital period, and light cure solution from the literature and catalogs. The outcomes of OO Aql differed significantly from those reported in the literature. Upon analyzing the system's light curve with TESS data, we concluded that the stars' temperatures were the reason for this difference, and utilizing Gaia DR3 parallax provided reasonable results. We displayed the target systems on the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR), q-L_ratio, P-M_V, and logM_tot-logJ_0 diagrams, and the systems are in good agreement with the theoretical fits. We showed that the estimation of absolute parameters with this method might be acceptable if Delta a(R_Sun) is less than about 0.1(R_Sun). There are open questions regarding the existence of l_3 in the light curve analysis and its effect on the estimation of absolute parameters with this method.</description>

      <title>zoomies: A tool to infer stellar age from vertical action in Gaia data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar age measurements are fundamental to understanding a wide range of astronomical processes, including galactic dynamics, stellar evolution, and planetary system formation. However, extracting age information from Main Sequence stars is complicated, with techniques often relying on age proxies in the absence of direct measurements. The Gaia data releases have enabled detailed studies of the dynamical properties of stars within the Milky Way, offering new opportunities to understand the relationship between stellar age and dynamics. In this study, we leverage high-precision astrometric data from Gaia DR3 to construct a stellar age prediction model based only on stellar dynamical properties; namely, the vertical action. We calibrate two distinct, hierarchical stellar age--vertical action relations, first employing asteroseismic ages for red giant branch stars, then isochrone ages for main-sequence turn-off stars. We describe a framework called "zoomies" based on this calibration, by which we can infer ages for any star given its vertical action. This tool is open-source and intended for community use. We compare dynamical age estimates from "zoomies" with ages derived from other techniques for a sample of open clusters and main-sequence stars with asteroseismic age measurements. We also compare dynamical age estimates for stellar samples from the Kepler, K2, and TESS exoplanet transit surveys. While dynamical age relations are associated with large uncertainty, they are generally mass-independent and depend on homogeneously measured astrometric data. These age predictions are uniquely useful for large-scale demographic investigations, especially in disentangling the relationship between planet occurrence, metallicity, and age for low-mass stars.</description>

      <title>The Bright Rim Prominences according to 2.5D Radiative Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar prominences observed close to the limb commonly include a bright feature that, from the perspective of the observer, runs along the interface between itself and the underlying chromosphere. Despite several idealised models being proposed to explain the underlying physics, a more general approach remains outstanding. In this manuscript we demonstrate as a proof-of-concept the first steps in applying the Lightweaver radiative transfer framework's 2.5D extension to a `toy' model prominence + VAL3C chromosphere, inspired by recent 1.5D experiments that demonstrated a significant radiative chromosphere--prominence interaction. We find the radiative connection to be significant enough to enhance both the electron number density within the chromosphere, as well as its emergent intensity across a range of spectral lines in the vicinity of the filament absorption signature. Inclining the viewing angle from the vertical, we find these enhancements to become increasingly asymmetric and merge with a larger secondary enhancement sourced directly from the prominence underside. In wavelength, the enhancements are then found to be the largest in both magnitude and horizontal extent for the spectral line cores, decreasing into the line wings. Similar behaviour is found within new Chinese H$\alpha$ Solar Explorer (CHASE)/H$\alpha$ Imaging Spectrograph (HIS) observations, opening the door for subsequent statistical confirmations of the theoretical basis we develop here.</description>

      <title>The first measurements of carbon isotopic ratios in post-RGB stars: SZ Mon and DF Cyg. E-iSpec: A spectral analysis tool to derive elemental abundances and isotopic ratios for evolved stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dusty post-red giant branch (post-RGB) stars are low- and intermediate-mass stars where the RGB evolution was prematurely terminated by a poorly understood binary interaction. These binary stars are considered to be low-luminosity analogues of post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) binary stars. In this study, we investigated the chemical composition of two dusty post-RGB binary stars, SZ Mon and DF Cyg, using multi-wavelength spectroscopic data from HERMES/Mercator (optical) and the APOGEE survey (near-infrared). Owing to challenges posed by existing spectral analysis tools for the study of evolved stars with complex atmospheres, we developed E-iSpec: a dedicated spectral analysis tool for evolved stars, to consistently determine atmospheric parameters, elemental abundances, and carbon isotopic ratios. Our abundance analysis revealed that observed depletion patterns and estimated depletion efficiencies resemble those found in post-AGB binary stars. However, the onset of chemical depletion in post-RGB targets occurs at higher condensation temperatures ($T_{\rm turn-off, post-RGB}\approx1400$ K), than in most post-AGB stars ($T_{\rm turn-off, post-AGB}\approx1100$ K). Additionally, our study resulted in the first estimates of carbon isotopic ratios for post-RGB stars ($^{12}$C/$^{13}$C$_{\rm SZ Mon}=8\pm4$, $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C$_{\rm DF Cyg}=12\pm3$). We found that the observationally derived CNO abundances and the carbon isotopic ratios of our post-RGB binary targets are in good agreement with theoretical predictions from the ATON single star evolutionary models involving first dredge-up and moderately-deep extra mixing. This agreement emphasises that in post-RGB binary targets, the observed CNO abundances reflect the chemical composition expected from single star nucleosynthesis (i.e., convective and non-convective mixing processes) occurring during the RGB phase before it is terminated.</description>

      <title>Constraining Protoplanetary Disk Winds from Forbidden Line Profiles with Simulation-based Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protoplanetary disks are the sites of vigorous hydrodynamic processes, such as accretion and outflows, and ultimately establish the conditions for the formation of planets. The properties of disk outflows are often inferred through analysis of forbidden emission lines. These lines contain multiple overlapping components, tracing different emission regions with different processes that excite them: a high-velocity component (tracing a jet), a broad low-velocity component (tracing inner disk wind), and a narrow low-velocity component (tracing outer disk wind). They are also heavily contaminated by background spectral features. All of these challenges call into question the traditional approach of fitting Gaussian components to the line profiles, and cloud the physical interpretation of those components. We introduce a novel statistical technique to analyze emission lines in protoplanetary disks. Simulation-Based Inference is a computationally efficient machine learning technique that produces posterior distributions of the parameters (e.g. magnetic field, radiation sources, geometry) of a representative wind model when given a spectrum, without any prior assumption about line shapes (e.g.symmetry). In this pathfinder study, we demonstrate that this technique indeed accurately recovers the parameters from simulated spectra without noise and background. A following work will deal with the analysis of observed spectra.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Observations of the Solar Corona during the 2017 August 21 Total Solar Eclipse: Comparison of Spectral Line Widths and Doppler Shifts Between Open and Closed Magnetic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectroscopic observations presented here were acquired during the 2017 August 21 total solar eclipse with a three-channel partially multiplexed imaging spectrometer (3PAMIS) operating at extremely high orders ($&gt;$ 50). The 4 $R_\odot$ extent of the slit in the North-South direction scanned the corona starting from the central meridian out to approximately 1.0 $R_\odot$ off the east limb throughout totality. The line widths and Doppler shifts of the Fe X (637.4 nm) and Fe XIV (530.3 nm) emission lines, characteristic of $1.1 \times 10^6$ K and $1.8 \times 10^6$ K electron temperatures respectively, varied across the different coronal structures intercepted by the slit. Fe XIV was the dominant emission in the closed fields of an active region and the base of a streamer, with relatively constant 20 - 30 km s$^{-1}$ line widths independent of the height. In contrast, Fe X emission exhibited broader ($&gt;40 $km s$^{-1}$) line widths in open fields which increased with height, in particular in the polar coronal hole. Inferences of line widths and Doppler shifts were consistent with extreme ultraviolet (EUV) observations from Hinode/EIS, as well as with the near-infrared Fe XIII 1074 nm line observed by CoMP. The differences in the spectral line widths between distinct coronal structures are interpreted as an indication of the predominance of wave heating in open structures versus localized heating in closed structures. This study underscores the unparalleled advantages and the enormous potential of TSE spectroscopy in measuring line widths simultaneously in open and closed fields at high altitudes, with minimal exposure times, stray light levels, and instrumental widths.</description>

      <title>Statistical investigation of wave propagation in the quiet-Sun using IRIS spectroscopic observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current analysis, we use spectroscopic observations of the quiet-Sun made by IRIS instrument, and investigate wave propagation. We analyze various spectral lines formed in different atmospheric layers such as the photosphere, chromosphere, and transition region. We examine Doppler velocity time-series at various locations in the quiet-Sun to determine the dominant oscillation periods. Our results executing statistical analysis resemble those of the classical physical scenario, indicating that the photosphere is mainly characterized by the dominant 5-minute period, while the chromosphere is primarily associated with the 3-minute oscillation period. In the transition region, we observe a variety of oscillation periods, with dominant periods of 3, 8, and 12 minutes. We estimate the cut-off frequency by deducing phase difference between two Doppler velocity time-series obtained from spectral line pairs in different atmospheric layers formed at different temperatures. It reveals a significant correlation between 3-minute periods in TR and photospheric oscillations, suggesting that these oscillations in the TR might propagate from the photosphere. Additionally, we analyze the phase difference between chromospheric oscillations and photospheric oscillations, demonstrating that only the 3-minute oscillations propagate upwards. Based on the statistical analyses, we suggest the presence of magnetoacoustic waves in the solar atmosphere in which some are propagating from the lower solar atmosphere upward, while some others are propagating downward. TR carries both long-period oscillations generated in situ, and some photospheric oscillations which are also able to reach there from below.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of the kinetic properties of proton and alpha beams in the Alfv\'enic wind observed by SWA-PAS onboard Solar Orbiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problems of heating and acceleration of solar wind particles are of significant and enduring interest in astrophysics. The interactions between waves and particles are crucial in determining the distributions of proton and alpha particles, resulting in non-Maxwellian characteristics including temperature anisotropies and particle beams. These processes can be better understood as long as the beam can be separated from the core for the two major components of the solar wind. We utilized an alternative numerical approach that leverages the clustering technique employed in Machine Learning to differentiate the primary populations within the velocity distribution, rather than employing the conventional biMaxwellian fitting method. Separation of the core and beam revealed new features for protons and alphas. We estimated that the total temperature of the two beams was slightly higher than that of their respective cores, and the temperature anisotropy for the cores and beams was larger than 1. We concluded that the temperature ratio between alphas and protons largely over 4 is due to the presence of a massive alpha beam, which is approximately 50% of the alpha core. We provided evidence that the alpha core and beam populations are sensitive to Alfv\'enic fluctuations and the surfing effect found in the literature can be recovered only when considering the core and beam as a single population. Several similarities between proton and alpha beams would suggest a common and local generation mechanism not shared with the alpha core, which may not have necessarily been accelerated and heated locally.</description>

      <title>The Carbon Isotopic Ratio and Planet Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first detection of 13CCH in a protoplanetary disk (TW Hya). Using observations of C2H we measure CCH/13CCH = 65 +/- 20 in gas with a CO isotopic ratio of 12CO/13CO = 21 +/- 5 (Yoshida et al. 2022a). The TW Hya disk exhibits a gas phase C/O that exceeds unity and C2H is the tracer of this excess carbon. We confirm that the TW Hya gaseous disk exhibits two separate carbon isotopic reservoirs as noted previously (Yoshida et al. 2022a). We explore two theoretical solutions for the development of this dichotomy. One model represents TW Hya today with a protoplanetary disk exposed to a cosmic ray ionization rate that is below interstellar as consistent with current estimates. We find that this model does not have sufficient ionization in cold (T &lt; 40 K) layers to activate carbon isotopic fractionation. The second model investigates a younger TW Hya protostellar disk exposed to an interstellar cosmic ray ionization rate. We find that the younger model has sources of ionization deeper in a colder disk that generates two independent isotopic reservoirs. One reservoir is 12C-enriched carried by methane/hydrocarbon ices and the other is 13C-enriched carried by gaseous CO. The former potentially provides a source of methane/hydrocarbon ices to power the chemistry that generates the anomalously strong C$_2$H emission in this (and other) disk systems in later stages. The latter provides a source of gaseous 13C-rich material to generate isotopic enrichments in forming giant planets as recently detected in the super-Jupiter TYC 8998-760-1 b by Zhang et al. (2021).</description>

      <title>[N I] 10400/10410 {\AA} Lines as Possible Disk Wind Tracers in a Young Intermediate-Mass Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we performed high-resolution near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy (R = 28,000; ${\lambda} = 0.90$-1.35 ${\mu}$m) with a high signal-to-noise ratio on HD 200775, a very young (${\sim}$0.1 Myr old) and massive intermediate-mass star (a binary star with a mass of about 10 $M_{\odot}$ each) with a protoplanetary disk. The obtained spectra show eight forbidden lines of three elements: two of [S II] (10289 and 10323 {\AA}), two of [N I] (10400 and 10410 {\AA}), and four of [Fe II] (12570, 12946, 12981, and 13209 {\AA}). This is the first time that the [N I] lines are detected in a young stellar object with a doublet deblended. Gaussian fitting of the spectra indicates that all line profiles have low-velocity components and exhibit blueshifted features, suggesting that all lines originate from the disk winds (magnetohydrodynamic disk wind and/or photoevaporative wind). Based on the fit, the [N I] and [Fe II] lines are categorized into narrow components, while the [S II] lines are at the boundary between broad and narrow components. These forbidden lines are suggested to be very promising disk wind tracers among the existing ones because they are in the NIR-wavelength range, which can be observed from early stages with high sensitivities. Among these lines, [N I] lines would be a rather powerful probe for deriving the basic physical parameters of disk wind gases. However, the study of these lines herein is limited to one object; thus, further studies are needed to examine their properties.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Geoffective Events from Solar Wind Data and Evaluating the Most Predictive Features through Machine Learning Approaches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study addresses the prediction of geomagnetic disturbances by exploiting machine learning techniques. Specifically, the Long-Short Term Memory recurrent neural network, which is particularly suited for application over long time series, is employed in the analysis of in-situ measurements of solar wind plasma and magnetic field acquired over more than one solar cycle, from $2005$ to $2019$, at the Lagrangian point L$1$. The problem is approached as a binary classification aiming to predict one hour in advance a decrease in the SYM-H geomagnetic activity index below the threshold of $-50$ nT, which is generally regarded as indicative of magnetospheric perturbations. The strong class imbalance issue is tackled by using an appropriate loss function tailored to optimize appropriate skill scores in the training phase of the neural network. Beside classical skill scores, value-weighted skill scores are then employed to evaluate predictions, suitable in the study of problems, such as the one faced here, characterized by strong temporal variability. For the first time, the content of magnetic helicity and energy carried by solar transients, associated with their detection and likelihood of geo-effectiveness, were considered as input features of the network architecture. Their predictive capabilities are demonstrated through a correlation-driven feature selection method to rank the most relevant characteristics involved in the neural network prediction model. The optimal performance of the adopted neural network in properly forecasting the onset of geomagnetic storms, which is a crucial point for giving real warnings in an operational setting, is finally showed.</description>

      <title>The Dynamic, Chimeric Inner Disk of PDS 70</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition disks, with inner regions depleted in dust and gas, could represent later stages of protoplanetary disk evolution when newly-formed planets are emerging. The PDS 70 system has attracted particular interest because of the presence of two giant planets at tens of au orbits within the inner disk cavity, at least one of which is itself accreting. However, the region around PDS 70 most relevant to understanding the planet populations revealed by exoplanet surveys of middle-aged stars is the inner disk, which is the dominant source of the system's excess infrared emission but only marginally resolved by ALMA. Here we present and analyze time-series optical and infrared photometry and spectroscopy that reveal the inner disk to be dynamic on timescales of days to years, with occultation of sub-micron dust dimming the star at optical wavelengths and 3-5 $\mu$m emission varying due to changes in disk structure. Remarkably, the infrared emission from the innermost region (nearly) disappears for ~1 year. We model the spectral energy distribution of the system and its time variation with a flattened warm (T &lt;~ 600K) disk and a hotter (1200K) dust that could represent an inner rim or wall. The high dust-to-gas ratio of the inner disk relative to material accreting from the outer disk, means that the former could be a chimera consisting of depleted disk gas that is subsequently enriched with dust and volatiles produced by collisions and evaporation of planetesimals in the inner zone.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Approach for Mitigating Dark Current Noise and Bad Pixels in Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor Cameras for Space-based Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a gradual increase in the performance of Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) cameras. These cameras have gained popularity as a viable alternative to charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras in a wide range of applications. One particular application is the CMOS camera installed in small space telescopes. However, the limited power and spatial resources available on satellites present challenges in maintaining ideal observation conditions, including temperature and radiation environment. Consequently, images captured by CMOS cameras are susceptible to issues such as dark current noise and defective pixels. In this paper, we introduce a data-driven framework for mitigating dark current noise and bad pixels for CMOS cameras. Our approach involves two key steps: pixel clustering and function fitting. During pixel clustering step, we identify and group pixels exhibiting similar dark current noise properties. Subsequently, in the function fitting step, we formulate functions that capture the relationship between dark current and temperature, as dictated by the Arrhenius law. Our framework leverages ground-based test data to establish distinct temperature-dark current relations for pixels within different clusters. The cluster results could then be utilized to estimate the dark current noise level and detect bad pixels from real observational data. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we have conducted tests using real observation data obtained from the Yangwang-1 satellite, equipped with a near-ultraviolet telescope and an optical telescope. The results show a considerable improvement in the detection efficiency of space-based telescopes.</description>

      <title>Searching for precursor activity of Type IIn Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conducted a search for luminous outbursts prior to the explosion of Type IIn Supernovae (SNe IIn). We built a sample of 27 objects spectroscopically classified as SNe IIn, all located at $z&lt;0.015$. Using deep archival SN fields images taken up to nearly 20 years prior from transient surveys (PTF, ZTF, DES, CHASE) and major astronomical observatories (ESO and NOAO), we found at least one outburst years to months before the explosion of seven SNe IIn, the earliest precursor being 10 years prior to the explosion of SN 2019bxq. The maximum absolute magnitudes of the outbursts range between -11.5 mag and -15 mag, and the eruptive phases last for a few weeks to a few years. The $g-r$ colour measured for three objects during their outburst is relatively red, with $g-r$ ranging between 0.5 and 1.0 mag. This is similar to the colour expected during the eruptions of Luminous Blue Variables. We noticed that the SNe with pre-SN outbursts have light curves with faster decline rates than those that do not show pre-SN outbursts. SN 2011fh is remarkable, as it is still visible 12 years after the luminous SN-like event, indicating that the progenitor possibly survived, or that the interaction is still on-going. We detect precursor activity in 29% of bona-fide SNe~IIn in our sample. However, a quantitative assessment of the observational biases affecting the sample suggests that this fraction underestimates the intrinsic precursor occurrence rate.</description>

      <title>Embedded coherent structures from MHD to sub-ion scales in turbulent solar wind at 0.17 au</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10478v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study intermittent coherent structures in solar wind magnetic turbulence from MHD to kinetic plasma scales using Parker Solar Probe data during its first perihelion (at 0.17 au), when the satellite was in the Alfv\'enic slow wind of 340 km/s. The coherent structures are energetic events localized in time and covering wide range of scales. We detect them using Morlet wavelets. For the first time, we apply a multi-scale analyses in physical space to study these structures. At MHD scales within the inertial range, times scales $\tau \in (1, 10^{2} )$ s, we find (i) current sheets including switchback boundaries and (ii) Alfv\'en vortices. Within these events, there are embedded structures at smaller scales: typically Alfv\'en vortices at ion scales, $\tau \in (0.08, 1)$ s, and a compressible vortices at sub-ion scales, $\tau \in (8,80)$ ms. The number of coherent structures grows toward smaller scales: we observe about $\sim 200$ events during 5 h time interval at MHD scales, $\sim 10^{3}$ events ai ion scales and $\sim 10^{4}$ events at sub-ion scales. In general, there are multiple structures of ion and sub-ion scales embedded within one MHD structure. There are also examples of ion and sub-ion scales structures outside of MHD structures. To quantify the relative importance of different type of structures, we do a statistical comparison of the observed structures with the expectations of models of the current sheets and vortices. This comparison is based on amplitude anisotropy of magnetic fluctuations within the structures. The results show the dominance of Alfv\'en vortices at all scales in contrast to the widespread view of dominance of current sheets. This means that Alfv\'en vortices are important building blocs of solar wind turbulence.</description>

      <title>Wave Generation by Flare-Accelerated Ions and Implications for 3He Acceleration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The waves generated by high-energy proton and alpha particles streaming from solar flares into regions of colder plasma are explored using particle-in-cell simulations. Initial distribution functions for the protons and alphas consist of two populations: an energetic, streaming population represented by an anisotropic ($T_{\parallel} &gt; T_{\perp}$), one-sided kappa function and a cold, Maxwellian background population. The anisotropies and non-zero heat fluxes of these distributions destabilize oblique waves with a range of frequencies below the proton cyclotron frequency. These waves scatter particles out of the tails of the initial distributions along constant energy surfaces in the wave frame. Overlap of the nonlinear resonance widths allows particles to scatter into near isotropic distributions by the end of the simulations. The dynamics of $^3$He are explored using test particles. Their temperatures can increase by a factor of nearly 20. Propagation of such waves into regions above and below the flare site can lead to heating and transport of $^3$He into the flare acceleration region. The amount of heated $^3$He that will be driven into the flare site is proportional to the wave energy. Using values from our simulations, we show that the abundance of $^3$He driven into the acceleration region should approach that of $^4$He in the corona. Therefore, waves driven by energetic ions produced in flares are a strong candidate to drive the enhancements of $^3$He observed in impulsive flares.</description>

      <title>Outflows Driven from a Magnetic Pseudodisk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04260v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Outflows play a pivotal role in star formation as one of its most visible markers and a means of transporting mass, momentum, and angular momentum from the infalling gas into the surrounding molecular cloud. Their wide reach (at least thousands of au) is a contrast to typical disk sizes ($\sim 10-100$ au). We employ high-resolution three-dimensional nested-grid nonideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations to study outflow properties in the Class 0 phase. We find that no disk wind is driven from the extended centrifugal disk that has weak magnetic coupling. The low-velocity winds emerge instead from the infalling magnetic pseudodisk. Much of the disk actually experiences an infall of matter rather than outflowing gas. Some of the pseudodisk wind (PD-wind) moves inward to regions above the disk and either falls onto the disk or proceeds upward. The upward flow gives the impression of a disk wind above a certain height even if the gas is originally emerging from the pseudodisk. The PD-wind has the strongest flow coming from a disk interaction zone that lies just outside the disk and is an interface between the inwardly advected magnetic field of the pseudodisk and the outwardly diffusing magnetic field of the disk. The low-velocity wind exhibits the features of a flow driven by the magnetic pressure gradient force in some regions and those of a magnetocentrifugal wind in other regions. We interpret the structure and dynamics of the outflow zone in terms of the basic physics of gravity, angular momentum, magnetic fields, and nonideal MHD.</description>

      <title>Strong Gravity Extruding Peaks in Speed of Sound Profiles of Massive Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The speed of sound squared (SSS) $s^2$ in massive neutron stars (NSs) characterizes not only the stiffness of supradense neutron-rich matter within but also equivalently properties of the curved geometry due to the strong-field gravity and matter-geometry coupling. A peaked density or radius profile of $s^2$ has been predicted for massive NSs using various NS Equation of State (EOS) models. However, the nature, cause, location and size of the peak in $s^2$ profiles are still very EOS model dependent. In this work, we investigate systematically $s^2$ profiles in massive NSs in a new approach that is independent of the nuclear EOS model and without any presumption about the NS structure and/or composition. In terms of the small quantities (reduced radius, the energy density and pressure scaled by their central values), we perform double-element perturbative expansions in solving perturbatively the scaled Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff (TOV) equations and analyzing $s^2$ profiles from the Newtonian limit to the general relativistic (GR) case. The GR term in the TOV equations plays a twofold role: it compresses NS matter and modifies the pressure/energy density ratio from small values in Newtonian stars showing no $s^2$ peak to large ones for massive NSs possessing a peak in their $s^2$ profiles, and eventually takes away the peak in extremely compact/massive NSs approaching the causality limit. {In particular, the peaked behavior in $s^2$ is expected to emerge near the center of massive NSs like PSR J0740+6620, while a sharp phase transition is unlikely to occur there.} These features revealed from our analyses are universal as they are intrinsic properties of the GR stellar structure equations independent of the still very uncertain EOS of supradense neutron-rich matter in NSs.</description>

      <title>Zeeman splitting of torsional oscillation frequencies of magnetars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetars form a special class of neutron stars possessing superstrong magnetic fields and demonstrating power flares triggered likely by these fields. Observations of such flares reveal the presence of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) at certain frequencies; they are thought to be excited in the flares. QPOs carry potentially important information on magnetar structure, magnetic field, and mechanisms of magnetar activity. We calculate frequencies of torsional (magneto-elastic) oscillations of the magnetar crust treating the magnetic field effects in the first order of perturbation theory. The theory predicts splitting of non-magnetic oscillation frequencies into Zeeman components. Zeeman splitting of torsional oscillation spectrum of magnetars was suggested, clearly described and estimated by Shaisultanov and Eichler (2009) but their work has not been given considerable attention. To extend it we suggest the technique of calculating oscillation frequencies including Zeeman splitting at not too strong magnetic fields for arbitrary magnetic field configuration. Zeeman splitting enriches the oscillation spectrum and simplifies theoretical interpretation of observations. We calculate several low-frequency oscillations of magnetars with pure dipole magnetic field in the crust. The results qualitatively agree with low-frequency QPOs detected in the hyperflare of SGR 1806--20, and in the giant flare of SGR 1900+14.</description>

      <title>Neutron Stars as the Dark Matter detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been known for quite sometime that the Neutron Stars (NS) can play a role of the Dark Matter (DM) detectors due to many uniques features of NS. We apply these (previously developed) ideas to a specific form of the DM when it is represented by a composite object, rather than by a local fundamental field (such as WIMPs). To be more precise we consider the so-called axion quark nuggets (AQN) dark matter model, when the ``non-baryonic" dark matter in fact is made of quarks and gluons which are in dense quark phase (similar to the old idea of the Witten's strangelets). We argue that the interaction of the AQNs with NS material may lead to many profound observable effects, which dramatically different from conventional picture when DM particles are represented by weakly interacting WIMPs. In particular, we argue that the AQNs may serve as the triggers for the magnetic reconnection to heat the NS surface. This effect may strongly alleviate (or even completely remove) the observed inconsistencies between the predicted and observed surface temperatures for many old NS. This heating mechanism is always accompanied by the hard X ray emission, which may serve as an indicator of the proposed mechanism.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic observations of progenitor activity 100 days before a Type Ibn supernova</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15148v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Obtaining spectroscopic observations of the progenitors of core-collapse supernovae is often unfeasible due to an inherent lack of knowledge as to which stars will go supernova and when they will explode. In this letter, we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the progenitor activity of SN 2023fyq in the preceding 150 days before the He-rich progenitor exploded as a Type Ibn supernova. The progenitor of SN 2023fyq shows an exponential rise in flux prior to core-collapse. Complex He I emission line features are observed, with a P-Cygni like profile, as well as an evolving broad base with velocities on the order of 10,000 km/s, possibly due to electron scattering. The luminosity and evolution of SN 2023fyq are consistent with a faint Type Ibn, reaching a peak r-band magnitude of 18.1 mag, although there is some uncertainty in the distance to the host, NGC 4388, located in the Virgo cluster. We present additional evidence of asymmetric He-rich material being present prior to the explosion of SN 2023fyq, as well as after, suggesting this material has survived the ejecta-CSM interaction. Broad [O I] and the Ca II triplet lines are observed at late phases, confirming that SN 2023fyq was a genuine supernova rather than a non-terminal interacting transient. SN 2023fyq provides insight into the final moments of a massive star's life, highlighting that the progenitor is likely highly unstable before core-collapse.</description>

      <title>Contribution of Population III Stars to Merging Binary Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04389v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A large number of mergers of binary black holes (BHs) have been discovered by gravitational wave observations since the first detection of gravitational waves 2015. Binary BH mergers are the loudest events in the universe, however their origin(s) have been under debate. There have been many suggestions for merging binary BHs. Isolated binary stars are one of the most promising origins. We have investigated the evolution of isolated binary stars ranging from zero metallicity (Population III stars or Pop III stars) to the solar metallicity by means of so-called rapid binary population synthesis simulation. We have found that binary BHs formed from isolated binary stars reproduce the redshift evolution of the merger rate density and the distribution of primary BH masses and mass ratios inferred by Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog 3 (GWTC-3). Pop III stars have a crucial role in forming merging binary BHs in so-called the pair instability mass gap. Note that we choose the conventional prescription of pair instability mass loss, based on the standard $^{12}$C($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^{16}$O reaction rate. Finally, we have shown the redshift evolution of the rate density of pair instability supernovae, and have predicted that a few pair instability supernovae would be discovered in the next few years. The discoveries would validate our results of merging binary BHs.</description>

      <title>SN 2023zaw: an ultra-stripped, nickel-poor supernova from a low-mass progenitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present SN 2023zaw $-$ a sub-luminous ($\mathrm{M_r} = -16.7$ mag) and rapidly-evolving supernova ($\mathrm{t_{1/2,r}} = 4.9$ days), with the lowest nickel mass ($\approx0.002$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$) measured among all stripped-envelope supernovae discovered to date. The photospheric spectra are dominated by broad He I and Ca NIR emission lines with velocities of $\sim10\ 000 - 12\ 000$ $\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$. The late-time spectra show prominent narrow He I emission lines at $\sim$1000$\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$, indicative of interaction with He-rich circumstellar material. SN 2023zaw is located in the spiral arm of a star-forming galaxy. We perform radiation-hydrodynamical and analytical modeling of the lightcurve by fitting with a combination of shock-cooling emission and nickel decay. The progenitor has a best-fit envelope mass of $\approx0.2$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and an envelope radius of $\approx50$ $\mathrm{R_\odot}$. The extremely low nickel mass and low ejecta mass ($\approx0.5$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$) suggest an ultra-stripped SN, which originates from a mass-losing low mass He-star (ZAMS mass $&lt;$ 10 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$) in a close binary system. This is a channel to form double neutron star systems, whose merger is detectable with LIGO. SN 2023zaw underscores the existence of a previously undiscovered population of extremely low nickel mass ($&lt; 0.005$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$) stripped-envelope supernovae, which can be explored with deep and high-cadence transient surveys.</description>
