      <title>Reconstructing simplicial complexes from evolutionary games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In distributed systems, knowledge of the network structure of the connections among the unitary components is often a requirement for an accurate prediction of the emerging collective dynamics. However, in many real-world situations, one has, at best, access to partial connectivity data, and therefore the entire graph structure needs to be reconstructed from a limited number of observations of the dynamical processes that take place on it. While existing studies predominantly focused on reconstructing traditional pairwise networks, higher-order interactions remain largely unexplored. Here, we introduce three methods to reconstruct a simplicial complex structure of connection from observations of evolutionary games that take place on it, and demonstrate their high accuracy and excellent overall performance in synthetic and empirical complexes. The methods have different requirements and different complexity, thereby constituting a series of approaches from which one can pick the most appropriate one given the specific circumstances of the application under study.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph reconstruction from dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00078v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A plethora of methods have been developed in the past two decades to infer the underlying network structure of an interconnected system from its collective dynamics. However, methods capable of inferring nonpairwise interactions are only starting to appear. Here, we develop an inference algorithm based on sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) to reconstruct hypergraphs and simplicial complexes from time-series data. Our model-free method does not require information about node dynamics or coupling functions, making it applicable to complex systems that do not have a reliable mathematical description. We first benchmark the new method on synthetic data generated from Kuramoto and Lorenz dynamics. We then use it to infer the effective connectivity in the brain from resting-state EEG data, which reveals significant contributions from non-pairwise interactions in shaping the macroscopic brain dynamics.</description>

      <title>Indirect punishment can outperform direct punishment in promoting cooperation in structured populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Indirect punishment traditionally sustains cooperation in social systems through reputation or norms, often by reducing defectors' payoffs indirectly. In this study, we redefine indirect punishment for structured populations as a spatially explicit mechanism, where individuals on a square lattice target second-order defectors--those harming their neighbors--rather than their own immediate defectors, guided by the principle: "I help you by punishing those who defect against you". Using evolutionary simulations, we compare this adapted indirect punishment to direct punishment, where individuals punish immediate defectors. Results show that within a narrow range of low punishment costs and fines, adapted indirect punishment outperforms direct punishment in promoting cooperation. However, outside this cost-fine region, outcomes vary: direct punishment may excel, both may be equally effective, or neither improves cooperation, depending on the parameter values. These findings hold even when network reciprocity alone does not support cooperation. Notably, when adapted indirect punishment outperforms direct punishment in promoting cooperation, defectors face stricter penalties without appreciably increasing punishers' costs, making it more efficient than direct punishment. Overall, our findings provide insights into the role of indirect punishment in structured populations and highlight its importance in understanding the evolution of cooperation.</description>

      <title>Uncertain research country rankings. Should we continue producing uncertain rankings?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17560v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Citation-based assessments of countries' research capabilities often misrepresent their ability to achieve breakthrough advancements. These assessments commonly classify Japan as a developing country, which contradicts its prominent scientific standing. The purpose of this study is to investigate the underlying causes of such inaccurate assessments and to propose methods for conducting more reliable evaluations. Design/methodology/approach: The study evaluates the effectiveness of top-percentile citation metrics as indicators of breakthrough research. Using case studies of selected countries and research topics, the study examines how deviations from lognormal citation distributions impact the accuracy of these percentile indicators. A similar analysis is conducted using university data from the Leiden Ranking to investigate citation distribution deviations at the institutional level. Findings: The study finds that inflated lower tails in citation distributions lead to undervaluation of research capabilities in advanced technological countries, as captured by some percentile indicators. Conversely, research-intensive universities exhibit the opposite trend: a reduced lower tail relative to the upper tail, which causes percentile indicators to overestimate their actual research capacity. Research limitations: The descriptions are mathematical facts that are self-evident. Practical implications: Due to variations in citation patterns across countries and institutions, the Ptop 10%/P and Ptop 1%/P ratios are not universal predictors of breakthrough research. Evaluations should move away from these metrics. Relying on inappropriate citation-based measures could lead to poor decision-making in research policy, undermining the effectiveness of research strategies and their outcomes.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Meteorological Factors on Crop Price Volatility in India: Case studies of Soybean and Brinjal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Climate is an evolving complex system with dynamic interactions and non-linear feedback mechanisms, shaping environmental and socio-economic outcomes. Crop production is highly sensitive to such climatic fluctuations. This paper studies the price volatility of agricultural crops as influenced by meteorological variables (and many other environmental, social and governance factors), which is a critical challenge in sustainable finance, agricultural planning, and policy-making. As case studies, we choose the two Indian states of Madhya Pradesh (for Soybean) and Odisha (for Brinjal). We employ an Exponential Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (EGARCH) model to estimate the conditional volatility of the log returns of crop prices from 2012 to 2024. This study further explores the cross-correlations between volatility and the meteorological variables. Further, a Granger-causality test is carried out to analyze the causal effect of meteorological variables on the price volatility. Finally, the Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous Regressors (SARIMAX) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models are implemented as simple machine learning models of price volatility with meteorological factors as exogenous variables. We believe that this will illustrate the usefulness of simple machine learning models in agricultural finance, and help the farmers to make informed decisions by considering climate patterns and making beneficial decisions with regard to crop rotation or allocations. In general, incorporating meteorological factors to assess agricultural performance could help to understand and reduce price volatility and possibly lead to economic stability.</description>
