      <title>Three-Dimensional Spiral Beam Injection:Design Principles and Experimental Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A proof of principle experiment of Three-dimensional spiral beam injection scheme has been carried out. This injection scheme requires a strongly x-y coupled beam to meet magnetic field distribution through solenoid magnet fringe field. In this paper, we introduce outline of experimental setup, results of x-y coupling adjustment with DC electron beam of 80 keV. The results of this experiment will be evaluated and improvements for actual operation will be discussed.</description>

      <title>High-intensity LINACS: Dynamics, Instabilities and Mitigations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this lecture we discuss the intensity limitations in hadron LINACs. First, we will detail what are the two main meanings of intensity limitations as they differ substantially between high power LINACs and high brightness LINACs. Then we will illustrate in detail the building blocks of hadron linacs focusing on the beam dynamics. We will conclude with few examples of intensity limitations and their mitigations.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Brazing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First, we describe vacuum brazing and vacuum soldering. Then, we demonstrate how vacuum assists in reducing specific metal oxides, significantly enhancing the wetting of the braze material. Examples of metal-to-metal brazing and soldering are provided. The brazing of large accelerating cavities, specifically Radio Frequency Quadrupoles (RFQ), is then explained in more detail to present a comprehensive procedure tailored for high-precision, large-scale assemblies. Finally, we discuss the process of brazing ceramics using both techniques: with metallisation and with active brazing alloy.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the interaction geometry of inverse Compton scattering x-ray sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inverse Compton scattering (ICS) is a promising method for generating coherent and tunable x-rays in a compact setup. In this paper, we present a theoretical framework describing the output of an ICS x-ray source for arbitrary interaction angles between pulsed electron and laser beams. This allows for analytic optimization of the x-ray beam properties by varying the parameters defining the geometry. In general, different x-ray applications require optimization of different x-ray beam properties, such as energy spread for x-ray spectroscopy and angular spread for x-ray scattering measurements. In this paper, we restrict ourselves to optimization of the x-ray brilliance, which is a comprehensive figure of merit for x-ray beam quality. We investigate two specific ICS interaction geometries in particular: head-on scattering of a laser beam off an electron beam; and scattering of a laser beam off an electron beam in a co-propagating geometry, interacting under a grazing angle. For head-on scattering we show that a tightly focused, cylindrically symmetric laser pulse, which balances laser intensity and interaction time, optimizes the x-ray brilliance. For a co-propagating, grazing angle geometry, an elliptical focus of the laser pulse is required to mitigate the effect of a reduced interaction time. We find that the latter geometry is especially useful for soft x-ray generation.</description>
