      <description>arXiv:2411.09716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider equilibrium one-on-one conversations between neighbors on a circular table, with the goal of assessing the likelihood of a (perhaps) familiar situation: sitting at a table where both of your neighbors are talking to someone else. When $n$ people in a circle randomly prefer their left or right neighbor, we show that the probability a given person is unmatched in equilibrium (i.e., in a stable matching) is $$\frac{1}{9} + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n\left(\frac{2n}{3} - \frac{8}{9} + \frac{2}{n}\right)$$ for odd $n$ and $$\frac{1}{9} - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n\left(\frac{2n}{3} - \frac{8}{9}\right)$$ for even $n$. This probability approaches $1/9$ as $n\rightarrow \infty$. We also show that the probability \textit{every} person is matched in equilibrium is $0$ for odd $n$ and $\frac{3^{n/2}-1}{2^{n-1}}$ for even $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By establishing the regularity estimates for nonlocal Stein/Poisson equations under $\gamma$-order H\"older and dissipative conditions on the coefficients, we derive the $W_{\bf d}$-convergence rate for the Euler-Maruyama schemes applied to the invariant measure of SDEs driven by multiplicative $\alpha$-stable noises with $\alpha \in (\frac{1}{2}, 2)$, where $W_{\bf d}$ denotes the Wasserstein metric with ${\bf d}(x,y)=|x-y|^\gamma\wedge 1$ and $\gamma \in ((1-\alpha)_+, 1]$.</description>

      <title>Occupation times on the legs of a diffusion spider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the joint moments of occupation times on the legs of a diffusion spider. Specifically, we give a recursive formula for the Laplace transform of the joint moments, which extends earlier results for a one-dimensional diffusion. For a Bessel spider, of which the Brownian spider is a special case, our approach yields an explicit formula for the joint moments of the occupation times.</description>

      <title>A Study in Markov Chains, Loop-Erased Random Walk and Loop Soups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we make a few random explorations that relate directly to the items mentioned in the title. We define transient chains and recurrent chains with "killing", the Green's function, the Laplacian operator, and harmonic functions. We then introduce the loop-erased random walk (LERW) and its relationship with the uniform spanning tree (UST). We finish by introducing loop measures and soups and defining the "growing loop" model.</description>

      <title>Long-range one-dimensional internal diffusion-limited aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study internal diffusion limited aggregation on $\mathbb{Z}$, where a cluster is grown by sequentially adding the first site outside the cluster visited by each random walk dispatched from the origin. We assume that the increment distribution $X$ of the driving random walks has $\mathbb{E} X =0$, but may be neither simple nor symmetric, and can have $\mathbb{E} (X^2) = \infty$, for example. For the case where $\mathbb{E} (X^2) &lt; \infty$, we prove that after $m$ walks have been dispatched, all but $o(m)$ sites in the cluster form an approximately symmetric contiguous block around the origin. This extends known results for simple random walk. On the other hand, if~$X$ is in the domain of attraction of a symmetric $\alpha$-stable law, $1 &lt; \alpha &lt;2$, we prove that the cluster contains a contiguous block of $\delta m +o(m)$ sites, where $0 &lt; \delta &lt; 1$, but, unlike the finite-variance case, one may not take $\delta=1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the classical regularity theory of optimal transport to non-optimal transport maps generated by heat flow for perturbations of Gaussian measures. Considering probability measures of the form $d\mu(x) = \exp\left(-\frac{|x|^2}{2} + a(x)\right)dx$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ where $a$ has H\"older regularity $C^\beta$ with $\beta\geq 0$; we show that the Langevin map transporting the $d$-dimensional Gaussian distribution onto $\mu$ achieves H\"older regularity $C^{\beta + 1}$, up to a logarithmic factor. We additionally present applications of this result to functional inequalities and generative modelling.</description>

      <title>A-localized states for clock models on trees and their extremal decomposition into glassy states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider $\mathbb{Z}_q$-valued clock models on a regular tree, for general classes of ferromagnetic nearest neighbor interactions which have a discrete rotational symmetry. It has been proved recently that, at strong enough coupling, families of homogeneous Markov chain Gibbs states $\mu_A$ coexist whose single-site marginals concentrate on $A\subset \mathbb{Z}_q$, and which are not convex combinations of each other [AbHeKuMa24]. In this note, we aim at a description of the extremal decomposition of $\mu_A$ for $|A|\geq 2$ into all extremal Gibbs measures, which may be spatially inhomogeneous. First, we show that in regimes of very strong coupling, $\mu_A$ is not extremal. Moreover, $\mu_A$ possesses a single-site reconstruction property which holds for spin values sent from the origin to infinity, when these initial values are chosen from $A$. As our main result, we show that $\mu_A$ decomposes into uncountably many extremal inhomogeneous states. The proof is based on multi-site reconstruction which allows to derive concentration properties of branch overlaps. Our method is based on a new good site/bad site decomposition adapted to the $A$-localization property, together with a coarse graining argument in local state space.</description>

      <title>Parking on a random rooted binary tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the parking process on a uniform random rooted binary tree with $n$ vertices. Viewing each vertex as a single parking space, a random number of cars independently arrive at and attempt to park on each vertex one at a time. If a car attempts to park on an occupied vertex, it traverses the unique path on the tree towards the root, parking at the first empty vertex it encounters. If this is not possible, the car exits the tree at the root.
  We shall investigate the limit of the probability of the event that all cars can park when $\lfloor \alpha n \rfloor$ cars arrive, with $\alpha &gt; 0$. We find that there is a phase transition at $\alpha_c = 2 - \sqrt{2}$, with this event having positive limiting probability when $\alpha &lt; \alpha_c$, and the probability tending to 0 as $n \rightarrow \infty$ for $\alpha &gt; \alpha_c$.
  This is analogous to the work done by Goldschmidt and Przykucki (arXiv:1610.08786) and Goldschmidt and Chen (arXiv:1911.03816), while agreeing with the general result proven by Curien and H\'enard (arXiv:2205.15932).</description>

      <title>Planar Novikov-Shubin invariant for adjacency matrices of structured directed dense random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Novikov-Shubin invariant associated to a graph provides information about the accumulation of eigenvalues of the corresponding adjacency matrix close to the origin. For a directed graph these eigenvalues lie in the complex plane and having a finite value for the planar Novikov-Shubin invariant indicates a polynomial behaviour of the eigenvalue density as a function of the distance to zero. We provide a complete description of these invariants for dense random digraphs with constant batch sizes, i.e. for the directed stochastic block model. The invariants depend only on which batches in the graph are connected by non-zero edge densities. We present an explicit finite step algorithm for their computation. For the proof we identify the asymptotic spectral density with the distribution of a $\mathbb{C}^K$-valued circular element in operator-valued free probability theory. We determine the spectral density in the bulk regime by solving the associated Dyson equation and infer the singular behaviour of this density close to the origin by determining the exponents associated to the power law with which the resolvent entries of the adjacency matrix that corresponds to the individual batches diverge to infinity or converge to zero.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Mixing of the critical Glauber Dynamics for the Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we prove that on any graph of maximal degree $d$ the mixing time of the Glauber Dynamics for the Ising Model at $\beta_c=\tanh^{-1}(\frac1{d-1})$, the uniqueness threshold on the infinite $d$-regular tree, is at most polynomial in $n$. The proof follows by a simple combination of new log-Sobolev bounds of Bauerschmidt and Dagallier, together with the tree of self avoiding walks construction of Weitz. While preparing this note we became aware that Chen, Chen, Yin and Zhang recently posted another proof of this result. We believe the simplicity of our argument is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Subcritical annulus crossing in spatial random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider general continuum percolation models obeying sparseness, translation invariance, and spatial decorrelation. In particular, this includes models constructed on general point sets other than the standard Poisson point process or the Bernoulli-percolated lattice. Moreover, in our setting the existence of an edge may depend not only on the two end vertices but also on a surrounding vertex set and models are included that are not monotone in some of their parameters. We study the critical annulus-crossing intensity $\widehat{\lambda}_{c}$, which is smaller or equal to the classical critical percolation intensity $\lambda_{c}$ and derive a condition for $\widehat{\lambda}_{c}&gt;0$ by relating the crossing of annuli to the occurrence of long edges. This condition is sharp for models that have a modicum of independence. In a nutshell, our result states that annuli are either not crossed for small intensities or crossed by a single edge. Our proof rests on a multiscale argument that further allows us to directly describe the decay of the annulus-crossing probability with the decay of long edges probabilities.
  We apply our result to a number of examples from the literature. Most importantly, we extensively discuss the weight-dependent random connection model in a generalised version, for which we derive sufficient conditions for the presence or absence of long edges that are typically easy to check. These conditions are built on a decay coefficient $\zeta$ that has recently seen some attention due to its importance for various proofs of global graph properties.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds on the top Lyapunov exponent for linear PDEs driven by the 2D stochastic Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the top Lyapunov exponent associated to the advection-diffusion and linearised Navier-Stokes equations on the two-dimensional torus. The velocity field is given by the stochastic Navier-Stokes equations driven by a non-degenerate white-in-time noise with a power-law correlation structure. We show that the top Lyapunov exponent is bounded from below by a negative power of the diffusion parameter. This partially answers a conjecture of Doering and Miles and provides a first lower bound on the Batchelor scale in terms of the diffusivity. The proof relies on a robust analysis of the projective process associated to the linear equation, through its spectral median dynamics. We introduce a probabilistic argument to show that high-frequency states for the projective process are unstable under stochastic perturbations, leading to a Lyapunov drift condition and quantitative-in-diffusivity estimates.</description>

      <title>Integrating Fuzzy Set Theory with Pandora Temporal Fault Trees for Dynamic Failure Analysis of Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pandora temporal fault tree, as one notable extension of the fault tree, introduces temporal gates and temporal laws. Pandora Temporal Fault Tree(TFT) enhances the capability of fault trees and enables the modeling of system failure behavior that depends on sequences. The calculation of system failure probability in Pandora TFT relies on precise probabilistic information on component failures. However, obtaining such precise failure data can often be challenging. The data may be uncertain as historical records are used to derive failure data for system components. To mitigate this uncertainty, in this study, we proposed a method that integrates fuzzy set theory with Pandora TFT. This integration aims to enable dynamic analysis of complex systems, even in cases where quantitative failure data of components is unreliable or imprecise. The proposed work introduces the development of Fuzzy AND, Fuzzy OR, Fuzzy PAND, and Fuzzy POR logic gates for Pandora TFT. We also introduce a fuzzy importance measure for criticality analysis of basic events. All events in our analysis are assumed to have exponentially distributed failures, with their failure rates represented as triangular fuzzy numbers. We illustrate the proposed method through a case study of the Aircraft Fuel Distribution System (AFDS), highlighting its practical application and effectiveness in analyzing complex systems. The results are compared with existing results from Petri net and Bayesian network techniques to validate the findings.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on the effect of risk sharing and diversification for infinite mean risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The basic principle of any version of insurance is the paradigm that exchanging risk by sharing it in a pool is beneficial for the participants. In case of independent risks with a finite mean this is the case for risk averse decision makers. The situation may be very different in case of infinite mean models. In that case it is known that risk sharing may have a negative effect, which is sometimes called the nondiversification trap. This phenomenon is well known for infinite mean stable distributions. In a series of recent papers similar results for infinite mean Pareto and Fr\'echet distributions have been obtained. We further investigate this property by showing that many of these results can be obtained as special cases of a simple result demonstrating that this holds for any distribution that is more skewed than a Cauchy distribution. We also relate this to the situation of deadly catastrophic risks, where we assume a positive probability for an infinite value. That case gives a very simple intuition why this phenomenon can occur for such catastrophic risks. We also mention several open problems and conjectures in this context.</description>

      <title>A Random Process Model Useful for Describing Radar Clutter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the theory of Bernstein functions, completely monotonic functions, and Levy processes to define a positive random process $\tau(t)$. For radar clutter one may think of $\tau(t)$ as the instantaneous power of the scattered radar signal that is described by a compound-Gaussian model. Thus the results herein give a mechanism for defining and simulating a compound-Gaussian random process that can be used in various radar studies. We give several examples of the sample paths of this process.</description>

      <title>On fluctuations of Coulomb systems and universality of the Heine distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of external potentials on the complex plane $\mathbb{C}$ for which the coincidence set to the obstacle problem contains a Jordan curve in the exterior of the droplet. We refer to this curve as a spectral outpost. We study the corresponding Coulomb gas at $\beta=2$. Generalizing recent work in the radially symmetric case, we prove that the number of particles which fall near the spectral outpost has an asymptotic Heine distribution, as the number of particles $n\to\infty$.We also consider a class of potentials with disconnected droplets whose connected components are separated by a ring-shaped spectral gap. We prove that the fluctuations of the number of particles that fall near a given component has an asymptotic discrete normal distribution, which depends on $n$. For the case of disconnected droplets we also consider fluctuations of general smooth linear statistics and show that they tend to distribute as the sum of a Gaussian field and an independent, oscillatory, discrete Gaussian field.

      <description>arXiv:2411.10295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A self-interacting dynamics that mimics the standard Consensus-Based Optimization (CBO) model is introduced. This single-particle dynamics is shown to converge to a unique invariant measure that approximates the global minimum of a given function. As an application, its connection to CBO with Personal Best introduced by C. Totzeck and M.-T. Wolfram (Math. Biosci. Eng., 2020) has been established.</description>

      <title>A weak formulation of free boundary problems and its application to hydrodynamic limits of particle systems with selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.07535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.07535v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A weak formulation for a class of parabolic free boundary problems (FBP) is proposed that does not involve the notion of a free boundary but reduces to a FBP when classical solutions exist. It is aimed at hydrodynamic limits (HDL) of particle systems with selection in circumstances where the macroscopic model does not possess (or is hard to prove to possess) a regular free boundary in the classical sense. The formulation involves the macroscopic density of particles and a measure that accounts for selection. It consists of a second order parabolic equation satisfied by the density and driven by the measure, coupled with a complementarity condition satisfied by the density-measure pair. The approach is applied to an injection-branching-selection particle system of diffusion on $\R$ under arbitrarily varying injection and removal rates, for which the corresponding FBP is not in general known to be classically solvable. The HDL is characterized as the unique solution to the weak formulation. The proof of convergence is based on PDE uniqueness, which in turn relies on the barrier method.</description>

      <title>Theory on new fractional operators using normalization and probability tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06198v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how a rescaling of fractional operators with bounded kernels may help circumvent their documented deficiencies, for example, the inconsistency at zero or the lack of inverse integral operator. On the other hand, we build a novel class of linear operators with memory effects to extend the L-fractional and the ordinary derivatives, using probability tools. A Mittag-Leffler-type function is introduced to solve linear problems, and nonlinear equations are addressed with power series, illustrating the methods for the SIR epidemic model. The inverse operator is constructed, and a fundamental theorem of calculus and an existence-and-uniqueness result for differintegral equations are proved. A conjecture on deconvolution is raised, that would permit completing the proposed theory.</description>

      <title>Littlewood-Offord problems for the Curie-Weiss models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Littlewood-Offord problems in one dimension for the Curie-Weiss models. Let \[Q_n^{+}:=\sup_{x\in\mathbb{R}}\sup_{v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n\geq 1}P(\sum_{i=1}^{n}v_i\varepsilon_i\in(x-1,x+1)),\] \[Q_n=\sup_{x\in\mathbb{R}}\sup_{|v_1|,|v_2|,\ldots,|v_n|\geq 1}P(\sum_{i=1}^{n}v_i\varepsilon_i\in(x-1,x+1))\] where the random variables $(\varepsilon_i)_{1\leq i\leq n}$ are spins in Curie-Weiss models. We calculate the asymptotic properties of $Q_n^{+}$ and $Q_n$ as $n\to\infty$ and observe the phenomena of phase transitions. Meanwhile, we also get that $Q_n^{+}$ is attained when $v_1=v_2=\cdots=v_n=1$. And $Q_n$ is attained when one half of $(v_i)_{1\leq i\leq n}$ equals to $1$ and the other half equals to $-1$ when $n$ is even.This is a generalization of classical Littlewood-Offord problems from Rademacher random variables to possibly dependent random variables. In particular, it includes the case of general independent and identically distributed Bernoulli random variables.</description>

      <title>A Kesten Stigum theorem for Galton-Watson processes with infinitely many types in a random environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a Galton-Watson process $(Z_n)$ with infinitely many types in a random ergodic environment $\bar{\xi}=(\xi_n)_{n\geq 0}$. We focus on the supercritical regime of the process, where the quenched average of the size of the population grows exponentially fast to infinity. We work under Doeblin-type assumptions coming from a previous paper, which ensure that the quenched mean semi group of $(Z_n)$ satisfies some ergodicity property and admits a $\bar{\xi}$-measurable family of space-time harmonic functions. We use these properties to derive an associated nonnegative martingale $(W_n)$. Under a $L\log(L)^{1+\varepsilon}$-integrabilty assumption on the offspring distribution, we prove that the almost sure limit $W$ of the martingale $(W_n)$ is not degenerate. Assuming some uniform $L^2$-integrability of the offspring distribution, we prove that conditionally on $\{W&gt;0\}$, at a large time $n$, both the size of the population and the distribution of types correspond to those of the quenched mean of the population $\mathbb{E}[Z_n|\bar{\xi}, Z_0]$.
  We finally introduce an example of a process modelling a population with a discrete age structure. In this context, we provide more tractable criterions which guarantee our various assumptions are met.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Dirichlet Forms for MCMC Optimal Scaling with Dependent Target Distributions on Large Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.17042v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms have played a significant role in statistics, physics, machine learning and others, and they are the only known general and efficient approach for some high-dimensional problems. The random walk Metropolis (RWM) algorithm as the most classical MCMC algorithm, has had a great influence on the development and practice of science and engineering. The behavior of the RWM algorithm in high-dimensional problems is typically investigated through a weak convergence result of diffusion processes. In this paper, we utilize the Mosco convergence of Dirichlet forms in analyzing the RWM algorithm on large graphs, whose target distribution is the Gibbs measure that includes any probability measure satisfying a Markov property. The abstract and powerful theory of Dirichlet forms allows us to work directly and naturally on the infinite-dimensional space, and our notion of Mosco convergence allows Dirichlet forms associated with the RWM chains to lie on changing Hilbert spaces. Through the optimal scaling problem, we demonstrate the impressive strengths of the Dirichlet form approach over the standard diffusion approach.</description>

      <title>On the interplay between pricing, competition and QoS in ride-hailing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse a non-cooperative game between two competing ride-hailing platforms, each of which is modeled as a two-sided queueing system, where drivers (with a limited level of patience) are assumed to arrive according to a Poisson process at a fixed rate, while the arrival process of (price-sensitive) passengers is split across the two platforms based on Quality of Service (QoS) considerations. As a benchmark, we also consider a monopolistic scenario, where each platform gets half the market share irrespective of its pricing strategy. The key novelty of our formulation is that the total market share is fixed across the platforms. The game thus captures the competition between the platforms over market share, with pricing being the lever used by each platform to influence its share of the market. The market share split is modeled via two different QoS metrics: (i) probability that an arriving passenger obtains a ride, and (ii) the average passenger pick-up time. The platform aims to maximize the rate of revenue generated from matching drivers and passengers.
  In each of the above settings, we analyse the equilibria associated with the game in certain limiting regimes. We also show that these equilibria remain relevant in the more practically meaningful 'pre-limit.' Interestingly, we show that for a certain range of system parameters, no pure Nash equilibrium exists. Instead, we demonstrate a novel solution concept called an \textit{equilibrium cycle}, which has interesting dynamic connotations. Our results highlight the interplay between competition, passenger-side price sensitivity, and passenger/driver arrival rates.</description>

      <title>An "Opinion Reproduction Number" for Infodemics in a Bounded-Confidence Content-Spreading Process on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the spreading dynamics of content on networks. To do this, we use a model in which content spreads through a bounded-confidence mechanism. In a bounded-confidence model (BCM) of opinion dynamics, the agents of a network have continuous-valued opinions, which they adjust when they interact with agents whose opinions are sufficiently close to theirs. The employed content-spreading model introduces a twist into BCMs by using bounded confidence for the content spread itself. We define an analogue of the basic reproduction number from disease dynamics that we call an \emph{opinion reproduction number}. A critical value of the opinion reproduction number indicates whether or not there is an ``infodemic'' (i.e., a large content-spreading cascade) of content that reflects a particular opinion. By determining this critical value, one can determine whether or not an opinion dies off or propagates widely as a cascade in a population of agents. Using configuration-model networks, we quantify the size and shape of content dissemination by calculating a variety of summary statistics, and we illustrate how network structure and spreading-model parameters affect these statistics. We find that content spreads most widely when the agents have a large expected mean degree or a large receptiveness to content. When the spreading process slightly exceeds the infodemic threshold, there can be longer dissemination trees than when the expected mean degree or receptiveness are larger, even though the total number of content shares is smaller.</description>

      <title>On the chaotic behavior of the Lagrangian flow of the 2D Navier-Stokes system with bounded degenerate noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a fluid governed by the randomly forced 2D Navier-Stokes system. It is assumed that the force is bounded, acts directly only on a small number of Fourier modes, and satisfies some natural decomposability and observability properties. Under these assumptions, we show that the Lagrangian flow associated with the random fluid exhibits chaotic behavior characterized by the strict positivity of the top Lyapunov exponent. To achieve this, we introduce a new abstract result that allows to derive positivity of the top Lyapunov exponent from controllability properties of the underlying deterministic system.</description>
