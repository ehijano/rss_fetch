      <title>Label-free pathological subtyping of non-small cell lung cancer using deep classification and virtual immunohistochemical staining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The differentiation between pathological subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is an essential step in guiding treatment options and prognosis. However, current clinical practice relies on multi-step staining and labelling processes that are time-intensive and costly, requiring highly specialised expertise. In this study, we propose a label-free methodology that facilitates autofluorescence imaging of unstained NSCLC samples and deep learning (DL) techniques to distinguish between non-cancerous tissue, adenocarcinoma (AC), squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC), and other subtypes (OS). We conducted DL-based classification and generated virtual immunohistochemical (IHC) stains, including thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) for AC and p40 for SqCC, and evaluated these methods using two types of autofluorescence imaging: intensity imaging and lifetime imaging. The results demonstrate the exceptional ability of this approach for NSCLC subtype differentiation, achieving an area under the curve above 0.981 and 0.996 for binary- and multi-class classification. Furthermore, this approach produces clinical-grade virtual IHC staining which was blind-evaluated by three experienced thoracic pathologists. Our label-free NSCLC subtyping approach enables rapid and accurate diagnosis without conventional tissue processing and staining. Both strategies can significantly accelerate diagnostic workflows and support efficient lung cancer diagnosis, without compromising clinical decision-making.</description>

      <title>In vitro 2 In vivo : Bidirectional and High-Precision Generation of In Vitro and In Vivo Neuronal Spike Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neurons encode information in a binary manner and process complex signals. However, predicting or generating diverse neural activity patterns remains challenging. In vitro and in vivo studies provide distinct advantages, yet no robust computational framework seamlessly integrates both data types. We address this by applying the Transformer model, widely used in large-scale language models, to neural data. To handle binary data, we introduced Dice loss, enabling accurate cross-domain neural activity generation. Structural analysis revealed how Dice loss enhances learning and identified key brain regions facilitating high-precision data generation. Our findings support the 3Rs principle in animal research, particularly Replacement, and establish a mathematical framework bridging animal experiments and human clinical studies. This work advances data-driven neuroscience and neural activity modeling, paving the way for more ethical and effective experimental methodologies.</description>

      <title>Fungicides vs mycoinsecticides in the management of corn leafhopper: physicochemical, in vitro and in vivo compatibilities, and degradation kinetics in maize plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study investigates the compatibility of mycoinsecticides based on isolates IBCB66 and Simbi BB15 of Beauveria bassiana and Esalq-1296 of Cordyceps javanica, which are registered for the management of Dalbulus maidis in Brazil, with synthetic fungicides. Irrespective of the fungicide, a total inhibition in the number of colony-forming units (CFUs), vegetative growth, conidiogenesis, and conidial viability of the three tested isolates was observed, with their incompatibility being indicated in the in vitro bioassays. However, the use of formulated mycoinsecticides mitigated the impact of these xenobiotics on the number of CFUs, with the commercial mycoinsecticide FlyControl (B. bassiana isolate Simbi BB15) being the least sensitive to the fungicides propiconazole + difenoconazole, bixafem + prothioconazole + trifloxystrobin and trifloxystrobin + tebuconazole. Nevertheless, an increase in exposure time (from 1.5 to 3 hours) generally led to an increase in the toxicity of fungicides towards entomopathogens. Physical-chemical compatibility assessments indicated that physical incompatibilities were observed, depending on the mycoinsecticide formulation. In addition, in vivo bioassays employing D. maidis adults demonstrated that, despite a synergistic effect on mortality in certain binary mixtures, no cadavers exposed to such mixtures exhibited fungal extrusion. Furthermore, analyses using UHPLC/MS/MS revealed alterations in the degradation kinetics (k) of the active ingredient (a.i.) pyraclostrobin, with changes greater than tenfold being observed in the different formulations of the fungicides that were tested. Consequently, given the diminished degradation kinetics of the active ingredients in maize plants, the implementation of mycoinsecticides should precede, in isolation, the application of synthetic fungicides within the framework of phytosanitary management of maize crops.</description>

      <title>BioX-CPath: Biologically-driven Explainable Diagnostics for Multistain IHC Computational Pathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of biologically interpretable and explainable models remains a key challenge in computational pathology, particularly for multistain immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis. We present BioX-CPath, an explainable graph neural network architecture for whole slide image (WSI) classification that leverages both spatial and semantic features across multiple stains. At its core, BioX-CPath introduces a novel Stain-Aware Attention Pooling (SAAP) module that generates biologically meaningful, stain-aware patient embeddings. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both Rheumatoid Arthritis and Sjogren's Disease multistain datasets. Beyond performance metrics, BioX-CPath provides interpretable insights through stain attention scores, entropy measures, and stain interaction scores, that permit measuring model alignment with known pathological mechanisms. This biological grounding, combined with strong classification performance, makes BioX-CPath particularly suitable for clinical applications where interpretability is key.

      <title>Two for the Price of One: Integrating Large Language Models to Learn Biophysical Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models have become fundamental tools in drug design. In particular, large language models trained on biochemical sequences learn feature vectors that guide drug discovery through virtual screening. However, such models do not capture the molecular interactions important for binding affinity and specificity. Therefore, there is a need to 'compose' representations from distinct biological modalities to effectively represent molecular complexes. We present an overview of the methods to combine molecular representations and propose that future work should balance computational efficiency and expressiveness. Specifically, we argue that improvements in both speed and accuracy are possible by learning to merge the representations from internal layers of domain specific biological language models. We demonstrate that 'composing' biochemical language models performs similar or better than standard methods representing molecular interactions despite having significantly fewer features. Finally, we discuss recent methods for interpreting and democratizing large language models that could aid the development of interaction aware foundation models for biology, as well as their shortcomings.</description>

      <title>Interactive Databases for the Life Sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past few decades, the life sciences have experienced an unprecedented accumulation of data, ranging from genomic sequences and proteomic profiles to heavy-content imaging, clinical assays, and commercial biological products for research. Traditional static databases have been invaluable in providing standardized and structured information. However, they fall short when it comes to facilitating exploratory data interrogation, real-time query, multidimensional comparison and dynamic visualization. Interactive databases aiming at supporting user-driven data queries and visualization offer promising new avenues for making the best use of the vast and heterogeneous data streams collected in biological research. This article discusses the potential of interactive databases, highlighting the importance of implementing this model in the life sciences, while going through the state-of-the-art in database design, technical choices behind modern data management systems, and emerging needs in multidisciplinary research. Special attention is given to data interrogation strategies, user interface design, and comparative analysis capabilities, along with challenges such as data standardization and scalability in data-heavy applications. Conceptual features for developing interactive databases along diverse life science domains are then presented in the user case of cell line selection for in vitro research to bridge the gap between research data generation, actionable biological insight, subsequent meaningful experimental design, and clinical relevance.</description>

      <title>DBgDel: Database-Enhanced Gene Deletion Framework for Growth-Coupled Production in Genome-Scale Metabolic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08077v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When simulating metabolite productions with genome-scale constraint-based metabolic models, gene deletion strategies are necessary to achieve growth-coupled production, which means cell growth and target metabolite production occur simultaneously. Since obtaining gene deletion strategies for large genome-scale models suffers from significant computational time, it is necessary to develop methods to mitigate this computational burden. In this study, we introduce a novel framework for computing gene deletion strategies. The proposed framework first mines related databases to extract prior information about gene deletions for growth-coupled production. It then integrates the extracted information with downstream algorithms to narrow down the algorithmic search space, resulting in highly efficient calculations on genome-scale models. Computational experiment results demonstrated that our framework can compute stoichiometrically feasible gene deletion strategies for numerous target metabolites, showcasing a noteworthy improvement in computational efficiency. Specifically, our framework achieves an average 6.1-fold acceleration in computational speed compared to existing methods while maintaining a respectable success rate.

      <title>Image segmentation of treated and untreated tumor spheroids by Fully Convolutional Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01105v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS) are advanced cell culture systems for assessing the impact of combinatorial radio(chemo)therapy. They exhibit therapeutically relevant in-vivo-like characteristics from 3D cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions to radial pathophysiological gradients related to proliferative activity and nutrient/oxygen supply, altering cellular radioresponse. State-of-the-art assays quantify long-term curative endpoints based on collected brightfield image time series from large treated spheroid populations per irradiation dose and treatment arm. Here, spheroid control probabilities are documented analogous to in-vivo tumor control probabilities based on Kaplan-Meier curves. This analyses require laborious spheroid segmentation of up to 100.000 images per treatment arm to extract relevant structural information from the images, e.g., diameter, area, volume and circularity. While several image analysis algorithms are available for spheroid segmentation, they all focus on compact MCTS with clearly distinguishable outer rim throughout growth. However, treated MCTS may partly be detached and destroyed and are usually obscured by dead cell debris. We successfully train two Fully Convolutional Networks, UNet and HRNet, and optimize their hyperparameters to develop an automatic segmentation for both untreated and treated MCTS. We systematically validate the automatic segmentation on larger, independent data sets of spheroids derived from two human head-and-neck cancer cell lines. We find an excellent overlap between manual and automatic segmentation for most images, quantified by Jaccard indices at around 90%. For images with smaller overlap of the segmentations, we demonstrate that this error is comparable to the variations across segmentations from different biological experts, suggesting that these images represent biologically unclear or ambiguous cases.</description>
