      <title>CASteer: Steering Diffusion Models for Controllable Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have transformed image generation, yet controlling their outputs for diverse applications, including content moderation and creative customization, remains challenging. Existing approaches usually require task-specific training and struggle to generalize across both concrete (e.g., objects) and abstract (e.g., styles) concepts. We propose CASteer (Cross-Attention Steering) a training-free framework for controllable image generation using steering vectors to influence a diffusion model$'$s hidden representations dynamically. CASteer computes these vectors offline by averaging activations from concept-specific generated images, then applies them during inference via a dynamic heuristic that activates modifications only when necessary, removing concepts from affected images or adding them to unaffected ones. This approach enables precise control over a wide range of tasks, including removing harmful content, adding desired attributes, replacing objects, or altering styles, all without model retraining. CASteer handles both concrete and abstract concepts, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques across multiple diffusion models while preserving unrelated content and minimizing unintended effects.</description>

      <title>V2M4: 4D Mesh Animation Reconstruction from a Single Monocular Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present V2M4, a novel 4D reconstruction method that directly generates a usable 4D mesh animation asset from a single monocular video. Unlike existing approaches that rely on priors from multi-view image and video generation models, our method is based on native 3D mesh generation models. Naively applying 3D mesh generation models to generate a mesh for each frame in a 4D task can lead to issues such as incorrect mesh poses, misalignment of mesh appearance, and inconsistencies in mesh geometry and texture maps. To address these problems, we propose a structured workflow that includes camera search and mesh reposing, condition embedding optimization for mesh appearance refinement, pairwise mesh registration for topology consistency, and global texture map optimization for texture consistency. Our method outputs high-quality 4D animated assets that are compatible with mainstream graphics and game software. Experimental results across a variety of animation types and motion amplitudes demonstrate the generalization and effectiveness of our method.

      <title>Identity Preserving Latent Diffusion for Brain Aging Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural and appearance changes in brain imaging over time are crucial indicators of neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration. The rapid advancement of large-scale generative models provides a promising backbone for modeling these complex global and local changes in brain images, such as transforming the age of a source image to a target age. However, current generative models, typically trained on independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data, may struggle to maintain intra-subject spatiotemporal consistency during transformations. We propose the Identity-Preserving Longitudinal Diffusion Model (IP-LDM), designed to accurately transform brain ages while preserving subject identity. Our approach involves first extracting the identity representation from the source image. Then, conditioned on the target age, the latent diffusion model learns to generate the age-transformed target image. To ensure consistency within the same subject over time, we regularize the identity representation using a triplet contrastive formulation. Our experiments on both elderly and infant brain datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing conditional generative models, producing realistic age transformations while preserving intra-subject identity.</description>

      <title>FPGS: Feed-Forward Semantic-aware Photorealistic Style Transfer of Large-Scale Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present FPGS, a feed-forward photorealistic style transfer method of large-scale radiance fields represented by Gaussian Splatting. FPGS, stylizes large-scale 3D scenes with arbitrary, multiple style reference images without additional optimization while preserving multi-view consistency and real-time rendering speed of 3D Gaussians. Prior arts required tedious per-style optimization or time-consuming per-scene training stage and were limited to small-scale 3D scenes. FPGS efficiently stylizes large-scale 3D scenes by introducing a style-decomposed 3D feature field, which inherits AdaIN's feed-forward stylization machinery, supporting arbitrary style reference images. Furthermore, FPGS supports multi-reference stylization with the semantic correspondence matching and local AdaIN, which adds diverse user control for 3D scene styles. FPGS also preserves multi-view consistency by applying semantic matching and style transfer processes directly onto queried features in 3D space. In experiments, we demonstrate that FPGS achieves favorable photorealistic quality scene stylization for large-scale static and dynamic 3D scenes with diverse reference images.

      <title>Physics-Aware Human-Object Rendering from Sparse Views via 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rendering realistic human-object interactions (HOIs) from sparse-view inputs is challenging due to occlusions and incomplete observations, yet crucial for various real-world applications. Existing methods always struggle with either low rendering qualities (\eg, visual fidelity and physically plausible HOIs) or high computational costs. To address these limitations, we propose HOGS (Human-Object Rendering via 3D Gaussian Splatting), a novel framework for efficient and physically plausible HOI rendering from sparse views. Specifically, HOGS combines 3D Gaussian Splatting with a physics-aware optimization process. It incorporates a Human Pose Refinement module for accurate pose estimation and a Sparse-View Human-Object Contact Prediction module for efficient contact region identification. This combination enables coherent joint rendering of human and object Gaussians while enforcing physically plausible interactions. Extensive experiments on the HODome dataset demonstrate that HOGS achieves superior rendering quality, efficiency, and physical plausibility compared to existing methods. We further show its extensibility to hand-object grasp rendering tasks, presenting its broader applicability to articulated object interactions.</description>

      <title>SANA-Sprint: One-Step Diffusion with Continuous-Time Consistency Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents SANA-Sprint, an efficient diffusion model for ultra-fast text-to-image (T2I) generation. SANA-Sprint is built on a pre-trained foundation model and augmented with hybrid distillation, dramatically reducing inference steps from 20 to 1-4. We introduce three key innovations: (1) We propose a training-free approach that transforms a pre-trained flow-matching model for continuous-time consistency distillation (sCM), eliminating costly training from scratch and achieving high training efficiency. Our hybrid distillation strategy combines sCM with latent adversarial distillation (LADD): sCM ensures alignment with the teacher model, while LADD enhances single-step generation fidelity. (2) SANA-Sprint is a unified step-adaptive model that achieves high-quality generation in 1-4 steps, eliminating step-specific training and improving efficiency. (3) We integrate ControlNet with SANA-Sprint for real-time interactive image generation, enabling instant visual feedback for user interaction. SANA-Sprint establishes a new Pareto frontier in speed-quality tradeoffs, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 7.59 FID and 0.74 GenEval in only 1 step - outperforming FLUX-schnell (7.94 FID / 0.71 GenEval) while being 10x faster (0.1s vs 1.1s on H100). It also achieves 0.1s (T2I) and 0.25s (ControlNet) latency for 1024 x 1024 images on H100, and 0.31s (T2I) on an RTX 4090, showcasing its exceptional efficiency and potential for AI-powered consumer applications (AIPC). Code and pre-trained models will be open-sourced.</description>

      <title>Open-Sora 2.0: Training a Commercial-Level Video Generation Model in $200k</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress in the past year. The quality of AI video continues to improve, but at the cost of larger model size, increased data quantity, and greater demand for training compute. In this report, we present Open-Sora 2.0, a commercial-level video generation model trained for only $200k. With this model, we demonstrate that the cost of training a top-performing video generation model is highly controllable. We detail all techniques that contribute to this efficiency breakthrough, including data curation, model architecture, training strategy, and system optimization. According to human evaluation results and VBench scores, Open-Sora 2.0 is comparable to global leading video generation models including the open-source HunyuanVideo and the closed-source Runway Gen-3 Alpha. By making Open-Sora 2.0 fully open-source, we aim to democratize access to advanced video generation technology, fostering broader innovation and creativity in content creation.

      <description>arXiv:2503.09645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dance serves as a profound and universal expression of human culture, conveying emotions and stories through movements synchronized with music. Although some current works have achieved satisfactory results in the task of single-person dance generation, the field of multi-person dance generation remains relatively novel. In this work, we present a group choreography framework that leverages recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLM) by modeling the group dance generation problem as a sequence-to-sequence translation task. Our framework consists of a tokenizer that transforms continuous features into discrete tokens, and an LLM that is fine-tuned to predict motion tokens given the audio tokens. We show that by proper tokenization of input modalities and careful design of the LLM training strategies, our framework can generate realistic and diverse group dances while maintaining strong music correlation and dancer-wise consistency. Extensive experiments and evaluations demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Semantic Attribute Binding for Free-Lunch Color Control in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have enabled remarkable control over various attributes, yet precise color specification remains a fundamental challenge. Existing approaches, such as ColorPeel, rely on model personalization, requiring additional optimization and limiting flexibility in specifying arbitrary colors. In this work, we introduce ColorWave, a novel training-free approach that achieves exact RGB-level color control in diffusion models without fine-tuning. By systematically analyzing the cross-attention mechanisms within IP-Adapter, we uncover an implicit binding between textual color descriptors and reference image features. Leveraging this insight, our method rewires these bindings to enforce precise color attribution while preserving the generative capabilities of pretrained models. Our approach maintains generation quality and diversity, outperforming prior methods in accuracy and applicability across diverse object categories. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that ColorWave establishes a new paradigm for structured, color-consistent diffusion-based image synthesis.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How does AI connect to the past in conservation? What can 17 years old photos be helpful in a renewed effort of preservation? This research aims to use AI to connect both in a seamless 3D reconstruction of heritage from imagery data taken from Gongfan Palace, Yunlin Taiwan. AI-assisted 3D modeling was used to reconstruct correspondent details across different 3D platforms of 3DGS or NeRF models generated by Postshot or KIRI Engine. Polygon or point models by Zephyr were referred to and assessed in two sets. The results also include AI-assist modeling outcomes in Stable Diffusion and Postshot-based animation. The evolved documenta-tion and interpretation in AI presents a novel arrangement of working processes contributed by new structure and management of resources, formats, and interfaces, as a continuous preservation effort.</description>

      <title>GroomLight: Hybrid Inverse Rendering for Relightable Human Hair Appearance Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present GroomLight, a novel method for relightable hair appearance modeling from multi-view images. Existing hair capture methods struggle to balance photorealistic rendering with relighting capabilities. Analytical material models, while physically grounded, often fail to fully capture appearance details. Conversely, neural rendering approaches excel at view synthesis but generalize poorly to novel lighting conditions. GroomLight addresses this challenge by combining the strengths of both paradigms. It employs an extended hair BSDF model to capture primary light transport and a light-aware residual model to reconstruct the remaining details. We further propose a hybrid inverse rendering pipeline to optimize both components, enabling high-fidelity relighting, view synthesis, and material editing. Extensive evaluations on real-world hair data demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of our method.</description>

      <title>Distilling Diversity and Control in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distilled diffusion models suffer from a critical limitation: reduced sample diversity compared to their base counterparts. In this work, we uncover that despite this diversity loss, distilled models retain the fundamental concept representations of base models. We demonstrate control distillation - where control mechanisms like Concept Sliders and LoRAs trained on base models can be seamlessly transferred to distilled models and vice-versa, effectively distilling control without any retraining. This preservation of representational structure prompted our investigation into the mechanisms of diversity collapse during distillation. To understand how distillation affects diversity, we introduce Diffusion Target (DT) Visualization, an analysis and debugging tool that reveals how models predict final outputs at intermediate steps. Through DT-Visualization, we identify generation artifacts, inconsistencies, and demonstrate that initial diffusion timesteps disproportionately determine output diversity, while later steps primarily refine details. Based on these insights, we introduce diversity distillation - a hybrid inference approach that strategically employs the base model for only the first critical timestep before transitioning to the efficient distilled model. Our experiments demonstrate that this simple modification not only restores the diversity capabilities from base to distilled models but surprisingly exceeds it, while maintaining nearly the computational efficiency of distilled inference, all without requiring additional training or model modifications.

      <title>MACS: Multi-source Audio-to-image Generation with Contextual Significance and Semantic Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Propelled by the breakthrough in deep generative models, audio-to-image generation has emerged as a pivotal cross-model task that converts complex auditory signals into rich visual representations. However, previous works only focus on single-source audio inputs for image generation, ignoring the multi-source characteristic in natural auditory scenes, thus limiting the performance in generating comprehensive visual content. To bridge this gap, a method called MACS is proposed to conduct multi-source audio-to-image generation. This is the first work that explicitly separates multi-source audio to capture the rich audio components before image generation. MACS is a two-stage method. In the first stage, multi-source audio inputs are separated by a weakly supervised method, where the audio and text labels are semantically aligned by casting into a common space using the large pre-trained CLAP model. We introduce a ranking loss to consider the contextual significance of the separated audio signals. In the second stage, efficient image generation is achieved by mapping the separated audio signals to the generation condition using only a trainable adapter and a MLP layer. We preprocess the LLP dataset as the first full multi-source audio-to-image generation benchmark. The experiments are conducted on multi-source, mixed-source, and single-source audio-to-image generation tasks. The proposed MACS outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in 17 of the 21 evaluation indexes on all tasks and delivers superior visual quality. The code will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>ETCH: Generalizing Body Fitting to Clothed Humans via Equivariant Tightness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fitting a body to a 3D clothed human point cloud is a common yet challenging task. Traditional optimization-based approaches use multi-stage pipelines that are sensitive to pose initialization, while recent learning-based methods often struggle with generalization across diverse poses and garment types. We propose Equivariant Tightness Fitting for Clothed Humans, or ETCH, a novel pipeline that estimates cloth-to-body surface mapping through locally approximate SE(3) equivariance, encoding tightness as displacement vectors from the cloth surface to the underlying body. Following this mapping, pose-invariant body features regress sparse body markers, simplifying clothed human fitting into an inner-body marker fitting task. Extensive experiments on CAPE and 4D-Dress show that ETCH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods -- both tightness-agnostic and tightness-aware -- in body fitting accuracy on loose clothing (16.7% ~ 69.5%) and shape accuracy (average 49.9%). Our equivariant tightness design can even reduce directional errors by (67.2% ~ 89.8%) in one-shot (or out-of-distribution) settings. Qualitative results demonstrate strong generalization of ETCH, regardless of challenging poses, unseen shapes, loose clothing, and non-rigid dynamics. We will release the code and models soon for research purposes at https://boqian-li.github.io/ETCH/.</description>

      <title>Bokeh Diffusion: Defocus Blur Control in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image models have revolutionized creative fields by generating visually captivating outputs from textual prompts; however, while traditional photography offers precise control over camera settings to shape visual aesthetics -- such as depth-of-field -- current diffusion models typically rely on prompt engineering to mimic such effects. This approach often results in crude approximations and inadvertently altering the scene content. In this work, we propose Bokeh Diffusion, a scene-consistent bokeh control framework that explicitly conditions a diffusion model on a physical defocus blur parameter. By grounding depth-of-field adjustments, our method preserves the underlying scene structure as the level of blur is varied. To overcome the scarcity of paired real-world images captured under different camera settings, we introduce a hybrid training pipeline that aligns in-the-wild images with synthetic blur augmentations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only achieves flexible, lens-like blur control but also supports applications such as real image editing via inversion.</description>

      <title>SplatAD: Real-Time Lidar and Camera Rendering with 3D Gaussian Splatting for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16816v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring the safety of autonomous robots, such as self-driving vehicles, requires extensive testing across diverse driving scenarios. Simulation is a key ingredient for conducting such testing in a cost-effective and scalable way. Neural rendering methods have gained popularity, as they can build simulation environments from collected logs in a data-driven manner. However, existing neural radiance field (NeRF) methods for sensor-realistic rendering of camera and lidar data suffer from low rendering speeds, limiting their applicability for large-scale testing. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering, current methods are limited to camera data and are unable to render lidar data essential for autonomous driving. To address these limitations, we propose SplatAD, the first 3DGS-based method for realistic, real-time rendering of dynamic scenes for both camera and lidar data. SplatAD accurately models key sensor-specific phenomena such as rolling shutter effects, lidar intensity, and lidar ray dropouts, using purpose-built algorithms to optimize rendering efficiency. Evaluation across three autonomous driving datasets demonstrates that SplatAD achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality with up to +2 PSNR for NVS and +3 PSNR for reconstruction while increasing rendering speed over NeRF-based methods by an order of magnitude.

      <title>SpotLight: Shadow-Guided Object Relighting via Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that diffusion models can serve as powerful neural rendering engines that can be leveraged for inserting virtual objects into images. However, unlike typical physics-based renderers, these neural rendering engines are limited by the lack of manual control over the lighting, which is often essential for improving or personalizing the desired image outcome. In this paper, we show that precise lighting control can be achieved for object relighting simply by providing a coarse shadow of the object. Indeed, we show that injecting only the desired shadow of the object into a pre-trained diffusion-based neural renderer enables it to accurately shade the object according to the desired light position, while properly harmonizing the object (and its shadow) within the target background image. Our method, SpotLight, leverages existing neural rendering approaches and achieves controllable relighting results with no additional training. We show that SpotLight achieves superior object compositing results, both quantitatively and perceptually, as confirmed by a user study, outperforming existing diffusion-based models specifically designed for relighting. We also demonstrate other applications, such as hand-scribbling shadows and full-image relighting, demonstrating its versatility.</description>

      <title>Hallo3: Highly Dynamic and Realistic Portrait Image Animation with Video Diffusion Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00733v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing methodologies for animating portrait images face significant challenges, particularly in handling non-frontal perspectives, rendering dynamic objects around the portrait, and generating immersive, realistic backgrounds. In this paper, we introduce the first application of a pretrained transformer-based video generative model that demonstrates strong generalization capabilities and generates highly dynamic, realistic videos for portrait animation, effectively addressing these challenges. The adoption of a new video backbone model makes previous U-Net-based methods for identity maintenance, audio conditioning, and video extrapolation inapplicable. To address this limitation, we design an identity reference network consisting of a causal 3D VAE combined with a stacked series of transformer layers, ensuring consistent facial identity across video sequences. Additionally, we investigate various speech audio conditioning and motion frame mechanisms to enable the generation of continuous video driven by speech audio. Our method is validated through experiments on benchmark and newly proposed wild datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements over prior methods in generating realistic portraits characterized by diverse orientations within dynamic and immersive scenes. Further visualizations and the source code are available at: https://fudan-generative-vision.github.io/hallo3/.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning-Enhanced Procedural Generation for Dynamic Narrative-Driven AR Experiences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Procedural Content Generation (PCG) is widely used to create scalable and diverse environments in games. However, existing methods, such as the Wave Function Collapse (WFC) algorithm, are often limited to static scenarios and lack the adaptability required for dynamic, narrative-driven applications, particularly in augmented reality (AR) games. This paper presents a reinforcement learning-enhanced WFC framework designed for mobile AR environments. By integrating environment-specific rules and dynamic tile weight adjustments informed by reinforcement learning (RL), the proposed method generates maps that are both contextually coherent and responsive to gameplay needs. Comparative evaluations and user studies demonstrate that the framework achieves superior map quality and delivers immersive experiences, making it well-suited for narrative-driven AR games. Additionally, the method holds promise for broader applications in education, simulation training, and immersive extended reality (XR) experiences, where dynamic and adaptive environments are critical.</description>

      <title>ForceGrip: Data-Free Curriculum Learning for Realistic Grip Force Control in VR Hand Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Realistic hand manipulation is a key component of immersive virtual reality (VR), yet existing methods often rely on a kinematic approach or motion-capture datasets that omit crucial physical attributes such as contact forces and finger torques. Consequently, these approaches prioritize tight, one-size-fits-all grips rather than reflecting users' intended force levels. We present ForceGrip, a deep learning agent that synthesizes realistic hand manipulation motions, faithfully reflecting the user's grip force intention. Instead of mimicking predefined motion datasets, ForceGrip uses generated training scenarios-randomizing object shapes, wrist movements, and trigger input flows-to challenge the agent with a broad spectrum of physical interactions. To effectively learn from these complex tasks, we employ a three-phase curriculum learning framework comprising Finger Positioning, Intention Adaptation, and Dynamic Stabilization. This progressive strategy ensures stable hand-object contact, adaptive force control based on user inputs, and robust handling under dynamic conditions. Additionally, a proximity reward function enhances natural finger motions and accelerates training convergence. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations reveal ForceGrip's superior force controllability and plausibility compared to state-of-the-art methods.
