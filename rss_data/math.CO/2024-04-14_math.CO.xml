      <description>arXiv:2404.08072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies obstructions to preservation of return sets by episturmian morphisms. We show, by way of an explicit construction, that infinitely many obstructions exist. This generalizes and improves an earlier result about Sturmian morphisms.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Tropical Rank 2 Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the tropicalization of the space of symmetric rank two matrices. Analogously to the result of Markwig and Yu for general tropical rank two matrices, we show that it has a simplicial complex structure as the space of symmetric bicolored trees and that this simplicial complex is shellable. We also discuss some matroid structures arising from this space and present generating functions for the number of symmetric bicolored trees.</description>

      <title>On set systems with strongly restricted intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Set systems with strongly restricted intersections, called $\alpha$-intersecting families for a vector $\alpha$, were introduced recently as a generalization of several well-studied intersecting families including the classical oddtown and eventown. Given a binary vector $\alpha=(a_1, \ldots, a_k)$, a collection $\mathcal F$ of subsets over an $n$ element set is an $\alpha$-intersecting family modulo $2$ if for each $i=1,2,\ldots,k$, all $i$-wise intersections of distinct members in $\mathcal F$ have sizes with the same parity as $a_i$. Let $f_\alpha(n)$ denote the maximum size of such a family. In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of $f_\alpha(n)$ when $n$ goes to infinity. We show that if $t$ is the maximum integer such that $a_t=1$ and $2t\leq k$, then $f_{\alpha(n)} \sim {(t! n)}^{\frac 1 t}$. More importantly, we show that for any constant $c$, as the length $k$ goes larger, $f_\alpha(n)$ is upper bounded by $O (n^c)$ for almost all $\alpha$. Equivalently, no matter what $k$ is, there are only finitely many $\alpha$ satisfying $f_\alpha(n)=\Omega (n^c)$. This answers an open problem raised by Johnston and O'Neill in 2023. All of our results can be generalized to modulo $p$ setting for any prime $p$ smoothly.</description>

      <title>Radio number for the Cartesian product of a tree and a complete graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A radio labelling of a graph $G$ is a mapping $f : V(G) \rightarrow \{0, 1, 2,\ldots\}$ such that $|f(u)-f(v)|\geq diam(G) + 1 - d(u,v)$ for every pair of distinct vertices $u,v$ of $G$, where $diam(G)$ is the diameter of $G$ and $d(u,v)$ is the distance between $u$ and $v$ in $G$. The radio number $rn(G)$ of $G$ is the smallest integer $k$ such that $G$ admits a radio labelling $f$ with $\max\{f(v):v \in V(G)\} = k$. In this paper, we give a lower bound for the radio number of the Cartesian product of a tree and a complete graph and give two necessary and sufficient conditions to achieve the lower bound. We also give three sufficient conditions to achieve the lower bound. We determine the radio number for the Cartesian product of a level-wise regular trees and a complete graph which attains the lower bound. The radio number for the Cartesian product of a path and a complete graph derived in [Radio number for the product of a path and a complete graph, J. Comb. Optim., 30 (2015), 139-149] can be obtained using our results in a short way.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of relaxed $k$-ary trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A relaxed $k$-ary tree is an ordered directed acyclic graph with a unique source and sink in which every node has out-degree $k$. These objects arise in the compression of trees in which some repeated subtrees are factored and repeated appearances are replaced by pointers. We prove an asymptotic theta-result for the number of relaxed $k$-ary tree with $n$ nodes for $n \to \infty$. This generalizes the previously proved binary case to arbitrary finite arity, and shows that the seldom observed phenomenon of a stretched exponential term $e^{c n^{1/3}}$ appears in all these cases. We also derive the recurrences for compacted $k$-ary trees in which all subtrees are unique and minimal deterministic finite automata accepting a finite language over a finite alphabet.</description>

      <title>Variations of the $\alpha$-Eulerian polynomials and gamma positivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a connection formula between two multivariate generalizations of the Eulerian polynomials $A^{\cyc}_n(x,y, t\,|\,\alpha)$ and $A_n(u_1,u_2,u_3,u_4, f, g, t\,|\,\alpha, \beta)$, which enumerate permutations related to excedance and descent based statistics respectively. By exploring this connection, we derive the exponential generating function of the latter polynomials and several
  $\gamma$-positivity formulas for variants of Eulerian polynomials. In particular, our results generalise the main results in two recent papers by Ji \cite{Ji23} and Ji-Lin \cite{JL23}. Our proofs are combinatorial in nature and involve Foata's fundamental transformation and a cyclic analogue of valley-hopping.</description>

      <title>An improved spectral lower bound of treewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for every $n$-vertex graph with at least one edge, its treewidth is greater than or equal to $n \lambda_{2} / (\Delta + \lambda_{2}) - 1$, where $\Delta$ and $\lambda_{2}$ are the maximum degree and the second smallest Laplacian eigenvalue of the graph, respectively. This lower bound improves the one by Chandran and Subramanian [Inf. Process. Lett., 2003] and the subsequent one by the authors of the present paper [IEICE Trans. Inf. Syst., 2024]. The new lower bound is almost tight in the sense that there is an infinite family of graphs such that the lower bound is only $1$ less than the treewidth for each graph in the family. Additionally, using similar techniques, we also present a lower bound of treewidth in terms of the largest and the second smallest Laplacian eigenvalues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Answering a question of Gamarnik and Smedira, we give a polynomial time algorithm that approximately computes the volume of a truncation of a relaxation of the independent set polytope, improving on their quasi-polynomial time algorithm. Our algorithm is obtained by viewing the volume as an evaluation of a graph polynomial and we approximate this evaluation using Barvinok's interpolation method.</description>

      <title>On the structure of graph product von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We undertake a comprehensive study of structural properties of graph products of von Neumann algebras equipped with faithful, normal states, as well as properties of the graph products relative to subalgebras coming from induced subgraphs. Among the technical contributions in this paper include a complete bimodule calculation for subalgebras arising from subgraphs. As an application, we obtain a complete classification of when two subalgebras coming from induced subgraphs can be amenable relative to each other. We also give complete characterizations of when the graph product can be full, diffuse, or a factor. Our results are obtained in a broad generality, and we emphasize that they are new even in the tracial setting. They also allow us to deduce new results about when graph products of groups can be amenable relative to each other.</description>

      <title>End behavior of Ramanujan's taxicab numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized taxicab numbers are the smallest positive integers that are the sum of exactly $j$, positive $k$-th powers in exactly $m$ distinct ways. This paper is considers for which values of $m$ does a smallest such integer exist as $j$ gets large. There appear to be only two possible outcomes, leading to curious results like there is no positive integer that can be expressed as the sum of exactly $10$ positive squares in exactly $3$ ways. This paper resolves a number of conjectures found in the OEIS by considering generalized Taxicab numbers in the setting of the theory of partitions.</description>

      <title>The global and local limit of the continuous-time Mallows process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous-time Mallows processes are processes of random permutations of the set $\{1, \ldots, n\}$ whose marginal at time $t$ is the Mallows distribution with parameter $t$. Recently Corsini showed that there exists a unique Markov Mallows process whose left inversions are independent counting processes. We prove that this process admits a global and a local limit as $n \to \infty$. The global limit, obtained after suitably rescaling space and time, is an explicit stochastic process on $[0,1]$ whose description is based on the permuton limit of the Mallows distribution, analyzed by Starr. The local limit is a process of permutations of $\mathbb{Z}$ which is closely related to the construction of the Mallows distribution on permutations of $\mathbb{Z}$ due to Gnedin and Olshanski. Our results demonstrate an analogy between the asymptotic behavior of Mallows processes and the recently studied limiting properties of random sorting networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2104.04754v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The enhanced power graph of a group is the simple graph whose vertex set is consisted of all elements of the group, and whose any pair of vertices are adjacent if they generate a cyclic subgroup. In this paper, we classify all finite groups whose enhanced power graphs are split and threshold. We also classify all finite nilpotent groups whose enhanced power graphs are chordal graphs and cographs. Finally, we give some families of non-nilpotent groups whose enhanced power graphs are chordal graphs and cographs. These results partly answer a question posed by Peter J. Cameron.</description>

      <title>Reduced clique graphs: a correction to "Chordal graphs and their clique graphs"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.03781v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galinier, Habib, and Paul introduced the reduced clique graph of a chordal graph $G$. The nodes of the reduced clique graph are the maximal cliques of $G$, and two nodes are joined by an edge if and only if they form a non-disjoint separating pair of cliques in $G$. In this case the weight of the edge is the size of the intersection of the two cliques. A clique tree of $G$ is a tree with the maximal cliques of $G$ as its nodes, where for any $v\in V(G)$, the subgraph induced by the nodes containing $v$ is connected. Galinier et al.\ prove that a spanning tree of the reduced clique graph is a clique tree if and only if it has maximum weight, but their proof contains an error. We explain and correct this error.
  In addition, we initiate a study of the structure of reduced clique graphs by proving that they cannot contain any induced cycle of length five (although they may contain induced cycles of length three or any even integer greater than two). We show that no cycle of length four or more is isomorphic to a reduced clique graph. We prove that the class of clique graphs of chordal graphs is not comparable to the class of reduced clique graphs of chordal graphs by providing examples that are in each of these classes without being in the other.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss several extension properties of matroids and polymatroids and their application as necessary conditions for the existence of different matroid representations, namely linear, folded linear, algebraic, and entropic representations. Iterations of those extension properties are checked for matroids on eight and nine elements by means of computer-aided explorations, finding in that way several new examples of non-linearly representable matroids. A special emphasis is made on sparse paving matroids on nine points containing the tic-tac-toe configuration. We present a new, more clear description of that family and we analyze extension properties on those matroids and their duals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14312v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a matroid and a group of its matroid automorphisms, we study the induced group action on the Chow ring of the matroid. This turns out to always be a permutation action. Work of Adiprasito, Huh and Katz showed that the Chow ring satisfies Poincar\'e duality and the Hard Lefschetz theorem. We lift these to statements about this permutation action, and suggest further conjectures in this vein.</description>

      <title>Enumerating pattern-avoiding permutations by leading terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The number of 123-avoiding permutation on $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ with a fixed leading terms is counted by the ballot numbers. The same holds for $132$-avoiding permutations. These results were proved by Miner and Pak using the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth (RSK) correspondence to connect permutations with Dyck paths. In this paper, we first provide an alternate proof of these enumeration results via a direct counting argument. We then study the number of pattern-avoiding permutations with a fixed prefix of length $t\geq1$, generalizing the $t=1$ case. We find exact expressions for single and pairs of patterns of length three as well as the pair $3412$ and $3421$. These expressions depend on $t$, the extrema, and the order statistics. We also define $r$-Wilf equivalence for permutations with a single fixed leading term $r$, and classify the $r$-Wilf-equivalence classes for both classical and vincular patterns of length three.</description>

      <title>On regular sets in Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Ga = (V, E)$ be a graph and $a, b$ nonnegative integers. An $(a, b)$-regular set in $\Ga$ is a nonempty proper subset $D$ of $V$ such that every vertex in $D$ has exactly $a$ neighbours in $D$ and every vertex in $V \setminus D$ has exactly $b$ neighbours in $D$. A $(0,1)$-regular set is called a perfect code, an efficient dominating set, or an independent perfect dominating set. A subset $D$ of a group $G$ is called an $(a,b)$-regular set of $G$ if it is an $(a, b)$-regular set in some Cayley graph of $G$, and an $(a, b)$-regular set in a Cayley graph of $G$ is called a subgroup $(a, b)$-regular set if it is also a subgroup of $G$. In this paper we study $(a, b)$-regular sets in Cayley graphs with a focus on $(0, k)$-regular sets, where $k \ge 1$ is an integer. Among other things we determine when a non-trivial proper normal subgroup of a group is a $(0, k)$-regular set of the group. We also determine all subgroup $(0, k)$-regular sets of dihedral groups and generalized quaternion groups. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for a hypercube or the Cartesian product of $n$ copies of the cycle of length $p$ to admit $(0, k)$-regular sets, where $p$ is an odd prime. Our results generalize several known results from perfect codes to $(0, k)$-regular sets.</description>

      <title>Production optimization by agents of differing work rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09208v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We devise a scheme for producing, in the least possible time, $n$ identical objects with $p$ agents that work at differing speeds. This involves halting the process in order to transfer production across agent types. For the case of two types of agent, we construct a scheme based on the Euclidean algorithm that seeks to minimise the number of pauses in production.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the avoidance of patterns in inversion sequences that relate sorting via sorting machines including data structures such as pop stacks and stacks. Such machines have been studied under a variety of additional constraints and generalizations, some of which we apply here. We give the classification of several classes of sortable inversion sequences in terms of pattern avoidance. We are able to provide an exact enumeration of some of the sortable classes in question using both classical approaches and a more recent strategy utilizing generating trees.</description>

      <title>Binomial Coefficients and Littlewood--Richardson Coefficients for Interpolation Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inhomogeneous versions of Jack and Macdonald polynomials, called interpolation polynomials, have been introduced by Knop-Sahi (type $A$) and Okounkov (type $BC$). In this paper, we study binomial coefficients and Littlewood-Richardson (LR) coefficients for these interpolation polynomials. We extend to type $BC$ the weighted sum formula for binomial coefficients due to the second author in type $A$, and obtain a new weighted sum formula for LR coefficients for both types $A$ and $BC$. We prove that binomial coefficients are positive and monotone using the weighted sum formula and the combinatorial formulas due to Okounkov. As an application, we show that the containment partial order can be characterized in terms of Schur positivity or Jack positivity. This result is in parallel with the work of Cuttler-Greene-Skandera, Sra and Khare-Tao, which characterize two other partial orders, majorization and weak majorization, in terms of evaluation positivity of Schur functions.</description>

      <title>A topology on the poset of quiver mutation classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To better understand mutation-invariant and hereditary properties of quivers (and more generally skew-symmetrizable matrices), we have constructed a topology on the set of all mutation classes of quivers which we call the mutation class topology. This topology is the Alexandrov topology induced by the poset structure on the set of mutation classes of quivers from the partial order of quiver embedding. The closed sets of our topology -- equivalently, the lower sets of the poset -- are in bijective correspondence with mutation-invariant and hereditary properties of quivers. We show that this space is strictly $T_0$, connected, non-Noetherian, and that every open set is dense. We close by providing open questions from cluster algebra theory in the setting of the mutation class topology and some directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Extremes of generalized inversions on permutation groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical inversion statistic on symmetric groups is the sum of all indicators $\textbf{1}\{\pi(i) &gt; \pi(j)\}$ for a random permutation $\pi = (\pi(1), \ldots, \pi(n))$ and the pairs $(i,j)$ with $1 \leq i &lt; j \leq n$. The descent statistic counts all $i \in \{1, \ldots, n-1\}$ with $\pi(i) &gt; \pi(i+1)$. The number of inversions can be generalized by restricting the indicators to pairs $(i,j)$ with $i&lt;j$ and $|i-j| \leq d$ for some $d \in \{1, \ldots, n-1\}$. Likewise, the number of descents can be generalized by counting all $i \in \{1, \ldots, n-d\}$ with $\pi(i) &gt; \pi(i+d)$. These generalized statistics can be further extended to the signed and even-signed permutation groups. The bandwidth index $d$ can be chosen in dependence of $n$, and the magnitude of $d$ is significant for asymptotic considerations. It is known that each of these statistics is asymptotically normal for suitable choices of $d$. In this paper we prove the bivariate asymptotic normality and determine the extreme value asymptotics of generalized inversions and descents.</description>

      <title>Poset Positional Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of positional games, supplementing them with a restriction on the order in which the elements of the board are allowed to be claimed. We introduce poset positional games, which are positional games with an additional structure -- a poset on the elements of the board. Throughout the game play, based on this poset and the set of the board elements that are claimed up to that point, we reduce the set of available moves for the player whose turn it is -- an element of the board can only be claimed if all the smaller elements in the poset are already claimed.
  We proceed to analyse these games in more detail, with a prime focus on the most studied convention, the Maker-Breaker games. First we build a general framework around poset positional games. Then, we perform a comprehensive study of the complexity of determining the game outcome, conditioned on the structure of the family of winning sets on the one side and the structure of the poset on the other.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.01973v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study crystallographic sphere packings and Kleinian sphere packings, introduced first by Kontorovich and Nakamura in 2017 and then studied further by Kapovich and Kontorovich in 2021. In particular, we solve the problem of existence of crystallographic sphere packings in certain higher dimensions posed by Kontorovich and Nakamura. In addition, we present a geometric doubling procedure allowing to obtain sphere packings from some Coxeter polyhedra without isolated roots, and study "properly integral" packings (that is, ones which are integral but not superintegral). Our techniques rely extensively on computations with Lorentzian quadratic forms, their orthogonal groups, and associated higher-dimensional hyperbolic polyhedra.</description>

      <title>On 2-strong connectivity orientations of mixed graphs and related problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02215v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A mixed graph $G$ is a graph that consists of both undirected and directed edges. An orientation of $G$ is formed by orienting all the undirected edges of $G$, i.e., converting each undirected edge $\{u,v\}$ into a directed edge that is either $(u,v)$ or $(v,u)$. The problem of finding an orientation of a mixed graph that makes it strongly connected is well understood and can be solved in linear time. Here we introduce the following orientation problem in mixed graphs. Given a mixed graph $G$, we wish to compute its maximal sets of vertices $C_1,C_2,\ldots,C_k$ with the property that by removing any edge $e$ from $G$ (directed or undirected), there is an orientation $R_i$ of $G\setminus{e}$ such that all vertices in $C_i$ are strongly connected in $R_i$. We discuss properties of those sets, and we show how to solve this problem in linear time by reducing it to the computation of the $2$-edge twinless strongly connected components of a directed graph. A directed graph $G=(V,E)$ is twinless strongly connected if it contains a strongly connected spanning subgraph without any pair of antiparallel (or twin) edges. The twinless strongly connected components (TSCCs) of a directed graph $G$ are its maximal twinless strongly connected subgraphs. A $2$-edge twinless strongly connected component (2eTSCC) of $G$ is a maximal subset of vertices $C$ such that any two vertices $u, v \in C$ are in the same twinless strongly connected component of $G \setminus e$, for any edge $e$. These concepts are motivated by several diverse applications, such as the design of road and telecommunication networks, and the structural stability of buildings.</description>

      <title>Agreement theorems for high dimensional expanders in the small soundness regime: the role of covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a family $X$ of subsets of $[n]$ and an ensemble of local functions $\{f_s:s\to\Sigma\; | \; s\in X\}$, an agreement test is a randomized property tester that is supposed to test whether there is some global function $G:[n]\to\Sigma$ such that $f_s=G|_s$ for many sets $s$. A "classical" small-soundness agreement theorem is a list-decoding $(LD)$ statement, saying that \[\tag{$LD$} Agree(\{f_s\}) &gt; \varepsilon \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \exists G^1,\dots, G^\ell,\quad P_s[f_s\overset{0.99}{\approx}G^i|_s]\geq poly(\varepsilon),\;i=1,\dots,\ell. \] Such a statement is motivated by PCP questions and has been shown in the case where $X=\binom{[n]}k$, or where $X$ is a collection of low dimensional subspaces of a vector space.
  In this work we study small the case of on high dimensional expanders $X$. It has been an open challenge to analyze their small soundness behavior. Surprisingly, the small soundness behavior turns out to be governed by the topological covers of $X$.We show that:
  1. If $X$ has no connected covers, then $(LD)$ holds, provided that $X$ satisfies an additional expansion property.
  2. If $X$ has a connected cover, then $(LD)$ necessarily fails.
  3. If $X$ has a connected cover (and assuming the additional expansion property), we replace the $(LD)$ by a weaker statement we call lift-decoding:
  \[ \tag{$LFD$}
  Agree(\{f_s\})&gt; \varepsilon \Longrightarrow \quad \exists\text{ cover }\rho:Y\twoheadrightarrow X,\text{ and }G:Y(0)\to\Sigma,\text{ such that }\] \[P_{{\tilde s\twoheadrightarrow s}}[f_s \overset{0.99}{\approx} G|_{\tilde s}] \geq poly(\varepsilon),\] where ${\tilde s\twoheadrightarrow s}$ means that $\rho(\tilde s)=s$.
  The additional expansion property is cosystolic expansion of a complex derived from $X$ holds for the spherical building and for quotients of the Bruhat-Tits building.</description>

      <title>An exactly solvable asymmetric $K$-exclusion process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an interacting particle process on a finite ring with $L$ sites with at most $K$ particles per site, in which particles hop to nearest neighbors with rates given in terms of $t$-deformed integers and asymmetry parameter $q$, where $t&gt;0$ and $q \geq 0$ are parameters. This model, which we call the $(q, t)$~$K$-ASEP, reduces to the usual ASEP on the ring when $K = 1$ and to a model studied by Sch\"utz and Sandow (\emph{Phys. Rev. E}, 1994) when $t = q = 1$. This is a special case of the misanthrope process and as a consequence, the steady state does not depend on $q$ and is of product form, generalizing the same phenomena for the ASEP. What is interesting here is the steady state weights are given by explicit formulas involving $t$-binomial coefficients, and are palindromic polynomials in $t$. Interestingly, although the $(q, t)$~$K$-ASEP does not satisfy particle-hole symmetry, its steady state does. We analyze the density and calculate the most probable number of particles at a site in the steady state in various regimes of $t$. Lastly, we construct a two-dimensional exclusion process on a discrete cylinder with height $K$ and circumference $L$ which projects to the $(q, t)$~$K$-ASEP and whose steady state distribution is also of product form. We believe this model will serve as an illustrative example in constructing two-dimensional analogues of misanthrope processes.

      <title>Low Acceptance Agreement Tests via Bounded-Degree Symplectic HDXs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solve the derandomized direct product testing question in the low acceptance regime, by constructing new high dimensional expanders that have no small connected covers. We show that our complexes have swap cocycle expansion, which allows us to deduce the agreement theorem by relying on previous work.
  Derandomized direct product testing, also known as agreement testing, is the following problem. Let X be a family of k-element subsets of [n] and let $\{f_s:s\to\Sigma\}_{s\in X}$ be an ensemble of local functions, each defined over a subset $s\subset [n]$. Suppose that we run the following so-called agreement test: choose a random pair of sets $s_1,s_2\in X$ that intersect on $\sqrt k$ elements, and accept if $f_{s_1},f_{s_2}$ agree on the elements in $s_1\cap s_2$. We denote the success probability of this test by $Agr(\{f_s\})$. Given that $Agr(\{f_s\})=\epsilon&gt;0$, is there a global function $G:[n]\to\Sigma$ such that $f_s = G|_s$ for a non-negligible fraction of $s\in X$ ?
  We construct a family X of k-subsets of $[n]$ such that $|X| = O(n)$ and such that it satisfies the low acceptance agreement theorem. Namely,
  $Agr (\{f_s\}) &gt; \epsilon \; \; \longrightarrow$ there is a function $G:[n]\to\Sigma$ such that $\Pr_s[f_s\overset{0.99}{\approx} G|_s]\geq poly(\epsilon)$.
  A key idea is to replace the well-studied LSV complexes by symplectic high dimensional expanders (HDXs). The family X is just the k-faces of the new symplectic HDXs. The later serve our needs better since their fundamental group satisfies the congruence subgroup property, which implies that they lack small covers. We also give a polynomial-time algorithm to construct this family of symplectic HDXs.</description>

      <title>Hardness of circuit and monotone diameters of polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Circuit diameter of polytopes was introduced by Borgwardt, Finhold and Hemmecke as a fundamental tool for the study of circuit augmentation schemes for linear programming and for estimating combinatorial diameters. Determining the complexity of computing the circuit diameter of polytopes was posed as an open problem by Sanit\`a as well as by Kafer, and was recently reiterated by Borgwardt, Grewe, Kafer, Lee and Sanit\`a.
  In this paper, we solve this problem by showing that computing the circuit diameter of a polytope given in halfspace-description is strongly NP-hard. To prove this result, we show that computing the combinatorial diameter of the perfect matching polytope of a bipartite graph is NP-hard. This complements a result by Sanit\`a (FOCS 2018) on the NP-hardness of computing the diameter of fractional matching polytopes and implies the new result that computing the diameter of a $\{0,1\}$-polytope is strongly NP-hard, which may be of independent interest. In our second main result, we give a precise graph-theoretic description of the monotone diameter of perfect matching polytopes and use this description to prove that computing the monotone (circuit) diameter of a given input polytope is strongly NP-hard as well.</description>
