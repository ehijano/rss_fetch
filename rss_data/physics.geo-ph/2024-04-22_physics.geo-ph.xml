      <title>Seismic Interpolation Transformer for Consecutively Missing Data: A Case Study in DAS-VSP Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed optical fiber acoustic sensing (DAS) is a rapidly-developed seismic acquisition technology with advantages of low cost, high resolution, high sensitivity, and small interval, etc. Nonetheless, consecutively missing cases often appear in real seismic data acquired by DAS system due to some factors, including optical fiber damage and inferior coupling between cable and well. Recently, some deep-learning seismic interpolation methods based on convolutional neural network (CNN) have shown impressive performance in regular and random missing cases but still remain the consecutively missing case as a challenging task. The main reason is that the weight sharing makes it difficult for CNN to capture enough comprehensive features. In this paper, we propose a transformer-based interpolation method, called seismic interpolation transformer (SIT), to deal with the consecutively missing case. This proposed SIT is an encoder-decoder structure connected by some U-shaped swin-transformer blocks. In encoder and decoder part, the multi-head self-attention (MSA) mechanism is used to capture global features which is essential for the reconstruction of consecutively missing traces. The U-shaped swin-transformer blocks are utilized to perform feature extraction operations on feature maps with different resolutions. Moreover, we combine the loss based on structural similarity index (SSIM) and L1 norm to propose a novel loss function for SIT. In experiments, this proposed SIT outperforms U-Net and swin-transformer. Moreover, ablation studies also demonstrate the advantages of new network architecture and loss function.</description>

      <title>Modeling Seismic Wave Propagation in TTI Media Using Residual Perfectly Matched Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The perfectly matched layer(PML) is commonly used in wave propagation, radiation and diffraction problems in unbounded space domains. A new implementation scheme of PML is presented. The PML formulation is pre-defined, and the wave field absorption is achieved by calculating the residual between the PML equation and original equation through backward induction. Two forms of the Residual PML (RPML) are presented: RPML-1, which defines the residual as the difference between the original and PML equations, and RPML-2, which defines the residual as the difference between the original and PML wave fields. RPML-2 is the simplest and easiest to extend, as it does not alter the original equation and only has one time partial derivative term in the residual equation. Additionally, since the residual equation has no spatial partial derivative term, high-order spatial difference discretization is unnecessary, which results in higher accuracy and computational efficiency. Furthermore, simulating a wave field in TTI media requires a high absorption effect and stability of PML. The numerical simulation demonstrates that RPML-2 provides better absorption performance and stability compared to ADEPML and NPML. To meet the needs of wave field simulation for complex media, a multiaxial complex frequency shifted RPML-2 (MCFS-RPML-2) is introduced, which employs double damping profiles and complex frequency shift technology to achieve higher stability and absorption effects.</description>

      <title>Methodological Reconstruction of Historical Landslide Tsunamis Using Bayesian Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indonesia is one of the world's most densely populated regions and lies among the epicenters of Earth's greatest natural hazards. Effectively reducing the disaster potential of these hazards through resource allocation and preparedness first requires an analysis of the risk factors of the region. Since destructive tsunamis present one of the most eminent dangers to coastal communities, understanding their sources and geological history is necessary to determine the potential future risk.
  Inspired by results from Cummins et al. 2020, and previous efforts that identified source parameters for earthquake-generated tsunamis, we consider landslide-generated tsunamis. This is done by constructing a probability distribution of potential landslide sources based on anecdotal observations of the 1852 Banda Sea tsunami, using Bayesian inference and scientific computing. After collecting over 100,000 samples (simulating 100,000 landslide induced tsunamis), we conclude that a landslide event provides a reasonable match to the tsunami reported in the anecdotal accounts. However, the most viable landslides may push the boundaries of geological plausibility. Future work creating a joint landslide-earthquake model may compensate for the weaknesses associated with an individual landslide or earthquake source event.</description>

      <title>Machine learning for climate physics and simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the emerging advances and opportunities at the intersection of machine learning (ML) and climate physics, highlighting the use of ML techniques, including supervised, unsupervised, and equation discovery, to accelerate climate knowledge discoveries and simulations. We delineate two distinct yet complementary aspects: (1) ML for climate physics and (2) ML for climate simulations. While physics-free ML-based models, such as ML-based weather forecasting, have demonstrated success when data is abundant and stationary, the physics knowledge and interpretability of ML models become crucial in the small-data/non-stationary regime to ensure generalizability. Given the absence of observations, the long-term future climate falls into the small-data regime. Therefore, ML for climate physics holds a critical role in addressing the challenges of ML for climate simulations. We emphasize the need for collaboration among climate physics, ML theory, and numerical analysis to achieve reliable ML-based models for climate applications.</description>

      <title>What can Hurricane SAM (2021) tell us about ocean waves under tropical cyclones?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ocean wave field under Hurricane SAM (2021). Whilst measurements of waves under Tropical Cyclones (TCs) are rare, an unusually large number of quality in situ and remote measurements are available in that case. First, we highlight the good consistency between the wave spectra provided by the Surface Waves Investigation and Monitoring (SWIM) instrument onboard the China-France Oceanography Satellite (CFOSAT), the in situ spectra measured by National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) buoys, and a saildrone. The impact of strong rains on SWIM spectra is then further investigated. We show that whereas the rain definitely affects the normalized radar cross section, both the innovative technology (beam rotating scanning geometry) and the post-processing processes applied to retrieve the 2D wave spectra ensure a good quality of the resulting wave spectra, even in heavy rain conditions. On this basis, the satellite, airborne and in situ observations are confronted to the analytical model proposed by Kudryavtsev et al (2015). We show that a trapped wave mechanism may be invoked to explain the large significant wave height observed in the right front quadrant of Hurricane SAM.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Geothermal Gradient in Colombia: a Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05184v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate determination of the geothermal gradient is critical for assessing the geothermal energy potential of a given region. Of particular interest is the case of Colombia, a country with abundant geothermal resources. A history of active oil and gas exploration and production has left drilled boreholes in different geological settings, providing direct measurements of the geothermal gradient. Unfortunately, large regions of the country where geothermal resources might exist lack such measurements. Indirect geophysical measurements are costly and difficult to perform at regional scales. Computational thermal models could be constructed, but they require very detailed knowledge of the underlying geology and uniform sampling of subsurface temperatures to be well-constrained. We present an alternative approach that leverages recent advances in supervised machine learning and available direct measurements to predict the geothermal gradient in regions where only global-scale geophysical datasets and course geological knowledge are available. We find that a Gradient Boosted Regression Tree algorithm yields optimal predictions and extensively validate the trained model. We show that predictions of our model are within 12\% accuracy and that independent measurements performed by other authors agree well with our model. Finnally, we present a geothermal gradient map for Colombia that highlights regions where futher exploration and data collection should be performed.</description>
