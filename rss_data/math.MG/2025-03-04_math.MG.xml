      <title>On $L_p$ Brunn-Minkowski type inequalities for a general class of functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the $L_p$ version (for $p\geqslant 1$) of the dimensional Brunn-Minkowski inequality for the standard Gaussian measure $\gamma_n(\cdot)$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ is shown. More precisely, we prove that for any $0$-symmetric convex sets with nonempty interior, any $p&gt;1$, and every $\lambda \in (0,1)$, \[ \gamma_n\bigl((1-\lambda)\cdot K+_p \lambda \cdot L\bigr)^{p/n} \geqslant (1-\lambda) \gamma_n(K)^{p/n} + \lambda \gamma_n(L)^{p/n}. \] Equality, for some $\lambda \in (0,1)$ and $p&gt;1$, holds if and only if $K=L$. This inequality turns out to be the $L_p$ extension of a celebrated result for the Minkowski sum (that is, for $p=1$) by Eskenazis and Moschidis (2021) on a problem by Gardner and Zvavitch (2010).
  Moreover, an $L_p$ Brunn-Minkowski type inequality is obtained for the classical Wills functional $\mathcal{W}(\cdot)$ of convex bodies.
  These results are derived as a consequence of a more general approach, which provides us with other remarkable examples of functionals satisfying $L_p$ Brunn-Minkowski type inequalities, such as different absolutely continuous measures with radially decreasing densities.</description>

      <title>On general versions of the Petty projection inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Petty projection inequality is an affine isoperimetric inequality which constitutes a cornerstone in the affine geometry of convex bodies. By extending the polar projection body to an inter-dimensional operator, Petty's inequality was generalized to the so-called $(L_p,Q)$ setting, where $Q$ is an $m$-dimensional compact convex set. In this work, we further extend the $(L_p,Q)$ Petty projection inequality to the broader realm of rotationally invariant measures with concavity properties, namely, those with $\gamma$-concave density (for $\gamma\geq-1/nm$). Moreover, when $p=1$, and motivated by a contemporary empirical reinterpretation of Petty's result, we explore empirical analogues of this inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $L_{p}$ Gaussian Minkowski problem for $C$-pseudo-cones is studied in this paper, and the existence and uniqueness results are established. This extends our previous work on the Minkowski problem for $C$-pseudo-cones with respect to the Gaussian surface area measure ($p=1$) and the Gaussian cone measure ($p=0$).</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of Riemannian Lie groups with nilpotency step 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive estimates comparing asymptotic Riemannian or sub-Riemannian metrics in step-2 nilpotent Lie groups. Given a sub-Riemannian metric, we construct a Carnot metric whose square remains at a bounded distance from the square of the original metric. As a consequence, we obtain a refined estimate of the error term in the asymptotic expansion of the volume of (sub-)Riemannian metric balls. To achieve this, we develop a novel technique to perturb sub-Riemannian geodesics, allowing us to modify their endpoints in a prescribed vertical direction.</description>

      <title>Tangency sets of non-involutive distributions and unrectifiability in Carnot-Carath\'{e}odory spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish refined versions of the Frobenius Theorem for non-involutive distributions and use these refinements to prove an unrectifiability result for Carnot-Carath\'{e}odory spaces. We also introduce a new class of metric spaces that extends the framework of Carnot-Carath\'{e}odory geometry and show that, within this class, Carnot-Carath\'{e}odory spaces are, in some sense, extremal. Our results provide new insights into the relationship between integrability, non-involutivity, and rectifiability in both classical and sub-Riemannian settings.</description>

      <title>Merging Hazy Sets with m-Schemes: A Geometric Approach to Data Visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many machine learning algorithms try to visualize high dimensional metric data in 2D in such a way that the essential geometric and topological features of the data are highlighted. In this paper, we introduce a framework for aggregating dissimilarity functions that arise from locally adjusting a metric through density-aware normalization, as employed in the IsUMap method. We formalize these approaches as m-schemes, a class of methods closely related to t-norms and t-conorms in probabilistic metrics, as well as to composition laws in information theory. These m-schemes provide a flexible and theoretically grounded approach to refining distance-based embeddings.</description>

      <title>A Rockafellar-type theorem for non-traditional costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.13263v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we present a unified approach to the problem of existence of a potential for the optimal transport problem with respect to non-traditional cost functions, that is, costs that assume infinite values. We establish a new method that relies on proving solvability of a special (possibly infinite) family of linear inequalities. When the index set of this family is countable, we give a necessary and sufficient condition on the coefficients that assures the existence of a solution, and which, in the setting of transport theory, we call $c$-path-boundedness. In the case of an uncountable index set, one needs an additional assumption for solvability. We propose a sufficient condition in this case. We note that any set admitting a potential must be $c$-path-bounded, and this condition replaces $c$-cyclic monotonicity from the classical theory, i.e. when the cost is real-valued. Our method also gives a new and elementary proof for the classical results of Rockafellar, Rochet and R\"uschendorf.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kolmogorov asked the following question: can every bounded measurable set in the plane be mapped onto a polygon by a 1-Lipschitz map with arbitrarily small measure loss? The answer is negative in general, however, the case of compact sets is still open. We present an equivalent form of the question for compact sets. Furthermore, we give a positive answer to Kolmogorov's question for specific classes of sets, most importantly, for planar sets with tube-null boundary. In particular, we show that the Sierpi\'nski carpet can be mapped into the union of finitely many line segments by a 1-Lipschitz map with arbitrarily small displacements, answering a question of Balka, Elekes and M\'ath\'e.</description>

Abstract: A recent result on the Gauss image problem for pseudo-cones can be interpreted as a measure transport, performed by the reverse radial Gauss map of a pseudo-cone. We find a cost function that is minimized by this transport map, and we prove an analogue of Rockafellar's characterization of the subdifferentials of convex functions.</description>

Abstract: Similarity matrices are fundamentals of the theory of magnitude. We show that finite metric spaces can be identified by the characteristic polynomials of the similartity matrices of $tX$ $(t&gt;0)$, where $tX$ is a homothetical expansion of $X$ by a factor $t$, if we restrict ourselves to a certain open dense subset of the set of finite metric spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15383v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fine curve graph was introduced to study homeomorphism group of surfaces. In this paper we study the topology of the Gromov boundary of this graph for closed surfaces with higher genus. We first prove a bounded geodesic image theorem for the fine curve graph, a consequence of which is the non-compactness of the Gromov boundary. Using this theorem, we are able to show that the Gromov boundary is linearly connected with respect to some visual metric.</description>

      <title>Arrangements of circles supported by small chords and compatible with natural real algebraic functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have previously proposed a study of arrangements of small circles which also surround regions in the plane realized as the images of natural real algebraic maps yielding Morse-Bott functions by projections. Among studies of arrangements, families of smooth regular submanifolds in smooth manifolds, this study is fundamental, explicit, and new, surprisingly.
  We have obtained a complete list of local changes of the graphs the regions naturally collapse to in adding a (generic) small circle to an existing arrangement of the proposed class. Here, we propose a similar and essentially different class of arrangements of circles. The present study also yields real algebraic maps and nice real algebraic functions similarly and we present a similar study.
  We are interested in topological properties and combinatorics among such arrangements and regions and applications to constructing such real algebraic maps and manifolds explicitly and understanding their global structures.</description>

      <title>Realizations of planar graphs as Poincar'e-Reeb graphs of refined algebraic domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17425v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algebraic domains are regions in the plane surrounded by mutually disjoint non-singular real algebraic curves. Poincar'e-Reeb Graphs of them are graphs they naturally collapse: such graphs are formally formulated by Sorea, for example, around 2020. Their studies found that nicely embedded planar graphs are Poincar'e-Reeb graphs of some algebraic domains. These graphs are generic with respect to the projection to the horizontal axis. Problems, methods and results are elementary and natural and they apply natural approximations nicely for example.
  We present our new approach to extension of the result to a non-generic case and an answer. We first formulate generalized algebraic domains, surrounded by non-singular real algebraic curves which may intersect with normal crossings. Such domains and certain classes of them appear in related studies of graphs and regions surrounded by algebraic curves explicitly.</description>

      <title>Arrangements of circles, the regions surrounded by them and labeled Poincar\'e-Reeb graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are interested in arrangements of circles and the regions surrounded by them. {\it Poincar\'e-Reeb graphs} have been fundamental and strong tools in studying shapes of regions surrounded by real algebraic curves, since around 2020. They are natural graphs the regions naturally collapse to and were first formulated by Sorea with several researchers. Studying shapes of such regions is one of fundamental studies in real algebraic geometry and combinatorics for example. This is surprisingly new and recently developing.
  Our study introduces labels on vertices and edges of such graphs encoding information of the circles where we concentrate on regions surrounded by circles. The author studied local changes of Poincar\'e-Reeb graphs by addition of circles under certain rules before and we discuss changes of new types. The author has started related studies motivated by singularity theory of real algebraic maps and found first that our regions are the images of natural real algebraic maps, generalizing natural projections of spheres.</description>
