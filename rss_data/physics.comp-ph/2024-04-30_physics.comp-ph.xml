      <title>Walking on Spheres and Talking to Neighbors: Variance Reduction for Laplace's Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Walk on Spheres algorithms leverage properties of Brownian Motion to create Monte Carlo estimates of solutions to a class of elliptic partial differential equations. Until recently, estimates were constructed pointwise and did not utilize the relationship between solutions at nearby points within a domain. We propose a new caching strategy which leverages the continuity of paths of Brownian Motion. In the case of Laplace's equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions, our novel algorithm has improved asymptotic runtime compared to previous approaches. This is achieved by passing information from a cache of constant size. We also provide bounds on the performance of our algorithm and demonstrate its performance on an example problem.</description>

      <title>Efficient, robust and universal computation of classical orbital elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reviews the standard algorithm for converting spacecraft state vectors to Keplerian orbital elements with a focus on its computer implementation. It analyzes the shortcomings of the scheme as described in the literature, and proposes changes to address orbits of arbitrary eccentricity and inclination in a robust way. Next, it presents two alternative schemes that simplify the program structure while improving the accuracy and speed of the transformation on modern computer architectures. Comprehensive numerical benchmarks demonstrate accuracy improvements by two orders of magnitude, together with a 40% reduction of computational cost relative to the standard implementation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A neural network is used to train, predict, and evaluate a model to calculate the energies of 3-dimensional systems composed of Ti and O atoms. Python classes are implemented to quantify atomic interactions through symmetry functions and to specify prediction algorithms. The hyperparameters of the model are optimised by minimising validation RMSE, which then produced a model that is accurate to within 100 eV. The model could be improved by proper testing of symmetry function calculations and addressing properties of features and targets.</description>

      <title>Plastic instability of annular crystalline membrane in circular confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanical instabilities of two-dimensional membranes has strong connection to the subjects of structure instabilities, morphology control and materials failures. In this work, we investigate the plastic mechanism developed in the annular crystalline membrane system for adapting to the shrinking space, which is caused by the controllable gradual expansion of the inner boundary. In the process of plastic deformation, we find the continuous generation of dislocations at the inner boundary, and their collective migration to the outer boundary; this neat dynamic scenario of dislocation current captures the complicated reorganization process of the particles. We also reveal the characteristic vortex structure arising from the interplay of topological defects and the displacement field. These results may find applications in the precise control of structural instabilities in packings of particulate matter and covalently bonded systems.</description>

      <title>A symbolic information approach applied to human intracranial data to characterize and distinguish different congnitive processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How the human brain processes information during different cognitive tasks is one of the greatest questions in contemporary neuroscience. Understanding the statistical properties of brain signals during specific activities is one promising way to address this question. Here we analyze freely available data from implanted electrocorticography (ECoG) in five human subjects during two different cognitive tasks in the light of information theory quantifiers ideas. We employ a symbolic information approach to determine the probability distribution function associated with the time series from different cortical areas. Then we utilize these probabilities to calculate the associated Shannon entropy and a statistical complexity measure based on the disequilibrium between the actual time series and one with a uniform probability distribution function. We show that an Euclidian distance in the complexity-entropy plane and an asymmetry index for complexity are useful for comparing the two conditions. We show that our method can distinguish visual search epochs from blank screen intervals in different electrodes and patients. By using a multi-scale approach and embedding time delays to downsample the data, we find important time scales in which the relevant information is being processed. We also determine cortical regions and time intervals along the 2-second-long trials that present more pronounced differences between the two cognitive tasks. Finally, we show that the method is useful to distinguish cognitive processes using brain activity on a trial-by-trial basis.</description>

      <title>Stability and Elasticity of Ultrathin Sphere-Patterned Block Copolymer Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sphere-patterned ultrathin block copolymers films are potentially interesting for a variety of applications in nanotechnology. We use self-consistent field theory to investigate the elastic response of sphere monolayer films with respect to in-plane shear, in-plane extension and compression deformations, and with respect to bending. The relations between the in-plane elastic moduli is roughly compatible with the expectations for two-dimensional elastic systems with hexagonal symmetry, with one notable exception: The pure shear and the simple shear moduli differ from each other by roughly 20%. Even more importantly, the bending constants are found to be negative, indicating that free-standing block copolymer membranes made of only sphere mono-layer are inherently unstable above the glass transition. Our results are discussed in view of experimental findings.</description>

      <title>Bayesian optimization for state engineering of quantum gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State engineering of quantum objects is a central requirement in most implementations. In the cases where the quantum dynamics can be described by analytical solutions or simple approximation models, optimal state preparation protocols have been theoretically proposed and experimentally realized. For more complex systems, however, such as multi-component quantum gases, simplifying assumptions do not apply anymore and the optimization techniques become computationally impractical. Here, we propose Bayesian optimization based on multi-output Gaussian processes to learn the quantum state's physical properties from few simulations only. We evaluate its performance on an optimization study case of diabatically transporting a Bose-Einstein condensate while keeping it in its ground state, and show that within only few hundreds of executions of the underlying physics simulation, we reach a competitive performance with other protocols. While restricting this benchmarking to well known approximations for straightforward comparisons, we expect a similar performance when employing more involving models, which are computationally more challenging. This paves the way to efficient state engineering of complex quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Potential Paradigm Shift in Hazard Risk Management: AI-Based Weather Forecast for Tropical Cyclone Hazards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advents of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven models marks a paradigm shift in risk management strategies for meteorological hazards. This study specifically employs tropical cyclones (TCs) as a focal example. We engineer a perturbation-based method to produce ensemble forecasts using the advanced Pangu AI weather model. Unlike traditional approaches that often generate fewer than 20 scenarios from Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) simulations for one event, our method facilitates the rapid nature of AI-driven model to create thousands of scenarios. We offer open-source access to our model and evaluate its effectiveness through retrospective case studies of significant TC events: Hurricane Irma (2017), Typhoon Mangkhut (2018), and TC Debbie (2017), affecting regions across North America, East Asia, and Australia. Our findings indicate that the AI-generated ensemble forecasts align closely with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ensemble predictions up to seven days prior to landfall. This approach could substantially enhance the effectiveness of weather forecast-driven risk analysis and management, providing unprecedented operational speed, user-friendliness, and global applicability.</description>

      <title>Exact symmetry conservation and automatic mesh refinement in discrete initial boundary value problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel solution procedure for initial boundary value problems. The procedure is based on an action principle, in which coordinate maps are included as dynamical degrees of freedom. This reparametrization invariant action is formulated in an abstract parameter space and an energy density scale associated with the space-time coordinates separates the dynamics of the coordinate maps and of the propagating fields. Treating coordinates as dependent, i.e. dynamical quantities, offers the opportunity to discretize the action while retaining all space-time symmetries and also provides the basis for automatic adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). The presence of unbroken space-time symmetries after discretization also ensures that the associated continuum Noether charges remain exactly conserved. The presence of coordinate maps in addition provides new freedom in the choice of boundary conditions. An explicit numerical example for wave propagation in $1+1$ dimensions is provided, using recently developed regularized summation-by-parts finite difference operators.</description>

      <title>Diffuse scattering from dynamically compressed single-crystal zirconium following the pressure-induced $\alpha\to\omega$ phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prototypical $\alpha\to\omega$ phase transition in zirconium is an ideal test-bed for our understanding of polymorphism under extreme loading conditions. After half a century of study, a consensus had emerged that the transition is realized via one of two distinct displacive mechanisms, depending on the nature of the compression path. However, recent dynamic-compression experiments equipped with in situ diffraction diagnostics performed in the past few years have revealed new transition mechanisms, demonstrating that our understanding of the underlying atomistic dynamics and transition kinetics is in fact far from complete. We present classical molecular dynamics simulations of the $\alpha\to\omega$ phase transition in single-crystal zirconium shock-compressed along the [0001] axis using a machine-learning-class potential. The transition is predicted to proceed primarily via a modified version of the two-stage Usikov-Zilberstein mechanism, whereby the high-pressure $\omega$-phase heterogeneously nucleates at boundaries between grains of an intermediate $\beta$-phase. We further observe the fomentation of atomistic disorder at the junctions between $\beta$ grains, leading to the formation of highly defective interstitial material between the $\omega$ grains. We directly compare synthetic x-ray diffraction patterns generated from our simulations with those obtained using femtosecond diffraction in recent dynamic-compression experiments, and show that the simulations produce the same unique, anisotropic diffuse scattering signal unlike any previously seen from an elemental metal. Our simulations suggest that the diffuse signal arises from a combination of thermal diffuse scattering, nanoparticle-like scattering from residual kinetically stabilized $\alpha$ and $\beta$ grains, and scattering from interstitial defective structures.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Impact of B-site Distribution on the Frustration Effect in Double Perovskite Ca2FeReO6 Using Monte Carlo Simulation and Molecular Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work systematically investigates the spin glass behavior of the double perovskite Ca2FeReO6. Building on previous studies, we have developed a formula to quantify the ions distribution at B-site, incorporating the next-nearest neighbor interactions. Employing molecular field theory and Monte Carlo simulations, the influence of various arrangements of two B-site ions on frustration effects was uncovered. B-site is segmented into a and b-site, defining the number of nearest neighbors from Fea to Feb (and vice versa) as Zx(Zy). The significant frustration effects occur when 1&lt;Zx(or Zy)&lt;3, with Zx is not equal to Zy and also when Zx(or Zy) ~ 3 while Zy(or Zx) ~ 4. All of these are reflected in the variations observed in ground state magnetization and the Thermal Energy Step relation to Zx and Zy. The model proposed in this work can be applied to most B-site disordered in perovskite systems and even to other chemically disordered in frustrated systems.</description>

      <title>Spectral measures and iterative bounds for effective diffusivity of steady and space-time periodic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over three decades ago the advection-diffusion equation for a steady fluid velocity field was homogenized, leading to a Stieltjes integral representation for the effective diffusivity, which is given in terms of a spectral measure of a compact self-adjoint operator and the P\'eclet number of the fluid flow. This result was recently extended to space-time periodic flows, instead involving an unbounded self-adjoint operator. Pad\'e approximants provide rigorous upper and lower bounds for Stieltjes functions in terms of the moments of the spectral measure. However, with the lack of a method for calculating the moments of the spectral measure for general fluid velocity fields, the utility of this powerful mathematical framework for calculating bounds for the effective diffusivity has not been fully realized. Here we significantly expand the applicability of this framework by providing an iterative method that enables an arbitrary number of moments, hence bounds, to be calculated analytically in closed form for both spatially and space-time periodic flows. The method is demonstrated for periodic flows in two spatial dimensions. The known asymptotic behavior of the effective diffusivity for a steady flow is accurately captured by high order upper and lower bounds, demonstrating the ability of the method to provide accurate estimates for the effective diffusivity for a broad range of parameter values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINN) is a extremely powerful paradigm used to solve equations encountered in scientific computing applications. An important part of the procedure is the minimization of the equation residual which includes, when the equation is time-dependent, a time sampling. It was argued in the literature that the sampling need not be uniform but should overweight initial time instants, but no rigorous explanation was provided for these choice. In this paper we take some prototypical examples and, under standard hypothesis concerning the neural network convergence, we show that the optimal time sampling follows a truncated exponential distribution. In particular we explain when the time sampling is best to be uniform and when it should not be. The findings are illustrated with numerical examples on linear equation, Burgers' equation and the Lorenz system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pump-probe experiments with femtosecond time resolution allow to disentangle the electronic dynamics from the lattice response and thus provide valuable insights into the non-equilibrium behavior of correlated materials. In Cr-doped V$_2$O$_3$, a multi-orbital Mott-Hubbard material which has been intensively investigated for decades, time-resolved experiments reported a photo-induced insulator-metal transition leading to a transient metal state with nonthermal properties. Here, we combine non-equilibrium dynamical mean-field theory with realistic first principles modeling to simulate the ultrafast response of this material to a laser excitation. Our calculations reproduce the insulating initial state, with orbital occupations in agreement with experiment, and reveal an ultrafast pump-induced gap filling associated with a charge reshuffling between the $e_g^\pi$ and $a_{1g}$ orbitals. However, in contrast to the related compound VO$_2$, the electronic system thermalizes within a few tens of femtoseconds and we find no evidence for the existence of a metastable nonthermal metal. This suggests that the reported nonthermal behavior in the experiments may be associated with the mismatch between the electronic and lattice temperatures.</description>

      <title>Avalanche Dynamics and the Effect of Straining in Dislocation Systems with Quenched Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The plastic deformation of crystalline and other heterogeneous materials often manifests in stochastic intermittent events indicating the criticality of plastic behavior. Previous studies demonstrated that the presence of short-ranged quenched disorder modifies this behavior disrupting long-range static and dynamic correlations consequently localizing dislocation avalanches. However, these observations were mostly confined to relaxed materials devoid of deformation history. In this work our focus is on how straining affects static and dynamic correlations, avalanche dynamics and local yield stresses. We demonstrate that the interplay between severe straining and confining quenched disorder induces critical behavior characterized by dislocation avalanches distinct from those at lower stresses. Namely, near the flow stress many avalanches, even if triggered locally, evolve into events affecting a larger region by exciting small clusters of dislocations all around the sample. This type of avalanches differ from the ones at low strains where plastic events typically consist of one compact cluster of dislocations which is either local or it is already quite extended at the onset of the avalanche. Furthermore, we examine the impact of avalanches on local yield stresses. It is shown in detail in this work that while some statistical features of the local yield thresholds are robust to straining, others are significantly affected by the deformation history.</description>

Abstract: We present the application of the physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach in Bayesian formulation. We have adopted the Bayesian neural network framework to obtain posterior densities from Laplace approximation. For each model or fit, the evidence is computed, which is a measure that classifies the hypothesis. The optimal solution is the one with the highest value of evidence. We have proposed a modification of the Bayesian algorithm to obtain hyperparameters of the model. We have shown that within the Bayesian framework, one can obtain the relative weights between the boundary and equation contributions to the total loss. Presented method leads to predictions comparable to those obtained by sampling from the posterior distribution within the Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm (HMC). We have solved heat, wave, and Burger's equations, and the results obtained are in agreement with the exact solutions, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. In Burger's equation problem, we have demonstrated that the framework can combine information from differential equations and potential measurements. All solutions are provided with uncertainties (induced by the model's parameter dependence) computed within the Bayesian framework.</description>

      <title>Raman spectra of amino acids and peptides from machine learning polarizabilities</title>

Abstract: Raman spectroscopy is an important tool in the study of vibrational properties and composition of molecules, peptides and even proteins. Raman spectra can be simulated based on the change of the electronic polarizability with vibrations, which can nowadays be efficiently obtained via machine learning models trained on first-principles data. However, the transferability of the models trained on small molecules to larger structures is unclear and direct training on large structures in prohibitively expensive. In this work, we first train two machine learning models to predict polarizabilities of all 20 amino acids. Both models are carefully benchmarked and compared to DFT calculations, with neural network method found to offer better transferability. By combining machine learning models with classical force field molecular dynamics, Raman spectra of all amino acids are also obtained and investigated, showing good agreement with experiments. The models are further extended to small peptides. We find that adding structures containing peptide bonds to the training set greatly improves predictions even for peptides not included in training sets.</description>

      <title>Towards Cross Domain Generalization of Hamiltonian Representation via Meta Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.01168v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning for physics have focused on discovering shared representations of target systems by incorporating physics priors or inductive biases into neural networks. While effective, these methods are limited to the system domain, where the type of system remains consistent and thus cannot ensure the adaptation to new, or unseen physical systems governed by different laws. For instance, a neural network trained on a mass-spring system cannot guarantee accurate predictions for the behavior of a two-body system or any other system with different physical laws. In this work, we take a significant leap forward by targeting cross domain generalization within the field of Hamiltonian dynamics. We model our system with a graph neural network (GNN) and employ a meta learning algorithm to enable the model to gain experience over a distribution of systems and make it adapt to new physics. Our approach aims to learn a unified Hamiltonian representation that is generalizable across multiple system domains, thereby overcoming the limitations of system-specific models. We demonstrate that the meta-trained model captures the generalized Hamiltonian representation that is consistent across different physical domains. Overall, through the use of meta learning, we offer a framework that achieves cross domain generalization, providing a step towards a unified model for understanding a wide array of dynamical systems via deep learning.</description>

      <title>MLQAOA: Graph Learning Accelerated Hybrid Quantum-Classical Multilevel QAOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning the problem structure at multiple levels of coarseness to inform the decomposition-based hybrid quantum-classical combinatorial optimization solvers is a promising approach to scaling up variational approaches. We introduce a multilevel algorithm reinforced with the spectral graph representation learning-based accelerator to tackle large-scale graph maximum cut instances and fused with several versions of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) and QAOA-inspired algorithms. The graph representation learning model utilizes the idea of QAOA variational parameters concentration and substantially improves the performance of QAOA. We demonstrate the potential of using multilevel QAOA and representation learning-based approaches on very large graphs by achieving high-quality solutions in a much faster time. Reproducibility: Our source code and results are available at https://github.com/bachbao/MLQAOA</description>
