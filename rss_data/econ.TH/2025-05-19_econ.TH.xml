      <title>SPARC: Staking Performance And Reward Coopetition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel staking coopetition design aimed at incentivizing decentralization and continuous growth of economic security within a proof-of-stake system. Staking rewards follow a nonlinear mapping relative to stake size. This affords the highest effective yields to smaller operators, fueling network growth and giving users an incentive to delegate their stake to smaller operators. This prevents the preferential accrual and centralization of stake seen in popular blockchains such as Ethereum, where popular liquid staking protocols control large fractions of the total stake thereby having outsized potential impacts on the economic security of the protocol. The proposed system addresses key challenges such as Sybil attacks and offers a comprehensive framework for future research and implementation. We introduce innovative mechanisms and gamification elements, to enhance user engagement and provide transparency in emissions.</description>

      <title>Predicting Financial Market Crises using Multilayer Network Analysis and LSTM-based Forecasting of Spillover Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial crises often occur without warning, yet markets leading up to these events display increasing volatility and complex interdependencies across multiple sectors. This study proposes a novel approach to predicting market crises by combining multilayer network analysis with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, using Granger causality to capture within-layer connections and Random Forest to model interlayer relationships. Specifically, we utilize Granger causality to model the temporal dependencies between market variables within individual layers, such as asset prices, trading values, and returns. To represent the interactions between different market variables across sectors, we apply Random Forest to model the interlayer connections, capturing the spillover effects between these features. The LSTM model is then trained to predict market instability and potential crises based on the dynamic features of the multilayer network. Our results demonstrate that this integrated approach, combining Granger causality, Random Forest, and LSTM, significantly enhances the accuracy of market crisis prediction, outperforming traditional forecasting models. This methodology provides a powerful tool for financial institutions and policymakers to better monitor systemic risks and take proactive measures to mitigate financial crises.</description>

      <title>Unique global solution of an integral-differential equation of Footloose Entrepreneur model in new economic geography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the Footloose Entrepreneur model in new economic geography in continuous space. In an appropriate function space, the model is formulated as an initial value problem for an infinite-dimensional ordinary differential equation. A unique global solution is constructed based on the Banach fixed point theorem. The stability of a homogeneous stationary solution is then investigated and numerical simulations of the asymptotic behavior of the solution are performed. Numerical solutions starting near the unstable homogeneous stationary solution converge to spike-shaped stationary solutions, and the number of spikes decreases with decreasing transport costs and strengthening preference for variety.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Monetary Ecosystems: Integrating Stablecoins and Fiat in the Future of Currency Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With market capitalization exceeding USD 200 billion as of early 2025, stablecoins have evolved from a crypto-focused innovation into a vital component of the global monetary structure. This paper identifies the characteristics of stablecoins from an analytical perspective and investigates the role of stablecoins in forming hybrid monetary ecosystems where public (fiat, CBDC) and private (USDC, USDT, DAI) monies coexist. Through econometric analysis with multiple models, we find that stablecoins maintain strong peg stability, while each type also exhibiting distinctive responses to market variables such as trading volume and capitalization, depending on the mechanisms behind. We introduce a hybrid system design that proposes a two-layer structure where private stablecoin issuers are backed by central bank reserves, ensuring uniformity, security, and programmability. This model merges the advantages of decentralized finance and payment innovation while utilizing the Federal Reserve's institutional trust. A case study on the 2023 SVB-USDC depeg event illustrates how such a hybrid system could prevent panic-induced instability through transparent reserves, secured liquidity, and interoperable assets. Ultimately, this research concludes that a hybrid monetary model not only enhances financial inclusivity, scalability, and dollar utility in digital ecosystems but also strengthens systemic resilience, offering a credible blueprint for future digital dollar architectures.</description>

      <title>A Note on the Continuity of Expected Utility Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16806v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the continuity of expected utility functions, and derive a necessary and sufficient condition for a weak order on the space of simple probabilities to have a continuous expected utility function. We also verify that almost the same condition is necessary and sufficient for a weak order on the space of probabilities with compact-support to have a continuous expected utility function.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Adversarial Attacks on Large Language Model-Based Search Engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing integration of Large Language Model (LLM) based search engines has transformed the landscape of information retrieval. However, these systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially ranking manipulation attacks, where attackers craft webpage content to manipulate the LLM's ranking and promote specific content, gaining an unfair advantage over competitors. In this paper, we study the dynamics of ranking manipulation attacks. We frame this problem as an Infinitely Repeated Prisoners' Dilemma, where multiple players strategically decide whether to cooperate or attack. We analyze the conditions under which cooperation can be sustained, identifying key factors such as attack costs, discount rates, attack success rates, and trigger strategies that influence player behavior. We identify tipping points in the system dynamics, demonstrating that cooperation is more likely to be sustained when players are forward-looking. However, from a defense perspective, we find that simply reducing attack success probabilities can, paradoxically, incentivize attacks under certain conditions. Furthermore, defensive measures to cap the upper bound of attack success rates may prove futile in some scenarios. These insights highlight the complexity of securing LLM-based systems. Our work provides a theoretical foundation and practical insights for understanding and mitigating their vulnerabilities, while emphasizing the importance of adaptive security strategies and thoughtful ecosystem design.</description>
