      <title>Structure Formation under Inelastic Two-Component Dark Matter: Halo Statistics and Matter Power Spectra in the High-$z$ Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present hydrodynamic simulations of a flavour-mixed two-component dark matter (2cDM) model that utilize IllustrisTNG baryonic physics. The model parameters are explored for two sets of power laws of the velocity-dependent cross sections, favoured on the basis of previous studies. The model is shown to suppress the formation of structures at scales $k\gtrsim 10^2\ h\text{ Mpc}^{-1}$ up to 40\% compared to cold dark matter (CDM) at redshifts $z\sim5-2$. We compare our results to structure enhancement and suppression due to cosmological and astrophysical parameters presented in the literature and find that 2cDM effects remain relevant at galactic and subgalactic scales. The results indicate the robustness of the role of nongravitational dark matter interactions in structure formation and the absence of putative degeneracies introduced by baryonic feedback at high $z$. The predictions made can be further tested with future Ly-$\alpha$ forest observations.</description>

      <title>Illuminating the Physics of Dark Energy with the Discovery Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the Discovery simulations: a new pair of high-resolution N-body simulations motivated by the DESI Y1 BAO cosmological constraints on dark energy. The Discovery simulations were run with identical initial conditions, and differ only in their cosmological parameters. The first simulation is based on a flat $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ cosmology, while the second is based on a $w_0 w_a\mathrm{CDM}$ cosmology, with particular parameter values chosen based on the DESI analysis which includes constraints from BAO with CMB priors. Both simulations evolve $6720^3$ particles in a box with a side length of $L_\mathrm{box} = 1.5$ Gpc, leading to a mass resolution of $\sim4 \times 10^8$ $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ in each simulation. In this work we demonstrate the impact of the $w_0 w_a\mathrm{CDM}$ cosmology on the matter power spectrum, halo mass function, and halo mass accretion rate. We also populate halos with galaxies using a novel forward model for in-situ star formation, and examine the way in which changes to cosmology manifest as changes in star formation history. The Discovery simulations provide a testbed for alternative cosmological probes that may offer additional constraining power beyond BAO, such as higher-order summary statistics and observables in the nonlinear regime. Halo catalogs from the Discovery simulations are publicly available and can be downloaded from the HACC Simulation Data Portal.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Impact of LSST $u$-band Survey Strategy on Photometric Redshift Estimation and the Detection of Lyman-break Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will conduct the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), promising to discover billions of galaxies out to redshift 7, using six photometric bands ($ugrizy$) spanning the near-ultraviolet to the near-infrared. The exact number of and quality of information about these galaxies will depend on survey depth in these six bands, which in turn depends on the LSST survey strategy: i.e., how often and how long to expose in each band. $u$-band depth is especially important for photometric redshift (photo-z) estimation and for detection of high-redshift Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs). In this paper we use a simulated galaxy catalog and an analytic model for the LBG population to study how recent updates and proposed changes to Rubin's $u$-band throughput and LSST survey strategy impact photo-z accuracy and LBG detection. We find that proposed variations in $u$-band strategy have a small impact on photo-z accuracy for $z &lt; 1.5$ galaxies, but the outlier fraction, scatter, and bias for higher redshift galaxies varies by up to 50%, depending on the survey strategy considered. The number of $u$-band dropout LBGs at $z \sim 3$ is also highly sensitive to the $u$-band depth, varying by up to 500%, while the number of $griz$-band dropouts is only modestly affected. Under the new $u$-band strategy recommended by the Rubin Survey Cadence Optimization Committee, we predict $u$-band dropout number densities of $110$ deg$^{-2}$ (3200 deg$^{-2}$) in year 1 (10) of LSST. We discuss the implications of these results for LSST cosmology.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Evolutions of Fundamental Constants from Clustering of Fast Radio Burst Dispersion Measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constrained measurements of fundamental physical constants using astronomical observational data represent a powerful method for investigating potential new physics. In particular, the dispersion measure (DM) of fast radio bursts (FRBs), which probes the electron density along their propagation paths, may be influenced by the space-time variation of the fine-structure constant \(\alpha\). In this study, we analyze the cross-correlation signal between foreground galaxies and the DM of background FRBs to constrain the evolution of \(\alpha\). Assuming large-scale structure (LSS) galaxy surveys with the capabilities of the China Space Station Telescope (CSST) at \(z=0.15\) and { a mock FRB survey with \(N_{\text{FRB}}=10^5\) at \(z=0.4\), we test how well \(\alpha\) variation can be constrained}, with a standard deviation of \(\sigma(\Delta \alpha / \alpha) = 0.0007\) at \(z=0.15\). Furthermore, taking into account the nonminimal coupling between the scalar field and the electromagnetic field, the variation in \(\alpha\) can lead to the non-conservation of photon number along geodesics. This would result in a violation of the CDDR and affect the evolution of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature. In this work, we { obtain constraints results} on the CDDR parameter \(\eta\) and the parameter \(\beta\) governing CMB temperature evolution at \(z=0.15\), yielding \(\sigma(\eta) = 0.0004\) and \(\sigma(\beta) = 0.0006\), respectively. Finally, we relate the variation in \(\alpha\) to the time evolution of the proton-to-electron mass ratio, { reporting a standard deviation} of \(\sigma(\Delta \mu/\mu) = 0.002\) at $z=0.15$. Future FRB surveys hold significant potential for advancing our understanding of the evolution of fundamental physical constants.</description>

      <title>A Hubble Constant Determination Through Quasar Time Delays and Type Ia Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new model-independent constraint on the Hubble constant ($H_0$) by anchoring relative distances from Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) observations to absolute distance measurements from time-delay strong Gravitational Lensing (SGL) systems. The approach only uses the validity of the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR) to derive constraints on $H_0$. By using Gaussian Process (GP) regression to reconstruct the unanchored luminosity distance from the Pantheon$+$ compilation to match the time-delay angular diameter distance at the redshift of the lenses, one yields a value of \mbox{$H_0 = 75.57 \pm 4.415$ km/s/Mpc} at a 68\% confidence level. The result aligns well with the local estimate from Cepheid variables within the $1\sigma$ confidence region, indicating consistency with late-universe probes.</description>

      <title>The dynamical and thermodynamic effects of turbulence for the cosmic baryonic fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both simulations and observations indicate that the so-called missing baryons reside in the intergalactic medium (IGM) known as the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM). In this article, we demonstrate that turbulence in the cosmic baryonic fluid is crucial for correctly understanding both the spatial distribution and the physical origins of the missing baryons in the universe. First, we find that dynamical effects cause the gas to be detained in low-density and intermediate-density regions, resulting in high baryon fractions, while prevent the inflow of the gas in high-density regions, leading to low baryon fractions. Second, turbulent energy is converted into thermal energy, and the injection and dissipation of turbulent energy have essentially reached a balance from $z=1$ to $0$. This indicates that the cosmic fluid is in a state of fully-developed turbulence within this redshift range. Due to turbulent heating, as redshift decreases, an increasing amount of warm gas is heated and transitions into the WHIM, and some even into hot gas.</description>

      <title>Redshift-Space Distortions in Massive Neutrinos Cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Kaiser formula for biased tracers in massive neutrino cosmologies by comparing its predictions with a large set of N-body simulations. In particular, we examine the ambiguity in the definition of the peculiar velocity contribution at linear level, whether it should be expressed in terms of the total matter velocity field or only the cold-matter component, comprised of cold dark matter and baryons. We revisit and extend previous qualitative studies on the topic with larger statistics and including a full fit of halo power spectrum and halo-matter cross-power spectrum measurements. We find clear evidence that the clustering of halos in redshift space is correctly described assuming that halo velocity is tracing the velocity field of cold-matter. The opposite assumption provides a worse fit to the simulated data and can lead to a spurious running of nuisance parameters in the perturbative galaxy power spectrum model.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Survey: implications for cosmological expansion models from the final DES Baryon Acoustic Oscillation and Supernova data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dark Energy Survey (DES) recently released the final results of its two principal probes of the expansion history: Type Ia Supernovae (SNe) and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). In this paper, we explore the cosmological implications of these data in combination with external Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), and age-of-the-Universe information. The BAO measurement, which is $\sim2\sigma$ away from Planck's $\Lambda$CDM predictions, pushes for low values of $\Omega_{\rm m}$ compared to Planck, in contrast to SN which prefers a higher value than Planck. We identify several tensions among datasets in the $\Lambda$CDM model that cannot be resolved by including either curvature ($k\Lambda$CDM) or a constant dark energy equation of state ($w$CDM). By combining BAO+SN+CMB despite these mild tensions, we obtain $\Omega_k=-5.5^{+4.6}_{-4.2}\times10^{-3}$ in $k\Lambda$CDM, and $w=-0.948^{+0.028}_{-0.027}$ in $w$CDM. If we open the parameter space to $w_0$$w_a$CDM\$ (where the equation of state of dark energy varies as $w(a)=w_0+(1-a)w_a$), all the datasets are mutually more compatible, and we find concordance in the $[w_0&gt;-1,w_a&lt;0]$ quadrant. For DES BAO and SN in combination with Planck-CMB, we find a $3.2\sigma$ deviation from $\Lambda$CDM, with $w_0=-0.673^{+0.098}_{-0.097}$, $w_a = -1.37^{+0.51}_{-0.50}$, a Hubble constant of $H_0=67.81^{+0.96}_{-0.86}$km s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$, and an abundance of matter of $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.3109^{+0.0086}_{-0.0099}$. For the combination of all the background cosmological probes considered (including CMB $\theta_\star$), we still find a deviation of $2.8\sigma$ from $\Lambda$CDMin the $w_0-w_a$ plane. Assuming a minimal neutrino mass, this work provides further evidence for non-$\Lambda$CDM physics or systematics, which is consistent with recent claims in support of evolving dark energy.</description>

      <title>Do JWST reionization (optical depth) puzzle, cosmological tensions, and CMB anomalies imply Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has observed massive galaxies at high redshifts, which implies an earlier epoch of reionization (EoR) compared with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) results. In this paper, based on \texttt{Planck 2020} (NPIPE release), \texttt{ACT DR4} and \texttt{SPT-3G} data, if assumed a Harrison-Zel'dovich (HZ) primordial power spectrum in the standard cosmological model, we discover that the redshift or optical depth of reionization is larger than the case of a power-law (PL) primordial power spectrum. In HZ-$ \Lambda $CDM model, the redshift of reionization is $ z_\text{reio} = 9.11 \pm 0.61 $, which is consistent with the JWST result that $ z_\text{reio} \approx 8.9 $. Moreover, the cosmological tensions, i.e. Hubble ($H_0$) tension and $ S_8 $ tension are alleviated in HZ-$ \Lambda $CDM case. The Hubble constant is $ H_0 = 70.38 \pm 0.35 \, \text{km}/\text{s}/\text{Mpc}$ and the structure growth parameter is $ S_8 = 0.7645\pm 0.0094 $ in HZ-$ \Lambda $CDM model. We also consider two extensions of $ \Lambda $CDM, including $ \Lambda $CDM$ + A_\text{L} $ and $ \Lambda $CDM$ + \Omega_\text{k} $ models. But the extensions of $ \Lambda $CDM with a HZ spectrum meet more serious CMB anomalies, i.e. lensing anomaly and spatial curvature anomaly as compared with the extensions of $ \Lambda $CDM with a PL spectrum. We discuss that these two CMB anomalies may come from the degeneracy of cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>The Topology of Rayleigh-Levy Flights in Two Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rayleigh-L\'evy flights are simplified cosmological tools which capture certain essential statistical properties of the cosmic density field, including hierarchical structures in higher-order correlations, making them a valuable reference for studying the highly non-linear regime of structure formation. Unlike standard Markovian processes, they exhibit long-range correlations at all orders. Following on recent work on one dimensional flights, this study explores the one-point statistics and Minkowski functionals (density PDF, perimeter, Euler characteristic) of Rayleigh-L\'evy flights in two dimensions. We derive the Euler characteristic in the mean field approximation and the density PDF and iso-field perimeter $W_{1}$ in beyond mean field calculations, and validate the results against simulations. The match is excellent throughout, even for fields with large variances, in particular when finite volume effects in the simulations are taken into account and when the calculation is extended beyond the mean field.</description>

      <title>Simulation-Based Priors without Simulations: an Analytic Perspective on EFT Parameters of Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective field theory (EFT)-based full-shape analysis with simulation-based priors (SBPs) is a novel approach to galaxy clustering data analysis, which significantly boosts the constraining power by efficiently incorporating field-level simulation information from small scales. So far, SBPs have been mostly extracted from a large set of mock catalogs generated with the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) approach. We show that given a halo mass function model and assuming that the EFT parameters of halos depend only on the peak height, HOD-based priors can be computed analytically for the standard 7-parameter HOD model. We derive the relevant expressions for deterministic EFT parameters from the halo model. The halo model, however, fails to accurately describe stochastic EFT parameters, for which we use a physically motivated phenomenological prescription. We compare our analytic priors with simulations and find an excellent agreement. Our approach provides analytic insights into the physics behind the EFT parameters of galaxies, and allows one to reduce the computation time of SBPs to virtually nothing. As an application, we produce a set of 100,000 EFT parameters by sampling both HOD and cosmological models, and explicitly demonstrate that any cosmology dependence can be completely absorbed by relatively minor shifts of the HOD parameters. Our approach can be generalized to other variants of the HOD and cosmological models beyond $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Emulating the Non-Linear Matter Power-Spectrum in Mixed Axion Dark Matter Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to constrain ultra light dark matter models with current and near future weak lensing surveys we need the predictions for the non-linear dark matter power-spectrum. This is commonly extracted from numerical simulations or from using semi-analytical methods. For ultra light dark matter models such numerical simulations are often very expensive due to the need of having a very low force-resolution often limiting them to very small simulation boxes which do not contain very large scales. In this work we take a different approach by relying on fast, approximate $N$-body simulations. In these simulations, axion physics are only included in the initial conditions, allowing us to run a large number of simulations with varying axion and cosmological parameters. From our simulation suite we use machine learning tools to create an emulator for the ratio of the dark matter power-spectrum in mixed axion models - models where dark matter is a combination of CDM and axion - to that of $\Lambda$CDM. The resulting emulator only needs to be combined with existing emulators for $\Lambda$CDM to be able to be used in parameter constraints. We compare the emulator to semi-analytical methods, but a more thorough test to full simulations to verify the true accuracy of this approach is not possible at the present time and is left for future work.</description>

      <title>Influence of finite-temperature effects on CMB power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the implications of finite-temperature quantum field theory effects on cosmological parameters within the framework of the $\Lambda$CDM model and its modification. By incorporating temperature-dependent corrections to the cosmological constant, we extend the standard cosmological model to include additional density parameters, $\Omega_{\Lambda_2}$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda_3}$, which arise from finite-T quantum gravitational effects. Using the Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System, we analyze the impact of these corrections on the cosmic microwave background power spectrum and compare the results with the Planck 2018 data. Through brute-force parameter scans and advanced machine learning techniques, including quartic regression, we demonstrate that the inclusion of $\Omega_{\Lambda_2}$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda_3}$ improves the model's predictive accuracy, achieving high $R^2$ values and low mean squared error. The present work paves the way for future research into higher-order corrections and enhanced computational methods for cosmological parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Bunch-Davies initial conditions and non-perturbative inflationary dynamics in Numerical Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that it is possible to simulate realistic inhomogeneities during cosmological inflation with high precision using numerical relativity. Stochastic initial conditions are set in line with the Bunch-Davies vaccuum and satisfy the Hamiltonian and Momentum constraints of General Relativity to leading order in perturbation theory. The subsequent fully non-linear dynamical evolution is formulated within a family of geodesic gauges but can in principle be adapted to any choice of coordinates. We present 3 examples of inflationary dynamics: a simple quadratic potential, a potential with an inflection point and a strong resonance model. When perturbations are small, we recover standard predictions of cosmological perturbation theory, and we quantify strongly non-linear inhomogeneities when non-perturbative configurations emerge, such as in the strong resonance model. Our results pave the way towards the first realistic non-perturbative, and fully non-linear Numerical Relativity simulations of the early inflationary universe.</description>

      <title>Metastable Cosmic Strings and Gravitational Waves from Flavour Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metastable cosmic strings (MSCSs) are among the best-fitting explanations of the 2023 pulsar timing array (PTA) signal for gravitational waves at nanohertz frequencies. We propose the novel possibility that a network of MSCSs generating this signal originates from the multi-step spontaneous breaking of a gauged flavour symmetry. As a specific example, we construct a model of $SU(2)$ flavour symmetry in the context of $SU(5)$ grand unification, where the $SU(2)$ acts exclusively on the first two generations of the matter 10-plet, such that it is ``right for leptons'' and allows for large lepton mixing. The model explains the mass hierarchies of the Standard Model fermions, and predicts the string scale of the MSCSs in a range compatible with the 2023 PTA signal. Cosmic inflation is associated with the latter step of (two-step) family symmetry breaking, and the phase transition ending inflation generates the cosmic string network.</description>

      <title>GHOST commissioning science results -- IV: Chemodynamical analyses of Milky Way satellites Sagittarius II and Aquarius II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Gemini/GHOST high-resolution spectra of five stars observed in two low surface brightness Milky Way satellites, Sagittarius II (Sgr2) and Aquarius II (Aqu2). For Aqu2, the velocities and metallicities of the two stars are consistent with membership in a dark matter-dominated ultra faint dwarf galaxy (UFD). The chemical abundance ratios suggest inefficient star formation from only one or a few supernovae (e.g., low Na, Sr, Ba), and enriched potassium (K) from super-AGB stars. For Sgr2, the velocity and metallicity dispersions of its members are not clearly resolved and our detailed chemical abundances show typical ratios for metal-poor stars, with low dispersions. There is only one exception - we report the discovery of an r-process enhanced star (Sgr2584, [Eu/Fe]= $+0.7 \pm 0.2 $; thus, an r-I star). As r-I stars are found in both UFDs (Tuc III, Tuc IV, Grus II) and globular clusters (M15 and M92), then this does not help to further classify the nature of Sgr2. Our exploration of Sgr2 demonstrates the difficulty in classifying some of the faintest (ambiguous) satellites. We advocate for additional diagnostics in analysing the ambiguous systems, such as exploring radial segregation (by mass and/or chemistry), N-body simulations, and the need for dark matter to survive Galactic tidal effects. The spectra analysed in this paper were taken as part of the GHOST commissioning observations, testing faint observation limits (G &lt; 18.8) and the single and double IFU observing modes.</description>

      <title>Divergence-free deceleration and energy conditions in non-minimal $f(R,T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the divergence-free parametric form of the deceleration parameter within the simplest non-minimal matter-geometry coupling in $f(R,T)$ gravity, where $R$ is the Ricci scalar and $T$ is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. Specifically, we consider the linear model $f(R,T) = R + 2\lambda T$, where $\lambda$ governs the interaction between matter and geometry. Using this parametric form, we derive the Hubble parameter as a function of redshift $z$ and incorporate it into the modified Friedmann equations. Constraining the model with OHD and Pantheon data, we obtain precise estimates for $H_0$, the present deceleration parameter $q_0$, and its evolutionary component $q_1$, confirming a smooth transition between cosmic deceleration and acceleration. Further, we analyze the evolution of the energy density $\rho$ and total EoS parameter $\omega$ for different $\lambda$ values, highlighting deviations from $\Lambda$CDM and the role of $\lambda$ in shaping cosmic dynamics. In addition, we examine energy conditions, finding that the NEC and DEC are satisfied throughout evolution, while the SEC is violated at late times, supporting the observed acceleration. Our findings demonstrate that this divergence-free parameterization within $f(R,T)$ gravity offers a viable framework for explaining late-time cosmic acceleration while maintaining key observational and theoretical constraints.</description>

      <title>Testing the Starobinsky model of inflation with resonant cavities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that in the Starobinsky inflation model stochastic gravitational waves are produced when the scalaron - which is the massive scalar mode of the metric - decays into gravitons during reheating. This decay is accompanied by decay of scalaron into matter as well through a similar coupling, proving an efficient reheating stage. The stochastic gravitational waves thus produced have characteristic strain $h_c\sim 10^{-35}-10^{-34}$ in the frequency range $10^{5}-10^{12}\, {\rm Hz}$ which makes them accessible to resonant cavity searches for graviton to photon conversions. Their detection could conclusively validate the Starobinsky inflation model.</description>

      <title>JWST ASPIRE: How Did Galaxies Complete Reionization? Evidence for Excess IGM Transmission around ${\rm [O\,{\scriptstyle III}]}$ Emitters during Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spatial correlation between galaxies and the Ly$\alpha$ forest provides insights into how galaxies reionized the Universe. Here, we present initial results on the spatial cross-correlation between [OIII] emitters and Ly$\alpha$ forest at 5.4&lt;z&lt;6.5 from the JWST ASPIRE NIRCam/F356W Grism Spectroscopic Survey in z&gt;6.5 QSO fields. Using data from five QSO fields, we find $2\sigma$ evidence for excess Ly$\alpha$ forest transmission at ~20-40 cMpc around [OIII] emitters at z=5.86, indicating that [OIII] emitters reside within a highly ionized IGM. At smaller scales, the Ly$\alpha$ forest is preferentially absorbed, suggesting gas overdensities around [OIII] emitters. Comparing with models including THESAN simulations, we interpret the observed cross-correlation as evidence for significant large-scale fluctuations of the IGM and the late end of reionization at z&lt;6, characterized by ionized bubbles over 50 cMpc around [OIII] emitters. The required UV background necessitates an unseen population of faint galaxies around the [OIII] emitters. Furthermore, we find that the number of observed [OIII] emitters near individual transmission spikes is insufficient to sustain reionization in their surroundings, even assuming all [OIII] emitters harbour AGN with 100 % LyC escape fractions. Despite broad agreement, a careful analysis of ASPIRE and THESAN, using the observed host halo mass from the clustering of [OIII] emitters, suggests that the simulations underpredict the observed excess IGM transmission around [OIII] emitters, challenging our model of reionization. Potential solutions include larger ionized bubbles at z&lt;6, more enhanced large-scale UV background or temperature fluctuations of the IGM, and possibly a patchy early onset of reionization at z&gt;10. Current observational errors are dominated by cosmic variance, meaning future analyses of more QSO fields from JWST will improve the results.</description>

      <title>Is MOND necessarily nonlinear?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The iconic, deep-MOND-limit (DML) relation between acceleration and mass, $a\sim (M\mathcal{A}_0)^{1/2}/r$, implies that, in MOND, accelerations cannot be linear in the mass distribution ($\mathcal{A}_0\equiv Ga_0$ is the DML constant, and $a_0$ the MOND acceleration). This leads to important idiosyncracies of MOND, such as a breakdown of the strong equivalence principle, and the resulting ``external-field effect''. I show that the DML axioms are, in themselves, consistent with a, possibly unique, nonrelativistic, action-based, linear formulation of the DML. This model suffers from important drawbacks, which may make it unacceptable as a basis for a full-fledged MOND theory. The model is unique among MOND theories propounded to date not only in being linear -- hence not exhibiting an external-field effect, for example -- but in constituting a modification of both Newtonian inertia and Newtonian gravity. This linear and time-local model inspires and begets several, one-parameter families of models. One family employs nonlinear, time-nonlocal kinetic terms, but still linear gravitational-field equations. Other families generalize the DMLs of AQUAL and QUMOND, modifying gravity as well as inertia. All families employ fractional time derivatives and possibly fractional Laplacians. At present, I cannot base some acceptable MOND theory on these models -- for example, I cannot offer a sensible umbrella theory that interpolates between these DML models and Newtonian dynamics. They are, however, quite useful in elucidating various matter-of-principle aspects of MOND; e.g., they help to understand which predictions follow from only the basic tenets of MOND -- so-called primary predictions -- and which are secondary, i.e., theory dependent. The models may also show the way to a wider class of MOND theories. (Abridged.)</description>

      <title>Probing Reionization-Era Galaxies with JWST UV Luminosity Functions and Large-Scale Clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has transformed our understanding of early galaxy formation, providing an unprecedented view of the first billion years of cosmic history. These observations offer a crucial opportunity to probe the interplay between galaxy formation and reionization, placing stringent constraints on theoretical models. In this work, we build upon our previously developed semi-analytical framework that self-consistently models the evolving UV luminosity function (UVLF) of galaxies and the global reionization history while incorporating the effects of radiative feedback. Comparing our predictions with JWST and HST data, we identify a fundamental tension: models that match the UVLF fail to reproduce the observed evolution of galaxy clustering (bias) with redshift, and vice versa. To resolve this, we introduce a mass-dependent duty cycle linked to star formation duration. This duty cycle approaches unity at $z &gt; 11$, requiring either enhanced UV radiation production or increased star formation efficiency to match the JWST UVLFs, while declining towards lower redshifts ($5 &lt; z \leq 9$) to remain consistent with the bias measurements. Reconciling theory with observations requires that the characteristic star formation timescale increases from $\approx 80$ Myr at $z \approx 6$ to $\approx 120$ Myr at $z \approx 8$. Finally, our extended model, assuming a halo mass-independent escape fraction of $\approx 12\%$, produces a reionization history consistent with current constraints. These findings underscore the importance of jointly constraining high-redshift galaxy models using both UVLF and bias statistics to accurately interpret JWST data and refine our understanding of early cosmic evolution.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian Perturbation Theory for Biased Tracers: Significance of the Number Conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07046v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lagrangian perturbation theory provides a simple yet powerful way of computing the nonlinear matter power spectrum, and it has been applied to biased tracers such as halos and galaxies. The number conservation of matter particles allows a simple relation between the fluctuations at the initial and the late times, which is essential in deriving the exact expression for the nonlinear matter power spectrum. Here we investigate the significance of the number conservation in the Lagrangian perturbation theory for biased tracers. We use $N$-body simulations to test the significance of number conservation by tracing dark matter halo samples in time. For the mass bin sample $\Delta \log M_h~(h^{-1}M_{\odot})= 0.5$ at $z\simeq3$, the theoretical predictions for the halos overestimates the power spectrum at $z=0$ by a factor of three, while the simulation results match the theoretical predictions if the number conservation of halos is imposed in the simulations throughout the evolution. Starting with a halo sample at $z=0$ as another test, we trace back in time the particles that belong to the halos at~$z=0$ and use their center-of-mass positions as halo positions at $z&gt;0$. The halo power spectra at $z&gt;0$ from the simulations agree with the theoretical predictions of the Lagrangian perturbation theory. This numerical experiment proves that the number conservation is crucial in the Lagrangian perturbation theory predictions. We discuss the implications for various applications of the Lagrangian perturbation theory for biased tracers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decaying dark matter (DDM) can be tested via different astrophysical and cosmological probes. In particular, particles in the $\sim$ 9.5 - 30 eV mass range that decay into monochromatic photons, would contribute to the extragalactic background light (EBL) in the ultraviolet (UV) bandwidth. In this work, we show that an intriguing improvement to the constraints on such DDM models can come from broadband UV surveys, such as GALEX or the upcoming ULTRASAT satellite. These provide diffuse light maps of the UV EBL, integrated over a wide redshift range. The cross correlation between intensity fluctuations in these maps with a reference spectroscopic galaxy survey, can be used to reconstruct the redshift evolution of the EBL intensity; in this way, it is also possible to detect signatures of contributions from DDM. We forecast the constraining power of (GALEX+ULTRASAT)$\times$DESI, and we show they will be able to detect DDM with decay rate up to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-26}\,{\rm s})$. In the context of axion-like particles (ALP), our forecasts can be converted to constraints on the ALP-photon coupling; our results show this technique will test ALP with coupling $\lesssim\mathcal{O}(10^{-12}\,{\rm GeV^{-1}})$, more than an order of magnitude better than current bounds in this mass range.</description>

      <title>Primordial Stochastic Gravitational Wave Backgrounds from a Sharp Feature in Three-field Inflation II: The Inflationary Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09023v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the contribution of large scalar perturbations sourced by a sharp feature during cosmic inflation to the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), extending our previous work to include the SGWB sourced during the inflationary era. We focus in particular on three-field inflation, since the third dynamical field is the first not privileged by the perturbations' equations of motion and allows a more direct generalization to $N$-field inflation. For the first time, we study the three-field isocurvature perturbations sourced during the feature and include the effects of isocurvature masses. In addition to a two-field limit, we find that the third field's dynamics during the feature can source large isocurvature transients which then later decay, leaving an inflationary-era-sourced SGWB as their only observable signature. We find that the inflationary-era signal shape near the peak is largely independent of the number of dynamical fields and has a greatly enhanced amplitude sourced by the large isocurvature transient, suppressing the radiation-era contribution and opening a new window of detectable parameter space with small adiabatic enhancement. The largest enhancements we study could easily violate backreaction constraints, but much of parameter space remains under perturbative control. These SGWBs could be visible in LISA and other gravitational wave experiments, leaving an almost universal signature of sharp features during multi-field inflation, even when the sourcing isocurvature decays to unobservability shortly afterwards.</description>

      <title>Improved Halo Model Calibrations for Mixed Dark Matter Models of Ultralight Axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the implications of relaxing the requirement for ultralight axions to account for all dark matter in the Universe by examining mixed dark matter (MDM) cosmologies with axion fractions $f \leq 0.3$ within the fuzzy dark matter (FDM) window $10^{-25}$ eV $\lesssim m \lesssim 10^{-23}$ eV. Our simulations, using a new MDM gravity solver implemented in AxiREPO, capture wave dynamics across various scales with high accuracy down to redshifts $z\approx 1$. We identify halos with Rockstar using the CDM component and find good agreement of inferred halo mass functions (HMFs) and concentration-mass relations with theoretical models across redshifts $z=1-10$. This justifies our halo finder approach a posteriori as well as the assumptions underlying the MDM halo model AxionHMcode. Using the inferred axion halo mass-cold halo mass relation $M_{\text{a}}(M_{\text{c}})$ and calibrating a generalised smoothing parameter $\alpha$ to our MDM simulations, we present a new version of AxionHMcode. The code exhibits excellent agreement with simulations on scales $k&lt; 20 \ h$ cMpc$^{-1}$ at redshifts $z=1-3.5$ for $f\leq 0.1$ around the fiducial axion mass $m = 10^{-24.5}$ eV $ = 3.16\times 10^{-25}$ eV, with maximum deviations remaining below 10%. For axion fractions $f\leq 0.3$, the model maintains accuracy with deviations under 20% at redshifts $z\approx 1$ and scales $k&lt; 10 \ h$ cMpc$^{-1}$, though deviations can reach up to 30% for higher redshifts when $f=0.3$. Reducing the run-time for a single evaluation of AxionHMcode to below $1$ minute, these results highlight the potential of AxionHMcode to provide a robust framework for parameter sampling across MDM cosmologies in Bayesian constraint and forecast analyses.</description>

      <title>General parametrization for energy density of quintessence field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general parametrization for energy density of a quintessence field, a minimally coupled canonical scalar field which rolls down slowly during the late time. This parametrization can mimic all classes of quintessence dynamics, namely scaling-freezing, tracker and thawing dynamics for any redshift. For thawing dynamics the parametrization needs two free parameters while for scaling-freezing and tracker dynamics it needs at least four free parameters. More parameters make the model less interesting from the observational data analysis point of view but as we expect more precise data in future it may be possible to constrain the models with multiple free parameters which can tell about the dynamics more precisely. One of the main advantage of this parametrization is that it reduces the computational time to significant amount while mimicking the actual scalar field dynamics for all redshifts which may not be possible with other existing parametrizations. We compare the parametrization with two and four parameters with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, $w$CDM and Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrizations using cosmological observational data from Planck 2018 (distance priors), DESI $2024$ DR1, PantheonPlus, Hubble parameter measurements and the redshift space distortion. We find that the observational data prefers standard $\Lambda$CDM model over other models. If we allow phantom region then it is more preferred by the data compared to non-phantom thawing quintessence. Our analysis does not show any preference of the dynamical dark energy over a cosmological constant except for the CPL parametrization.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the primordial curvature perturbations at small scales between $4.5\times 10^{18}$ and $1.8\times 10^{21}~\rm Mpc^{-1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18887v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation $\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}$ has been measured with high precision on large scales $10^{-4}\lesssim k\lesssim 3~\rm Mpc^{-1}$, basing on the observations of cosmic microwave background, Lyman-$\alpha$ forest and large scale structure. On small scales $3\lesssim k \lesssim 10^{23}~\rm Mpc^{-1}$, the constrains are mainly from the studies on the primordial black holes (PBHs). Specifically, on small scales $10^{17}\lesssim k\lesssim 10^{23}~{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$, the limits arise from studies on the lightest supersymmetric particles produced by PBHs radiation and the stable Planck-mass relics after its evaporation. It has been demonstrated that the big bang nucleosynthesis can be used to constrain the initial fraction of PBHs with masses $10^{9}\lesssim M_{\rm PBH}\lesssim 10^{13}~{\rm g}$, corresponding to the scales $10^{16}\lesssim k\lesssim 10^{18}~{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$. Recently, on one hand, it is found that the evaporation of light PBHs ($M_{\rm PBH}\lesssim 10^{9}\rm g$) can modify the expansion rate of the Universe and the baryon-to-photon ratio, resulting in the influences on the primordial abundance of light nuclei. On the other hand, it has been proposed that the `memory burden' effect can slow down the mass loss rate of black hole (BH), leading to the existence of light PBHs by now. Based on the recent theoretical research process of BH and the limits on the (initial) mass fraction of light PBHs with masses $10^{4}\lesssim M_{\rm PBH}\lesssim 10^{10}~\rm g$, we derive new constraints on $\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}$ on small scales $1.5\times 10^{18}\lesssim k\lesssim 2.5\times 10^{21}~\rm Mpc^{-1}$, which are rarely studied in previous literature.</description>

      <title>Composite Dark Energy and the Cosmological Tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15124v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard cosmological model currently in force, aka $\Lambda$CDM, has been plagued with a variety of tensions in the last decade or so, which puts it against the wall. At the core of the $\Lambda$CDM we have a rigid cosmological term, $\Lambda$, for the entire cosmic history. Recently, the results from the DESI collaboration suggested the possibility that dark energy (DE) should be dynamical rather than just a cosmological constant. Using a generic $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization, DESI favors quintessence behavior at $\sim 3\sigma$ c.l. However, to alleviate the tensions the DE needs more features. In the proposed $w$XCDM model of [45] the DE is actually a composite cosmic fluid with two components $(X,Y)$ acting sequentially: first $X$ (above a transition redshift $z_t$) and second $Y$ (below $z_t$). Fitting the model to the data, we find that the late component $Y$ behaves as quintessence, like DESI. However, to cure the $H_0$ and growth tensions, $X$ must behave as `phantom matter' (PM), which in contrast to phantom DE provides positive pressure at the expense of negative energy density. Using the SNIa (considering separately Pantheon$+$ and DESY5), cosmic chronometers, transversal BAO, LSS data, and the full CMB likelihood from Planck 2018, we find that both tensions can be completely cut down. We also compare the $w$XCDM with our own results using the standard $w$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM parameterizations of the DE. In all cases, model $w$XCDM performs much better. Finally, we have repeated our analysis with BAO 3D data (replacing BAO 2D), and we still find that the main dynamical DE models (including composite ones) provide a much better fit quality compared to $\Lambda$CDM. The growth tension is alleviated again, but in contrast, the $H_0$-tension remains significant, which is most likely reminiscent of the internal conflict in the BAO sector.</description>

      <title>Little ado about everything II: an `emergent' dark energy from structure formation to rule cosmic tensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: [abridged] The $\eta$CDM framework is a new cosmological model aimed to cure some drawbacks of the standard $\Lambda$CDM scenario, such as the origin of the accelerated expansion at late times, the cosmic tensions, and the violation of the cosmological principle due to the progressive development of inhomogeneous/anisotropic conditions in the Universe during structure formation. To this purpose, the model adopts a statistical perspective envisaging a stochastic evolution of large-scale patches in the Universe with typical sizes $10-50\, h^{-1}$ Mpc, which is meant to describe the complex gravitational processes leading to the formation of the cosmic web. The stochasticity among different patches is technically rendered via the diverse realizations of a multiplicative noise term (`a little ado') in the cosmological equations, and the overall background evolution of the Universe is then operationally defined as an average over the patch ensemble. In this paper we show that such an ensemble-averaged evolution in $\eta$CDM can be described in terms of a spatially flat cosmology and of an `emergent' dark energy with a time-dependent equation of state, able to originate the cosmic acceleration with the right timing and to solve the coincidence problem. Then we test the $\eta$CDM model against the most recent supernova type-I$a$, baryon acoustic oscillations and structure growth rate datasets, finding an excellent agreement. Remarkably, we demonstrate that $\eta$CDM is able to alleviate simultaneously both the $H_0$ and the $f\sigma_8$ tensions. Finally, we discuss that the Linders' diagnostic test could be helpful to better distinguish $\eta$CDM from the standard scenario in the near future via upcoming galaxy redshift surveys at intermediate redshifts such as those being conducted by the Euclid mission.</description>

      <title>Implementing a Robust Test of Galaxy Catalogue Completeness for Dark Siren Measurements of the Hubble Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the application of a robust test of galaxy catalogue completeness to the gwcosmo pipeline. The method implements a straightforward statistical test for determining the apparent magnitude completeness limit of a magnitude-redshift sample. This offers an improved, less conservative approach compared with how galaxy catalogue completeness is currently estimated in the gwcosmo gravitational wave cosmology pipeline for determining the Hubble constant $H_{0}$. The test also does not require prior knowledge of the luminosity function, and thus returns a more robust estimate of the limiting apparent magnitude for a magnitude-redshift sample of galaxies. For GWTC-1 results using $B_{J}$-band photometry of galaxies in the GLADE catalogue, we find a $3.4\%$ improvement on the inference of $H_{0}$ using dark sirens only and a $1.3\%$ improvement for the combined posterior with GW170817. Using GLADE+, there is a $8.6\%$ improvement with dark sirens only and a $6.3\%$ improvement for the combined posterior with GW170817. However, the final posterior on $H_{0}$ using the GWTC-3 dataset with the GLADE+ $K$-band shows no improvement when applying the robust method. This is because the GLADE+ galaxy catalogue provides little or no coverage in the $K$-band for any of the GWTC-3 events. With the use of deeper galaxy catalogues in future gravitational wave cosmology analyses, the adoption of a less conservative estimate of magnitude completeness will become increasingly important.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We constrain two vacuum decay models ($\Lambda(t)$CDM, proposed by the authors of~\cite{Brito:2024bhh}) utilizing the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data released by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), distance prior from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) observed by the Planck satellite, Hubble rate data obtained via the cosmic chronometers (CC) method and type Ia supernova (SNIa) data. The interaction terms between dark matter and dark energy are defined as $Q=3\varepsilon H\rho_{\Lambda}$ for model I and $3\varepsilon aH\rho_{\Lambda}$ for model II. We find that the decay parameter is constrained to be $\varepsilon=0.0094^{+0.0037}_{-0.0033}$ for model I and $\varepsilon=0.0119\pm{0.0045}$ for model II, respectively, indicating a potential interaction between dark matter and dark energy at the $2\sigma$ confidence level. The current Hubble parameter values are estimated to be $H_{0}=70.30\pm{0.67}$ for model I and $H_{0}=70.28\pm{0.64}$ for model II. These values of $H_0$ fall between those derived from the Planck and SH0ES data, suggesting that these two vacuum decay models could provide a potential solution to alleviate the Hubble tension problem.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the inflaton potential from scalar-induced gravitational waves and primordial black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A plateau on the background inflaton potential $V_{\rm b}(\phi)$ can lead cosmic inflation into an ultraslow-roll phase, greatly enhancing the primordial power spectrum on small scales, and resulting in significant scalar-induced gravitational waves (GWs) and abundant primordial black holes (PBHs). In this work, we construct an anti-symmetric perturbation $\delta V(\phi)$ on $V_{\rm b}(\phi)$ with three model parameters, the position, width, and slope of $\delta V(\phi)$, and constrain these parameters from the potential stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) in NANOGrav 15-year data set. The GW spectrum from the merger of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) with two model parameters, the amplitude and spectral index, is also investigated for comparison. We perform Bayesian analysis in three steps with increasing number of model parameters, and obtain the allowed parameter ranges. When the constraints on PBH abundance are taken into account, these ranges become further narrower. We find that the increase of model parameters cannot significantly improve the Bayes factors, and the model with an almost perfect plateau on $V_{\rm b}(\phi)$ is favored. Moreover, the interpretation of the SGWB via only the GWs generated by SMBHBs is not preferred by the data.</description>

      <title>Lost in the FoG: Pitfalls of Models for Large-Scale Hydrogen Distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01956v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale HI surveys and their cross-correlations with galaxy distributions have immense potential as cosmological probes. Interpreting these measurements requires theoretical models that must incorporate redshift-space distortions (RSDs), such as the Kaiser and fingers-of-God (FoG) effect, and differences in the tracer and matter distributions via the tracer bias. These effects are commonly approximated with assumptions that should be tested on simulated distributions. In this work, we use the hydrodynamical simulation suite IllustrisTNG to assess the performance of models of $z \leq 1$ HI auto and HI-galaxy cross-power spectra, finding that the models employed by recent observations introduce errors comparable to or exceeding their measurement uncertainties. In particular, neglecting FoG causes $\gtrsim 10\%$ deviations between the modeled and simulated power spectra at $k \gtrsim 0.1$ $h$ / Mpc, larger than assuming a constant bias which reaches the same error threshold at slightly smaller scales. However, even without these assumptions, models can still err by $\sim 10\%$ on relevant scales. These remaining errors arise from multiple RSD damping sources on HI clustering, which are not sufficiently described with a single FoG term. Overall, our results highlight the need for an improved understanding of RSDs to harness the capabilities of future measurements of HI distributions.</description>

      <title>A semi-cosmographic approach to study cosmological evolution in phase space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The signature of Baryon Acoustic Oscillation in the clustering of dark-matter tracers allows us to measure $(D_A(z), H(z))$ independently. Treating these as conjugate variables, we are motivated to study cosmological evolution in the phase space of dimensionless variables $x = H_0 D_A/c$ and $p = dx/dz$. The dynamical system $(x(z),p(z))$ can be integrated for a known set of equation of state parameters for different matter/energy components. However, to avoid any preference for specific dark energy models, we adopt a cosmographic approach. We consider two scenarios where the Luminosity distance is expanded as Pad\'e rational approximants using expansion in terms of $z$ and $(1+z)^{1/2}$ respectively. However, instead of directly using the Pad\'e ratios to fit kinematic quantities with data, we adopt an alternative approach where the evolution of the cold dark matter sector is incorporated in our analysis through a semi-cosmographic equation of state, which is then, used to solve the dynamical problem in the phase space. The semi-cosmographic $(D_A(z), H(z))$, thus obtained, is fitted with BAO and SNIa data from DESI DR1 + eBOSS and Pantheon+ respectively. We also consider a futuristic 21-cm intensity mapping experiment for error projections. We further use the semi-cosmographic fitting to reconstruct some diagnostics of background cosmology and compare our results for the two scenarios of Pad\'e expansions.</description>

      <title>Differential torsion sensor for direct detection of ultralight vector dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08935v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight bosons with masses in the range from $\sim 10^{-22}$ eV/$c^2$ to $\sim 1$ eV/$c^2$, are well-motivated, wave-like dark matter candidates. Particles on the lower-mass end are less explored in experiments due to their vanishingly small mass and weak coupling to the Standard Model. We propose a sensor with dual torsion pendulums for the direct detection of U(1)$_{B\!-\!L}$ gauge boson dark matter, which can achieve an enhanced differential torque sensitivity in a frequency band of $\sim 10^{-2}$-$10$ Hz due to its advantages in common-mode rejection and differential angular sensitivity. We describe the design of the differential torsion sensor and present the estimated sensitivity to an ultralight dark matter field coupled to baryon minus lepton ($B\!-\!L$) number, in a mass range of $\sim 10^{-17}$-$10^{-13}$ eV/$c^2$. Given a setup with meter-scale torsion pendulum beams and kg-scale test masses, the projected constraints on the coupling constant $g_{B\!-\!L}$ can reach $\sim 10^{-27}$ for a boson mass of $\sim 10^{-15}$ eV/$c^2$.</description>

Abstract: A particular generalization of the Chaplygin inflationary model, using the formalism of Hamilton-Jacobi and elliptic functions, results in a more general non-linear Chaplygin-type equation of state (Chaplygin-Jacobi model). We investigate the implementation of this model as a dark energy (DE) fluid to explain the recent acceleration of the universe. Unlike $\Lambda$CDM and other Chaplygin-like fluids, where the final fate of the universe is an eternal de Sitter (dS) phase, the dynamics of this model allows for the possibility of a decelerating phase in the future, following the current accelerating phase. In other words, a transient acceleration arises, accounting for the recently claimed slowing down phenomenon. This Chaplygin-Jacobi model shows important differences compared to the standard and generalized Chaplygin gas models. Additionally, we perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis using several datasets, including Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa), Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) to examine the observational viability of the model. Our results indicate that, although a transient phase of accelerated expansion is supported by current observations in the context of the Chaplygin-Jacobi model, this model is strongly disfavored in comparison with $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Detecting kHz gravitons from a neutron star merger with a multi-mode resonant mass detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16898v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a multi-mode bar consisting of mass elements of decreasing size for the implementation of a gravitational version of the photo-electric effect through the stimulated absorption of up to kHz gravitons from a binary neutron star merger and post-merger. We find that the multi-mode detector has normal modes that retain the coupling strength to the gravitational wave of the largest mass-element, while only having an effective mass comparable to the mass of the smallest element. This allows the normal modes to have graviton absorption rates due to the tonne-scale largest mass, while the single graviton absorption process in the normal mode could be resolved through energy measurements of a mass-element in-principle smaller than pico-gram scale. We argue the feasibility of directly counting gravito-phonons in the bar through energy measurements of the end mass. This improves the transduction of the single-graviton signal, enhancing the feasibility of detecting single gravitons.</description>

      <title>Consistency of EFT illuminated via relative entropy: A case study in scalar field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21062v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relative entropy is a non-negative quantity and offers a powerful means of achieving a unified understanding of fundamental properties in physics, including the second law of thermodynamics and positivity bounds on effective field theories (EFTs). We analyze the relative entropy in scalar field theories and show that the non-negativity of relative entropy is potentially violated in perturbative calculations based on operator and loop expansions. Conversely, this suggests that the consistency of the EFT description in the scalar field theory can be identified by the sign of the relative entropy. In fact, we revisit an EFT of single-field inflation and present a relation between its non-linear parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ and the consistency condition of the EFT description derived from the relative entropy method. We find that interesting regions of $f_{\rm NL}$ that are observationally allowed can be constrained from the relative entropy by imposing the consistency of the EFT description when the EFT is generated via the interaction with heavy fields in UV theories.</description>

      <title>New physics decaying into metastable particles: impact on cosmic neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate decays of hypothetical unstable new physics particles into metastable species such as muons, pions, or kaons in the Early Universe, when temperatures are in the MeV range, and study how they affect cosmic neutrinos. We demonstrate that the non-trivial dynamics of metastables in the plasma alters the impact of the new physics particles on the neutrino population, including the effective number of neutrino degrees of freedom, $N_{\rm eff}$, modifies neutrino spectral distortions, and may induce asymmetries in neutrino and antineutrino energy distributions. These modifications have important implications for observables such as Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the Cosmic Microwave Background, especially in light of upcoming CMB observations aiming to reach percent-level precision on $N_{\rm eff}$. We illustrate our findings with a few examples of new physics particles and provide a computational tool available for further exploration.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of metastable Standard Model particles from long-lived particle decays in the MeV primordial plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological impact of hypothetical unstable new physics particles that decay in the MeV-scale plasma of the Early Universe. Focusing on scenarios where the decays produce metastable species such as muons, pions, and kaons, we systematically analyze the dynamics of these particles using coupled Boltzmann equations governing their abundances. Our results demonstrate that the metastable species can efficiently annihilate or interact with nucleons, often leading to their disappearance before decay. The suppression of decay significantly alters the properties of cosmic neutrinos, impacting cosmological observables like Big Bang nucleosynthesis and the Cosmic Microwave Background. To support further studies, we provide two public codes: the Mathematica code that traces the evolution of these metastable particles, as well as the python-based unintegrated neutrino Boltzmann solver that uses this evolution as an input and may be applied to a broad range of scenarios. We then utilize them for studying a few particular new physics models.</description>

      <title>Introducing the THESAN-ZOOM project: radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of high-redshift galaxies with a multi-phase interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the THESAN-ZOOM project, a comprehensive suite of high-resolution zoom-in simulations of $14$ high-redshift ($z&gt;3$) galaxies selected from the THESAN simulation volume. This sample encompasses a diverse range of halo masses, with $M_\mathrm{halo} \approx 10^8 - 10^{13}~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ at $z=3$. At the highest-resolution, the simulations achieve a baryonic mass of $142~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and a gravitational softening length of $17~\mathrm{cpc}$. We employ a state-of-the-art multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM) model that self-consistently includes stellar feedback, radiation fields, dust physics, and low-temperature cooling through a non-equilibrium thermochemical network. Our unique framework incorporates the impact of patchy reionization by adopting the large-scale radiation field topology from the parent THESAN simulation box rather than assuming a spatially uniform UV background. In total, THESAN-ZOOM comprises $60$ simulations, including both fiducial runs and complementary variations designed to investigate the impact of numerical and physical parameters on galaxy properties. The fiducial simulation set reproduces a wealth of high-redshift observational data such as the stellar-to-halo-mass relation, the star-forming main sequence, the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, and the mass-metallicity relation. While our simulations slightly overestimate the abundance of low-mass and low-luminosity galaxies they agree well with observed stellar and UV luminosity functions at the higher mass end. Moreover, the star-formation rate density closely matches the observational estimates from $z=3-14$. These results indicate that the simulations effectively reproduce many of the essential characteristics of high-redshift galaxies, providing a realistic framework to interpret the exciting new observations from JWST.</description>
