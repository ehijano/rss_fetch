      <title>Redis-Based Streaming Architecture for Accelerator Beam Instrumentation DAQ Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fermilab Acceleraor Division, Beam Instrumentation Department, is always adopting modern and current software methodologies for complex DAQ architectures. This paper highlights the Redis Adapter (RA) as the key software component enabling high performance, modular communication between digitizers and distributed control systems by leveraging Redis and containerization. The RA provides a unified, efficient interface between Redis based data streams and consumer systems. In the legacy architecture, digitized data flowed through the custom, UDP based Distributed Data Communication Protocol in the middle layer. In the current system, DDCP remains the ingestion path, while the RA serves as the decoupling layer. The proposed system replaces old VME digitizers with a SOM-based digitizer that communicates with Redis using the RA. The RA acts as both a performance-critical bridge and a protocol-agnostic adapter, ensuring compatibility with legacy control frameworks while enabling future scalability and modularity. This restructuring of the middle layer also helps the system achieve high throughput, reduce latency, and simplify the data path. Finally, we will demonstrate how RA is utilized in our two core products to deliver both legacy compatibility and future flexibility.</description>

      <title>Field Emission Analysis in SRF Cavities for PIP-II Using GEANT4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Field emission (FE) remains a significant hurdle for achieving optimal performance and reliability in super-conducting radiofrequency (SRF) cavities used in accelerator cryomodules. A thorough understanding of the generation and propagation of FE-induced radiation is therefore essential to mitigate this problem. The absence of standardized measurement protocols further complicates the comparison of radiation data across different testing phases and facilities. This highlights the need for a precise quantitative method to diagnose and analyze FE-induced radiation. Such efforts could prove beneficial for improving cavity preparation and cleanroom assembly techniques during the prototype and production stages of Fermilab's Proton Improvement Plan-II (PIP-II) project. This study presents the initial steps of detailed Geant4 simulations aimed at analyzing FE-induced radiation in the low-beta 650 MHz 5-cell elliptical (LB650) cavity. Our goal is to combine these results with radiation diagnostics to enhance diagnostic accuracy and optimize detector positioning. This integrated approach ultimately aims to improve the preparation, assembly, and testing procedures for PIP-II SRF cavities, ensuring the delivery of FE-free cryomodules.</description>

      <title>Drive beam depletion with multi-Joule energy transfer in a plasma wakefield accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A collider based on beam-driven plasma wakefield acceleration will require the drive beam to transfer 10-100s of Joules to the plasma in each stage, with a drive-to-wake energy transfer efficiency exceeding 70%. Using an all-optical plasma source, we demonstrate significant progress towards these parameters, transferring at least 5.6 J from a 1.52 nC, 10 GeV electron beam to a $4.5\times 10^{16}\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ hydrogen plasma while achieving at least $37\pm 3\%$ drive-to-wake energy transfer efficiency. We observe deceleration of some particles to less than 0.93 GeV with up to 90% of the charge participating in the interaction.</description>
