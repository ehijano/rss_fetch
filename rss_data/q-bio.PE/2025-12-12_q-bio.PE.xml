      <title>Trimming to coexistence: How dispersal strategies should be accounted for in resource management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For two resource-sharing species we explore the interplay of harvesting and dispersal strategies, as well as their influence on competition outcomes. Although the extinction of either species can be achieved by excessive culling, choosing a harvesting strategy such that the biodiversity of the populations is preserved is much more complicated. We propose a type of heterogeneous harvesting policy, dependent on dispersal strategy, where the two managed populations become an ideal free pair, and show that this strategy guarantees the coexistence of the species. We also show that if the harvesting of one of the populations is perturbed in some way, then it is possible for the coexistence to be preserved. Further, we show that if the dispersal of two species formed an ideal free pair, then a slight change in the dispersal strategy for one of them does not affect their ability to coexist. Finally, in the model, directed movement is represented by the term $\Delta (u/P)$, where $P$ is the dispersal strategy and target distribution. We justify that once an invading species, which has an advantage in carrying capacity, chooses a dispersal strategy that mimics the resident species distribution, then successful invasion is guaranteed. However, numerical simulations show that invasion may be successful even without an advantage in carrying capacity. More work is needed to understand the conditions, in addition to targeted culling, under which the host species would be able to persist through an invasion.</description>

      <title>Computing Evolutionarily Stable Strategies in Imperfect-Information Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for computing evolutionarily stable strategies (ESSs) in symmetric perfect-recall extensive-form games of imperfect information. Our main algorithm is for two-player games, and we describe how it can be extended to multiplayer games. The algorithm is sound and computes all ESSs in nondegenerate games and a subset of them in degenerate games which contain an infinite continuum of symmetric Nash equilibria. The algorithm is anytime and can be stopped early to find one or more ESSs. We experiment on an imperfect-information cancer signaling game as well as random games to demonstrate scalability.</description>

      <title>Curvature-Weighted Contact Networks: Spectral Reduction and Global Stability in a Markovian SIR Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new network-based SIR epidemic model in which transmission is modulated by a curvature-weighted contact matrix that encodes structural and geometric features of the underlying graph. The formulation encompasses both adjacency-driven and Markovian mixing, allowing heterogeneous interactions to be shaped by curvature-sensitive topological properties. We prove that the basic reproduction number satisfies \[ R_0=\frac{\beta}{\gamma}\lambda_{\max}(M), \] where $M$ is the curvature-weighted transmission operator. Using Perron--Frobenius theory together with linear and nonlinear Lyapunov functionals, we establish: (i) global asymptotic stability of the disease-free equilibrium when $R_0&lt;1$, and (ii) existence and global asymptotic stability of a unique endemic equilibrium when $R_0&gt;1$. Our results show that curvature acts as a geometric regularizer of connectivity, lowering spectral radii, raising effective epidemic thresholds, and organizing the long-term dynamics through monotone contraction toward the endemic state. This framework generalizes classical network epidemiology by integrating geometric information directly into transmission operators, providing a rigorous foundation for epidemic dynamics on structurally heterogeneous networks.</description>

      <title>Coupling opinion dynamics and epidemiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research investigates the coupled dynamics of behavior and infectious disease using a mathematical model. We integrate a two-state q-voter opinion process with SIS-type infection dynamics, where transmission rates are influenced by the opinion and an infection-induced switching mechanism represents individuals reassessing their behav- ior upon infection. Analytically, we derive conditions for the stability of endemic and disease-free equilibria. Numerical simulations reveal complex dynamics: above a certain infectivity threshold, the system can exhibit alternative basins of attraction leading to a balanced endemic fixed point or stable limit cycles. Notably, the dominant asymptotic opinion and resulting epidemiological outcomes show non-monotonic relationships with infectivity, highlighting the potential for adaptive behavior to induce complex system dynamics. These findings underscore the critical role of social interventions; shifts in behavioral norms and trust can permanently alter epidemic outcomes, suggesting that such interventions are as crucial as biomedical controls</description>
