      <title>Geometric heat pumping under continuous modulation in thermal diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Berry (geometric) phase has attracted a lot of interest and permeated into all aspects of physics including photonics, crystal dynamics, electromagnetism and heat transfer since it was discovered, leading to various unprecedented effects both in classical and quantum systems, such as Hannay angle, quantum Hall effect, orbital magnetism and Thouless pumping. Heat pumping is one of the most prominent and fantastic application of geometric phase in heat transport. Here we derive a general heat pumping theory based on classical diffusion equation and continuous modulation of system parameters in macroscopic thermal diffusion system and obtain a formula which is reminiscent of contact between Berry phase and the Berry curvature. Furthermore, we discuss two cases of non-trivial zero heat flux after one cycle which is fundamentally different from the trivial zero heat flux generated by static zero heat bias in physical nature. Then we analyze the dependence of the effect on the system thermal parameters, including some counterintuitive phenomenon. Finally, under the guidance of this theory, we conduct an experiment to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of our theory and observe the heat pumping effect regardless of the presence and the absence of the thermal bias between two ports of system. In general, our work clearly derives the universal form of heat pumping theory under arbitrary form of the modulation in the macroscopic thermal diffusion system, this is of great significance for better heat energy transport, heat manipulation and so on. It also establishes the foundation of achieving other non-reciprocity devices or topological devices with the aid of spatiotemporal modulation.</description>

      <title>On Parametric Amplification In Discrete Josephson Transmission Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09644v7 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the discrete series-connected lossy Josephson transmission line, constructed from Josephson junctions, capacitors and resistors (one-dimensional array of Josephson junctions). We derive equations describing pump, signal, and idler interaction in the system and calculate the thresholds for the parametric amplification.</description>

      <title>Lagrange top: integrability according to Liouville and examples of analytic solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02394v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Equations of a heavy rotating body with one fixed point can be deduced starting from a variational problem with holonomic constraints. When applying this formalism to the particular case of a Lagrange top, in the formulation with a diagonal inertia tensor the potential energy has more complicated form as compared with that assumed in the literature on dynamics of a rigid body. This implies the corresponding improvements in equations of motion. Therefore, we revised this case, presenting several examples of analytical solutions to the improved equations. The case of precession without nutation has a surprisingly rich relationship between the rotation and precession rates, and this is discussed in detail.</description>
