      <title>Simulating acoustically-actuated flows in complex microchannels using the volume penalization technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a volume penalization technique for simulating acoustically-actuated flows in geometrically complex microchannels. Using a perturbation approach, the nonlinear response of an acoustically-actuated compressible Newtonian fluid moving over obstacles or flowing in a geometrically complex domain is segregated into two sub-problems: a harmonic first-order problem and a time-averaged second-order problem, where the latter utilizes forcing terms and boundary conditions arising from the first-order solution. This segregation results in two distinct volume penalized systems of equations. The no-slip boundary condition at the fluid-solid interface is enforced by prescribing a zero structure velocity for the first-order problem, while spatially varying Stokes drift -- which depends on the gradient of the first-order solution -- is prescribed as the structure velocity for the second-order problem. The harmonic first-order system is solved via MUMPS direct solver, whereas the steady state second-order system is solved iteratively using a novel projection method-based preconditioner. The preconditioned iterative solver for the second-order system is demonstrated to be highly effective and scalable with respect to increasing penalty force and grid resolution, respectively. A novel contour integration technique to evaluate the acoustic radiation force on an immersed object is also proposed. Through test cases featuring representative microfluidic geometries, we demonstrate excellent agreement between the volume penalized and body-fitted grid. We also identify suitable penalty factors and interfacial smearing widths to accurately capture the first- and second-order solutions. These results provide first-of-its-kind empirical evidence of the efficacy of the volume penalization method for simulating acoustic streaming problems that have so far been analyzed using body-fitted methods in literature.</description>

      <title>Effects of flame macrostructures on the combustion dynamics of novel counter-rotating radial swirl injector in a model can combustor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the flame macrostructures observed during self-sustained thermoacoustic oscillations in a model can combustor featuring a novel counter-rotating swirler. The swirler is designed to achieve high shear, distributing 60% of the airflow through the primary passage and 40% through the secondary passage, with radial fuel injection introduced via a central lance. To examine the influence of flame macrostructures on combustion instabilities, the flow expansion angles at the combustor's dump plane are systematically varied. In the present study, we consider three different flare angles comprising $90^\circ$, $60^\circ$, and $40^\circ$ for Reynolds numbers and thermal powers ranging from 10500-16800 and $10-16.2$ kW, respectively. Acoustic pressure, high-speed stereo PIV, and high-speed OH$^*$ chemiluminescence measurements are conducted to scrutinize flow and flame macrostructures during combustion instability. Large-amplitude acoustic oscillations are observed for a flare angle of $40^\circ$, accompanied by shorter flames and wider central recirculation zones. In contrast, a flare angle of $90^\circ$ results in low-amplitude acoustic oscillations characterized by longer flames and narrower central recirculation zones. The phase-averaged Rayleigh index is utilized to pinpoint regions that drive or dampen thermoacoustic instability, enabling the identification of potential strategies for its mitigation. Additionally, time-series analysis is employed to reveal the dominant acoustic modes and their interaction with heat release rate fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Ship Motion Prediction Capabilities of the Open-Source Model NEMOH Against Field Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate ship motion prediction is critical for safe and efficient maritime operations, particularly in open ocean environments. This study evaluates the capability of NEMOH, an open-source potential flow boundary element solver, for predicting ship motions in real-world open ocean conditions. A linear model, known as the Response Amplitude Operator (RAO), is obtained using NEMOH, and is driven by the wave directional spectrum obtained from the WaMoS-II marine radar on the research vessel Akademik Tryoshnikov during the Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition (ACE). Predictions are benchmarked against concurrent ship motion observations recorded by an onboard inertial measurement unit (IMU). The comparisons, based on the zeroth order moment of the ship motion spectrum, demonstrate a reliable heave prediction (Pearson correlation coefficient r=0.89, scatter index SI=0.41), a reasonable pitch prediction (r=0.80, SI=0.47), and an acceptable roll prediction (r=0.63, SI=0.84). More significant discrepancies for pitch and roll are identified under specific extreme sea conditions. The results demonstrate the capability of NEMOH, offering insights into its applicability for real-world maritime operations.</description>

      <title>Slip-flow theory for thermo-osmosis based on a kinetic model with near-wall potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, thermal-slip coefficients in slip boundary conditions of the Stokes equation are derived using the generalized slip-flow theory, with special interest in the role of near-wall potential in micro- and nanoscale flows. As the model of fluids and fluid-solid interaction, we employ the model Boltzmann equation for dilute gases and the diffuse-reflection boundaries with near-wall potential, respectively. It is found that, when the mean free path of gas molecules and the effective range of potential are of the same order of magnitude, the thermal-slip boundary condition can be derived in the near-continuum limit. In the derived slip-flow theory, the thermal-slip coefficient and the boundary-layer corrections (i.e., Knudsen-layer corrections) are determined by solving the kinetic boundary-layer problems (i.e., Knudsen-layer problems) that include external-force terms and inhomogeneous terms both driven by the potential. As the application of the slip-flow theory, thermo-osmosis between two parallel plates with uniform temperature gradients is analyzed. The results of the slip-flow theory are validated by comparing them with those of the direct numerical analysis of the same problem. Furthermore, it is found that thermo-osmosis and thermal slip on the plates are significantly affected by the features of the near-wall potential; even the gas-flow direction can be reversed when the near-wall potential is repulsive. Such a flow reversal is qualitatively similar to thermo-osmosis in liquids reported in existing molecular dynamics simulation.</description>

      <title>Thermal transport characteristics of impinging ferrofluid droplets in the presence of a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Droplet interactions with solid surfaces are fundamental to natural phenomena and hold significant commercial relevance across diverse applications. While the impingement dynamics of conventional aqueous droplets on solid substrates are well-characterized, the behavior of non-aqueous droplets, particularly those influenced by external force fields like electric or magnetic fields, remains a less explored domain. This study addresses this gap by investigating the impact of a magnetic field on the impingement dynamics of ferrofluid droplets on a heated solid surface. Ferrofluids are unique colloidal suspensions of magnetic nanoparticles within a non-magnetic carrier fluid, enabling external manipulation of their dynamic properties through magnetic forces. The application of a magnetic field introduces an attractive force within the ferrofluid, fundamentally altering the droplet's spreading behavior and, consequently, its transport characteristics upon impact. Our findings reveal a substantial increase in both the maximum spreading diameter and the contact time between the droplet and the substrate, directly leading to enhanced thermal transport efficiency. Furthermore, the magnetic force effectively suppresses droplet bounce-off from hydrophobic surfaces. These critical parameters can be precisely controlled by adjusting the strength of the induced magnetic force. Such interactions can be used in the design of thermal switches and thermal management systems. The multi-physics interactions of magnetic fields, fluid flow, interface tracking, and heat transfer within the multiphase system are computationally modelled to examine the effect of Weber number and contact angle on maximum spreading and associated heat transfer characteristics.</description>

      <title>A Neural-Operator Surrogate for Platelet Deformation Across Capillary Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable multiscale models of thrombosis require platelet-scale fidelity at organ-scale cost, a gap that scientific machine learning has the potential to narrow. We train a DeepONet surrogate on platelet dynamics generated with LAMMPS for platelets spanning ten elastic moduli and capillary numbers (0.07 - 0.77). The network takes in input the wall shear stress, bond stiffness, time, and initial particle coordinates and returns the full three-dimensional deformation of the membrane. Mean-squared-error minimization with Adam and adaptive learning-rate decay yields a median displacement error below 1%, a 90th percentile below 3%, and a worst case below 4% over the entire calibrated range while accelerating computation by four to five orders of magnitude. Leave-extremes-out retraining shows graceful extrapolation: the held-out stiffest and most compliant platelets retain sub-3% median error and an 8% maximum. Error peaks coincide with transient membrane self-contact, suggesting improvements via graph neural trunks and physics-informed torque regularization. These results classify the surrogate as high-fidelity and position it for seamless coupling with continuum CFD, enabling platelet-resolved hemodynamic simulations in patient-specific geometries and opening new avenues for predictive thrombosis modeling.</description>

      <title>Mixing of Gaussian Solute Plumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the general problem of mixing of Gaussian solute plumes arising across a range of different flows ranging from two-dimensional (2D) to three-dimensional (3D), steady to unsteady, regular to chaotic, Stokes to turbulent. We consider a a range of infinitesimal injection protocols (point or line sources, continuous or pulsed) which generate solute points, lines and sheets and their finite-sized counterparts (blobs, tubes and slabs). We show that evolution of this broad family of Gaussian plumes is solely governed by the initial solute distribution, the dispersion tensor and the Lagrangian history of the deformation gradient tensor. Significant simplifications arise when the deformation tensor is placed in the Protean (Lester et al, JFM, 2018) coordinate frame (which aligns with the maximum and minimum fluid stretching directions and renders the deformation tensor upper triangular), allowing evolution of the Gaussian covariance matrix to be expressed in physically relevant terms such as Lyapunov exponents, longitudinal and transverse shear rates. We couch these results in terms of evolution of the maximum concentration and scalar entropy of Gaussian plume for a range of flows and injection protocols. These results provide significant insights into the processes that govern mixing in a broad range of flows and provide the building blocks of efficient numerical methods using e.g. radial basis functions for solute transport and mixing in arbitrary flows.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Increases Wind Farm Power Production by Enabling Closed-Loop Collaborative Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional wind farm control operates each turbine independently to maximize individual power output. However, coordinated wake steering across the entire farm can substantially increase the combined wind farm energy production. Although dynamic closed-loop control has proven effective in flow control applications, wind farm optimization has relied primarily on static, low-fidelity simulators that ignore critical turbulent flow dynamics. In this work, we present the first reinforcement learning (RL) controller integrated directly with high-fidelity large-eddy simulation (LES), enabling real-time response to atmospheric turbulence through collaborative, dynamic control strategies. Our RL controller achieves a 4.30% increase in wind farm power output compared to baseline operation, nearly doubling the 2.19% gain from static optimal yaw control obtained through Bayesian optimization. These results establish dynamic flow-responsive control as a transformative approach to wind farm optimization, with direct implications for accelerating renewable energy deployment to net-zero targets.</description>

      <title>Novel Approximation of the Modified Mild Slope Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mild-slope equation and its various modifications aim to model, with varying degrees of success, linear water wave propagation over sloping or undulating seabed topography. However, despite multiple modifications and attempted simplifications, the different variants of the equation include multiple higher order terms involving the nonlinear water wave dispersion relation and thus remain analytic intractable. To further facilitate its use, we derive a drastically simplified alternative version of the modified mild-slope equation that bears striking resemblance to the linear shallow water equation while retaining all critical features of the original equation that enable it to be valid for a wide range of wave numbers and water depths. Direct comparison of the modified mild-slope equation and our simplified formulation indicates that the simplified equations agree with the modified mild slope equation at leading orders in the forcing frequency and local depth. Validations with multiple sets of benchmark wave scattering problems demonstrate that despite the clearly reduced complexity, the simplified equations were able to replicate the predictions of the modified mild slope equations over a wide range of wave numbers and surface topographies, including higher order resonant conditions.</description>

      <title>A parametric tensor ROM for the shallow water dam break problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a variant of a tensor reduced-order model (tROM) for the parameterized shallow-water dam-break problem. This hyperbolic system presents multiple challenges for model reduction, including a slow decay of the Kolmogorov $N$-width of the solution manifold, shock formation, and the loss of smooth solution dependence on parameters. These issues limit the performance of traditional Proper Orthogonal Decomposition based ROMs. Our tROM approach, based on a low-rank tensor decomposition, builds a parameter-to-solution map from high-fidelity snapshots and constructs localized reduced bases via a local POD procedure. We apply this method to both dry-bed and wet-bed problem setups, showing that the non-interpolatory variant of the tROM, combined with Chebyshev sampling near critical parameter values, effectively captures parameter-dependent behavior and significantly outperforms standard POD-ROMs. This is especially evident in the wet-bed case, where POD-ROMs exhibit poor resolution of shock waves and spurious oscillations.</description>

      <title>Static friction of liquid marbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liquid marbles, droplets coated with a granular layer, are highly mobile as particles prevent capillary adhesion with the substrate. Yet, they exhibit static friction due to their granular shell, which resists rolling until it yields. This friction depends on the shell geometry and increases exponentially with grain density, indicating a logistic dependence of interparticle compressive forces on surface coverage, confirmed by yielding measurements in granular rafts. These results reveal the shell's dual role, and establish liquid marbles as a model system for probing granular raft mechanics.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous plane waves in attenuative anisotropic porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the propagation of inhomogeneous plane waves in poro-viscoelastic media, explicitly incorporating both velocity and attenuation anisotropy. Starting from classical Biot theory, we present a fractional differential equation describing wave propagation in attenuative anisotropic porous media that accommodates arbitrary anisotropy in both velocity and attenuation. Then, instead of relying on the traditional complex wave vector approach, we derive new Christoffel and energy balance equations for general inhomogeneous waves by employing an alternative formulation based on the complex slowness vector. The phase velocities and complex slownesses of inhomogeneous fast and slow quasi-compressional (qP1 and qP2) and quasi-shear (qS1 and qS2) waves are determined by solving an eighth-degree algebraic equation. By invoking the derived energy balance equation along with the computed complex slowness, we present explicit and concise expressions for energy velocities. Additionally, we analyze dissipation factors defined by two alternative measures: the ratio of average dissipated energy density to either average strain energy density or average stored energy density. We clarify and discuss the implications of these definitional differences in the context of general poro-viscoelastic anisotropic media. Finally, our expressions are degenerated to give their counterparts of the homogeneous waves as a special case, and the reduced forms are identical to those presented by the existing poro-viscoelastic theory. Several examples are provided to illustrate the propagation characteristics of inhomogeneous plane waves in unbounded attenuative vertical transversely isotropic porous media.</description>

      <title>Parameterization and benchmarking of the Modified Marrone-Treanor Model for five-species air</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present updated parameters for five-species air to be used with the Modified Marrone-Treanor (MMT) air dissociation model. The vibrational relaxation and chemical reaction rates are derived from quasiclassical trajectory calculation (QCT) and direct molecular simulation (DMS) using ab initio potential energy surfaces (PESs). The resulting model and parameter set enable efficient computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of high-temperature nonequilibrium five-species air (N2, O2, NO, N and O). Through a consistent comparison, we show that the MMT model reproduces DMS benchmark solutions with high accuracy in zero-dimensional heat bath simulations representative of thermochemical nonequilibrium post-shock conditions. The MMT model's analytical expressions for dissociation rate coefficient and vibrational energy change per reaction ensure that the correct amount of energy is transferred between the vibrational and trans-rotational modes. Detailed balance is imposed for three-body recombination reactions and MMT solutions exhibit both quasi-steady-state (QSS) dissociation rates and proper approach to thermochemical equilibrium. MMT model predictions are compared to the Park two-temperature model for similar heat bath conditions. MMT predicts significantly slower conversion of N2 into N below 10000 K and significantly more NO production at all temperatures.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present resolvent4py, a parallel Python package for the analysis, model reduction and control of large-scale linear systems with millions or billions of degrees of freedom. This package provides the user with a friendly Python-like experience (akin to that of well-established libraries such as numpy and scipy), while enabling MPI-based parallelism through mpi4py, petsc4py and slepc4py. In turn, this allows for the development of streamlined and efficient Python code that can be used to solve several problems in fluid mechanics, solid mechanics, graph theory, molecular dynamics and several other fields.</description>

      <title>Two-Loop Turbulent Helical Magnetohydrodynamics: Large-Scale Dynamo and Energy Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a two-loop field-theoretic analysis of incompressible helical magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in fully developed stationary turbulence. A key feature of helical MHD is the appearance of an infrared-unstable ``mass-like'' term in the loop diagrams of the magnetic response function. Physically, this term corresponds to the relevant perturbation of the Joule damping, proportional to $\boldsymbol{\nabla} \times \boldsymbol{b}$ ($\boldsymbol{b} =$ magnetic field). Its presence destabilizes the trivial ground state $\langle \boldsymbol{b} \rangle = 0$ and forces us to look for a mechanism for stabilizing the system. We show that such stabilization can be achieved in two ways: (i) by introducing into induction equation an external mass-like parameter that precisely cancels these dangerous loop corrections (kinematic regime), or (ii) via spontaneous breaking of the rotational symmetry, leading to a new ground state with nonzero large-scale magnetic field (turbulent dynamo regime). For the latter case, we study the two-loop correction to the spontaneously generated magnetic field and demonstrate that Goldstone-like corrections to Alfv\'en modes along with some other anisotropic structures arise. Our results also confirm that the emergent mean magnetic field leads to a steeper slope of the magnetic energy spectrum, $-11/3 + 2\gamma_{b\star}$ (with $\gamma_{b\star} = -0.1039 - 0.4202\rho^2$, for $|\rho| \leqslant 1$ as the degree of helicity), compared to the Kolmogorov velocity spectrum of $-11/3$, thereby breaking equipartition.</description>

      <title>Buoyancy-driven flow regimes for a melting vertical ice cylinder in saline water</title>

Abstract: The presence of salt in seawater significantly affects the melt rate and morphological evolution of ice. This study investigates the melting process of a vertical cylinder in saline water using a combination of laboratory experiments and direct numerical simulations. The two-dimensional (2D) direct numerical simulations and 3D experiments achieve thermal Rayleigh numbers up to $\text{Ra}_{T}= \mathcal{O}\left(10^{9}\right)$ and saline Rayleigh numbers up to $\text{Ra}_{S}=\mathcal{O}\left(10^{12}\right)$. Some 3D simulations of the vertical ice cylinder are conducted at $\text{Ra}_{T}= \mathcal{O}\left(10^{5}\right)$ to confirm that the results in 2D simulations are qualitatively similar to those in 3D simulations. The mean melt rate exhibits a non-monotonic relationship with ambient salinity, initially decreasing towards the point that thermal and saline effects compensate each other, and then increasing again. Based on the ambient salinity, the flow can be categorized into three regimes: temperature-driven flow, salinity-driven flow, and thermal-saline competing flow. In the temperature-driven and competing flow regimes, we find that the mean melt rate follows a $\text{Ra}_{T_d}^{1/4}$ scaling. In contrast, in the salinity-driven flow regime, we see a transition from a $\text{Ra}_{T_d}^{1/4}$ to a $\text{Ra}_{T_d}^{1/3}$ scaling. Additionally, the mean melt rate follows a $\text{Ra}_{S_d}^{1/3}$ scaling in this regime. The ice cylinder develops distinct morphologies in different flow regimes. In the thermal-saline competing flow regime, distinctive scallop (dimpled) patterns emerge along the ice cylinder due to the competition between thermal buoyancy and saline buoyancy. We observe these scallop patterns to migrate downwards over time, due to local differences in the melt rate, for which we provide a qualitative explanation.</description>

      <title>incompressibleFoam: a new time consistent framework with BDF and DIRK integration schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work focuses on the development of a new incompressible solver, incompressibleFoam, within OpenFOAM and integrating several numerical methods within the same framework. Two momentum interpolation (NCMI/CMI) methods are implemented, two forms of the pressure Poisson equation (corrected/standard). Regarding time discretization, steady-state, Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF) and the Singly Diagonally Implicit Runge-Kutta (SDIRK) methods, up to the third order, are implemented. The solver is tested on three benchmark cases to assess the performance of different numerical configurations. The results are also compared with the standard incompressible solver of OpenFOAM: pimpleFoam. They provide perspective on previous attempts to improve OpenFOAM incompressible solvers and give practical results regarding the choice of momentum interpolation methods, pressure equation formulations, and time discretization schemes. It is found that the pressure-corrected form should be avoided while using the NCMI and that third order schemes are not superior to 2nd order schemes. The CMI should be privileged to avoid time step and relaxation factor dependence and pressure velocity decoupling. Finally, the source code is released in the following github repository: https://github.com/ferrop/incompressibleFoam</description>

      <title>Experimental study of Su-Schrieffer-Heeger edge modes for water waves in linear and nonlinear regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper experimentally investigates topologically protected edge modes in a water wave channel through a direct geometric mapping to the one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. By designing a periodic channel with alternating widths, we replicate the key features of the SSH model, leading to the emergence of robust zero-energy sloshing edge modes localized at the boundaries. Experimental data show excellent agreement with theoretical predictions, supported by two-dimensional numerical simulations. In the nonlinear regime, two distinct bifurcations are observed, indicating the appearance of secondary resonances. This study highlights the relevance of the SSH model for water wave systems and provides an accessible method to explore topological edge states in classical wave systems.</description>

      <title>Modeling liquid-mediated interactions for close-to-substrate magnetic microparticle transport in dynamic magnetic field landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the on-chip motion of magnetic particles in a microfluidic environment is key to realizing magnetic particle-based Lab-on-a-chip systems for medical diagnostics. In this work, a simulation model is established to quantify the trajectory of a single particle moving close to a polymer surface in a quiescent liquid. The simulations include hydrodynamic, magnetostatic, and Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) interactions. They are applied to particle motion driven by a dynamically changing magnetic field landscape created by engineered parallel-stripe magnetic domains superposed by a homogeneous, time-varying external magnetic field. The simulation model is adapted to experiments in terms of fluid-particle interactions with the magnetic field landscape approximated by analytic equations under the assumption of surface charges. Varying simulation parameters, we especially clarify the impact of liquid-mediated DLVO interactions, which are essential for diagnostic applications, on the 3D trajectory of the particle. A comparison to experimental results validates our simulation approach.</description>

      <title>Two apparently different interfacial stress formulations constructed from the diffuse interface free energy model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18751v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To express the capillary stress in the diffuse interface method, there are two different formulations in the literature: one formulation is proportional to the density and the other is to the density gradient. Confusingly, these two apparently different formulations both have been widely used for the same purpose without much attention in the difference. In the present study, we theoretically show that only the latter represents the capillary stress and the former represents the stress due to the non-equilibrium irreversible process in the fluid. The formulations are analyzed not only for the one-component fluid but also for the multi-component fluid. In the prediction of the incompressible flow of one-component fluids, the two formulations turn out to give the identical velocity field, but not the pressure field even in this case.</description>

      <title>Neural network-based Godunov corrections for approximate Riemann solvers using bi-fidelity learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Riemann problem is fundamental in the computational modeling of hyperbolic partial differential equations, enabling the development of stable and accurate upwind schemes. While exact solvers provide robust upwinding fluxes, their high computational cost necessitates approximate solvers. Although approximate solvers achieve accuracy in many scenarios, they produce inaccurate solutions in certain cases. To overcome this limitation, we propose constructing neural network-based surrogate models, trained using supervised learning, designed to map interior and exterior conservative state variables to the corresponding exact flux. Specifically, we propose two distinct approaches: one utilizing a vanilla neural network and the other employing a bi-fidelity neural network. The performance of the proposed approaches is demonstrated through applications to one-dimensional and two-dimensional partial differential equations, showcasing their robustness and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Effective and asymptotic scaling in a one-dimensional billiard problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of power laws that govern the large-time dynamics of a one-dimensional billiard of $N$ point particles is analysed. In the initial state, the resting particles are placed in the positive half-line $x\geqslant 0$ at equal distances. Their masses alternate between two distinct values. The dynamics is initialized by giving the leftmost particle a positive velocity. Due to elastic inter-particle collisions, the whole system gradually comes into motion, filling both right-hand and left-hand half-lines. As shown by [Chakraborti S., Dhar A., Krapivsky P., SciPost Phys., 2022, 13, 074], an inherent feature of such a billiard is the emergence of two different modes: the shock wave that propagates in $x\geqslant 0$ and the splash region in $x&lt;0$. Moreover, the behaviour of the relevant observables is characterized by universal asymptotic power-law dependencies. In view of the finite size of the system and of finite observation times, these dependencies only start to acquire a universal character. To analyse them, we set up molecular dynamics simulations using the concept of effective scaling exponents, familiar in the theory of continuous phase transitions. We present results for the effective exponents that govern the large-time behaviour of the shock-wave front, the number of collisions, the energies and momentum of different modes and analyse their tendency to approach corresponding universal values.</description>
