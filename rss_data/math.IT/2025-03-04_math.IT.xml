      <title>Energy-Efficient Edge Inference in Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Computation Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Task-oriented integrated sensing, communication, and computation (ISCC) is a key technology for achieving low-latency edge inference and enabling efficient implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPS). However, the constrained energy supply at edge devices has emerged as a critical bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a novel energy-efficient ISCC framework for AI inference at resource-constrained edge devices, where adjustable split inference, model pruning, and feature quantization are jointly designed to adapt to diverse task requirements. A joint resource allocation design problem for the proposed ISCC framework is formulated to minimize the energy consumption under stringent inference accuracy and latency constraints. To address the challenge of characterizing inference accuracy, we derive an explicit approximation for it by analyzing the impact of sensing, communication, and computation processes on the inference performance. Building upon the analytical results, we propose an iterative algorithm employing alternating optimization to solve the resource allocation problem. In each subproblem, the optimal solutions are available by respectively applying a golden section search method and checking the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, thereby ensuring the convergence to a local optimum of the original problem. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ISCC design, showing a significant reduction in energy consumption of up to 40% compared to existing methods, particularly in low-latency scenarios.</description>

      <title>Optimal Bilinear Equalizer Beamforming Design for Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks with Arbitrary Channel Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the distributed optimal bilinear equalizer (OBE) beamforming design for both the uplink and downlink cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output networks. We consider arbitrary statistics-based channel estimators over spatially correlated Rician fading channels. In the uplink, we derive the achievable spectral efficiency (SE) performance and OBE combining schemes with arbitrary statistics-based channel estimators and compute their respective closed-form expressions. It is insightful to explore that the achievable SE performance is not dependent on the choice of channel estimator when OBE combining schemes are applied over Rayleigh channels. In the downlink, we derive the achievable SE performance expressions with BE precoding schemes and arbitrary statistics-based channel estimators utilized and compute them in closed form. Then, we obtain the OBE precoding scheme leveraging insights from uplink OBE combining schemes.</description>

      <title>The dimension and Bose distance of certain primitive BCH codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: BCH codes are crucial in error correction and have numerous applications in digital communications and data storage. They are valued for their ability to detect and correct multiple errors, making them essential in ensuring data integrity. However, the dimension and minimum distance of BCH codes remain unknown in general.
  The main objective of this paper is to determine the dimension and Bose distance of narrow-sense primitive BCH codes with designed distance $\delta\in [2, q^{\lfloor (2m-1) /3 \rfloor+1}]$. Furthermore, we extend our result on the dimension of narrow-sense primitive BCH codes to primitive BCH codes that are not necessarily narrow-sense.</description>

      <title>Towords the Near Optimal Sampling Complexity via Generalized Exponential Spectral Pursuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse phase retrieval aims to recover a $k$-sparse signal from $m$ phaseless observations, raising the fundamental question of the minimum number of samples required for accurate recovery. As a classical non-convex optimization problem, sparse phase retrieval algorithms are typically composed of two stages: initialization and refinement. Existing studies reveal that the sampling complexity under Gaussian measurements is largely determined by the initialization stage.
  In this paper, we identify commonalities among widely used initialization algorithms and introduce key extensions to improve their performance. Building on this analysis, we propose a novel algorithm, termed Generalized Exponential Spectral Pursuit (GESP). Theoretically, our results not only align with existing conclusions but also demonstrate enhanced generalizability. In particular, our theoretical findings coincide with prior results under certain conditions while surpassing them in others by providing more comprehensive guarantees. Furthermore, extensive simulation experiments validate the practical effectiveness and robustness of GESP, showcasing its superiority in recovering sparse signals with reduced sampling requirements.</description>

      <title>The Impact of the Distance Between Cycles on Elementary Trapping Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elementary trapping sets (ETSs) are the main culprits of the performance of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes in the error floor region. Due to their large quantities and complex structures, ETSs are difficult to analyze. This paper studies the impact of the distance between cycles on ETSs, focusing on two special graph classes: theta graphs and dumbbell graphs, which correspond to cycles with negative and non-negative distances, respectively. We determine the Tur\'an numbers of these graphs and prove that increasing the distance between cycles can eliminate more ETSs. Additionally, using the linear state-space model and spectral theory, we prove that increasing the length of cycles or distance between cycles decreases the spectral radius of the system matrix, thereby reducing the harmfulness of ETSs. This is consistent with the conclusion obtained using Tur\'an numbers. For specific cases when removing two 6-cycles with distance of -1, 0 and 1, respectively, we calculate the sizes, spectral radii, and error probabilities of ETSs. These results confirm that the performance of LDPC codes improves as the distance between cycles increases. Furthermore, we design the PEG-CYCLE algorithm, which greedily maximizes the distance between cycles in the Tanner graph. Numerical results show that the QC-LDPC codes constructed by our method achieve performance comparable to or even superior to state-of-the-art construction methods.</description>

      <title>On Noncoherent Multiple-Antenna Rayleigh Block-Fading Channels at Finite Blocklength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the maximum coding rate at which data can be transmitted over a noncoherent, multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) Rayleigh block-fading channel using an error-correcting code of a given blocklength with a block-error probability not exceeding a given value. A high-SNR normal approximation is derived that becomes accurate as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the number of coherence intervals over which we code tend to infinity. The obtained normal approximation complements the nonasymptotic bounds that have appeared in the literature, but whose evaluation is computationally demanding. It further lays the theoretical foundation for an analytical analysis of the fundamental tradeoff between diversity, multiplexing, and channel-estimation cost at finite blocklength and finite SNR.</description>

Abstract: We study the distributed source coding problem with $k$ users of which at most $s$ may be controlled by an adversary and characterize the set of functions of the sources the decoder can reconstruct robustly in the following sense - if the users behave honestly, the function is recovered with high probability; if they behave adversarially, with high probability, either one of the adversarial users will be identified or the function is recovered with vanishingly small distortions.</description>

      <title>Application of the List Viterbi Algorithm for Satellite-based AIS Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satellites receiving Automatic Identification System (AIS) packets in dense areas are particularly prone to AIS channel overload due to the extensive number of vessels. Thus a failure of detection might be caused by the collisions among AIS messages. To improve the detection capability, we propose to exploit the presence of the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) in AIS frames by using the parallel list Viterbi algorithm (PLVA) instead of the classical Viterbi algorithm (VA) often used for decoding AIS signals. The performance of combining the PLVA with AIS post processing including the CRC is studied with two detectors, one coherent and the other differential, in two channel models: a single-user AWGN channel and a more realistic multiple-access AIS channel. We also show the impact of the PLVA parameters on the success recovery rate. The simulation results show that the resulting procedure can significantly improve the packet error rate (PER) at the cost of a limited increase of the computational complexity. The proposed technique could be applied to improve the performance of interference cancellation receivers by significantly lowering the AIS decoding threshold.</description>

      <title>Orbit recovery from invariants of low degree in representations of finite groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications to equivariant neural networks and cryo-electron microscopy we consider the problem of recovering the generic orbit in a representation of a finite group from invariants of low degree. The main result proved here is that invariants of degree at most three separate generic orbits in the regular representation of a finite group defined over any infinite field. This answers a question posed in a 2023 ACHA paper of Bandeira et. al. We also discuss this problem for subregular representations of the dihedral and symmetric groups.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Information in Interactive Decision Making: A Case Study for Multi-Armed Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of information in interactive decision making through the lens of a stochastic multi-armed bandit problem. Focusing on a fundamental example where a unique optimal arm outperforms the rest by a fixed margin, we characterize the optimal success probability and mutual information over time. Our findings reveal distinct growth phases in mutual information -- initially linear, transitioning to quadratic, and finally returning to linear -- highlighting curious behavioral differences between interactive and non-interactive environments. In particular, we show that optimal success probability and mutual information can be decoupled, where achieving optimal learning does not necessarily require maximizing information gain. These findings shed new light on the intricate interplay between information and learning in interactive decision making.</description>

      <title>Projection Head is Secretly an Information Bottleneck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, contrastive learning has risen to be a promising paradigm for extracting meaningful data representations. Among various special designs, adding a projection head on top of the encoder during training and removing it for downstream tasks has proven to significantly enhance the performance of contrastive learning. However, despite its empirical success, the underlying mechanism of the projection head remains under-explored. In this paper, we develop an in-depth theoretical understanding of the projection head from the information-theoretic perspective. By establishing the theoretical guarantees on the downstream performance of the features before the projector, we reveal that an effective projector should act as an information bottleneck, filtering out the information irrelevant to the contrastive objective. Based on theoretical insights, we introduce modifications to projectors with training and structural regularizations. Empirically, our methods exhibit consistent improvement in the downstream performance across various real-world datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-100. We believe our theoretical understanding on the role of the projection head will inspire more principled and advanced designs in this field.

      <title>Asymptotic Theory of Eigenvectors for Latent Embeddings with Generalized Laplacian Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laplacian matrices are commonly employed in many real applications, encoding the underlying latent structural information such as graphs and manifolds. The use of the normalization terms naturally gives rise to random matrices with dependency. It is well-known that dependency is a major bottleneck of new random matrix theory (RMT) developments. To this end, in this paper, we formally introduce a class of generalized (and regularized) Laplacian matrices, which contains the Laplacian matrix and the random adjacency matrix as a specific case, and suggest the new framework of the asymptotic theory of eigenvectors for latent embeddings with generalized Laplacian matrices (ATE-GL). Our new theory is empowered by the tool of generalized quadratic vector equation for dealing with RMT under dependency, and delicate high-order asymptotic expansions of the empirical spiked eigenvectors and eigenvalues based on local laws. The asymptotic normalities established for both spiked eigenvectors and eigenvalues will enable us to conduct precise inference and uncertainty quantification for applications involving the generalized Laplacian matrices with flexibility. We discuss some applications of the suggested ATE-GL framework and showcase its validity through some numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Rate Splitting Multiple Access for Simultaneous Lightwave Information and Power Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper initiate the application of rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) for simultaneous lightwave information and power transfer (SLIPT), where users require to decode information and harvest energy. We focus on a time-splitting (TS) mode where information decoding and energy harvesting are separated in two different phases. Based on the proposed system model, we design a constrained-concave-convex programming (CCCP) algorithm to solve the optimization problem of maximizing the worst-case rate among users subject to the harvested energy constraint at each user. Specifically, the proposed algorithm exploits transformation of the bilinear function, semidefinite relaxation (SDR), CCCP, and a penalty method to effectively deal with the non-convex constraints and objective function. Numerical results show that our proposed RSMA-aided SLIPT outperforms the existing baselines based on space-division multiple access (SDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA).</description>

      <title>A Transfer Framework for Enhancing Temporal Graph Learning in Data-Scarce Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic interactions between entities are prevalent in domains like social platforms, financial systems, healthcare, and e-commerce. These interactions can be effectively represented as time-evolving graphs, where predicting future connections is a key task in applications such as recommendation systems. Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have achieved strong results for such predictive tasks but typically require extensive training data, which is often limited in real-world scenarios. One approach to mitigating data scarcity is leveraging pre-trained models from related datasets. However, direct knowledge transfer between TGNNs is challenging due to their reliance on node-specific memory structures, making them inherently difficult to adapt across datasets.
  To address this, we introduce a novel transfer approach that disentangles node representations from their associated features through a structured bipartite encoding mechanism. This decoupling enables more effective transfer of memory components and other learned inductive patterns from one dataset to another. Empirical evaluations on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly enhances TGNN performance in low-data regimes, outperforming non-transfer baselines by up to 56\% and surpassing existing transfer strategies by 36\%</description>

      <title>Heterogeneity Matters even More in Distributed Learning: Study from Generalization Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the effect of data heterogeneity across clients on the performance of distributed learning systems, i.e., one-round Federated Learning, as measured by the associated generalization error. Specifically, \(K\) clients have each \(n\) training samples generated independently according to a possibly different data distribution and their individually chosen models are aggregated by a central server. We study the effect of the discrepancy between the clients' data distributions on the generalization error of the aggregated model. First, we establish in-expectation and tail upper bounds on the generalization error in terms of the distributions. In part, the bounds extend the popular Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) bound which was developed for the centralized learning setting, i.e., \(K=1\), to the distributed learning setting with arbitrary number of clients $K \geq 1$. Then, we use a connection with information theoretic rate-distortion theory to derive possibly tighter \textit{lossy} versions of these bounds. Next, we apply our lossy bounds to study the effect of data heterogeneity across clients on the generalization error for distributed classification problem in which each client uses Support Vector Machines (D-SVM). In this case, we establish explicit generalization error bounds which depend explicitly on the data heterogeneity degree. It is shown that the bound gets smaller as the degree of data heterogeneity across clients gets higher, thereby suggesting that D-SVM generalizes better when the dissimilarity between the clients' training samples is bigger. This finding, which goes beyond D-SVM, is validated experimentally through a number of experiments.</description>

      <title>The Emergence of Grammar through Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of grammatical systems of syntactic and semantic composition is modeled here with a novel application of reinforcement learning theory. To test the functionalist thesis that speakers' expressive purposes shape their language, we include within the model a probability distribution over different messages that could be expressed in a given context. The proposed learning and production algorithm then breaks down language learning into a sequence of simple steps, such that each step benefits from the message probabilities. The results are presented in the form of numerical simulations of language histories and analytic proofs. The potential for applying these mathematical models to the study of natural language is illustrated with two case studies from the history of English.</description>

      <title>Automorphism Ensemble Decoding of Quantum LDPC Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce AutDEC, a fast and accurate decoder for quantum error-correcting codes with large automorphism groups. Our decoder employs a set of automorphisms of the quantum code and an ensemble of belief propagation (BP) decoders. Each BP decoder is given a syndrome which is transformed by one of the automorphisms, and is run in parallel. For quantum codes, the accuracy of BP decoders is limited because short cycles occur in the Tanner graph and our approach mitigates this effect. We demonstrate decoding accuracy comparable to BP-OSD-0 with a lower time overhead for Quantum Reed-Muller (QRM) codes in the code capacity setting, and Bivariate Bicycle (BB) codes under circuit level noise. We provide a Python repository for use by the community and the results of our simulations.</description>

      <title>Consensus Capacity of Noisy Broadcast Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.06073v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study communication with consensus over a broadcast channel - the receivers reliably decode the sender's message when the sender is honest, and their decoder outputs agree even if the sender acts maliciously. We characterize the broadcast channels which permit this byzantine consensus and determine their capacity. We show that communication with consensus is possible only when the broadcast channel has embedded in it a natural ''common channel'' whose output both receivers can unambiguously determine from their own channel outputs. Interestingly, in general, the consensus capacity may be larger than the point-to-point capacity of the common channel, i.e., while decoding, the receivers may make use of parts of their output signals on which they may not have consensus provided there are some parts (namely, the common channel output) on which they can agree.</description>

Abstract: We present an explicit construction of a sequence of rate $1/2$ Wozencraft ensemble codes (over any fixed finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$) that achieve minimum distance $\Omega(\sqrt{k})$ where $k$ is the message length. The coefficients of the Wozencraft ensemble codes are constructed using Sidon Sets and the cyclic structure of $\mathbb{F}_{q^{k}}$ where $k+1$ is prime with $q$ a primitive root modulo $k+1$. Assuming Artin's conjecture, there are infinitely many such $k$ for any prime power $q$.</description>

      <title>Analytical Framework for Effective Degrees of Freedom in Near-Field XL-MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) is an emerging transceiver technology for enabling next-generation communication systems, due to its potential for substantial enhancement in both the spectral efficiency and spatial resolution. However, the achievable performance limits of various promising XL-MIMO configurations have yet to be fully evaluated, compared, and discussed. In this paper, we develop an effective degrees of freedom (EDoF) performance analysis framework specifically tailored for near-field XL-MIMO systems. We explore five representative distinct XL-MIMO hardware designs, including uniform planar array (UPA)-based with infinitely thin dipoles, two-dimensional (2D) continuous aperture (CAP) plane-based, UPA-based with patch antennas, uniform linear array (ULA)-based, and one-dimensional (1D) CAP line segment-based XL-MIMO systems. Our analysis encompasses two near-field channel models: the scalar and dyadic Green's function-based channel models. More importantly, when applying the scalar Green's function-based channel, we derive EDoF expressions in the closed-form, characterizing the impacts of the physical size of the transceiver, the transmitting distance, and the carrier frequency. In our numerical results, we evaluate and compare the EDoF performance across all examined XL-MIMO designs, confirming the accuracy of our proposed closed-form expressions. Furthermore, we observe that with an increasing number of antennas, the EDoF performance for both UPA-based and ULA-based systems approaches that of 2D CAP plane and 1D CAP line segment-based systems, respectively. Moreover, we unveil that the EDoF performance for near-field XL-MIMO systems is predominantly determined by the array aperture size rather than the sheer number of antennas.</description>

      <title>On A Class of Greedy Sparse Recovery Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sparse signal recovery deals with finding the sparest solution of an under-determined linear system $x = Q s$. In this paper, we propose a novel greedy approach to addressing the challenges from such a problem. Such an approach is based on a characterization of solutions to the system, which allows us to work on the sparse recovery in the $s$-space directly with a given measure. With $l_2$-based measure, an orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP)-type algorithm is proposed, which significantly outperforms the classical OMP algorithm in terms of recovery accuracy while maintaining comparable computational complexity. An $l_1$-based algorithm, denoted as $\text{Alg}_{GL1}$, is derived. Such an algorithm significantly outperforms the classical basis pursuit (BP) algorithm. Combining with the CoSaMP-strategy for selecting atoms, a class of high performance greedy algorithms is also derived. Extensive numerical simulations on both synthetic and image data are carried out, with which the superior performance of our proposed algorithms is demonstrated in terms of sparse recovery accuracy and robustness against numerical instability of the system matrix $Q$ and disturbance in the measurement $x$.</description>

      <title>Hybrid STAR-RIS Enabled Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15570v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is recognized as one of the key enabling technologies for sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication networks, facilitating diverse emerging applications and services in an energy and cost-efficient manner. This paper proposes a multi-user multi-target ISAC system to enable full-space coverage for communication and sensing tasks. The proposed system employs a hybrid simultaneous transmission and reflection reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) comprising active transmissive and passive reflective elements. In the proposed scheme, the passive reflective elements support communication and sensing links for local communication users and sensing targets situated within the same physical region as the base station (BS), while low-power active transmissive elements are deployed to improve sensing performance and overcome high path attenuation due to multi-hop transmission for distant communication users and sensing targets situated far from of the coverage area of the BS. Moreover, to optimize the transmissive/reflective coefficients of the hybrid STAR-RIS, a semi-definite relaxation (SDR)-based algorithm is proposed. Furthermore, to evaluate communication and sensing performance, signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR) and Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) metrics have been derived and investigated via conducting extensive computer simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We focus on designing error-correcting codes for the symmetric Gaussian broadcast channel with feedback. Feedback not only expands the capacity region of the broadcast channel but also enhances transmission reliability. In this work, we study the construction of learned finite blocklength codes for broadcast channels with feedback. Learned error-correcting codes, in which both the encoder and decoder are jointly trained, have shown impressive performance in point-to-point channels, particularly with noisy feedback. However, few learned schemes exist for multi-user channels. Here, we develop a lightweight code for the broadcast channel with feedback that performs well and operates effectively at short blocklengths.</description>

Abstract: We propose a channel modeling using jump-diffusion processes, and study the differential properties of entropy and mutual information. By utilizing the Kramers-Moyal and Kolmogorov-Feller equations, we express the mutual information between the input and the output in series and integral forms, presented by Fisher-type information and mismatched KL divergence. We extend de Bruijn's identity and the I-MMSE relation to encompass general Markov processes.</description>

      <title>Computing Capacity-Cost Functions for Continuous Channels in Wasserstein Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10670v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of computing capacity-cost (C-C) functions for continuous channels. Motivated by the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) proximal reformulation of the classical Blahut-Arimoto (BA) algorithm, the Wasserstein distance is introduced to the proximal term for the continuous case, resulting in an iterative algorithm related to the Wasserstein gradient descent. Practical implementation involves moving particles along the negative gradient direction of the objective function's first variation in the Wasserstein space and approximating integrals by the importance sampling (IS) technique. Such formulation is also applied to the rate-distortion (R-D) function for continuous source spaces and thus provides a unified computation framework for both problems.</description>

Abstract: We present novel constructions of polynomial codes for private distributed matrix multiplication (PDMM/SDMM) using outer product partitioning (OPP). We extend the degree table framework from the literature to cyclic-addition degree tables (CATs). By using roots of unity as evaluation points, we enable modulo-addition in the table. Based on CATs, we present an explicit construction, called CATx, that requires fewer workers than existing schemes in the low-privacy regime. Additionally, we present new families of schemes based on conventional degree tables, called GASPrs and DOGrs, that outperform the state-of-the-art for a wide range of parameters.</description>

      <title>An Analytical Study of the Min-Sum Approximation for Polar Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The min-sum approximation is widely used in the decoding of polar codes. Although it is a numerical approximation, hardly any penalties are incurred in practice. We give a theoretical justification for this. We consider the common case of a binary-input, memoryless, and symmetric channel, decoded using successive cancellation and the min-sum approximation. Under mild assumptions, we show the following. For the finite length case, we show how to exactly calculate the error probabilities of all synthetic (bit) channels in time $O(N^{1.585})$, where $N$ is the codeword length. This implies a code construction algorithm with the above complexity. For the asymptotic case, we develop two rate thresholds, denoted $R_{\mathrm{L}} = R_{\mathrm{L}}(\lambda)$ and $R_{\mathrm{U}} =R_{\mathrm{U}}(\lambda)$, where $\lambda(\cdot)$ is the labeler of the channel outputs (essentially, a quantizer). For any $0 &lt; \beta &lt; \frac{1}{2}$ and any code rate $R &lt; R_{\mathrm{L}}$, there exists a family of polar codes with growing lengths such that their rates are at least $R$ and their error probabilities are at most $2^{-N^\beta}$. That is, strong polarization continues to hold under the min-sum approximation. Conversely, for code rates exceeding $R_{\mathrm{U}}$, the error probability approaches $1$ as the code-length increases, irrespective of which bits are frozen. We show that $0 &lt; R_{\mathrm{L}} \leq R_{\mathrm{U}} \leq C$, where $C$ is the channel capacity. The last inequality is often strict, in which case the ramification of using the min-sum approximation is that we can no longer achieve capacity.</description>

      <title>Optimal Bilinear Equalizer for Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems over Correlated Rician Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the low-complexity optimal bilinear equalizer (OBE) combining scheme design for cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output networks with spatially correlated Rician fading channels. We provide a spectral efficiency (SE) performance analysis framework for both the centralized and distributed processing schemes with bilinear equalizer (BE)-structure combining schemes applied. The BE-structured combining is a set of schemes that are constructed by the multiplications of channel statistics-based BE matrices and instantaneous channel estimates. Notably, we derive closed-form achievable SE expressions for centralized and distributed BE-structured combining schemes. We propose one centralized and two distributed OBE schemes: Centralized OBE (C-OBE), Distributed OBE based on Global channel statistics (DG-OBE), and Distributed OBE based on Local channel statistics (DL-OBE), which maximize their respective SE expressions. OBE matrices in these schemes are tailored based on varying levels of channel statistics. Notably, we obtain new and insightful closed-form results for the C-OBE, DG-OBE, and DL-OBE combining schemes. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed OBE schemes can achieve excellent SE, even in scenarios with severe pilot contamination.</description>

In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture Spike Talk via a unified representation of power and information as a means of data normalization using spikes for coordinated control of microgrids. This grid-edge technology allows each distributed energy resource (DER) to execute decentralized secondary control philosophy independently by interacting among each other using power flow along the tie-lines. Inspired from the field of computational neuroscience, Spike Talk basically builds on a fine-grained parallelism on the information transfer theory in our brains, particularly when neurons (modeled as DERs) transmit information (inferred from power streams measurable at each DER) through synapses (modeled as tie-lines). Not only does Spike Talk simplify and address the current bottlenecks of the cyber-physical architectural operation by dismissing the ICT layer, it provides intrinsic operational and cost-effective opportunities in terms of infrastructure development, computations and modeling. Hence, this paper provides a pedagogic illustration of the key concepts and design theories. Since we focus on coordinated control of microgrids in this paper, the signaling accuracy and system performance is studied for several neural coding schemes responsible for converting the real-valued local measurements into spikes.</description>

Abstract: Label differential privacy (DP) is designed for learning problems involving private labels and public features. While various methods have been proposed for learning under label DP, the theoretical limits remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate the fundamental limits of learning with label DP in both local and central models for both classification and regression tasks, characterized by minimax convergence rates. We establish lower bounds by converting each task into a multiple hypothesis testing problem and bounding the test error. Additionally, we develop algorithms that yield matching upper bounds. Our results demonstrate that under label local DP (LDP), the risk has a significantly faster convergence rate than that under full LDP, i.e. protecting both features and labels, indicating the advantages of relaxing the DP definition to focus solely on labels. In contrast, under the label central DP (CDP), the risk is only reduced by a constant factor compared to full DP, indicating that the relaxation of CDP only has limited benefits on the performance.</description>
