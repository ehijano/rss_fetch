      <title>Approximate Puzzlepiece Compositing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing demand for larger and higher fidelity simulations has made Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) and unstructured mesh techniques essential to focus compute effort and memory cost on just the areas of interest in the simulation domain. The distribution of these meshes over the compute nodes is often determined by balancing compute, memory, and network costs, leading to distributions with jagged nonconvex boundaries that fit together much like puzzle pieces. It is expensive, and sometimes impossible, to re-partition the data posing a challenge for in situ and post hoc visualization as the data cannot be rendered using standard sort-last compositing techniques that require a convex and disjoint data partitioning. We present a new distributed volume rendering and compositing algorithm, Approximate Puzzlepiece Compositing, that enables fast and high-accuracy in-place rendering of AMR and unstructured meshes. Our approach builds on Moment-Based Ordered-Independent Transparency to achieve a scalable, order-independent compositing algorithm that requires little communication and does not impose requirements on the data partitioning. We evaluate the image quality and scalability of our approach on synthetic data and two large-scale unstructured meshes on HPC systems by comparing to state-of-the-art sort-last compositing techniques, highlighting our approach's minimal overhead at higher core counts. We demonstrate that Approximate Puzzlepiece Compositing provides a scalable, high-performance, and high-quality distributed rendering approach applicable to the complex data distributions encountered in large-scale CFD simulations.</description>

      <title>FilmAgent: A Multi-Agent Framework for End-to-End Film Automation in Virtual 3D Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virtual film production requires intricate decision-making processes, including scriptwriting, virtual cinematography, and precise actor positioning and actions. Motivated by recent advances in automated decision-making with language agent-based societies, this paper introduces FilmAgent, a novel LLM-based multi-agent collaborative framework for end-to-end film automation in our constructed 3D virtual spaces. FilmAgent simulates various crew roles, including directors, screenwriters, actors, and cinematographers, and covers key stages of a film production workflow: (1) idea development transforms brainstormed ideas into structured story outlines; (2) scriptwriting elaborates on dialogue and character actions for each scene; (3) cinematography determines the camera setups for each shot. A team of agents collaborates through iterative feedback and revisions, thereby verifying intermediate scripts and reducing hallucinations. We evaluate the generated videos on 15 ideas and 4 key aspects. Human evaluation shows that FilmAgent outperforms all baselines across all aspects and scores 3.98 out of 5 on average, showing the feasibility of multi-agent collaboration in filmmaking. Further analysis reveals that FilmAgent, despite using the less advanced GPT-4o model, surpasses the single-agent o1, showing the advantage of a well-coordinated multi-agent system. Lastly, we discuss the complementary strengths and weaknesses of OpenAI's text-to-video model Sora and our FilmAgent in filmmaking.</description>

      <title>Neural Radiance Fields for the Real World: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have remodeled 3D scene representation since release. NeRFs can effectively reconstruct complex 3D scenes from 2D images, advancing different fields and applications such as scene understanding, 3D content generation, and robotics. Despite significant research progress, a thorough review of recent innovations, applications, and challenges is lacking. This survey compiles key theoretical advancements and alternative representations and investigates emerging challenges. It further explores applications on reconstruction, highlights NeRFs' impact on computer vision and robotics, and reviews essential datasets and toolkits. By identifying gaps in the literature, this survey discusses open challenges and offers directions for future research.</description>

      <title>PairingNet: A Learning-based Pair-searching and -matching Network for Image Fragments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a learning-based image fragment pair-searching and -matching approach to solve the challenging restoration problem. Existing works use rule-based methods to match similar contour shapes or textures, which are always difficult to tune hyperparameters for extensive data and computationally time-consuming. Therefore, we propose a neural network that can effectively utilize neighbor textures with contour shape information to fundamentally improve performance. First, we employ a graph-based network to extract the local contour and texture features of fragments. Then, for the pair-searching task, we adopt a linear transformer-based module to integrate these local features and use contrastive loss to encode the global features of each fragment. For the pair-matching task, we design a weighted fusion module to dynamically fuse extracted local contour and texture features, and formulate a similarity matrix for each pair of fragments to calculate the matching score and infer the adjacent segment of contours. To faithfully evaluate our proposed network, we created a new image fragment dataset through an algorithm we designed that tears complete images into irregular fragments. The experimental results show that our proposed network achieves excellent pair-searching accuracy, reduces matching errors, and significantly reduces computational time. Details, sourcecode, and data are available in our supplementary material.</description>
