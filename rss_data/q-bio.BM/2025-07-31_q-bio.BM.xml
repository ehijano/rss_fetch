      <title>Biomimetic Engineering of a Fortified Ice Composite with Enhanced Mechanical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents BioPykrete, a new sustainable bio-composite material created from ice, nano-crystalline cellulose (CNC), and a tailor-made chimera protein designed to bind the two together. We developed and produced the chimera protein by linking AFPIII, an ice-binding protein, with CBM3a, a CNC-binding protein. As the suspension freezes, the CNC chains self-organize into a reinforcing network between the ice crystals. This structural enhancement limits crack propagation to typical pore sizes, allowing BioPykrete to avoid the brittle and sudden failure commonly associated with ice. Instead, it exhibits an elastic-like response to stress, making it suitable for construction and engineering applications. With compressive strength comparable with concrete, BioPykrete offers a sustainable and biodegradable alternative to construction materials suitable for the harsh arctic regions of the world where traditional methods are ineffective, and resources are scarce. Engineering chimera proteins with specific affinity to more than a single material type may help improve or tailor the properties of other composite materials.</description>

      <title>Whole body dynamic PET kernel reconstruction using nonnegative matrix factorization features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The kernel reconstruction is a method that reduces noise in dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) by exploiting spatial correlations in the PET image. Although this method works well for large anatomical regions with relatively slow kinetics, whole body PET reconstruction with the kernel method can produce suboptimal results in regions with fast kinetics and high contrast. In this work we propose a new design of the spatial kernel matrix to improve reconstruction in fast and slow kinetics body regions. We calculate voxels features using nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) with optimal rank selection. These features are then used to calculate similarities between voxels considering relative differences between features to adapt to a wide range of activity levels. Simulations and whole body mouse scans of high temporal resolution [18F]SynVesT-1, low dose [11C]raclopride, and [18F]Fallypride were performed to assess the performance of the method in different settings. In simulations, bias vs variance tradeoff and contrast was improved using the NMF kernel matrix, compared with the original kernel method. In real data, fast kinetic regions such as the heart, veins and kidneys presented oversmoothing or artifacts with the original kernel method. Our proposed method did not present these effects, while reducing noise. Brain kinetic modeling parametric maps with image derived input function ([18F]SynVesT-1) and with reference region ([11C]raclopride and [18F]Fallypride) also had lower standard error using the proposed kernel matrix compared with other methods. The NMF kernel reconstruction reduces noise and maintains high contrast in whole body PET imaging, outperforming the traditional kernel method.</description>
