      <title>Did WISE detect Dyson Spheres/Structures around Gaia-2MASS-selected stars?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soon after the release of the WISE all-sky catalogue of 500 million mid-infrared (IR) objects, suggestions were made that it could be used to search for extrasolar devices constructed by an advanced civilization to convert a significant fraction of their host star's luminosity into useful work: "technostructures", "megastructures" or "Dyson spheres/structures", hereafter DSMs, whose inevitable waste heat would be seen by WISE at mid-IR wavelengths. However, a trawl of several million potentially-habitable Gaia-detected stars for mid-IR-excess signatures is fraught with danger, due to both noise from such a large sample and, more importantly, confusion with the emission from dusty background galaxies. In light of a recent claim of seven potential DSMs in MNRAS, a brief rebuttal appeared on arXiv. Further to this response, the relevance of WISE-detected galaxies is discussed in more detail, leading to a seemingly tight limit on the number and lifetime of DSMs, and indeed intelligent worlds, in the ~600-pc-radius region patrolled by Gaia. However, the detectability of DSMs is questioned: a DSM might extinguish its star at optical/near-IR wavelengths, and thus either not appear or appear anomalously faint in a stellar catalogue. Moreover, a civilization advanced enough to construct a DSM is likely to be advanced enough to use countermeasures to mask its presence from us.</description>

      <title>Testing GPT-4 with Wolfram Alpha and Code Interpreter plug-ins on math and science problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05713v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This report describes a test of the large language model GPT-4 with the Wolfram Alpha and the Code Interpreter plug-ins on 105 original problems in science and math, at the high school and college levels, carried out in June-August 2023. Our tests suggest that the plug-ins significantly enhance GPT's ability to solve these problems. Having said that, there are still often "interface" failures; that is, GPT often has trouble formulating problems in a way that elicits useful answers from the plug-ins. Fixing these interface failures seems like a central challenge in making GPT a reliable tool for college-level calculation problems.</description>
