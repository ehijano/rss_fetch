      <title>Graph Learning for Bidirectional Disease Contact Tracing on Real Human Mobility Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For rapidly spreading diseases where many cases show no symptoms, swift and effective contact tracing is essential. While exposure notification applications provide alerts on potential exposures, a fully automated system is needed to track the infectious transmission routes. To this end, our research leverages large-scale contact networks from real human mobility data to identify the path of transmission. More precisely, we introduce a new Infectious Path Centrality network metric that informs a graph learning edge classifier to identify important transmission events, achieving an F1-score of 94%. Additionally, we explore bidirectional contact tracing, which quarantines individuals both retroactively and proactively, and compare its effectiveness against traditional forward tracing, which only isolates individuals after testing positive. Our results indicate that when only 30% of symptomatic individuals are tested, bidirectional tracing can reduce infectious effective reproduction rate by 71%, thus significantly controlling the outbreak.</description>

      <title>Emergence of network communities driven by local rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural systems are modeled by networks where nodes represent the system units and links their interactions. The networks nodes are often segregated into communities with different connectivity patterns. Node heterogeneity such as political affiliation in social networks or biological function in gene networks are highlighted as key factors driving the segregation of nodes into communities. Here I demonstrate that node heterogeneity is not a necessary requirement. Network communities are bound to emerge as a consequence of the local nature of the network evolution. To this end I introduce the Ramsey community number, $r_C$, the minimum graph size that warranties the emergence of network communities with almost certainty. I show that the Watts-Strogatz, local search and duplication-split network models all have finite $r_C$ values. In contrast, random graphs do not have emergent communities property and the Barab\'asi-Albert model does not reach certainty for the emergence of communities. I conclude that network communities are an emergent property rooted on the local nature of the network evolution.</description>

      <title>An iterative spectral algorithm for digraph clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph clustering is a fundamental technique in data analysis with applications in many different fields. While there is a large body of work on clustering undirected graphs, the problem of clustering directed graphs is much less understood. The analysis is more complex in the directed graph case for two reasons: the clustering must preserve directional information in the relationships between clusters, and directed graphs have non-Hermitian adjacency matrices whose properties are less conducive to traditional spectral methods. Here we consider the problem of partitioning the vertex set of a directed graph into $k\ge 2$ clusters so that edges between different clusters tend to follow the same direction. We present an iterative algorithm based on spectral methods applied to new Hermitian representations of directed graphs. Our algorithm performs favourably against the state-of-the-art, both on synthetic and real-world data sets. Additionally, it is able to identify a "meta-graph" of $k$ vertices that represents the higher-order relations between clusters in a directed graph. We showcase this capability on data sets pertaining food webs, biological neural networks, and the online card game Hearthstone.</description>

      <title>Revisiting gender bias research in bibliometrics: Standardizing methodological variability using Scholarly Data Analysis (SoDA) Cards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gender biases in scholarly metrics remain a persistent concern, despite numerous bibliometric studies exploring their presence and absence across productivity, impact, acknowledgment, and self-citations. However, methodological inconsistencies, particularly in author name disambiguation and gender identification, limit the reliability and comparability of these studies, potentially perpetuating misperceptions and hindering effective interventions. A review of 70 relevant publications over the past 12 years reveals a wide range of approaches, from name-based and manual searches to more algorithmic and gold-standard methods, with no clear consensus on best practices. This variability, compounded by challenges such as accurately disambiguating Asian names and managing unassigned gender labels, underscores the urgent need for standardized and robust methodologies. To address this critical gap, we propose the development and implementation of ``Scholarly Data Analysis (SoDA) Cards." These cards will provide a structured framework for documenting and reporting key methodological choices in scholarly data analysis, including author name disambiguation and gender identification procedures. By promoting transparency and reproducibility, SoDA Cards will facilitate more accurate comparisons and aggregations of research findings, ultimately supporting evidence-informed policymaking and enabling the longitudinal tracking of analytical approaches in the study of gender and other social biases in academia.</description>

      <title>Hashtag Re-Appropriation for Audience Control on Recommendation-Driven Social Media Xiaohongshu (rednote)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithms have played a central role in personalized recommendations on social media. However, they also present significant obstacles for content creators trying to predict and manage their audience reach. This issue is particularly challenging for marginalized groups seeking to maintain safe spaces. Our study explores how women on Xiaohongshu (rednote), a recommendation-driven social platform, proactively re-appropriate hashtags (e.g., #Baby Supplemental Food) by using them in posts unrelated to their literal meaning. The hashtags were strategically chosen from topics that would be uninteresting to the male audience they wanted to block. Through a mixed-methods approach, we analyzed the practice of hashtag re-appropriation based on 5,800 collected posts and interviewed 24 active users from diverse backgrounds to uncover users' motivations and reactions towards the re-appropriation. This practice highlights how users can reclaim agency over content distribution on recommendation-driven platforms, offering insights into self-governance within algorithmic-centered power structures.</description>

      <title>Massive Online Course on Entrepreneurship. Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entrepreneurship is a key component of society, and universities and major political structures have tried to support its development in recent years. The present study aims to check the perception of students (based on gender) about entrepreneurial intentions after participating in a course that had a large number of undergraduate students. There were 970 students enrolled from different faculties with various specializations. We conducted a gender-based survey on the unconventional entrepreneurial fundamentals course, where each course was delivered by a different speaker. We also compared the responses provided by computer science students with the overall responses to find differences in their perceptions related to the feasibility of teaching entrepreneurship online, determining the entrepreneurial intention of the students taking this course, and analyzing the perceptions related to the business environment and the ease of starting a business. We found that students, regardless of gender or field of study, prefer interactive online presentations based on the manner in which lectures on this subject were conducted.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Study of Dotfiles Repositories Containing User-Specific Configuration Files</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Storing user-specific configuration files in a "dotfiles" repository is a common practice among software developers, with hundreds of thousands choosing to publicly host their repositories on GitHub. This practice not only provides developers with a simple backup mechanism for their essential configuration files, but also facilitates sharing ideas and learning from others on how best to configure applications that are key to their daily workflows. However, our current understanding of these repository sharing practices is limited and mostly anecdotal. To address this gap, we conducted a study to delve deeper into this phenomenon. Beginning with collecting and analyzing publicly-hosted dotfiles repositories on GitHub, we discovered that maintaining dotfiles is widespread among developers. Notably, we found that 25.8% of the top 500 most-starred GitHub users maintain some form of publicly accessible dotfiles repository. Among these, configurations for text editors like Vim and shells such as bash and zsh are the most commonly tracked. Our analysis reveals that updating dotfiles is primarily driven by the need to adjust configurations (63.3%) and project meta-management (25.4%). Surprisingly, we found no significant difference in the types of dotfiles observed across code churn history patterns, suggesting that the frequency of dotfile modifications depends more on the developer than the properties of the specific dotfile and its associated application. Finally, we discuss the challenges associated with managing dotfiles, including the necessity for a reliable and effective deployment mechanism, and how the insights gleaned from dotfiles can inform tool designers by offering real-world usage information.</description>

      <title>Fairness in Social Influence Maximization via Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17736v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study fairness in social influence maximization, whereby one seeks to select seeds that spread a given information throughout a network, ensuring balanced outreach among different communities (e.g. demographic groups). In the literature, fairness is often quantified in terms of the expected outreach within individual communities. In this paper, we demonstrate that such fairness metrics can be misleading since they overlook the stochastic nature of information diffusion processes. When information diffusion occurs in a probabilistic manner, multiple outreach scenarios can occur. As such, outcomes such as ``In 50% of the cases, no one in group 1 gets the information, while everyone in group 2 does, and in the other 50%, it is the opposite'', which always results in largely unfair outcomes, are classified as fair by a variety of fairness metrics in the literature. We tackle this problem by designing a new fairness metric, mutual fairness, that captures variability in outreach through optimal transport theory. We propose a new seed-selection algorithm that optimizes both outreach and mutual fairness, and we show its efficacy on several real datasets. We find that our algorithm increases fairness with only a minor decrease (and at times, even an increase) in efficiency.</description>

      <title>Memory-Efficient Community Detection on Large Graphs Using Weighted Sketches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02268v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Community detection in graphs identifies groups of nodes with denser connections within the groups than between them, and while existing studies often focus on optimizing detection performance, memory constraints become critical when processing large graphs on shared-memory systems. We recently proposed efficient implementations of the Louvain, Leiden, and Label Propagation Algorithms (LPA) for community detection. However, these incur significant memory overhead from the use of collision-free per-thread hashtables. To address this, we introduce memory-efficient alternatives using weighted Misra-Gries (MG) sketches, which replace the per-thread hashtables, and reduce memory demands in Louvain, Leiden, and LPA implementations - while incurring only a minor quality drop (up to 1%) and moderate runtime penalties. We believe that these approaches, though slightly slower, are well-suited for parallel processing and could outperform current memory-intensive techniques on systems with many threads.</description>

      <title>Quantifying community evolution in temporal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When we detect communities in temporal networks it is important to ask questions about how they change in time. Normalised Mutual Information (NMI) has been used to measure the similarity of communities when the nodes on a network do not change. We propose two extensions namely Union-Normalised Mutual Information (UNMI) and Intersection-Normalised Mutual Information (INMI). UNMI and INMI evaluate the similarity of community structure under the condition of node variation. Experiments show that these methods are effective in dealing with temporal networks with the changes in the set of nodes, and can capture the dynamic evolution of community structure in both synthetic and real temporal networks. This study not only provides a new similarity measurement method for network analysis but also helps to deepen the understanding of community change in complex temporal networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local communities are widely observed in spatial networks. However, how such structure affects the vulnerability against malicious attacks remains unclear. This study investigates the impact of local communities on the robustness of connectivity by modeling planar infrastructure networks based on statistical population data. Our research reveals that the emergence of local communities is caused by spatial concentrations of nodes connected by short links, which significantly reduce the robustness. These results suggest that strategically establishing long distance links provides a feasible solution to balance reliability and construction costs in infrastructure network design.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Hyperedge Prediction with Context-Aware Self-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypergraphs can naturally model group-wise relations (e.g., a group of users who co-purchase an item) as hyperedges. Hyperedge prediction is to predict future or unobserved hyperedges, which is a fundamental task in many real-world applications (e.g., group recommendation). Despite the recent breakthrough of hyperedge prediction methods, the following challenges have been rarely studied: (C1) How to aggregate the nodes in each hyperedge candidate for accurate hyperedge prediction? and (C2) How to mitigate the inherent data sparsity problem in hyperedge prediction? To tackle both challenges together, in this paper, we propose a novel hyperedge prediction framework (CASH) that employs (1) context-aware node aggregation to precisely capture complex relations among nodes in each hyperedge for (C1) and (2) self-supervised contrastive learning in the context of hyperedge prediction to enhance hypergraph representations for (C2). Furthermore, as for (C2), we propose a hyperedge-aware augmentation method to fully exploit the latent semantics behind the original hypergraph and consider both node-level and group-level contrasts (i.e., dual contrasts) for better node and hyperedge representations. Extensive experiments on six real-world hypergraphs reveal that CASH consistently outperforms all competing methods in terms of the accuracy in hyperedge prediction and each of the proposed strategies is effective in improving the model accuracy of CASH. For the detailed information of CASH, we provide the code and datasets at: https://github.com/yy-ko/cash.</description>

      <title>Is the panel fair? Evaluating panel compositions through network analysis. The case of research assessments in Italy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06476v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Research evaluation is usually governed by panels of peers. Procedural fairness refers to the principles that ensures decisions are made through a fair and transparent process. It requires that the composition of panels is fair. A fair panel is usually defined in terms of observable characteristics of scholars such as gender or affiliations. The formal adherence to these criteria is not sufficient to guarantee a fair composition in terms of scholarly thinking, background, or policy orientation. An empirical strategy for exploring the fairness in the intellectual composition of panels is proposed, based on the observation of links between panellists. The case study regards the three panels selected to evaluate research in economics, statistics and business during the Italian research assessment exercises. The first two panels were appointed directly by the governmental agency responsible for the evaluation, while the third was randomly selected. Hence the third panel can be considered as a control for evaluating about the fairness of the others. The fair representation is explored by comparing the networks of panellists based on their co-authorship relations, the networks based on journals in which they published and the networks based on their affiliated institutions (universities, research centres and newspapers). The results show that the members of the first two panels had connections much higher than the members of the control group. Hence the composition of the first two panels should be considered as unfair, as the results of the research assessments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06889v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human mobility patterns reflect our interactions with the environment. While extensive research has focused on specific spatial scales -- such as intracity or intercity -- universal mobility characteristics across various scales remain largely unexplored. Here, by partitioning trajectories into modules through network community detection, we find that the geospatial extent of modules increases sublinearly with distance from home, indicating a universal inflation law that holds across three orders of magnitude and is independent of demographic factors. Our further investigation highlights a potential connection between this inflation law and hierarchical urban structure. These findings deepen our understanding of human mobility dynamics, with implications for urban planning, tourism management, and epidemic intervention.</description>
