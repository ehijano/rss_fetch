      <title>The Grothendieck computability model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Translating notions and results from category theory to the theory of computability models of Longley and Normann, we introduce the Grothendieck computability model and the first-projection-simulation. We prove some basic properties of the Grothendieck computability model, and we show that the category of computability models is a type-category, in the sense of Pitts. We introduce the notion of a fibration and opfibration-simulation, and we show that the first-projection-simulation is a split opfibration-simulation.</description>

      <title>Canonical extensions via fitted sublocales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build on a recent result stating that the frame $\mathsf{SE}(L)$ of strongly exact filters for a frame $L$ is anti-isomorphic to the coframe $\mathsf{S}_o(L)$ of fitted sublocales. The collection $\mathsf{E}(L)$ of exact filters of $L$ is known to be a sublocale of this frame. We consider several other subcollections of $\mathsf{SE}(L)$: the collections $\mathcal{J}(\mathsf{CP}(L))$ and $\mathcal{J}(\mathsf{SO}(L))$ of intersections of completely prime and Scott-open filters, respectively, and the collection $\mathsf{R}(L)$ of regular elements of the frame of filters. We show that all of these are sublocales of $\mathsf{SE}(L)$, and as such they correspond to subcolocales of $\mathsf{S}_o(L)$, which all turn out to have a concise description. By using the theory of polarities of Birkhoff, one can show that all of the structures mentioned above enjoy universal properties which are variations of that of the canonical extension. We also show how some of these subcollections can be described as polarities and give three new equivalent definitions of subfitness in terms of the lattice of filters.</description>

      <title>When Lawvere meets Peirce: an equational presentation of boolean hyperdoctrines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fo-bicategories are a categorification of Peirce's calculus of relations. Notably, their laws provide a proof system for first-order logic that is both purely equational and complete. This paper illustrates a correspondence between fo-bicategories and Lawvere's hyperdoctrines. To streamline our proof, we introduce peircean bicategories, which offer a more succinct characterization of fo-bicategories.</description>

      <title>Mutation of $n$-cotorsion pairs in triangulated categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we define the notion of $n$-cotorsion pairs in triangulated categories, which is a generalization of the classical cotorsion pairs. We prove that any mutation of an $n$-cotorsion pair is again an $n$-cotorsion pair. When $n=1$, this result generalizes the work of Zhou and Zhu for classical cotorsion pairs. As applications, we give a geometric characterization of $n$-cotorsion pairs in $n$-cluster categories of type $A$ and give a geometric realization of mutation of $n$-cotorsion pairs via rotation of certain configurations of $n$-diagonals.</description>

      <title>Natural homotopy of multipointed d-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify Grandis' directed spaces as a full reflective subcategory of the category of multipointed $d$-spaces. When the multipointed $d$-space realizes a precubical set, its reflection coincides with the standard realization of the precubical set as a directed space. The reflection enables us to extend the construction of the natural system of topological spaces in Baues-Wirsching's sense from directed spaces to multipointed $d$-spaces. In the case of a cellular multipointed $d$-space, there is a discrete version of this natural system which is proved to be bisimilar up to homotopy. We also prove that these constructions are invariant up to homotopy under globular subdivision. These results are the globular analogue of Dubut's results. Finally, we point the incompatibility between the notion of bisimilar natural systems and the q-model structure of multipointed $d$-spaces. This means that either the notion of bisimilar natural systems is too rigid or new model structures should be considered on multipointed $d$-spaces.</description>

      <title>Enriched monoidal categories I: centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.03121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is the first one in a series, in which we develop a mathematical theory of enriched (braided) monoidal categories and their representations. In this work, we introduce the notion of the $E_0$-center ($E_1$-center or $E_2$-center) of an enriched (monoidal or braided monoidal) category, and compute the centers explicitly when the enriched (braided monoidal or monoidal) categories are obtained from the canonical constructions. These centers have important applications in the mathematical theory of gapless boundaries of 2+1D topological orders and that of topological phase transitions in physics. They also play very important roles in the higher representation theory, which is the focus of the second work in the series.</description>

      <title>$\kappa $-left-exact and $\kappa $-regular copresheaves on $(\kappa ,\kappa )$-coherent categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05345v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\kappa $-left-exact copresheaves on a $\kappa $-site $(\mathcal{C},E)$ form a full reflective subcategory in $(\mathcal{C},E)\downarrow \mathbf{Site}^{\sim }_{\kappa }$, the category of site-morphisms out of $\mathcal{C}$. Given a $\kappa $-lex $F:\mathcal{C}\to \mathbf{Set}$ the construction extends $\mathcal{C}$ by adding constants along $F$.
  When $\kappa $ has the tree property one can work with subcanonical sites. $\kappa $-regular copresheaves on $(\kappa ,\kappa )$-coherent categories are identified with $(\kappa ,\kappa )$-coherent functors to sheaves over $\kappa $-complete, $(\kappa ,\kappa )$-distributive Boolean-algebras.
  We discuss some applications: first, a Boolean-valued completeness theorem, second, that $\mathcal{C}\to \mathbf{Set} $ regular functors (on coherent categories with disjoint coproducts) admit an elementary embedding to a product of coherent functors.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Equality in Substructural Logic via Lipschitz Doctrines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.05388v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Substructural logics naturally support a quantitative interpretation of formulas, as they are seen as consumable resources. Distances are the quantitative counterpart of equivalence relations: they measure how much two objects are similar, rather than just saying whether they are equivalent or not. Hence, they provide the natural choice for modelling equality in a substructural setting. In this paper, we develop this idea, using the categorical language of Lawvere's doctrines. We work in a minimal fragment of Linear Logic enriched by graded modalities, which are needed to write a resource sensitive substitution rule for equality, enabling its quantitative interpretation as a distance. We introduce both a deductive calculus and the notion of Lipschitz doctrine to give it a sound and complete categorical semantics. The study of 2-categorical properties of Lipschitz doctrines provides us with a universal construction, which generates examples based for instance on metric spaces and quantitative realisability. Finally, we show how to smoothly extend our results to richer substructural logics, up to full Linear Logic with quantifiers.</description>

      <title>The categories of corings and coalgebras over a ring are locally countably presentable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02928v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any commutative ring $R$, we show that the categories of $R$-coalgebras and cocommutative $R$-coalgebras are locally $\aleph_1$-presentable, while the categories of $R$-flat $R$-coalgebras are $\aleph_1$-accessible. Similarly, for any associative ring $R$, the category of $R$-corings is locally $\aleph_1$-presentable, while the category of $R$-$R$-bimodule flat $R$-corings is $\aleph_1$-accessible. The cardinality of the ring $R$ can be arbitrarily large. We also discuss $R$-corings with surjective counit and flat kernel. The proofs are straightforward applications of an abstract category-theoretic principle going back to Ulmer. For right or two-sided $R$-module flat $R$-corings, our cardinality estimate for the accessibility rank is not as good. A generalization to comonoid objects in accessible monoidal categories is also considered.</description>
