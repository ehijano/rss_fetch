      <title>The category of anyon sectors for non-abelian quantum double models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Kitaev's quantum double model for arbitrary finite gauge group in infinite volume, using an operator-algebraic approach. The quantum double model hosts anyonic excitations which can be identified with equivalence classes of `localized and transportable endomorphisms', which produce anyonic excitations from the ground state. Following the Doplicher--Haag--Roberts (DHR) sector theory from AQFT, we organize these endomorphisms into a braided monoidal category capturing the fusion and braiding properties of the anyons. We show that this category is equivalent to $\mathrm{Rep}_f \mathcal{D}(G)$, the representation category of the quantum double of $G$. This establishes for the first time the full DHR structure for a class of 2d quantum lattice models with non-abelian anyons.</description>

      <title>Derivation of Hartree-Fock Dynamics and Semiclassical Commutator Estimates for Fermions in a Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of a large number of interacting fermionic particles in a constant magnetic field. In a coupled mean-field and semiclassical scaling limit, we show that solutions of the many-body Schr\"odinger equation converge to solutions of a non-linear Hartree-Fock equation. The central ingredient of the proof are certain semiclassical trace norm estimates of commutators of the position and momentum operators with the one-particle density matrix of the solution of the Hartree-Fock equation. In a first step, we prove their validity for non-interacting initial data in a magnetic field by generalizing a 2020 result of Fournais and Mikkelsen. We then propagate these bounds from the initial data along the Hartree-Fock flow to arbitrary times.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations of unstable eigenvalues for Stokes waves derived from conserved energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address Euler's equations for irrotational gravity waves in an infinitely deep fluid rewritten in conformal variables. Stokes waves are traveling waves with the smooth periodic profile. In agreement with the previous numerical results, we give a rigorous proof that the zero eigenvalue bifurcation in the linearized equations of motion for co-periodic perturbations occurs at each extremal point of the energy function versus the steepness parameter, provided that the wave speed is not extremal at the same steepness. We derive the normal form for the unstable eigenvalues and, assisted with numerical approximation of its coefficients, we show that the new unstable eigenvalues emerge only in the direction of increasing steepness.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal polynomials in the spherical ensemble with two insertions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider planar orthogonal polynomials $P_{n,N}$ with respect to the weight $$\frac{|z-w|^{NQ_1}}{(1+|z|^2)^{N(1+Q_0+Q_1)+1}}, \quad(Q_0,Q_1 &gt; 0)$$ in the whole complex plane. With $n, N\rightarrow\infty$ and $N-n$ fixed, we obtain the strong asymptotics of the polynomials, and asymptotics for the weighted $L^2$ norm and the limiting zero counting measure. These results apply to the pre-critical phase of the underlying Coulomb gas system, when the equilibrium measure is simply connected. Our method relies on specifying the mother body of the two-dimensional potential problem. It relies too on the fact that the planar orthogonality can be rewritten as a non-Hermitian contour orthogonality. This allows us to perform the Deift-Zhou steepest descent analysis of the associated $2\times 2$ Riemann-Hilbert problem.</description>

      <title>General Classification, Invariance and Conservation Laws Analyses of Nonlinear Fourth Order Wave and Nerve Membrane Equations with Dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the nonlinear wave equation for arbitrary function with fourth order dissipation. A special case that is analysed exclusively is the model of nerve membranes; we consider this model, both, in the presence and absence of the fourth order dissipation. The equivalence transformations, Lie symmetries and a complete classification is presented. We also discuss the one dimensional optimal system in each case obtained via classification. The reduction of the partial differential equations (PDEs) is carried out and the forms of invariant solutions are presented. The study also include the construction of conservation laws using the direct method. The invariant solutions and some special type of solutions including solitions are presented with their graphical illustrations.</description>

      <title>Constraint Phase Space Formulations for Finite-State Quantum Systems: The Relation between Commutator Variables and Complex Stiefel Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have recently developed the \textit{constraint} coordinate-momentum \textit{phase space} (CPS) formulation for finite-state quantum systems. It has been implemented for the electronic subsystem in nonadiabatic transition dynamics to develop practical trajectory-based approaches. In the generalized CPS formulation for the mapping Hamiltonian of the classical mapping model with commutator variables (CMMcv) method [\textit{J. Phys. Chem. A} \textbf{2021}, 125, 6845-6863], each {connected} component of the generalized CPS is the \textit{complex Stiefel manifold} labeled by the eigenvalue set of the mapping kernel. Such a phase space structure allows for exact trajectory-based dynamics for pure discrete (electronic) degrees of freedom (DOFs), where the equations of motion of each trajectory are isomorphic to the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. We employ covariant kernels {within the generalized CPS framework} to develop two approaches that naturally yield exact evaluation of time correlation functions (TCFs) for pure discrete (electronic) DOFs. In addition, we briefly discuss the phase space mapping formalisms where the contribution of each trajectory to the integral expression of the {TCF} of population dynamics is strictly positive semi-definite. The generalized CPS formulation also indicates that the equations of motion in phase space mapping model I of our previous work [\textit{J. Chem. Phys.} \textbf{2016}, 145, 204105; \textbf{2017}, 146, 024110; \textbf{2019}, 151, 024105] lead to a complex Stiefel manifold $\mathrm{U}(F)/\mathrm{U}(F-2)$. It is expected that the generalized CPS formulation has implications for simulations of both nonadiabatic transition dynamics and many-body quantum dynamics for spins/bosons/fermions.</description>

      <title>Event Soliton Formation in Mixed Energy-Momentum Gaps of Nonlinear Spacetime Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the formation of a novel soliton, termed event soliton, in nonlinear photonic spacetime crystals (STCs). In these media, simultaneous spatiotemporal periodic modulation of the dielectric constant generates mixed frequency (${\omega}$) and wavevector (k) gaps. Under Kerr nonlinearity, the event solitons emerge as fully localized entities in both spacetime and energy-momentum domains, providing a tangible demonstration of the concept of event in relativity. The ${\omega}$k-gap mixture arises from the coexistence and competition between time reflected and Bragg reflected waves due to the spatiotemporal modulation. We propose a new partial differential equation to capture various spatiotemporal patterns and present numerical simulations to validate our theoretical predictions, reflecting a three-way balance among k-gap opening, ${\omega}$-gap opening, and nonlinearity. Our work opens avenues for fundamental studies and fosters experimental prospects for implementing spacetime crystals in both time-varying photonics and periodically driven condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>Super-Higher-Form Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the study of higher-form-symmetries to theories with supersymmetry. Using a supergeometry formulation, we find that ordinary higher-form-symmetries nicely combine with supersymmetry to give rise to a much larger spectrum of topological conserved (super)currents. These can be classified as a supersymmetric version of Chern-Weil symmetries, and a brand new set of geometric-Chern-Weil symmetries whose generators are constructed using invariant differential forms in super-manifolds. For N=1 super-Maxwell theory in various dimensions, we build the topological operators generating these super-higher-form symmetries and construct defects carrying non-trivial charges. Notably, the charge is proportional to the super-linking number between the super-hypersurface supporting the symmetry generator and the one supporting the defect.</description>

      <title>Modulated phases in Ising systems with long-range antiferromagnetic and short-range ferromagnetic interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider large spin systems with short-range ferromagnetic interactions and long-range antiferromagnetic interactions subjected to periodic boundary conditions which have been proved by Giuliani, Lebowitz and Lieb to have minimizers that tend to alternate groups of $1$ and $-1$ of the same length $h^\star$. We consider states with energy of the same order as that of minimizers and show that they consist of a finite number of modulated phases of the same form as minimizers with some interfacial defects. The analysis is carried out using the notation of Gamma-convergence by exhibiting an interfacial energy that describes the minimal defect energy between different modulated phases.</description>

      <title>A phase transition for the two-dimensional random field Ising/FK-Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the total variation (TV) distance between the laws of the 2D Ising/FK-Ising model in a box of side-length $N$ with and without an i.i.d.\ Gaussian external field with variance $\epsilon^2$. Letting the external field strength $\epsilon = \epsilon(N)$ depend on the size of the box, we derive a phase transition for each model depending on the order of $\epsilon(N)$. For the random field Ising model, the critical order for $\epsilon$ is $N^{-1}$. For the random field FK-Ising model, the critical order depends on the temperature regime: for $T&gt;T_c$, $T=T_c$ and $T\in (0, T_c)$ the critical order for $\epsilon$ is, respectively, $N^{-\frac{1}{2}}$, $N^{-\frac{15}{16}}$ and $N^{-1}$. In each case, as $N \to \infty$ the TV distance under consideration converges to $1$ when $\epsilon$ is above the respective critical order and converges to $0$ when below.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum transport generated by the bipartite entanglement in two-dimensional conformal field theory at finite density with the $U(1) \times U(1)$ symmetry associated to the conservation of the electric charge and of the helicity. The bipartition given by an interval is considered, either on the line or on the circle. The continuity equations and the corresponding conserved quantities for the modular flows of the currents and of the energy-momentum tensor are derived. We investigate the mean values of the associated currents and their quantum fluctuations in the finite density representation, which describe the properties of the modular quantum transport. The modular analogues of the Johnson-Nyquist law and of the fluctuation-dissipation relation are found, which encode the thermal nature of the modular evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework to identify Fluctuation Relations for vector-valued observables in physical systems evolving through a stochastic dynamics. These relations arise from the particular structure of a suitable entropic functional and are induced by transformations in trajectory space that are invertible but are not involutions, typical examples being spatial rotations and translations. In doing so, we recover as particular cases results known in the literature as isometric fluctuation relations or spatial fluctuation relations and moreover we provide a recipe to find new ones. We mainly discuss two case studies, namely stochastic processes described by a canonical path probability and non degenerate diffusion processes. In both cases we provide sufficient conditions for the fluctuation relation to hold, considering either finite time or asymptotically large times.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we analyze vanishing cycles of Feynman loop integrals by means of the Mayer-Vietoris spectral sequence. A complete classification of possible vanishing geometries are obtained. We employ this result for establishing an asymptotic expansion for the loop integrals near their singularity locus, then give explicit formulas for the coefficients of such an expansion. The further development of this framework may potentially lead to exact calculations of one- and two-loop Feynman diagrams, as well as other next-to-leading and higher-order diagrams, in studies of radiative corrections for upcoming lepton-hadron scattering experiments.</description>

      <title>Poincar\'e Duality for Supermanifolds, Higher Cartan Structures and Geometric Supergravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05224v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study relative differential and integral forms on families of supermanifolds and investigate their cohomology. In particular, we establish a relative version of Poincar\'e-Verdier duality, relating the cohomology of differential and integral forms, and provide a concrete interpretation via Berezin fiber integration, which we introduce. To complement Poincar\'e duality, we prove compactly supported Poincar\'e lemmas for both differential and integral forms, filling a gap in the literature. We then apply our results to the mathematical foundations of supergravity. Specifically, we rigorously define picture-changing operators via relative Poincar\'e duality and use them to formulate a general action principle for geometric supergravity in a mathematically rigorous manner. As an example, we explicitly describe three-dimensional supergravity via higher Cartan structures, which are defined by certain classes of connections valued in $L_\infty$-superalgebras. Our construction provides a unified framework interpolating between two equivalent formulations of supergravity in the physics literature: the superspace approach and the group manifold approach.</description>

      <title>Reformulation of continuum defects in terms of the general teleparallel geometry in the language of exterior algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the geometric formulation of continuum defects consisting of dislocations and disclinations. After reviewing the metric affine geometry and the present geometric formulation of dislocation and disclination written in terms of torsion and full curvature (together with vanishing non-metricity), we give a new formulation of them in a novel way in terms of torsion and non-metricity (together with vanishing full curvature), the so-called general teleparallel geometry. All calculations are performed by using the exterior algebra. We obtain continuity equations explicitly for dislocation density and disclination density.</description>

      <title>On the analog of the Kolmogorov-Arnold superposition representation for continuous functions of several $p$-adic variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that any continuous function depending on several $p$-adic variables, each of which is defined on $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$, can be represented as a superposition of continuous functions of one $p$-adic variable. This statement is true for both functions with values in $\mathbb{R}$ and functions with values in $\mathbb{Q}_{p}$.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Principle and Geometric Condition for the Observability of Schr\"{o}dinger Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09592v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide necessary and sufficient geometric conditions for the exact observability of the Schr\"odinger equation with inverse-square potentials on the half-line. These conditions are derived from a Logvinenko-Sereda type theorem for generalized Fourier transform. Specifically, the generalized Fourier transform associated with the Schr\"odinger operator with inverse-square potentials on the half-line is the well-known Hankel transform. We present a necessary and sufficient condition for a subset $\Omega$, such that a function whose Hankel transform is supported in a given interval can be bounded, in the $L^2$-norm, from above by its restriction to $\Omega$, with a constant independent of the position of the interval.</description>

      <title>Exploring external rarefied gas flows through the method of fundamental solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18128v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The well-known Navier--Stokes--Fourier equations of fluid dynamics are, in general, not adequate for describing rarefied gas flows. Moreover, while the Stokes equations -- a simplified version of the Navier--Stokes--Fourier equations -- are effective in modeling slow and steady liquid flow past a sphere, they fail to yield a non-trivial solution to the problem of slow and steady liquid flow past an infinitely long cylinder (a two-dimensional problem essentially); this is referred to as Stokes' paradox. The paradox also arises when studying these problems for gases. In this paper, we present a way to obtain meaningful solutions for two-dimensional flows of rarefied gases around objects by circumventing Stokes' paradox. To this end, we adopt an extended hydrodynamic model, referred to as the CCR model, consisting of the balance equations for the mass, momentum and energy and closed with the coupled constitutive relations. We determine an analytic solution of the CCR model for the problem and compare it with a numerical solution based on the method of fundamental solutions. Apart from addressing flow past a circular cylinder, we aim to showcase the capabilities of the method of fundamental solutions to predict the flow past other objects in two dimensions for which analytic solutions do not exist or are difficult to determine. For that, we investigate the problem of rarefied gas flow past an infinitely long semicircular cylinder.</description>

      <title>A Sufficient Criterion for Divisibility of Quantum Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17103v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a simple, dimension-independent criterion which guarantees that some quantum channel $\Phi$ is divisible, i.e. that there exists a non-trivial factorization $\Phi=\Phi_1\Phi_2$. The idea is to first define an "elementary" channel $\Phi_2$ and then to analyze when $\Phi\Phi_2^{-1}$ is completely positive. The sufficient criterion obtained this way -- which even yields an explicit factorization of $\Phi$ -- is that one has to find orthogonal unit vectors $x,x^\perp$ such that $\langle x^\perp|\mathcal K_\Phi\mathcal K_\Phi^\perp|x\rangle=\langle x|\mathcal K_\Phi\mathcal K_\Phi^\perp|x\rangle=\{0\}$ where $\mathcal K_\Phi$ is the Kraus subspace of $\Phi$ and $\mathcal K_\Phi^\perp$ is its orthogonal complement. Of course, using linearity this criterion can be reduced to finitely many equalities. Generically, this division even lowers the Kraus rank which is why repeated application -- if possible -- results in a factorization of $\Phi$ into in some sense "simple" channels. Finally, be aware that our techniques are not limited to the particular elementary channel we chose.</description>

      <title>A nonlinear d'Alembert comparison theorem and causal differential calculus on metric measure spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a variational first-order Sobolev calculus on metric measure spacetimes. The key object is the maximal weak subslope of an arbitrary causal function, which plays the role of the (Lorentzian) modulus of its differential. It is shown to satisfy certain chain and Leibniz rules, certify a locality property, and be compatible with its smooth analog. In this setup, we propose a quadraticity condition termed infinitesimal Minkowskianity, which singles out genuinely Lorentzian structures among Lorentz-Finsler spacetimes. Moreover, we establish a comparison theorem for a nonlinear yet elliptic $p$-d'Alembertian in a weak form under the timelike measure contraction property. As a particular case, this extends Eschenburg's classical estimate past the timelike cut locus.</description>

      <title>Entanglement of Disjoint Intervals in Dual-Unitary Circuits: Exact Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16750v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growth of the entanglement between two disjoint intervals and its complement after a quantum quench is regarded as a dynamical chaos indicator. Namely, it is expected to show qualitatively different behaviours depending on whether the underlying microscopic dynamics is chaotic or integrable. So far, however, this could only be verified in the context of conformal field theories. Here we present an exact confirmation of this expectation in a class of interacting microscopic Floquet systems on the lattice, i.e., dual-unitary circuits. These systems can either have zero or a super extensive number of conserved charges: the latter case is achieved via fine-tuning. We show that, for almost all dual unitary circuits on qubits and for a large family of dual-unitary circuits on qudits the asymptotic entanglement dynamics agrees with what is expected for chaotic systems. On the other hand, if we require the systems to have conserved charges, we find that the entanglement displays the qualitatively different behaviour expected for integrable systems. Interestingly, despite having many conserved charges, charge-conserving dual-unitary circuits are in general not Yang-Baxter integrable.</description>

      <title>Variational principles for fully coupled stochastic fluid dynamics across scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates variational frameworks for modeling stochastic dynamics in incompressible fluids, focusing on large-scale fluid behavior alongside small-scale stochastic processes. The authors aim to develop a coupled system of equations that captures both scales, using a variational principle formulated with Lagrangians defined on the full flow, and incorporating stochastic transport constraints. The approach smooths the noise term along time, leading to stochastic dynamics as a regularization parameter approaches zero. Initially, fixed noise terms are considered, resulting in a generalized stochastic Euler equation, which becomes problematic as the regularization parameter diminishes. The study then examines connections with existing stochastic frameworks and proposes a new variational principle that couples noise dynamics with large-scale fluid motion. This comprehensive framework provides a stochastic representation of large-scale dynamics while accounting for fine-scale components. Our main result is that the evolution of the small-scale velocity component is governed by a linearized Euler equation with random coefficients, influenced by large-scale transport, stretching, and pressure forcing.</description>

      <title>Infinite series involving special functions obtained using simple one-dimensional quantum mechanical problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10126v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper certain classes of infinite sums involving special functions are evaluated analytically by application of basic quantum mechanical principles to simple models of half harmonic oscillator and a particle trapped inside an infinite potential well. The infinite sums $\sum^{\infty}_{n=0}\frac{2^{2n}}{(2n+1)!}\Gamma^{2}\left(n+\frac{3}{2}\right)\left[\hspace{0.2mm}_2\hspace{-0.03cm}F_1\left(-n,\frac{\nu+2}{2};\frac{3}{2};\frac{1}{2}\right)\right]^{2}$, $\sum^{\infty}_{n=0}\frac{\left[L_{\nu}^{2n+1-\nu}\left(\frac{b^{2}}{2}\right)\right]^{2}b^{4n}}{2^{2n}(2n+1)!}$ and $\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}\frac{\big[J_{\nu+1}(n\pi)\big]^{2}}{n^{2\nu}}$, where $_2\hspace{-0.03cm}F_1\left(-n,\frac{\nu+2}{2};\frac{3}{2};\frac{1}{2}\right)$ is generalized hypergeometric function, $L_{\nu}^{2n+1-\nu}\left(\frac{b^{2}}{2}\right)$ associated Laguerre polynomial and $J_{\nu+1}(n\pi)$ Bessel function of the first kind, are calculated for integer $\nu$. It is also demonstrated that the same procedure can be generalized by application to some classes of functions which are not regular wave functions leading to additional infinite sums, as a consequence of which the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\left[\mathsf{H}_{\nu}(n\pi)\right]^{2}}{n^{2\nu}}$ containing Struve functions of the first kind $\mathsf{H}_{\nu}(n\pi)$ are evaluated. Convergence of the evaluated series, additionally verified by the application of different convergence tests, is secured by the properties of the corresponding Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>On a hyperbolic Duffing oscillator with linear damping and periodic forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Duffing oscillator describes the dynamics of a mass suspended on a spring with position-dependent stiffness. The mass is assumed to experience a linear damping and a time-dependent external forcing. The model has been instrumental in theoretical investigations of dynamical properties of systems with parity-conserving symmetry, where a double-well substrate connects two metastable states separated by a barrier. Physical systems of interest include nonlinear feedback-controlled mass-spring-damper oscillators, active hysteresis circuits (e.g. memristors), protein chains prone to hydrogen bond-mediated conformational transitions, centro-symmetric crystals and so on. In this work we consider a Duffing-type oscillator with a double-well potential represented by a hyperbolic function of mass position. The hyperbolic double-well potential has two degenerate minima that can be smoothly tuned by varying a deformability parameter, leaving unchanged the barrier height. We investigate solutions of the equation of motion in the absence and presence of damping and forcing. In the absence of perturbations numerical solutions lead to a periodic train of anharmonic oscillations featuring a crystal of pulse solitons of sech types. However, when the hyperbolic double-well potential is inverted, analytical solutions can be obtained which turn out to be kink-soliton crystals described by Jacobi elliptic functions. When damping and forcing are taken into consideration, the system dynamics can transit from periodic to chaotic phases or vice-versa via period-doubling or period-halving bifurcations, by simply varying the deformability parameter. The Poincar\'e map of the proposed model carries the well-known characteristic signatures of chaos presursors of the standard Duffing model, which happens to be just a particular case of the bistable oscillator model with the hyperbolic double-well potential.</description>
