      <title>AI-Aided Annealed Langevin Dynamics for Rapid Optimization of Programmable Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging technologies such as Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) make it possible to optimize some parameters of wireless channels. Conventional approaches require relating the channel and its programmable parameters via a simple model that supports rapid optimization, e.g., re-tuning the parameters each time the users move. However, in practice such models are often crude approximations of the channel, and a more faithful description can be obtained via complex simulators, or only by measurements. In this work, we introduce a novel approach for rapid optimization of programmable channels based on AI-aided Annealed Langevin Dynamics (ALD), which bypasses the need for explicit channel modeling. By framing the ALD algorithm using the MAP estimate, we design a deep unfolded ALD algorithm that leverages a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to estimate score gradients for optimizing channel parameters. We introduce a training method that overcomes the need for channel modeling using zero-order gradients, combined with active learning to enhance generalization, enabling optimization in complex and dynamically changing environments. We evaluate the proposed method in RIS-aided scenarios subject to rich-scattering effects. Our results demonstrate that our AI-aided ALD method enables rapid and reliable channel parameter tuning with limited latency.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits of Cooperative Integrated Sensing and Communications over Low-Earth Orbit THz Satellite Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz inter-satellite links enable unprecedented sensing precision for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations, yet face fundamental bounds from hardware impairments, pointing errors, and network interference. We develop a Network Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (N-CRLB) framework incorporating dynamic topology, hardware quality factor $\Gamma_{\text{eff}}$, phase noise $\sigma^2_\phi$, and cooperative effects through recursive Fisher Information analysis. Our analysis reveals three key insights: (i) hardware and phase noise create power-independent performance ceilings ($\sigma_{\text{ceiling}} \propto \sqrt{\Gamma_{\text{eff}}}$) and floors ($\sigma_{\text{floor}} \propto \sqrt{\sigma^2_\phi}/f_c$), with power-only scaling saturating above $\text{SNR}_{\text{crit}}=1/\Gamma_{\text{eff}}$; (ii) interference coefficients $\alpha_{\ell m}$ enable opportunistic sensing with demonstrated gains of 5.5~dB under specific conditions (65~dB processing gain, 50~dBi antennas); (iii) measurement correlations from shared timing references, when properly modeled, do not degrade performance and can provide common-mode rejection benefits compared to mismodeled independent-noise baselines. Sub-millimeter ranging requires co-optimized hardware ($\Gamma_{\text{eff}}&lt;0.01$), oscillators ($\sigma^2_\phi&lt;10^{-2}$), and appropriate 3D geometry configurations.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic EEG Reveals Discriminative Low-Frequency Oscillations in Plan-to-Grasp Visuomotor Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vision-based grasping brain network integrates visual perception with cognitive and motor processes for visuomotor tasks. While invasive recordings have successfully decoded localized neural activity related to grasp type planning and execution, macroscopic neural activation patterns captured by noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG) remain far less understood. We introduce a novel vision-based grasping platform to investigate grasp-type-specific (precision, power, no-grasp) neural activity across large-scale brain networks using EEG neuroimaging. The platform isolates grasp-specific planning from its associated execution phases in naturalistic visuomotor tasks, where the Filter-Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) technique was designed to extract discriminative frequency-specific features within each phase. Support vector machine (SVM) classification discriminated binary (precision vs. power, grasp vs. no-grasp) and multiclass (precision vs. power vs. no-grasp) scenarios for each phase, and were compared against traditional Movement-Related Cortical Potential (MRCP) methods. Low-frequency oscillations (0.5-8 Hz) carry grasp-related information established during planning and maintained throughout execution, with consistent classification performance across both phases (75.3-77.8\%) for precision vs. power discrimination, compared to 61.1\% using MRCP. Higher-frequency activity (12-40 Hz) showed phase-dependent results with 93.3\% accuracy for grasp vs. no-grasp classification but 61.2\% for precision vs. power discrimination. Feature importance using SVM coefficients identified discriminative features within frontoparietal networks during planning and motor networks during execution. This work demonstrated the role of low-frequency oscillations in decoding grasp type during planning using noninvasive EEG.</description>

      <title>AI Signal Processing Paradigm for Movable Antenna: From Geometric Optimization to Electromagnetic Reconfigurability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As 6G wireless communication systems evolve toward intelligence and high reconfigurability, the limitations of traditional fixed antenna (TFA) has become increasingly prominent, with geometrically movable antenna (GMA) and electromagnetically reconfigurable antenna (ERA) emerging as key technologies to break through this bottleneck. GMA activates spatial degrees of freedom (DoF) by dynamically adjusting antenna positions, ERA regulates radiation characteristics using tunable metamaterials, thereby introducing DoF in the electromagnetic domain. However, the ``geometric-electromagnetic dual reconfiguration" paradigm formed by their integration poses severe challenges of high-dimensional hybrid optimization to signal processing. To address this issue, we integrate the geometric optimization of GMA and the electromagnetic reconfiguration of ERA for the first time, propose a unified modeling framework for movable and reconfigurable antenna (MARA), investigate the channel modeling and spectral efficiency (SE) optimization for GMA, ERA, and MARA. Besides, we systematically review artificial intelligence (AI)-based solutions, focusing on analyzing the advantages of AI over traditional algorithms in high-dimensional non-convex optimization computations. This paper fills the gap in existing literature regarding the lack of a comprehensive review on the AI-driven signal processing paradigm under geometric-electromagnetic dual reconfiguration and provides theoretical support for the design and optimization of 6G wireless systems with high SE and flexibility.</description>

      <title>Generalized Modified Blake-Zisserman Robust Spline Adaptive Filter for Generalized Gaussian Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spline adaptive filtering (SAF) algorithm-based information-theoretic learning has exhibited strong convergence performance in nonlinear system identification (NSI), establishing SAF as a promising framework for adaptive filtering. However, existing SAF-based methods suffer from performance degradation under generalized Gaussian noise (GGN) environment and exhibit significant steady-state misalignment under impulse noise. Moreover, prior research on SAF algorithms has not effectively addressed the adverse effects caused by outliers. To overcome these challenges, the generalized modified Blake-Zisserman robust spline adaptive filtering (SAF-GMBZ) algorithm is proposed. Compared to conventional SAF algorithms, SAF-GMBZ exhibits superior learning performance in GGN. Furthermore, the mean convergence ranges of the step-sizes and the steady-state mean-square error (MSE) are calculated by introducing the commonly utilized assumptions. To arrive at good convergence accuracy and noise cancellation capability in active noise control (ANC) application, the filter-c GMBZ (FcGMBZ) algorithm is further developed based on SAF-GMBZ. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of the theoretical steady-state MSE, and the superiority of the SAF-GMBZ algorithm under GGN environment in NSI, along with the effectiveness of the FcGMBZ algorithm in ANC application under impulsive noise environment.</description>

      <title>A Study on Delay Assessment for Heterogenous Traffic in VANET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) comprise of multi-priority hetero-genous nodes, both stationary and/or mobile. The data generated by these nodes may include messages relating to information, safety, entertainment, traffic management and emergency alerts. The data in the network needs dif-ferentiated service based on the priority/urgency. Media Access Control (MAC) protocols hold a significant value for managing the data priority. This paper studies a comparison of 802.11p which is a standard PHY and MAC protocol for VANET with a fragmentation-based protocol, FROG-MAC. The major design principle of 802.11-p is to allow direct Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication without associa-tion, using Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) to prioritize safety-critical messages. However, if non-critical messages already start to transmit, the nodes with critical data have to wait. FROG-MAC reduces this delay by transmitting normal packets in fragments with short pauses between them, al-lowing urgent packets to access the channel during these intervals. Simula-tions have been performed to assess the delay and throughput for high and low priority data. We report that FROG-MAC improves both the performance parameters due to offering an early channel access to the emergency traffic.</description>

      <title>IoT-Enabled Sleep Monitoring and Cognitive Assessment for Evaluating Teacher Well-Being</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sleep quality is an important indicator of the efficient cognitive function for high school teachers. Due to the high work stress and multi-tasking expectations, the teachers often face issues with their sleep quality and cognitive function, which has a clearly negative influence on their teaching abilities. In this work, we propose a unique but simple method of deploying Internet of Things (IoT) technology to monitor the sleep quality of high school teachers at Pakistan. Smart watches embedded with pulse rate and SpO2 sensors were used to collect data and categorize the sleep quality as "poor", "fair" or "good". Moreover, we used a psychological tool, Cognitive Assessment Questionnaire (CAQ) for the self-assessment of teachers' cognitive function. The study was conducted over 208 high school teachers from across Pakistan. It has been found that most of the teachers had a poor sleep quality and cognitive function; The link between these two variables indicate that the workload and other factors must be improved for the teachers to ensure their well-being, which will in turn have a positive impact on their teaching quality.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic computing for anomaly detection in a laser powder bed fusion process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study is the first application of spiking neural networks (SNNs) for anomaly detection in the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing process. The neural networks were used to identify print processing anomalies generated by dropping of laser energy during the printing of individual layers in a Ti-6Al-4V alloy lattice structures. Associated changes in the laser generated melt pool were observed using an in-process photodiode monitoring technique. photodiode sensors capturing plasma and infrared radiations reflected from the print bed of the metal 3D printer were utilized to detect sudden changes caused by anomalies during the printing process. The algorithm is first implemented on non-neuromorphic hardware including a central processing unit (CPU), on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) and then on neuromorphic Intel's Loihi chip. Improved detection of anomalies is achieved by adjusting the spike latency of the neural network, which reduces masking of information by noise within the monitored temporal signal. The work demonstrates the possibility of using low-power neuromorphic chips within an edge framework for anomaly detection in additive manufacturing and creates a framework for the process.</description>

      <title>Multi-code rate Task-Oriented Communication for Multi-Edge Cooperative Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with the internet of things (IoT) enables task-oriented communication for multi-edge cooperative inference system, where edge devices transmit extracted features of local sensory data to an edge server to perform AI-driven tasks. However, the privacy concerns and limited communication bandwidth pose fundamental challenges, since simultaneous transmission of extracted features with a single fixed compression ratio from all devices leads to severe inefficiency in communication resource utilization. To address this challenge, we propose a framework that dynamically adjusts the code rate in feature extraction based on its importance to the downstream inference task by adopting a rate-adaptive quantization (RAQ) scheme. Furthermore, to select the code rate for each edge device under limited bandwidth constraint, a dynamic programming (DP) approach is leveraged to allocate the code rate across discrete code rate options. Experiments on multi-view datasets demonstrate that the proposed frameworks significantly outperform the frameworks using fixed-rate quantization, achieving a favorable balance between communication efficiency and inference performance under limited bandwidth conditions.</description>

      <title>Ray-Tracing Based Narrow-Beam Channel Simulation, Characterization and Performance Evaluation for 5G-R Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates narrow-beam channel characterization and performance evaluation for 5G for railway (5G-R) systems based on ray-tracing (RT) simulation. Three representative high-speed railway (HSR) scenarios including viaduct, cutting, and station are established, and RT-based dynamic narrow-beam channel simulations are conducted using a designed beam tracking scheme that ensures continuous alignment with the moving train. The channel characteristics are analyzed in terms of both large-scale and small-scale fading, as well as non-stationarity, providing statistical insights into path loss, shadow fading, fading severity, time-frequency-space dispersion, and stationarity interval. The influence of beamwidth on these channel properties is also examined. Furthermore, the performance of 5G-R systems operating in such narrow-beam channels is evaluated using the Vienna 5G simulator, with a focus on block error rate, throughput, and spectral efficiency. A hardware-in-the-loop simulation platform is developed to further assess synchronization signal reference signal received power, signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio, and reference signal received quality. The results provide valuable guidance for the design and optimization of 5G-R systems in HSR environments.</description>

      <title>A Novel Delay-Doppler Domain Channel Sounding Method for 6G High-Mobility Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel measurements are the prerequisite for applying emerging transmission technologies and designing communication systems. In sixth-generation (6G) system, conventional time or frequency domain channel sounding methods cannot directly obtain Doppler information induced by high-mobility scenarios. The channel spreading function (CSF) simultaneously captures delay and Doppler information, while naturally characterizing the propagation environment in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain. However, DD domain channel sounding methods remain underexplored. This paper presents a novel DD domain channel sounding method for 6G high-mobility scenarios. First, we introduce the waveform design for the sounding signal and analyze its sounding capability. Next, the methodology of DD domain channel sounding, including synchronization and CSF estimation, is thoroughly detailed. Additionally, an algorithm for enhancing measurement precision is proposed. The performance of the proposed method is rigorously evaluated. Subsequently, a DD domain channel sounding system competent for 6G high-mobility scenarios is established. Finally, DD domain channel measurements are conducted for a vehicle-to-infrastructure scenario in urban environments. Measurement results, including CSF, power delay profile, Doppler power spectral density, number of multipath components, and other characteristics, are derived, which confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method and offer helpful insights for advancing research on 6G high-mobility communications.</description>

      <title>Network-Centric Anomaly Filtering and Spoofer localization for 5G-NR Localization in LAWNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates security vulnerabilities and countermeasures for 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Fifth Generation New Radio (5G-NR) Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA)-based unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) localization in low-altitude urban environments. We first optimize node selection strategies under Air to Ground (A2G) channel conditions, proving that optimal selection depends on UAV altitude and deployment density. We propose lightweight User Equipment (UE)-assisted that reduce overhead while enhancing accuracy. We then expose critical security vulnerabilities by introducing merged-peak spoofing attacks where rogue UAVs transmit multiple lower-power pulses that merge with legitimate signals, bypassing existing detection methods. Through theoretical modeling and sensitivity analysis, we quantify how synchronization quality and geometric factors determine spoofing success probability, revealing fundamental weaknesses in current 3GPP positioning frameworks. To address these vulnerabilities, we design a network-centric anomaly detection framework at the Localization Management Function (LMF) using existing 3GPP-specified parameters, coupled with a recursive gradient descent-based robust localization algorithm that filters anomaly data while estimating UAV position. Our unified framework simultaneously provides robust victim localization and spoofer localization-capabilities not integrated in existing literature. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of both optimization and security mechanisms for 3GPP-compliant UAV positioning.</description>

      <title>On the Robustness of AFDM and OTFS Against Passive Eavesdroppers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the robustness of affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) and orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) waveforms against passive eavesdroppers performing brute-force demodulation to intercepted signals, under the assumption that eavesdroppers have no knowledge of chirp parameters (in AFDM) or the delay-Doppler grid configuration (in OTFS), such that they must search exhaustively over possible demodulation matrices. Analytical results show that the brute-force complexity scales as $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$ for OTFS and $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ for AFDM, where $N$ is the number of subcarriers, indicating that AFDM has superior resilience over OTFS. Bit error rate (BER) simulations confirm the analysis by showing that, with AFDM, the signal remains nearly undecodable at the eavesdropper, while OTFS allows partial signal recovery under equivalent conditions.</description>

      <title>Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network Model: A Novel Approach for LFP Contrast Sensitivity Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local field potentials (LFPs) have been demonstrated to be an important measurement to study the activity of a local population of neurons. The response tunings of LFPs have been mostly reported as weaker and broader than spike tunings. Therefore, selecting optimized tuning methods is essential for appropriately evaluating the LFP responses and comparing them with neighboring spiking activity. In this paper, new models for tuning of the contrast response functions (CRFs) are proposed. To this end, luminance contrast-evoked LFP responses recorded in primate primary visual cortex (V1) are first analyzed. Then, supersaturating CRFs are distinguished from linear and saturating CRFs by using monotonicity index (MI). The supersaturated recording data are then identified through static identification methods including multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network, radial basis function (RBF) neural network, fuzzy model, neuro-fuzzy model, and the local linear model tree (LOLIMOT) algorithm. Our results demonstrate that the MLP neural network, compared to traditional and modified hyperbolic Naka-Rushton functions, exhibits superior performance in tuning the local field potential responses to luminance contrast stimuli, resulting in successful tuning of a significantly higher number of neural recordings of all three types. These results suggest that the MLP neural network model can be used as a novel approach to measure a better fitted contrast sensitivity tuning curve of a population of neurons than other currently used models.</description>

      <title>Micro-Doppler Energy-Based Robust Multi-Target Vital Signs Monitoring Using 77-GHz FMCW Radar with Spatiotemporal Adaptive Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel micro-Doppler energy-based framework for robust multi-target vital signs monitoring using 77-GHz Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) radar. Unlike conventional phase-based methods that are susceptible to environmental noise, random body movements, and stringent calibration requirements, our approach exploits the energy variations in radar returns induced by cardiopulmonary activities. The proposed system integrates a comprehensive processing pipeline including space-time adaptive processing (STAP) for target detection and tracking, MUSIC algorithm for high-resolution angle estimation, and an innovative adaptive spectral filtering technique for vital signs extraction. We establish a rigorous mathematical framework that formalizes the relationship between micro-Doppler energy variations and physiological activities, enabling robust separation of closely spaced targets. The key innovation lies in the micro-Doppler energy extraction methodology that provides inherent robustness to phase noise and motion artifacts. Experimental results using millimeter-wave radar datasets demonstrate that the system can accurately detect and separate vital signs of up to four targets within \SI{5}{\meter} range, achieving mean absolute errors of \SI{1.2}beats per minute and \SI{2.3} beats per minute for respiration and heart rates, respectively. The proposed approach demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional phase-based methods, particularly in challenging multi-target scenarios with environmental noise and subject movement.</description>

      <title>Interpretable machine learning for cardiogram-based biometrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the role of electrocardiogram (ECG) and impedance cardiogram (ICG) features in biometric identification, emphasizing their discriminative capacity and robustness to emotional variability. A total of 29 features spanning four domains (temporal, amplitude, slope, and morphological) are evaluated using random forest (RF) models combined with multiple interpretability methods. Feature importance shows that both ECG- and ICG-derived features are consistently ranked among the top 10 by Gini importance, permutation importance, and SHAP values, with ECG features, particularly QRS-centric descriptors, occupying the highest positions. In parallel, ICG BCX features contribute complementary, however, with lower cross-method stability. Correlation analysis reveals substantial multicollinearity, where the RF distributes and diminishes importance across highly correlated pairs, confirming reduced independent contributions. Statistical analysis identifies 14 features with significant differences between baseline and anger, without a clear pattern by domain. Feature selection with recursive feature elimination and genetic algorithms converges on a subset (14 features) that attains accuracy within 1% of the full set (99%), improving efficiency in storage and computation. These complementary analyses indicate that the individuality required for reliable identification is primarily encoded in QRS-related ECG features across all four domains. Meanwhile, BCX-derived ICG features contribute mainly through amplitude, providing supportive but less stable discriminatory cues. The confirmed resilience of QRS-centric descriptors to emotional variation, where stable inter-individual differences in the QRS complex could be traced to variations in ventricular mass, conduction pathways, and thoracic geometry, may indicate their central role in future models of cardiogram-based identity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Room impulse responses are a core resource for dereverberation, robust speech recognition, source localization, and room acoustics estimation. We present RIR-Mega, a large collection of simulated RIRs described by a compact, machine friendly metadata schema and distributed with simple tools for validation and reuse. The dataset ships with a Hugging Face Datasets loader, scripts for metadata checks and checksums, and a reference regression baseline that predicts RT60 like targets from waveforms. On a train and validation split of 36,000 and 4,000 examples, a small Random Forest on lightweight time and spectral features reaches a mean absolute error near 0.013 s and a root mean square error near 0.022 s. We host a subset with 1,000 linear array RIRs and 3,000 circular array RIRs on Hugging Face for streaming and quick tests, and preserve the complete 50,000 RIR archive on Zenodo. The dataset and code are public to support reproducible studies.</description>

      <title>A Graph Signal Processing Framework for Hallucination Detection in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models achieve impressive results but distinguishing factual reasoning from hallucinations remains challenging. We propose a spectral analysis framework that models transformer layers as dynamic graphs induced by attention, with token embeddings as signals on these graphs. Through graph signal processing, we define diagnostics including Dirichlet energy, spectral entropy, and high-frequency energy ratios, with theoretical connections to computational stability. Experiments across GPT architectures suggest universal spectral patterns: factual statements exhibit consistent "energy mountain" behavior with low-frequency convergence, while different hallucination types show distinct signatures. Logical contradictions destabilize spectra with large effect sizes ($g&gt;1.0$), semantic errors remain stable but show connectivity drift, and substitution hallucinations display intermediate perturbations. A simple detector using spectral signatures achieves 88.75% accuracy versus 75% for perplexity-based baselines, demonstrating practical utility. These findings indicate that spectral geometry may capture reasoning patterns and error behaviors, potentially offering a framework for hallucination detection in large language models.</description>

      <title>Training-Free Spectral Fingerprints of Voice Processing in Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Different transformer architectures implement identical linguistic computations via distinct connectivity patterns, yielding model imprinted ``computational fingerprints'' detectable through spectral analysis. Using graph signal processing on attention induced token graphs, we track changes in algebraic connectivity (Fiedler value, $\Delta\lambda_2$) under voice alternation across 20 languages and three model families, with a prespecified early window (layers 2--5). Our analysis uncovers clear architectural signatures: Phi-3-Mini shows a dramatic English specific early layer disruption ($\overline{\Delta\lambda_2}_{[2,5]}\!\approx\!-0.446$) while effects in 19 other languages are minimal, consistent with public documentation that positions the model primarily for English use. Qwen2.5-7B displays small, distributed shifts that are largest for morphologically rich languages, and LLaMA-3.2-1B exhibits systematic but muted responses. These spectral signatures correlate strongly with behavioral differences (Phi-3: $r=-0.976$) and are modulated by targeted attention head ablations, linking the effect to early attention structure and confirming functional relevance. Taken together, the findings are consistent with the view that training emphasis can leave detectable computational imprints: specialized processing strategies that manifest as measurable connectivity patterns during syntactic transformations. Beyond voice alternation, the framework differentiates reasoning modes, indicating utility as a simple, training free diagnostic for revealing architectural biases and supporting model reliability analysis.</description>

      <title>Auditory Attention Decoding from Ear-EEG Signals: A Dataset with Dynamic Attention Switching and Rigorous Cross-Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent promising results in auditory attention decoding (AAD) using scalp electroencephalography (EEG) have motivated the exploration of cEEGrid, a flexible and portable ear-EEG system. While prior cEEGrid-based studies have confirmed the feasibility of AAD, they often neglect the dynamic nature of attentional states in real-world contexts. To address this gap, a novel cEEGrid dataset featuring three concurrent speakers distributed across three of five distinct spatial locations is introduced. The novel dataset is designed to probe attentional tracking and switching in realistic scenarios. Nested leave-one-out validation-an approach more rigorous than conventional single-loop leave-one-out validation-is employed to reduce biases stemming from EEG's intricate temporal dynamics. Four rule-based models are evaluated: Wiener filter (WF), canonical component analysis (CCA), common spatial pattern (CSP) and Riemannian Geometry-based classifier (RGC). With a 30-second decision window, WF and CCA models achieve decoding accuracies of 41.5% and 41.4%, respectively, while CSP and RGC models yield 37.8% and 37.6% accuracies using a 10-second window. Notably, both WF and CCA successfully track attentional state switches across all experimental tasks. Additionally, higher decoding accuracies are observed for electrodes positioned at the upper cEEGrid layout and near the listener's right ear. These findings underscore the utility of dynamic, ecologically valid paradigms and rigorous validation in advancing AAD research with cEEGrid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10371v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a beam codebook design for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) that reduces self-interference (SI) to alleviate analog distortion. Our optimization framework, which considers either tapered beamforming or phased arrays for both analog and hybrid schemes, modifies given reference codebooks such that a certain SI power level is achieved. In contrast to other low-SI codebooks, which often rely on hardly interpretable optimization parameters, we provide design guidelines to obtain sensing performance guarantees by deriving analytical bounds on saturation and analog-to-digital quantization in relation to the multipath SI level. By selecting standard reference codebooks in our simulations, we show how our method substantially improves the signal-to-noise ratio for sensing with little impact on 5G-NR communication.</description>

      <title>Model-Based Learning for DOA Estimation with One-Bit Single-Snapshot Sparse Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the challenging problem of estimating the directions-of-arrival (DOAs) of multiple off-grid signals using a single snapshot of one-bit quantized measurements. Conventional DOA estimation methods face difficulties in tackling this problem effectively. This paper introduces a domain-knowledge-guided learning framework to achieve high-resolution DOA estimation in such a scenario, thus drastically reducing hardware complexity without compromising performance. We first reformulate DOA estimation as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) problem, unifying on-grid and off-grid scenarios under a Laplacian-type sparsity prior to effectively enforce sparsity for both uniform and sparse linear arrays. For off-grid signals, a first-order approximation grid model is embedded into the one-bit signal model. We then reinterpret one-bit sensing as a binary classification task, employing a multivariate Bernoulli likelihood with a logistic link function to enhance stability and estimation accuracy. To resolve the non-convexity inherent in the MAP formulation, we develop augmented algorithmic frameworks based on majorization-minimization principles. Further, we design model-based inference neural networks by deep unrolling these frameworks, significantly reducing computational complexity while preserving the estimation precision. Extensive simulations demonstrate the robustness of the proposed framework across a wide range of input signal-to-noise ratio values and off-grid deviations. By integrating the unified model-based priors with data-driven learning, this work bridges the gap between theoretical guarantees and practical feasibility in one-bit single-snapshot DOA estimation, offering a scalable, hardware-efficient solution for next-generation radar and communication systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving terabit-per-second (Tbps) data rates in terahertz (THz)-band communications requires bridging the complexity gap in baseband transceiver design. This work addresses the signal processing challenges associated with data detection in THz-band multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. We begin by analyzing the trade-offs between performance and complexity across various detection schemes and THz channel models, demonstrating significant complexity reduction by leveraging spatial parallelism across subspaces of correlated, typically ill-conditioned THz MIMO channels. We also derive accurate theoretical bounds on the detection error probability by incorporating THz-specific channel distributions and accounting for mismatches introduced by subspace decomposition. In addition, we propose a variation of subspace detectors that combines channel-matrix sorting, QR decomposition, and puncturing. Furthermore, under wideband THz UM-MIMO systems, we introduce a channel-matrix reuse strategy that minimizes exhaustive computations while maintaining reliable detection performance within a coherence bandwidth. Simulations over accurate THz channels show that the proposed efficient spatial parallelization schemes yield multi-dB performance gains, while the proposed reuse strategy offers significant computational savings with minimal performance degradation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22456v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The next decade will usher in a profound transformation of wireless communication, driven by the ever-increasing demand for data-intensive applications and the rapid adoption of emerging technologies. To fully unlock the potential of 5G and beyond, substantial advancements are required in signal processing techniques, innovative network architectures, and efficient spectrum utilization strategies. These advancements facilitate seamless integration of emerging technologies, driving industrial digital transformation and connectivity. This paper introduces a novel Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-based framework, Wireless Infrastructure for Smart Warehouses using VAE (WISVA), designed for accurate indoor radio propagation modeling in automated Industry 4.0 environments such as warehouses and factory floors operating within 5G wireless bands. The research delves into the meticulous creation of training data tensors, capturing complex electromagnetic (EM) wave behaviors influenced by diverse obstacles, and outlines the architecture and training methodology of the proposed VAE model. The model's robustness and adaptability are showcased through its ability to predict signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) heatmaps across various scenarios, including denoising tasks, validation datasets, extrapolation to unseen configurations, and previously unencountered warehouse layouts. Compelling reconstruction error heatmaps are presented, highlighting the superior accuracy of WISVA compared to traditional autoencoder models. The paper also analyzes the model's performance in handling complex smart warehouse environments, demonstrating its potential as a key enabler for optimizing wireless infrastructure in Industry 4.0.</description>

Abstract: Wideband systems experience significant inter-channel stimulated Raman scattering (ISRS) and channel-dependent losses. Due to the non-uniform attenuation profile, the combined effects of ISRS and fiber loss can only be accurately estimated using numerical methods. In this work, we present an approximate closed-form expression for the channels' power profile accounting for these combined effects. We validate the proposed expression against numerical solutions in the case of CLU transmission, showing high accuracy for both single-span and multi-span fiber-optic links. Additionally, we derive an inverse expression, formulated as a function of the output power, which can be utilized to target a desired optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) profile through pre-emphasis of the launched channel powers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence approaches for base-band processing for radio receivers have demonstrated significant performance gains. Most of the proposed methods are characterized by high compute and memory requirements, hindering their deployment at the edge of the Radio Access Networks (RAN) and limiting their scalability to large bandwidths and many antenna 6G systems. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity, model-driven neural network-based receiver, designed for multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems and suitable for implementation at the RAN edge. The proposed solution is compliant with the 5G New Radio (5G NR), and supports different modulation schemes, bandwidths, number of users, and number of base-station antennas with a single trained model without the need for further training. Numerical simulations of the Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH) processing show that the proposed solution outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of achievable Transport Block Error Rate (TBLER), while reducing the Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) by 66$\times$, and the learnable parameters by 396$\times$.</description>

Abstract: When to apply wavelet analysis to real-time temporal signals, where the future cannot be accessed, it is essential to base all the steps in the signal processing pipeline on computational mechanisms that are truly time-causal.
  This paper describes how a time-causal wavelet analysis can be performed based on concepts developed in the area of temporal scale-space theory, originating from a complete classification of temporal smoothing kernels that guarantee non-creation of new structures from finer to coarser temporal scale levels. By necessity, convolution with truncated exponential kernels in cascade constitutes the only permissable class of kernels, as well as their temporal derivatives as a natural complement to fulfil the admissibility conditions of wavelet representations. For a particular way of choosing the time constants in the resulting infinite convolution of truncated exponential kernels, to ensure temporal scale covariance and thus self-similarity over temporal scales, we describe how mother wavelets can be chosen as temporal derivatives of the resulting time-causal limit kernel.
  By developing connections between wavelet theory and scale-space theory, we characterize and quantify how the continuous scaling properties transfer to the discrete implementation, demonstrating how the proposed time-causal wavelet representation can reflect the duration of locally dominant temporal structures in the input signals.
  We propose that this notion of time-causal wavelet analysis could be a valuable tool for signal processing tasks, where streams of signals are to be processed in real time, specifically for signals that may contain local variations over a rich span of temporal scales, or more generally for analysing physical or biophysical temporal phenomena, where a fully time-causal analysis is called for to be physically realistic.</description>

Abstract: Accurate and real-time prediction of wireless channel conditions, particularly the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR), is a foundational requirement for enabling Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC) in highly dynamic Industry 4.0 environments. Traditional physics-based or statistical models fail to cope with the spatio-temporal complexities introduced by mobile obstacles and transient interference inherent to smart warehouses. To address this, we introduce Evo-WISVA (Evolutionary Wireless Infrastructure for Smart Warehouse using VAE), a novel synergistic deep learning architecture that functions as a lightweight 2D predictive digital twin of the radio environment. Evo-WISVA integrates a memory-augmented Variational Autoencoder (VAE) featuring an Attention-driven Latent Memory Module (LMM) for robust, context-aware spatial feature extraction, with a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network for precise temporal forecasting and sequential refinement. The entire pipeline is optimized end-to-end via a joint loss function, ensuring optimal feature alignment between the generative and predictive components. Rigorous experimental evaluation conducted on a high-fidelity ns-3-generated industrial warehouse dataset demonstrates that Evo-WISVA significantly surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 47.6\% reduction in average reconstruction error. Crucially, the model exhibits exceptional generalization capacity to unseen environments with vastly increased dynamic complexity (up to ten simultaneously moving obstacles) while maintaining amortized computational efficiency essential for real-time deployment. Evo-WISVA establishes a foundational technology for proactive wireless resource management, enabling autonomous optimization and advancing the realization of predictive digital twins in industrial communication networks.</description>

      <title>Resilient Full-Duplex ISAC in the Face of Imperfect SI Cancellation: Globally Optimal Timeslot Allocation and Beam Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work addresses the radio resource management (RRM) design in downlink full-duplex integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems, jointly optimizing timeslot allocation and beam selection under imperfect self-interference cancellation. Timeslot allocation governs the distribution of discrete channel uses between sensing and communication tasks, while beam selection determines transmit and receive directions along with adaptive beamwidths. The joint design leads to a semi-infinite, nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), which is difficult to solve. To overcome this, we develop a tailored reformulation strategy that transforms the problem into a tractable mixed-integer linear program (MILP), enabling globally optimal solutions. Our approach provides insights into the coordinated optimization of timeslot allocation and beam selection, enhancing the efficiency of full-duplex ISAC systems while ensuring resilience against residual self-interference.</description>

      <title>Source-Free Domain Adaptation for SSVEP-based Brain-Computer Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17403v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objective: SSVEP-based BCI spellers assist individuals experiencing speech difficulties by enabling them to communicate at a fast rate. However, achieving a high information transfer rate (ITR) in most prominent methods requires an extensive calibration period before using the system, leading to discomfort for new users. We address this issue by proposing a novel method that adapts a powerful deep neural network (DNN) pre-trained on data from source domains (data from former users or participants of previous experiments), to the new user (target domain) using only unlabeled target data. Approach: Our method adapts the pre-trained DNN to the new user by minimizing our proposed custom loss function composed of self-adaptation and local-regularity terms. The self-adaptation term uses the pseudo-label strategy, while the novel local-regularity term exploits the data structure and forces the DNN to assign similar labels to adjacent instances. Main results: Our method achieves excellent ITRs of 201.15 bits/min and 145.02 bits/min on the benchmark and BETA datasets, respectively, and outperforms the state-of-the-art alternatives. Our code is available at https://github.com/osmanberke/SFDA-SSVEP-BCI Significance: The proposed method prioritizes user comfort by removing the burden of calibration while maintaining an excellent character identification accuracy and ITR. Because of these attributes, our approach could significantly accelerate the adoption of BCI systems into everyday life.</description>

      <title>Phase-driven Domain Generalizable Learning for Nonstationary Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05960</link>

Abstract: Pattern recognition is a fundamental task in continuous sensing applications, but real-world scenarios often experience distribution shifts that necessitate learning generalizable representations for such tasks. This challenge is exacerbated with time-series data, which also exhibit inherent nonstationarity--variations in statistical and spectral properties over time. In this work, we offer a fresh perspective on learning generalizable representations for time-series classification by considering the phase information of a signal as an approximate proxy for nonstationarity and propose a phase-driven generalizable representation learning framework for time-series classification, PhASER. It consists of three key elements: 1) Hilbert transform-based augmentation, which diversifies nonstationarity while preserving task-specific discriminatory semantics, 2) separate magnitude-phase encoding, viewing time-varying magnitude and phase as independent modalities, and 3) phase-residual feature broadcasting, integrating 2D phase features with a residual connection to the 1D signal representation, providing inherent regularization to improve distribution-invariant learning. Extensive evaluations on five datasets from sleep-stage classification, human activity recognition, and gesture recognition against 13 state-of-the-art baseline methods demonstrate that PhASER consistently outperforms the best baselines by an average of 5% and up to 11% in some cases. Additionally, the principles of PhASER can be broadly applied to enhance the generalizability of existing time-series representation learning models.</description>

      <title>Learn More by Using Less: Distributed Learning with Energy-Constrained Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a solution for distributed model training across decentralized, privacy-preserving devices, but the different energy capacities of participating devices (system heterogeneity) constrain real-world implementations. These energy limitations not only reduce model accuracy but also increase dropout rates, impacting on convergence in practical FL deployments. In this work, we propose LeanFed, an energy-aware FL framework designed to optimize client selection and training workloads on battery-constrained devices. LeanFed leverages adaptive data usage by dynamically adjusting the fraction of local data each device utilizes during training, thereby maximizing device participation across communication rounds while ensuring they do not run out of battery during the process. We rigorously evaluate LeanFed against traditional FedAvg on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, simulating various levels of data heterogeneity and device participation rates. Results show that LeanFed consistently enhances model accuracy and stability, particularly in settings with high data heterogeneity and limited battery life, by mitigating client dropout and extending device availability. This approach demonstrates the potential of energy-efficient, privacy-preserving FL in real-world, large-scale applications, setting a foundation for robust and sustainable pervasive AI on resource-constrained networks.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Task Foundation Model for Wireless Channel Representation Using Contrastive and Masked Autoencoder Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current applications of self-supervised learning to wireless channel representation often borrow paradigms developed for text and image processing, without fully addressing the unique characteristics and constraints of wireless communications. To bridge this gap, we introduce ContraWiMAE, Wireless Contrastive Masked Autoencoder, a transformer-based foundation model that unifies masked reconstruction and masked contrastive learning for wireless channel representation. Our key innovation is a new wireless-inspired contrastive objective that exploits the inherent characteristics of wireless environment, including noise, fading, and partial observability, as natural augmentation. Through extensive evaluation on unseen scenarios and conditions, we demonstrate our method's effectiveness in multiple downstream tasks, including cross-frequency beam selection, line-of-sight detection, and channel estimation. ContraWiMAE exhibits superior linear separability and adaptability in diverse wireless environments, demonstrating exceptional data efficiency and competitive performance compared with supervised baselines under challenging conditions. Comparative evaluations against a state-of-the-art wireless channel foundation model confirm the superior performance and data efficiency of our approach, highlighting its potential as a powerful baseline for future research in self-supervised wireless channel representation learning. To foster further work in this direction, we release the model weights and training pipeline for ContraWiMAE.</description>

      <title>Optimal and Suboptimal Decoders under Finite-Alphabet Interference: A Mismatched Decoding Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interference widely exists in communication systems and is often not optimally treated at the receivers due to limited knowledge and/or computational burden. Evolutions of receivers have been proposed to balance complexity and spectral efficiency, for example, for 6G, while commonly used performance metrics, such as capacity and mutual information (MI), fail to capture the suboptimal treatment of interference, leading to potentially inaccurate performance evaluations. Mismatched decoding is an information-theoretic tool for analyzing communications with suboptimal decoders. In this work, we use mismatched decoding to analyze communications with decoders that treat interference suboptimally, aiming at more accurate performance metrics. Specifically, we consider a finite-alphabet input Gaussian channel under interference, representative of modern systems, where the decoder can be matched (optimal) or mismatched (suboptimal) to the channel. The matched capacity is derived using MI, while a lower bound on the mismatched capacity under various decoding metrics is derived using generalized mutual information (GMI). We show that the decoding metric in the proposed channel model is closely related to the behavior of the demodulator in bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) systems. Simulations illustrate that GMI/MI accurately predicts the throughput of BICM-type systems {with various demodulators}. Finally, we extend the channel model and the GMI to multiple antenna cases, with an example of multi-user multiple-input-single-output (MU-MISO) precoder optimization problem considering GMI under different decoding strategies. In short, this work discovers new insights about the impact of interference, proposes novel receivers, and introduces a new design and performance evaluation framework that more accurately captures the effect of interference.</description>
