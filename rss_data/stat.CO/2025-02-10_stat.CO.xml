      <title>Probabilistic Programming with Sufficient Statistics for faster Bayesian Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic programming methods have revolutionised Bayesian inference, making it easier than ever for practitioners to perform Markov-chain-Monte-Carlo sampling from non-conjugate posterior distributions. Here we focus on Stan, arguably the most used probabilistic programming tool for Bayesian inference (Carpenter et al., 2017), and its interface with R via the brms (Burkner, 2017) and rstanarm (Goodrich et al., 2024) packages. Although easy to implement, these tools can become computationally prohibitive when applied to datasets with many observations or models with numerous parameters. While the use of sufficient statistics is well-established in theory, it has been surprisingly overlooked in state-of-the-art Stan software. We show that when the likelihood can be written in terms of sufficient statistics, considerable computational improvements can be made to current implementations. We demonstrate how this approach provides accurate inference at a fraction of the time than state-of-the-art implementations for Gaussian linear regression models with non-conjugate priors, hierarchical random effects models, and factor analysis models. Our results also show that moderate computational gains can be achieved even in models where the likelihood can only be partially written in terms of sufficient statistics.</description>

      <title>Complexity Analysis of Normalizing Constant Estimation: from Jarzynski Equality to Annealed Importance Sampling and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an unnormalized probability density $\pi\propto\mathrm{e}^{-V}$, estimating its normalizing constant $Z=\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}\mathrm{e}^{-V(x)}\mathrm{d}x$ or free energy $F=-\log Z$ is a crucial problem in Bayesian statistics, statistical mechanics, and machine learning. It is challenging especially in high dimensions or when $\pi$ is multimodal. To mitigate the high variance of conventional importance sampling estimators, annealing-based methods such as Jarzynski equality and annealed importance sampling are commonly adopted, yet their quantitative complexity guarantees remain largely unexplored. We take a first step toward a non-asymptotic analysis of annealed importance sampling. In particular, we derive an oracle complexity of $\widetilde{O}\left(\frac{d\beta^2{\mathcal{A}}^2}{\varepsilon^4}\right)$ for estimating $Z$ within $\varepsilon$ relative error with high probability, where $\beta$ is the smoothness of $V$ and $\mathcal{A}$ denotes the action of a curve of probability measures interpolating $\pi$ and a tractable reference distribution. Our analysis, leveraging Girsanov theorem and optimal transport, does not explicitly require isoperimetric assumptions on the target distribution. Finally, to tackle the large action of the widely used geometric interpolation of probability distributions, we propose a new normalizing constant estimation algorithm based on reverse diffusion samplers and establish a framework for analyzing its complexity.</description>

      <title>A note on auxiliary mixture sampling for Bayesian Poisson models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian hierarchical Poisson models are an essential tool for analyzing count data. However, designing efficient algorithms to sample from the posterior distribution of the target parameters remains a challenging task for this class of models. Auxiliary mixture sampling algorithms have been proposed to address this issue. They involve two steps of data augmentations: the first leverages the theory of Poisson processes, and the second approximates the residual distribution of the resulting model through a mixture of Gaussian distributions. In this way, an approximated Gibbs sampler is obtained. In this paper, we focus on the accuracy of the approximation step, highlighting scenarios where the mixture fails to accurately represent the true underlying distribution, leading to a lack of convergence in the algorithm. We outline key features to monitor, in order to assess if the approximation performs as intended. Building on this, we propose a robust version of the auxiliary mixture sampling algorithm, which can detect approximation failures and incorporate a Metropolis-Hastings step when necessary. Finally, we evaluate the proposed algorithm together with the original mixture sampling algorithms on both simulated and real datasets.</description>

      <title>Estimating Parameters of Structural Models Using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an alternative use of machine learning. We train neural nets to provide the parameter estimate of a given (structural) econometric model, for example, discrete choice or consumer search. Training examples consist of datasets generated by the econometric model under a range of parameter values. The neural net takes the moments of a dataset as input and tries to recognize the parameter value underlying that dataset. Besides the point estimate, the neural net can also output statistical accuracy. This neural net estimator (NNE) tends to limited-information Bayesian posterior as the number of training datasets increases. We apply NNE to a consumer search model. It gives more accurate estimates at lighter computational costs than the prevailing approach. NNE is also robust to redundant moment inputs. In general, NNE offers the most benefits in applications where other estimation approaches require very heavy simulation costs. We provide code at: https://nnehome.github.io.</description>

      <title>Non-linear Quantum Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mean of a random variable can be understood as a $\textit{linear}$ functional on the space of probability distributions. Quantum computing is known to provide a quadratic speedup over classical Monte Carlo methods for mean estimation. In this paper, we investigate whether a similar quadratic speedup is achievable for estimating $\textit{non-linear}$ functionals of probability distributions. We propose a quantum-inside-quantum Monte Carlo algorithm that achieves such a speedup for a broad class of non-linear estimation problems, including nested conditional expectations and stochastic optimization. Our algorithm improves upon the direct application of the quantum multilevel Monte Carlo algorithm introduced by An et al.. The existing lower bound indicates that our algorithm is optimal up polylogarithmic factors. A key innovation of our approach is a new sequence of multilevel Monte Carlo approximations specifically designed for quantum computing, which is central to the algorithm's improved performance.</description>

      <title>Time Series Analysis of Rankings: A GARCH-Type Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ranking data are frequently obtained nowadays but there are still scarce methods for treating these data when temporally observed. The present paper contributes to this topic by proposing and developing novel models for handling time series of ranking data. We introduce a class of time-varying ranking models inspired by the Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models. More specifically, the temporal dynamics are defined by the conditional distribution of the current ranking given the past rankings, which are assumed to follow a Mallows distribution, which implicitly depends on a distance. Then, autoregressive and feedback components are incorporated into the model through the conditional expectation of the associated distances. Theoretical properties of our ranking GARCH models such as stationarity and ergodicity are established. The estimation of parameters is performed via maximum likelihood estimation when data is fully observed. We develop a Monte Carlo Expectation-Maximisation algorithm to deal with cases involving missing data. Monte Carlo simulation studies are presented to study the performance of the proposed estimators under both non-missing and missing data scenarios. A real data application about the weekly ranking of professional tennis players from 2015 to 2019 is presented under our proposed ranking GARCH models.</description>

      <title>A Tutorial on Markov Renewal and Semi-Markov Proportional Hazards Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transition probability estimation plays a critical role in multi-state modeling, especially in clinical research. This paper investigates the application of semi-Markov and Markov renewal frameworks to the EBMT dataset, focusing on six clinical states encountered during hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. By comparing Aalen-Johansen (AJ) and Dabrowska-Sun-Horowitz (DSH) estimators, we demonstrate that semi-Markov models, which incorporate sojourn times, provide a more nuanced and temporally sensitive depiction of patient trajectories compared to memoryless Markov models. The DSH estimator consistently yields smoother probability curves, particularly for transitions involving prolonged states. We use empirical process theory and Burkholder-Davis-Gundy inequality to show weak convergence of the estimator. Future work includes extending the framework to accommodate advanced covariate structures and non-Markovian dynamics.</description>
