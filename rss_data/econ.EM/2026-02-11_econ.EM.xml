      <title>Initial-Condition-Robust Inference in Autoregressive Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers confidence intervals (CIs) for the autoregressive (AR) parameter in an AR model with an AR parameter that may be close or equal to one. Existing CIs rely on the assumption of a stationary or fixed initial condition to obtain correct asymptotic coverage and good finite sample coverage. When this assumption fails, their coverage can be quite poor. In this paper, we introduce a new CI for the AR parameter whose coverage probability is completely robust to the initial condition, both asymptotically and in finite samples. This CI pays only a small price in terms of its length when the initial condition is stationary or fixed. The new CI also is robust to conditional heteroskedasticity of the errors.</description>

      <title>Causal Identification in Multi-Task Demand Learning with Confounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a canonical multi-task demand learning problem motivated by retail pricing, in which a firm seeks to estimate heterogeneous linear price-response functions across a large collection of decision contexts. Each context is characterized by rich observable covariates yet typically exhibits only limited historical price variation, motivating the use of multi-task learning to borrow strength across tasks. A central challenge in this setting is endogeneity: historical prices are chosen by managers or algorithms and may be arbitrarily correlated with unobserved, task-level demand determinants. Under such confounding by latent fundamentals, commonly used approaches, such as pooled regression and meta-learning, fail to identify causal price effects.
  We propose a new estimation framework that achieves causal identification despite arbitrary dependence between prices and latent task structure. Our approach, Decision-Conditioned Masked-Outcome Meta-Learning (DCMOML), involves carefully designing the information set of a meta-learner to leverage cross-task heterogeneity while accounting for endogenous decision histories. Under a mild restriction on price adaptivity in each task, we establish that this method identifies the conditional mean of the task-specific causal parameters given the designed information set. Our results provide guarantees for large-scale demand estimation with endogenous prices and small per-task samples, offering a principled foundation for deploying causal, data-driven pricing models in operational environments.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Testability of Slutsky Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05603v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Economic theory implies strong limitations on what types of consumption behavior are considered rational. Rationality implies that the Slutsky matrix, which captures the substitution effects of compensated price changes on demand for different goods, is symmetric and negative semi-definite. While empirically informed versions of negative semi-definiteness have been shown to be nonparametrically testable, the analogous question for Slutsky symmetry has remained open. Recently, it has even been shown that the symmetry condition is not testable via the average Slutsky matrix, prompting conjectures about its non-testability. We settle this question by deriving nonparametric conditional quantile restrictions on observable data that constitute a testable implication of Slutsky symmetry in an empirical setting with individual heterogeneity and endogeneity. The theoretical contribution is a multivariate generalization of identification results for partial effects in nonseparable models without monotonicity, which is of independent interest. This result has implications for different areas in econometric theory, including nonparametric welfare analysis with individual heterogeneity for which, in the case of more than two goods, the symmetry condition introduces nonlinear correction factors.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Debiased Machine Learning: Riesz Representer Fitting under Bregman Divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07752v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating the Riesz representer is central to debiased machine learning for causal and structural parameter estimation. We propose generalized Riesz regression, a unified framework for estimating the Riesz representer by fitting a representer model via Bregman divergence minimization. This framework includes various divergences as special cases, such as the squared distance and the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence, where the former recovers Riesz regression and the latter recovers tailored loss minimization. Under suitable pairs of divergence and model specifications (link functions), the dual problems of the Riesz representer fitting problem correspond to covariate balancing, which we call automatic covariate balancing. Moreover, under the same specifications, the sample average of outcomes weighted by the estimated Riesz representer satisfies Neyman orthogonality even without estimating the regression function, a property we call automatic Neyman orthogonalization. This property not only reduces the estimation error of Neyman orthogonal scores but also clarifies a key distinction between debiased machine learning and targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE). Our framework can also be viewed as a generalization of density ratio fitting under Bregman divergences to Riesz representer estimation, and it applies beyond density ratio estimation. We provide convergence analyses for both reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and neural network model classes. A Python package for generalized Riesz regression is released as genriesz and is available at https://github.com/MasaKat0/genriesz.</description>

      <title>Holistic Multi-Scale Inference of the Leverage Effect: Efficiency under Dependent Microstructure Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08654v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the long-standing challenge of estimating the leverage effect from high-frequency data contaminated by dependent, non-Gaussian microstructure noise. We depart from the conventional reliance on pre-averaging or volatility "plug-in" methods by introducing a holistic multi-scale framework that operates directly on the leverage effect. We propose two novel estimators: the Subsampling-and-Averaging Leverage Effect (SALE) and the Multi-Scale Leverage Effect (MSLE). Central to our approach is a shifted window technique that constructs a noise-unbiased base estimator, significantly simplifying the multi-scale architecture. We provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for these estimators, establishing central limit theorems and stable convergence results that remain valid under both noise-free and dependent-noise settings. The primary contribution to estimation efficiency is a specifically designed weighting strategy for the MSLE estimator. By optimizing the weights based on the asymptotic covariance structure across scales and incorporating finite-sample variance corrections, we achieve substantial efficiency gains over existing benchmarks. Extensive simulation studies and an empirical analysis of 30 U.S. assets demonstrate that our framework consistently yields smaller estimation errors and superior performance in realistic, noisy market environments.</description>

      <title>Triply Robust Panel Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21536v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies estimation of causal effects in a panel data setting. We introduce a new estimator, the Triply RObust Panel (TROP) estimator, that combines (i) a flexible model for the potential outcomes based on a low-rank factor structure on top of a two-way-fixed effect specification, with (ii) unit weights intended to upweight units similar to the treated units and (iii) time weights intended to upweight time periods close to the treated time periods. We study the performance of the estimator in a set of simulations designed to closely match several commonly studied real data sets. We find that there is substantial variation in the performance of the estimators across the settings considered. The proposed estimator outperforms two-way-fixed-effect/difference-in-differences, synthetic control, matrix completion and synthetic-difference-in-differences estimators. We investigate what features of the data generating process lead to this performance, and assess the relative importance of the three components of the proposed estimator. We have two recommendations. Our preferred strategy is that researchers use simulations closely matched to the data they are interested in, along the lines discussed in this paper, to investigate which estimators work well in their particular setting. A simpler approach is to use more robust estimators such as synthetic difference-in-differences or the new triply robust panel estimator which we find to substantially outperform two-way fixed effect estimators in many empirically relevant settings.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Inference for Rank Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kendall's tau and Spearman's rho are widely used tools for measuring dependence. Surprisingly, when it comes to asymptotic inference for these rank correlations, some fundamental results and methods have not yet been developed, in particular for discrete random variables and in the time series case, and concerning variance estimation in general. Consequently, asymptotic confidence intervals are not available. We provide a comprehensive treatment of asymptotic inference for classical rank correlations, including Kendall's tau, Spearman's rho, Goodman-Kruskal's gamma, Kendall's tau-b, and grade correlation. We derive asymptotic distributions for both iid and time series data, resorting to asymptotic results for U-statistics, and introduce consistent variance estimators. This enables the construction of confidence intervals and tests, generalizes classical results for continuous random variables and leads to corrected versions of widely used tests of independence. We analyze the finite-sample performance of our variance estimators, confidence intervals, and tests in simulations and illustrate their use in case studies.</description>
