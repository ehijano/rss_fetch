      <title>Extreme events in a random set of nonlinear elastic bending waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The processes that generate rogue waves on the sea surface remain a mystery. Despite their different natures, the nonlinear bending waves generated in a thin elastic plate share some similarities with waves on the surface of the sea. For instance, both involve four-wave interactions during energy exchange, but in bending waves, the number of waves is not conserved. Here, we present an experimental study to investigate extreme event statistics in random elastic bending waves forced by an electromagnetic shaker on a thin stainless steel plate. In our setup, the standard statistical criterion used to define extreme events, such as rogue waves on the sea surface, is insufficiently restrictive. We therefore apply a new criterion to determine the occurrence frequency of rare events, similar to those observed in wave tanks. With this new criterion, we examine correlations between extreme events amplitude and wave slopes, energy, and periods, raising questions about the links between statistically rare events and rogue waves.</description>

      <title>Chaotic orbital dynamics of pulsating stars around black holes surrounded by dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the orbital dynamics of spherical test bodies in ``black hole surrounded by dark matter halo'' spherically symmetric spacetimes. When the test body pulsates periodically (such as a variable star), altering its quadrupole tensor, Melnikov's method shows that its orbital dynamics presents homoclinic chaos near the corresponding unstable circular orbits however small the oscillation amplitude is. Since for supermassive black holes the period of revolution of a star near the innermost stable circular orbit roughly spans time intervals from minutes to hours, the formalism can be applied in principle to the astrophysical scenario of a pulsating (variable) star inspiraling into a supermassive black hole, including the black hole SgrA* at the center of our Galaxy. The chaotic nature of its orbit, due to pulsation, is imprinted in the redshift time series of the emitted light and can, in principle, be observed in the corresponding light curves and even in gravitational-wave signals detected by future observatories such as the Laser Inteferometer Space Antenna. Also, although periodic with respect to the star's proper time, the chaotic orbital motion will produce an erratic light curve (and gravitational-wave signal) in terms of observed, coordinate time. Although our results were obtained for a specific exact solution, we argue that this phenomenon is generic for pulsating bodies immersed in black hole spacetimes surrounded by self-gravitating fluids.</description>

      <title>Integrability versus chaos in the steady state of many-body open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lindblad description of an open quantum system gives rise to two types of integrability, since the nonequilibrium steady state can be integrable independently of the Liouvillian. Taking boundary-driven and dephasing spin chains as a representative example, we discriminate Liouvillian and steady-state chaos by combining level spacing statistics and an extension of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis to open quantum systems. Moreover, we analyze the structure of the steady states by expanding it in the basis of Pauli strings and comparing the weight of strings of different lengths. We show that the natural expectation that integrable steady states are "simple" (i.e., built from few-body local operators) does not hold: the steady states of both chaotic and integrable models have relevant contributions coming from Pauli strings of all possible lengths, including long-range and many-body interactions. Nevertheless, we show that one can effectively use the operator-size distribution to distinguish chaotic and integrable steady states.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Chaos and Extended Self-Similarity of Bose Einstein Condensates in a 1D Harmonic Trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate spatiotemporal chaos in Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) confined by a 1D harmonic trap using Gross-Pitaevskii equation simulations. The chaos arises from nonlinear mixing of ground and excited states, confirmed by positive Lyapunov exponents. By sampling the density field at intervals matching the center-of-mass oscillation period, we analyze the density structure function. Both spatial and temporal density structure functions reveal Kolmogorov-like scaling through extended self-similarity (ESS). Our findings suggest that ESS and density structure functions provide experimentally accessible tools to explore spatiotemporal chaos and turbulence-like behavior in BECs.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue and pseudospectrum processes generated by nonnormal Toeplitz matrices with rank 1 perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08129v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce two kinds of matrix-valued dynamical processes generated by nonnormal Toeplitz matrices with the additive rank 1 perturbations $\delta J$, where $\delta \in {\mathbb{C}}$ and $J$ is the all-ones matrix. For each process, first we report the complicated motion of the numerically obtained eigenvalues. Then we derive the specific equation which determines the motion of non-zero simple eigenvalues and clarifies the time-dependence of degeneracy of the zero-eigenvalue $\lambda_0=0$. Comparison with the solutions of this equation, it is concluded that the numerically observed non-zero eigenvalues distributing around $\lambda_0$ are the exact eigenvalues not of the original system, but of the system perturbed by uncontrolled rounding errors of computer. The complex domain in which the eigenvalues of randomly perturbed system are distributed is identified with the pseudospectrum including $\lambda_0$ of the original system with $\delta J$. We characterize the pseudospectrum processes using the symbol curves of the corresponding nonnormal Toeplitz operators without $\delta J$. We report new phenomena in our second model such that at each time the outermost closed simple curve cut out from the symbol curve is realized as the exact eigenvalues, but the inner part of symbol curve is reduced in size and embedded in the pseudospectrum including $\lambda_0$. Such separation of exact simple eigenvalues and a degenerated eigenvalue associated with pseudospectrum will be meaningful for numerical analysis, since the former is stable and robust, but the latter is highly sensitive and unstable with respective to perturbations. The present study will be related to the pseudospectra approaches to non-Hermitian systems developed in quantum physics</description>

      <title>Classical scattering and fragmentation of clusters of ions in helical confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the scattering dynamics of classical Coulomb-interacting clusters of ions confined to a helical geometry. Ion clusters of equally charged particles constrained to a helix can form many-body bound states, i.e. they exhibit stable motion of Coulomb-interacting identical ions. We analyze the scattering and fragmentation behavior of two ion clusters, thereby understanding the rich phenomenology of their dynamics. The scattering dynamics is complex in the sense that it exhibits cascades of decay processes involving strongly varying cluster sizes. These processes are governed by the internal energy flow and the underlying oscillatory many-body potential. We specifically focus on the impact of the collision energy on the dynamics of individual ions during and immediately after the collision of two clusters, and on the internal dynamics of ion clusters that are excited during a cluster collision.</description>
