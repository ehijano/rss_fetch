      <title>Relative sectional category revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of relative sectional category expands upon classical sectional category theory by incorporating the pullback of a fibration along a map. Our paper aims not only to explore this extension but also to thoroughly investigate its properties. We seek to uncover how the relative sectional category unifies several homotopic numerical invariants found in recent literature. These include the topological complexity of maps according to Murillo-Wu or Scott, relative topological complexity as defined by Farber, and homotopic distance for continuous maps in the sense of Mac\'{\i}as-Virg\'os and Mosquera-Lois, among others.</description>

      <title>A T-Duality of Non-Supersymmetric Heterotic Strings and an implication for Topological Modular Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent developments connecting non-supersymmetric heterotic string theory to the theory of Topological Modular Forms (TMF), we show that the worldsheet theory with central charge $(17,\frac{3}{2})$ obtained by fibering the $(E_8)_1 \times (E_8)_1$ current algebra over the $\mathcal{N}=(0,1)$ sigma model on $S^{1}$ with antiperiodic spin structure (such that the two $E_8$ factors are exchanged as we go around the circle), is continuously connected to the $(E_8)_2$ theory in the Gaiotto$-$Johnson-Freyd$-$Witten sense of going "up and down the RG trajectories". Combined with the work of Tachikawa and Yamashita, this furnishes a physical derivation of the fact that the $(E_8)_2$ theory corresponds to the unique nontrivial torsion element $[(E_8)_2]$ of $\mathsf{TMF}^{31}$ with zero mod-2 elliptic genus.</description>

      <title>A construction of homotopically non-trivial embedded spheres for hyperplane arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of locally consistent system of half-spaces for a real hyperplane arrangement. We embed a sphere in the complexified complement by shifting the real unit sphere into the imaginary direction indicated by the half-spaces. We then prove that the sphere is homotopically trivial if and only if the system of half-spaces is globally consistent. To prove its non-triviality, we compute the twisted intersection number of the sphere with a specific, explicitly constructed twisted Borel-Moore cycle.</description>

      <title>Configuration spaces of clusters as $E_d$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.02729v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is a classical result that configuration spaces of labelled particles in $\mathbb{R}^d$ are free $E_d$-algebras and that their $d$-fold bar construction is equivalent to the $d$-fold suspension of the labelling space. In this paper, we study a variation of these spaces, namely configuration spaces of labelled clusters of particles. These configuration spaces are again $E_d$-algebras, and we give geometric models for their iterated bar construction in two different ways: one establishes a description of these configuration spaces of clusters as cellular $E_1$-algebras, and the other one uses an additional verticality constraint. In the last section, we apply these results in order to calculate the stable homology of certain vertical configuration spaces.</description>

      <title>Fast Topological Signal Identification and Persistent Cohomological Cycle Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.15446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the context of topological data analysis, the problems of identifying topological significance and matching signals across datasets are important and useful inferential tasks in many applications. The limitation of existing solutions to these problems, however, is computational speed. In this paper, we harness the state-of-the-art for persistent homology computation by studying the problem of determining topological prevalence and cycle matching using a cohomological approach, which increases their feasibility and applicability to a wider variety of applications and contexts. We demonstrate this on a wide range of real-life, large-scale, and complex datasets. We extend existing notions of topological prevalence and cycle matching to include general non-Morse filtrations. This provides the most general and flexible state-of-the-art adaptation of topological signal identification and persistent cycle matching, which performs comparisons of orders of ten for thousands of sampled points in a matter of minutes on standard institutional HPC CPU facilities.</description>

      <title>A new approach to formal moduli problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07227v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to introduce a framework for infinitesimal deformation problems, using new methods coming from operadic calculus. We construct an adjunction between infinitesimal deformation problems over some type of algebras and their Koszul dual algebras, in any characteristic. This adjunction is an equivalence if and only if some algebras are equivalent to their completions. We give a concrete homological criterion for it. It gives us a new proof of the celebrated Lurie--Pridham theorem, as well as of many other generalizations of it. Our methods are effective, meaning they directly produce point-set models for the algebras that encode infinitesimal deformation problems.</description>

      <title>On the structures of the Johnson cokernels of the basis-conjugating automorphism groups of free groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Johnson homomorphisms of basis-conjugating automorphism groups of free groups. We construct obstructions for the surjectivity of the Johnson homomorphisms. By using it, we determine its cokernels of degree up to four, and give further observations for degree greater than four.
  As applications, we give the affirmative answer for the Andreadakis problem for degree four. We show that the cup product map of the first cohomology groups of the basis-conjugating automorphism group of a free group into the second cohomology group is surjective. Finally, we calculate the twisted first cohomology groups of the braid-permutation automorphism groups of a free group.</description>

      <title>Non-commutative divergence and the Turaev cobracket</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16566v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The divergence map, an important ingredient in the algebraic description of the Turaev cobracket on a connected oriented compact surface with boundary, is reformulated in the context of non-commutative geometry using a flat connection on the space of 1-forms on a formally smooth associative algebra. We then extend this construction to the case of associative algebras with any finite cohomological dimension, which allows us to give a similar algebraic description of the Turaev cobracket on a closed surface. We also look into a relation between the Satoh trace and the divergence map on a free Lie algebra via geometry over Lie operad.</description>

Abstract: We give a complete description of which non-torsion generators are not in the image of the Thom morphism from complex cobordism to integral cohomology for the classifying space of exceptional Lie groups except for E_8. We then show that the Thom morphism is not surjective for the classifying space of the gauge group of a principal E_7-bundle over the four-dimensional sphere. We use the results to detect nontrivial elements in the kernel of the reduced Thom morphism for Lie groups and their classifying spaces.</description>

      <title>Embedding calculus and grope cobordism of knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.05120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that embedding calculus invariants $ev_n$ are surjective for long knots in an arbitrary $3$-manifold. This solves some remaining open cases of Goodwillie--Klein--Weiss connectivity estimates, and at the same time confirms one half of the conjecture that for classical knots $ev_n$ are universal additive Vassiliev invariants over the integers. In addition, we give a sufficient condition for this conjecture to hold over a coefficient group, which is by recent results of Boavida de Brito and Horel fulfilled for the rationals and for the $p$-adic integers in a range. Therefore, embedding calculus invariants are strictly more powerful than the Kontsevich integral.
  Furthermore, our work shows they are more computable as well. Namely, the main theorem computes the first possibly non-vanishing invariant $ev_n$ of a knot which is grope cobordant to the unknot to be precisely equal to the equivalence class of the underlying decorated tree of the grope in the associated graph complex. Actually, our techniques apply beyond dimension $3$, offering a description of the layers in embedding calculus for long knots in a manifold of any dimension, and suggesting that certain generalised gropes realise the corresponding graph complex classes.</description>

      <title>A bi-variant algebraic cobordism via correspondences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.00269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A bi-variant theory $\mathbb B(X,Y)$ defined for a pair $(X,Y)$ is a theory satisfying properties similar to those of Fulton--MacPherson's bivariant theory $\mathbb B(X \xrightarrow f Y)$ defined for a morphism $f:X \to Y$. In this paper, using correspondences we construct a bi-variant algebraic cobordism $\Omega^{*,\sharp}(X, Y)$ such that $\Omega^{*,\sharp}(X, pt)$ is isomorphic to Lee--Pandharipande's algebraic cobordism of vector bundles $\Omega_{-*,\sharp}(X)$. In particular, $\Omega^{*}(X, pt)=\Omega^{*, 0}(X, pt)$ is isomorphic to Levine--Morel's algebraic cobordism $\Omega_{-*}(X)$. Namely, $\Omega^{*,\sharp}(X, Y)$ is \emph{a bi-variant vesion} of Lee--Pandharipande's algebraic cobordism of bundles $\Omega_{*,\sharp}(X)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14516v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a covariant functor W. Fulton and R. MacPherson defined \emph{an operational bivariant theory} associated to this covariant functor. In this paper we will show that given a contravariant functor one can similarly construct a ``dual" version of an operational bivariant theory, which we call a \emph{co-operational} bivariant theory. If a given contravariant functor is the usual cohomology theory, then our co-operational bivariant group for the identity map consists of what are usually called ``cohomology operations". In this sense, our co-operational bivariant theory consists of \emph{``generalized"} cohomology operations.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Equilibrium the Lucas Critique and Keynesian Economics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16214v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a mathematically rigorous solution overturns existing wisdom regarding New Keynesian Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium. I develop a formal concept of stochastic equilibrium. I prove uniqueness and necessity, when agents are patient, with general application. Existence depends on appropriately specified eigenvalue conditions. Otherwise, no solution of any kind exists. I construct the equilibrium with Calvo pricing. I provide novel comparative statics with the non-stochastic model of mathematical significance. I uncover a bifurcation between neighbouring stochastic systems and approximations taken from the Zero Inflation Non-Stochastic Steady State (ZINSS). The correct Phillips curve agrees with the zero limit from the trend inflation framework. It contains a large lagged inflation coefficient and a small response to expected inflation. Price dispersion can be first or second order depending how shocks are scaled. The response to the output gap is always muted and is zero at standard parameters. A neutrality result is presented to explain why and align Calvo with Taylor pricing. Present and lagged demand shocks enter the Phillips curve so there is no Divine Coincidence and the system is identified from structural shocks alone. The lagged inflation slope is increasing in the inflation response, embodying substantive policy trade-offs. The Taylor principle is reversed, inactive settings are necessary, pointing towards inertial policy. The observational equivalence idea of the Lucas critique is disproven. The bifurcation results from the breakdown of the constraints implied by lagged nominal rigidity, associated with cross-equation cancellation possible only at ZINSS. There is a dual relationship between restrictions on the econometrician and constraints on repricing firms. Thus, if the model is correct, goodness of fit will jump.</description>
