      <title>Arithmetic properties of multiplier polynomials for certain polynomial maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the arithmetic properties of the multiplier polynomials for certain $1$-parameter families of polynomials. In particular, we answer the unsolved Excercise 4.12 (c) of the book ``The Arithmetic of Dynamical Systems" by J. H. Silverman for broader classes of polynomials than quadratic polynomials. As a corollary, we obtain the uniform upper bound of the naive height of parabolic parameters of unicritical polynomials. Moreover, candidates for the parabolic parameter are determined. We have also confirmed that it is a parabolic parameter, except $c=-3/2$.</description>

      <title>Generic dimensional and dynamical properties of invariant measures of full-shift systems over countable alphabets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we are interested in characterizing typical (generic) dimensional properties of invariant measures associated with the full-shift system, $T$, in a product space whose alphabet is a countable set. More specifically, we show that the set of invariant measures with infinite packing dimension equal to infinity is a dense $G_\delta$ subset of $\mathcal{M}(T)$, the space of $T$-invariant measures endowed with the weak topology, where the alphabet $M$ is a countable Polish metric space. We also show that the set of invariant measures with upper $q$-generalized fractal dimension (with $q&gt;1$) equal to infinity is a dense $G_\delta$ subset of $\mathcal{M}(T)$, where the alphabet $M$ is a countable compact metric space. This improves the results obtained by Carvalho and Condori in \cite{AS} and \cite{AS2}, respectively. Furthermore, we discuss the dynamical consequences of such results, regarding the upper recurrence rates and upper quantitative waiting time indicator for typical orbits, and how the fractal dimensions of invariant measures and such dynamical quantities behave under an $\alpha$-H\"older conjugation.</description>

      <title>On a classification of axiom A diffeomorphisms with codimension one basic sets and isolated saddles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M^n$, $n\geq 3$, be a closed orientable $n$-manifold and $\mathbb{D}_k(M^n;a,b,c)$ the set of axiom A diffeomorp\-hisms $f: M^n\to M^n$ satisfying the following conditions: (1) $f$ has $k\geq 1$ nontrivial basic sets each is either an orientable codimension one expanding attractor or an orientable codimension one contracting repeller, and other trivial basic sets which are $a$ sinks, $b$ sources, $c$ saddles; (2) the invariant manifolds of isolated saddles are intersected transversally. We classify the diffeomorphisms from $\mathbb{D}_k(M^n;a,b,c)$ up to the global conjugacy on non-wandering sets for the following subsets $\mathbb{S}_k(M^n;a,b,c), \mathbb{P}_k(M^n;0,0,1), \mathbb{M}_k(M^n;0,0,1)$ of $\mathbb{D}_k(M^n;a,b,c)$ where $\mathbb{S}_k(M^n;a,b,c)$ satisfies to the following conditions:
  ($1_{\mathbb{S}}$) every nontrivial basic set of any $f\in\mathbb{S}_k(M^n;a,b,c)$ is uniquely bunched, and there is at least one nontrivial attractor and at least one nontrivial repeller, i.e. $k\geq 2$;
  ($2_{\mathbb{S}}$) $c\geq 1$ and all isolated saddles have the same Morse index belonging to $\{1,n-1\}$.
  The subset $\mathbb{P}_k(M^n;0,0,1)\subset\mathbb{D}_k(M^n;0,0,1)$ satisfies to the following conditions:
  ($1_{\mathbb{P}}$) any boundary point of $f\in\mathbb{P}_k(M^n;0,0,1)$ is fixed;
  ($2_{\mathbb{P}}$) a unique isolated saddle has Morse index different from $\{1,n-1\}$.
  The subset $\mathbb{M}_k(M^n;0,0,1)\subset\mathbb{D}_k(M^n;0,0,1)$ satisfies to the following conditions:
  ($1_{\mathbb{M}}$) any boundary point of $f\in\mathbb{M}_k(M^n;0,0,1)$ is fixed;
  ($2_{\mathbb{M}}$) a unique isolated saddle has Morse index belonging to $\{1,n-1\}$.
  The classification is based on a description of topological structure of supporting manifolds $M^n$.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Zeta functions for differentiable parabolic maps of the interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the domain of meromorphic extension for the dynamical zeta function associated to a class of one-dimensional differentiable parabolic maps featuring an indifferent fixed point. We establish the connection between this domain and the spectrum of the weighted transfer operators of the induced map. Furthermore, we discuss scenarios where meromorphic extensions occur beyond the confines of the natural disc of convergence of the dynamical zeta function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a compact surface of genus $\geq 2$ equipped with a metric that is flat everywhere except at finitely many cone points with angles greater than $2\pi$. We examine the geodesic flow on $S$ and prove local product structure for a wide class of equilibrium states. Using this, we establish the Bernoulli property for these systems.</description>

      <title>Density of group languages in shift spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the density of group languages (i.e. rational languages recognized by morphisms onto finite groups) inside shift spaces. The density of a rational language can be understood as the frequency of some "pattern" in the shift space, for example a pattern like "words with an even number of a given letter." In this paper, we handle density of group languages via ergodicity of skew products between the shift space and the recognizing group. We consider both the cases of shifts of finite type (with a suitable notion of irreducibility), and of minimal shifts. In the latter case, our main result is a closed formula for the density which holds whenever the skew product has minimal closed invariant subsets which are ergodic under the product of the original measure and the uniform probability measure on the group. The formula is derived in part from a characterization of minimal closed invariant subsets for skew products relying on notions of cocycles and coboundaries. In the case where the whole skew product itself is ergodic under the product measure, then the density is completely determined by the cardinality of the image of the language inside the recognizing group. We provide sufficient conditions for the skew product to have minimal closed invariant subsets that are ergodic under the product measure. Finally, we investigate the link between minimal closed invariant subsets, return words and bifix codes.</description>

Abstract: Using results relating taut foliations and pseudo-Anosov flows, we find cusped hyperbolic 3-manifolds which are not the non-singular part of a pseudo-Anosov flow. In particular, we find the first examples of cusped hyperbolic 3-manifolds not admitting veering triangulations, confirming a conjecture of S. Schleimer.</description>

      <title>Belief Samples Are All You Need For Social Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of social learning, where a group of agents embedded in a social network are interested in learning an underlying state of the world. Agents have incomplete, noisy, and heterogeneous sources of information, providing them with recurring private observations of the underlying state of the world. Agents can share their learning experience with their peers by taking actions observable to them, with values from a finite feasible set of states. Actions can be interpreted as samples from the beliefs which agents may form and update on what the true state of the world is. Sharing samples, in place of full beliefs, is motivated by the limited communication, cognitive, and information-processing resources available to agents especially in large populations. Previous work (Salhab et al.) poses the question as to whether learning with probability one is still achievable if agents are only allowed to communicate samples from their beliefs. We provide a definite positive answer to this question, assuming a strongly connected network and a ``collective distinguishability'' assumption, which are both required for learning even in full-belief-sharing settings. In our proposed belief update mechanism, each agent's belief is a normalized weighted geometric interpolation between a fully Bayesian private belief -- aggregating information from the private source -- and an ensemble of empirical distributions of the samples shared by her neighbors over time. By carefully constructing asymptotic almost-sure lower/upper bounds on the frequency of shared samples matching the true state/or not, we rigorously prove the convergence of all the beliefs to the true state, with probability one.</description>

Abstract: We show that for any sufficiently rich compact family $\mathcal{H}$ of $C^1$ diffeomorphisms of a closed Riemannanian manifold $M$, the average geometric intersection number over $h \in \mathcal{H}$ between $h(V)$ and $W$, for $V, W$ any complementary dimensional submanifolds of $M$, is approximately (i.e. up to a uniform multiplicative error depending only on $\mathcal{H}$) the product of their volumes. We also give a construction showing that such families always exist.</description>

Abstract: We classify the Teichm\"uller curves in the moduli space of genus three Riemann surfaces $\mathcal M_3$ that are obtained by a covering construction from a primitive Teichm\"uller curve in $\mathcal M_2$. We describe the action on homology modulo two of the affine groups of translation surfaces generating these primitive curves. We also classify the $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb Z)$-orbits of square-tiled surfaces in $\mathcal H(2, 2)$ that are a cover of a genus two one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study recurrent operators from a new perspective by introducing the notion of hyper-recurrent operators and establish robust connections with quasi-rigid operators. For example, we prove that a recurrent operator on a separable Banach space is quasi-rigid if and only if it is a linear factor of a hyper-recurrent operator, and show that the quasi-rigid operators found in Costakis, Manoussos and Parissis's work, along with many others, are, in fact, hyper-recurrent operators. Furthermore, we provide a negative answer, using a class of operators introduced by Tapia, to the question by Costakis et al. whether $T \oplus T$ is recurrent whenever $T$ is.</description>

      <title>The instability mechanism of compact multiplanet systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To improve our understanding of orbital instabilities in compact planetary systems, we compare suites of $N$-body simulations against numerical integrations of simplified dynamical models. We show that, surprisingly, dynamical models that account for small sets of resonant interactions between the planets can accurately recover $N$-body instability times. This points towards a simple physical picture in which a handful of three-body resonances (3BRs), generated by interactions between nearby two-body mean motion resonances (MMRs), overlap and drive chaotic diffusion, leading to instability. Motivated by this, we show that instability times are well-described by a power law relating instability time to planet separations, measured in units of fractional semi-major axis difference divided by the planet-to-star mass ratio to the $1/4$ power, rather than the frequently-adopted $1/3$ power implied by measuring separations in units of mutual Hill radii. For idealized systems, the parameters of this power-law relationship depend only on the ratio of the planets' orbital eccentricities to the orbit-crossing value, and we report an empirical fit to enable quick instability time predictions. This relationship predicts that observed systems comprised of three or more sub-Neptune mass planets must be spaced with period ratios $\mathcal{P} \gtrsim 1.35$ and that tightly-spaced systems ($\mathcal{P} \lesssim 1.5$) must possess very low eccentricities ($e \lesssim 0.05$) to be stable for more than $10^9$ orbits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1804.01362v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study spectral triples and non-commutative expectations associated to expanding and weakly expanding maps. In order to do so, we generalize the Perron-Frobenius-Ruelle theorem and obtain a polynomial decay of the operator, which allows to prove differentiability of a dynamically defined $\zeta$-function at its critical parameter. We then generalize Sharp's construction of spectral triples to this setting and provide criteria when the associated spectral metric is non-degenerate and when the non-commutative expectation of the spectral triple is colinear to the integration with respect to the associated equilibrium state from thermodynamic formalism. Due to our general setting, we are able to simultaneously analyse expanding maps on manifolds or connected fractals, subshifts of finite type as well as the Dyson model from statistical physics, which underlines the unifying character of noncommutative geometry. Furthermore, we derive an explicit representation of the $\zeta$-function associated to a particular class of pathological continuous potentials, giving rise to examples where the representation as a non-commutative expectation via the associated zeta function holds, and others where it does not hold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1908.06324v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the standard neural field equation with an exponential temporal kernel. We analyze the time-independent (static) and time-dependent (dynamic) bifurcations of the equilibrium solution and the emerging spatiotemporal wave patterns. We show that an exponential temporal kernel does not allow static bifurcations such as saddle-node, pitchfork, and in particular, static Turing bifurcations. However, the exponential temporal kernel possesses the important property that it takes into account the finite memory of past activities of neurons, which Green's function does not. Through a dynamic bifurcation analysis, we give explicit bifurcation conditions. Hopf bifurcations lead to temporally non-constant, but spatially constant solutions, but Turing-Hopf bifurcations generate spatially and temporally non-constant solutions, in particular, traveling waves. Bifurcation parameters are the coefficient of the exponential temporal kernel, the transmission speed of neural signals, the time delay rate of synapses, and the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory synaptic weights.</description>

Abstract: The Koopman operator represents the dynamics induced by a dynamical system in some suitably chosen functional space. It provides a linear representation of any nonlinear system. Its eigenfunctions represent the non-mixing component $D$ of the dynamics, they factor the dynamics into linear ergodic flows on tori $\mathbb{T}^d$. The orthogonal complement (in $L^2$ space) $D^\bot$ to these eigenfunctions include the continuous spectrum of the system and this where properties like decay of correlations, weak and strong mixing are observed. A mixed spectrum system contains non-trivial eigenfunctions and $D^\bot$ is non-zero. It will be shown that in $C^1$ flows with mixed spectrum, one can restrict the dynamics to a fibre of a submersion into $\mathbb{T}^d$, this submersion being just a collection of Koopman eigenfunctions. This map is a discrete time map which has no eigenfunctions, and its spectral properties are similar to the mixing or chaotic component of the dynamics. This decomposition gives three important results : (i) an explicit characterization of $D^\bot$; (ii) a construction of suspension flows present universally in every $C^1$ flow with a $C^1$ Koopman eigenfunction; (iii) a deconstruction of the underlying manifold as a higher-dimensional mapping torus.</description>

      <title>A geometric analysis of the SIRS compartmental model with fast information and misinformation spreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel slow-fast SIRS compartmental model with demography, by coupling a slow disease spreading model and a fast information and misinformation spreading model. Beside the classes of susceptible, infected and recovered individuals of a common SIRS model, here we define three new classes related to the information spreading model, e.g. unaware individuals, misinformed individuals and individuals who are skeptical to disease-related misinformation. Under our assumptions, the system evolves on two time scales. We completely characterize its asymptotic behaviour with techniques of Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory (GSPT). We exploit the time scale separation to analyse two lower dimensional subsystem separately. First, we focus on the analysis of the fast dynamics and we find three equilibrium point which are feasible and stable under specific conditions. We perform a theoretical bifurcation analysis of the fast system to understand the relations between these three equilibria when varying specific parameters of the fast system. Secondly, we focus on the evolution of the slow variables and we identify three branches of the critical manifold, which are described by the three equilibria of the fast system. We fully characterize the slow dynamics on each branch. Moreover, we show how the inclusion of (mis)information spread may negatively or positively affect the evolution of the epidemic, depending on whether the slow dynamics evolves on the second branch of the critical manifold, related to the skeptical-free equilibrium or on the third one, related to misinformed-free equilibrium, respectively. We conclude with numerical simulations which showcase our analytical results.</description>

      <title>A Note on the Uniform Ergodicity of Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the uniform ergodicity property for non-invertible topological and measure-preserving dynamical systems. It is shown that for topological dynamical systems uniform ergodicity is equivalent to eventually periodicity and that for measure preserving systems it is equivalent to periodicity. To obtain our results, we prove a result on the long-term behavior of lattice homomorphisms that have $1$ isolated in its spectrum.</description>

      <title>On the quasi-ergodicity of absorbing Markov chains with unbounded transition densities, including random logistic maps with escape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.01281v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider absorbing Markov chains $X_n$ admitting a quasi-stationary measure $\mu$ on $M$ where the transition kernel $\mathcal P$ admits an eigenfunction $0\leq \eta\in L^1(M,\mu)$. We find conditions on the transition densities of $\mathcal P$ with respect to $\mu$ which ensure that $\eta(x) \mu(\mathrm d x)$ is a quasi-ergodic measure for $X_n$ and that the Yaglom limit converges to the quasi-stationary measure $\mu$-almost surely. We apply this result to the random logistic map $X_{n+1} = \omega_n X_n (1-X_n)$ absorbed at $\mathbb R \setminus [0,1],$ where $\omega_n$ is an i.i.d sequence of random variables uniformly distributed in $[a,b],$ for $1\leq a &lt;4$ and $b&gt;4.$</description>
