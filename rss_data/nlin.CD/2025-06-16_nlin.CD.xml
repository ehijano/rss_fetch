      <title>Choosing observables that capture critical slowing down before tipping points: A Fokker-Planck operator approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tipping points (TP) are abrupt transitions between metastable states in complex systems, most often described by a bifurcation or crisis of a multistable system induced by a slowly changing control parameter. An avenue for predicting TPs in real-world systems is critical slowing down (CSD), which is a decrease in the relaxation rate after perturbations prior to a TP that can be measured by statistical early warning signals (EWS) in the autocovariance of observational time series. In high-dimensional systems, we cannot expect a priori chosen scalar observables to show significant EWS, and some may even show an opposite signal. Thus, to avoid false negative or positive early warnings, it is desirable to monitor fluctuations only in observables that are designed to capture CSD. Here we propose that a natural observable for this purpose can be obtained by a data-driven approximation of the first non-trivial eigenfunction of the backward Fokker-Planck (or Kolmogorov) operator, using the diffusion map algorithm.</description>

      <title>Synchronous Propagation of Periodic Signals in Feedforward Networks of Standard Model Neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodic signals propagating along chains are common in biology, for example in locomotion and peristalsis, and are also of interest for continuum robots. In previous work we constructed such networks as 'feedforward lifts' of a central pattern generator (CPG). When the CPG undergoes periodic oscillations, created by Hopf bifurcation or other mechanisms, it can then transmit periodic signals along one or more feedforward chains in a synchronous or phase-synchronous manner. We proved necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of these lifted periodic orbits, in several senses. Here we examine the implications of the resulting theory for chains of neurons, using several standard neuron models: FitzHugh-Nagumo, Morris-Lecar, Hindmarsh-Rose, and Hodgkin-Huxley. We compare different notions of transverse stability, and summarize some numerical simulations showing that for all these neuron models the propagating signal can be transversely Floquet stable. Finally we discuss implications for less idealized models.</description>

      <title>Controlling quantum chaos via Parrondo strategies on NISQ hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computing are steadily pushing these systems toward outperforming classical supercomputers on specific, well-defined computational tasks. In this work, we explore and control quantum chaos in NISQ systems using discrete-time quantum walks (DTQW) on cyclic graphs. To efficiently implement quantum walks on NISQ hardware, we employ the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) to diagonalize the conditional shift operator, optimizing circuit depth and fidelity. We experimentally realize the transition from quantum chaos to order via DTQW dynamics on both odd and even cyclic graphs, specifically 3- and 4-cycle graphs, using the counterintuitive Parrondo's paradox strategy across three different NISQ devices. While the 4-cycle graphs exhibit high-fidelity quantum evolution, the 3-cycle implementation shows significant fidelity improvement when augmented with dynamical decoupling pulses. Our results demonstrate a practical approach to probing and harnessing controlled chaotic dynamics on real quantum hardware, laying the groundwork for future quantum algorithms and cryptographic protocols based on quantum walks.</description>

      <title>A Hamiltonian formulation for the motion of an active spheroidal particle suspended in laminar straight duct flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse a generalisation of Z\"{o}ttl and Stark's model of active spherical particles [Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 218104 (2012)] and prolate spheroidal particles [Eur. Phys. J. E 36(1), 4 (2013)] suspended in cylindrical Poiseuille flow, to particle dynamics in an arbitrary unidirectional steady laminar flow through a straight duct geometry. Our primary contribution is to describe a Hamiltonian formulation of these systems and provide explicit forms of the constants of motions in terms of the arbitrary fluid velocity field. The Hamiltonian formulation provides a convenient and robust approach to the computation of particle orbits whilst also providing new insights into the dynamics, specifically the way in which orbits are trapped within basins defined by a potential well. In addition to considering spherical and prolate spheroidal particles, we also illustrate that the model can be adapted to oblate spheroidal particles.</description>
