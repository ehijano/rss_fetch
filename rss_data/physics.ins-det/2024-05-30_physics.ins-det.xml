      <title>The DUNE-DAQ Application Framework</title>

Abstract: The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is a next-generation neutrino experiment that will probe the properties of these elusive particles with unparalleled precision. It will also act as an observatory for neutrino bursts caused by nearby supernovae, in the event that one occurs while the experiment is in operation. Given these goals, the DUNE trigger and DAQ system must be able to maintain extremely high uptime and provide a path for full readout of the detectors for very long times (up to 100~s). To achieve these ends, we have designed the DUNE DAQ system around a flexible "application framework", which provides a modular interface for specific tasks while handling the interconnections between them. The application framework collects modules into applications which can then be interacted with as units by the control, configuration and monitoring systems. One of the key features of the framework is its communications abstraction layer, which allows for modules to interact with both internal queues and external network connections with a single transport-agnostic interface. We will report on the architecture and features of the framework.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning based photon counting for PMT waveforms and its application to the improvement of the energy resolution in large liquid scintillator detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) are widely used in particle experiments for photon detection. PMT waveform analysis is crucial for high-precision measurement of the position and energy of incident particles in liquid scintillator (LS) detectors. A key factor contributing to the energy resolution in large liquid scintillator detectors with PMTs is the charge smearing of PMTs. This paper presents a machine-learning-based photon counting method for PMT waveforms and its application to the energy reconstruction, using the JUNO experiment as an example. The results indicate that leveraging the photon counting information from the machine learning model can partially mitigate the impact of PMT charge smearing and lead to a relative 2.0% to 2.8% improvement on the energy resolution at different energies.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Novel Indium Phosphide Pad Detectors with Focused X-ray Beams and Laboratory Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future tracking systems in High Energy Physics experiments will require large instrumented areas with low radiation length. Crystalline silicon sensors have been used in tracking systems for decades, but are difficult to manufacture and costly to produce for large areas. We are exploring alternative sensor materials that are amenable to fast fabrication techniques used for thin film devices. Indium Phosphide pad sensors were fabricated at Argonne National Lab using commercially available InP:Fe 2-inch mono-crystal substrates. Current-voltage and capacitance-voltage characterizations were performed to study the basic operating characteristics of a group of sensors. Micro-focused X-ray beams at Canadian Light Source and Diamond Light Source were used to study the response to ionizing radiation, and characterize the uniformity of the response for several devices. The results show a high degree of performance uniformity in our evaluations, both within a device and between the 48 tested devices. This motivates further studies into thin film devices for future tracking detectors.</description>

      <title>A novel mechanical design of a bolometric array for the CROSS double-beta decay experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CROSS experiment will search for neutrinoless double-beta decay using a specific mechanical structure to hold thermal detectors. The design of the structure was tuned to minimize the background contribution, keeping an optimal detector performance. A single module of the structure holds two scintillating bolometers (with a crystal size of 45x45x45 mm and a Ge slab facing the crystal's upper side) in the Cu frame, allowing for a modular construction of a large-scale array. Two designs are released: the initial Thick version contains around 15% of Cu over the crystal mass (lithium molybdate, LMO), while this ratio is reduced to ~6% in a finer (Slim) design. Both designs were tested extensively at aboveground (IJCLab, France) and underground (LSC, Spain) laboratories. In particular, at LSC we used a pulse-tube-based CROSS facility to operate a 6-crystal array of LMOs enriched/depleted in $^{100}$Mo. The tested LMOs show high spectrometric performance in both designs; notably, the measured energy resolution is 5--7 keV FWHM at 2615 keV $\gamma$s, nearby the Q-value of $^{100}$Mo (3034 keV). Due to the absence of a reflective cavity around LMOs, a low scintillation signal is detected by Ge bolometers: ~0.3 keV (~150 photons) for 1-MeV $\gamma$($\beta$) LMO-event. Despite that, an acceptable separation between $\alpha$ and $\gamma$($\beta$) events is achieved with most devices. The highest efficiency is reached with light detectors in the Thick design thanks to a lower baseline noise width (0.05--0.09 keV RMS) when compared to that obtained in the Slim version (0.10--0.35 keV RMS). Given the pivotal role of bolometric photodetectors for particle identification and random coincidences rejection, we will use the structure here described with upgraded light detectors, featuring thermal signal amplification via the Neganov-Trofimov-Luke effect, as also demonstrated in the present work.</description>

      <title>Optimizaci\'on del sistema de iluminaci\'on y proyecci\'on para un sensor multiparam\'etrico acusto-\'optico</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In previous works we presented a novel multiparametric sensor to simultaneously measure the refractive index and the speed of sound in a liquid by means of the acousto-optic effect. The sensor requires an illumination system that expands the laser beam so that it interacts effectively with the liquid under study. Also, a projection system is necessary in order to adequately capture the diffraction pattern at the cell exit. In this article, we present the optimization of the sensor illumination and projection system using the optical design computational tool Zemax OpticStudio. The considered range of refractive indices of the liquid samples is between 1.33 and 1.51. The results show a correct expansion of the incident beam on the cell, and the projection system achieves an image with very few aberrations and an adequate angular separation between the maxima of the diffraction pattern. From the resulting dimensions of the sensor after the illumination and projection system optimization, we affirm that it is compact and portable.</description>

      <title>Calibration of MAJIS (Moons And Jupiter Imaging Spectrometer): III. Spectral Calibration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Moons And Jupiter Imaging Spectrometer (MAJIS) is the visible and near-infrared imaging spectrometer onboard ESA s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) mission. Before its integration into the spacecraft, the instrument undergoes an extensive ground calibration to establish its baseline performances. This process prepares the imaging spectrometer for flight operations by characterizing the behavior of the instrument under various operative conditions and uncovering instrumental distortions that may depend on instrumental commands. Two steps of the on-ground calibration campaigns were held at the instrument level to produce the data. Additional in-flight measurements have recently been obtained after launch during the Near-Earth Commissioning Phase. In this article, we present the analyses of these datasets, focusing on the characterization of the spectral performances. First, we describe and analyze the spectral calibration datasets obtained using both monochromatic sources and polychromatic sources coupled with solid and gas samples. Then, we derive the spectral sampling and the spectral response function over the entire field of view. These spectral characteristics are quantified for various operational parameters of MAJIS, such as temperature and spectral binning. The derived on-ground performances are then compared with in-flight measurements obtained after launch and presented in the framework of the MAJIS performance requirements.</description>

Abstract: Antineutrinos from nuclear reactors have the potential to be used for reactor monitoring in the mid- to far-field under certain conditions. Antineutrinos are an unshieldable signal and carry information about the reactor core and the distance they travel. Using gadolinium-doped water Cherenkov detectors for this purpose has been previously proposed alongside rate-only analyses. As antineutrinos carry information about their distance of travel in their energy spectrum, the analyses can be extended to a spectral analysis to gain more knowledge about the detected core. Two complementary analyses are used to evaluate the distance between a proposed gadolinium-doped water-based liquid scintillator detector and a detected nuclear reactor. Example cases are shown for a detector in Boulby Mine, near the Boulby Underground Laboratory in the UK, and six reactor sites in the UK and France. The analyses both show strong potential to range reactors, but are limited by the detector design.</description>

Abstract: The European Spallation Source, currently under construction in Lund, Sweden, is a multidisciplinary international laboratory. Once completed to full specifications, it will operate the world's most powerful pulsed neutron source. Supported by a 3 million Euro Research and Innovation Action within the EU Horizon 2020 program, a design study (HighNESS) has been completed to develop a second neutron source located below the spallation target. Compared to the first source, designed for high cold and thermal brightness, the new source has been optimized to deliver higher intensity, and a shift to longer wavelengths in the spectral regions of cold (CN, 2--20\,\AA), very cold (VCN, 10--120\,\AA), and ultracold (UCN, ${&gt;}\,{500}$\,\AA) neutrons. The second source comprises a large liquid deuterium moderator designed to produce CN and support secondary VCN and UCN sources. Various options have been explored in the proposed designs, aiming for world-leading performance in neutronics. These designs will enable the development of several new instrument concepts and facilitate the implementation of a high-sensitivity neutron-antineutron oscillation experiment (NNBAR). This document serves as the Conceptual Design Report for the HighNESS project, representing its final deliverable.</description>

      <title>Simulating the secondary electron avalanche of MCP by Geant4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07153v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nowadays, Microchannel Plate (MCP), as a kind of electron multipliers based on the secondary electron emission, is widely used in many high-sensitive experiments, such as neutrino detection, which require the noise to be as low as possible, while the conventional straight-channel MCP will inevitably have ion feedback, resulting in the sequential after-pulses being the major source of noise. Normally, the problem can be effectively avoided by coupling two straight-channel MCPs in cascade and combining the channels into a `V` shape known as chevron MCPs, but this method is limited by the manufacturing techniques due to the unavoidable gap between the two pieces that will worsen the resolution and peak-to-valley ratio. However, the ion feedback can be inhibited significantly for MCPs with curved channels. Based on Geant4, we investigate how the geometrical parameters of curved-channel MCP influence the gain and get the optimum pore diameter for an MCP to reach the maximum gain with fixed thickness and applied voltage. Additionally, the track-by-track simulation reveals that the average acceleration distance of a secondary electron inside the curved-channel is approximately 20 um when the applied voltage, length-to-diameter ratio and pore diameter are 950 V, 50:1 and 20 um, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Second generation quantum technologies aim to outperform classical alternatives by utilizing engineered quantum systems. Maintaining the coherence required to enable any quantum advantage requires detailed knowledge and control over the noise the hosting system is subjected to. Characterizing noise processes via their power spectral density is routinely done throughout science and technology and can be a demanding task. Determining the phase noise power spectrum in leading quantum technology platforms, for example, can be either outside the reach of many phase noise analyzers, or be prohibitively expensive. In this work, we present and characterize a cost-effective optical phase noise analyzer for quantum technology applications. Using this setup we compare two $\approx1\ \rm{Hz}$ linewidth ultra-stable oscillators near $729\ \rm{nm}$, using them as references to determine and discuss the noise floor achieved in this measurement apparatus with a focus on limitations and their tradeoffs. The achieved noise floor in this implementation of a low-cost, all-stock component, low-complexity phase noise analyzer compares favourably to commercial offerings. This setup can find application in particular without a more stable reference or operational quantum system as sensor as would be the case for many component manufacturers.</description>

      <title>Nanofluidic platform for studying the first-order phase transitions in superfluid helium-3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The symmetry-breaking first-order phase transition between superfluid phases $^3$He-A and $^3$He-B can be triggered extrinsically by ionising radiation or heterogeneous nucleation arising from the details of the sample cell construction. However, the role of potential homogeneous intrinsic nucleation mechanisms remains elusive. Discovering and resolving the intrinsic processes may have cosmological consequences, since an analogous first-order phase transition, and the production of gravitational waves, has been predicted for the very early stages of the expanding Universe in many extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics. Here we introduce a new approach for probing the phase transition in superfluid $^3$He. The setup consists of a novel stepped-height nanofluidic sample container with close to atomically smooth walls. The $^3$He is confined in five tiny nanofabricated volumes and assayed non-invasively by NMR. Tuning of the state of $^3$He by confinement is used to isolate each of these five volumes so that the phase transitions in them can occur independently and free from any obvious sources of heterogeneous nucleation. The small volumes also ensure that the transitions triggered by ionising radiation are strongly suppressed. Here we present the preliminary measurements using this setup, showing both strong supercooling of $^3$He-A and superheating of $^3$He-B, with stochastic processes dominating the phase transitions between the two. The objective is to study the nucleation as a function of temperature and pressure over the full phase diagram, to both better test the proposed extrinsic mechanisms and seek potential parallel intrinsic mechanisms.</description>
