      <title>Carl St{\o}rmer and his Numbers</title>

Abstract: In many proofs of Fermat's Two Squares Theorem, the smallest least residue solution $x_0$ of the quadratic congruence $x^2 \equiv -1 \bmod p$ plays an essential role; here $p$ is prime and $p \equiv 1 \bmod 4$. Such an $x_0$ is called a St{\o}rmer number, named after the Norwegian mathematician and astronomer Carl St{\o}rmer (1874-1957). In this paper, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for $x_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ to be a St{\o}rmer number of some prime $p \equiv 1 \bmod 4$. St{\o}rmer's main interest in his investigations of St{\o}rmer numbers stemmed from his study of identities expressing $\pi$ as finite linear combinations of certain values of the Gregory-MacLaurin series for $\arctan(1/x)$. Since less than 600 digits of $\pi$ were known by 1900, approximating $\pi$ was an important topic. One such identity, discovered by St{\o}rmer in 1896, was used by Yasumasa Kanada and his team in 2002 to obtain 1.24 trillion digits of $\pi$. We also discuss St{\o}rmer's work on connecting these numbers to Gregory numbers and approximations of $\pi$. \u</description>

      <title>Advancing mathematics research with generative AI</title>

Abstract: The main drawback of using generative AI models for advanced mathematics is that these models are not logical reasoning engines. However, Large Language Models, and their refinements, can pick up on patterns in higher mathematics that are difficult for humans to see. By putting the design of generative AI models to their advantage, mathematicians may use them as powerful interactive assistants that can carry out laborious tasks, generate and debug code, check examples, formulate conjectures and more. We discuss how generative AI models can be used to advance mathematics research. We also discuss their integration with Computer Algebra Systems and formal proof assistants such as Lean.</description>
