      <title>Forecasting implied volatility surface with generative diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) for generating arbitrage-free implied volatility (IV) surfaces, offering a more stable and accurate alternative to existing GAN-based approaches. To capture the path-dependent nature of volatility dynamics, our model is conditioned on a rich set of market variables, including exponential weighted moving averages (EWMAs) of historical surfaces, returns and squared returns of underlying asset, and scalar risk indicators like VIX. Empirical results demonstrate our model significantly outperforms leading GAN-based models in capturing the stylized facts of IV dynamics. A key challenge is that historical data often contains small arbitrage opportunities in the earlier dataset for training, which conflicts with the goal of generating arbitrage-free surfaces. We address this by incorporating a standard arbitrage penalty into the loss function, but apply it using a novel, parameter-free weighting scheme based on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that dynamically adjusts the penalty's strength across the diffusion process. We also show a formal analysis of this trade-off and provide a proof of convergence showing that the penalty introduces a small, controllable bias that steers the model toward the manifold of arbitrage-free surfaces while ensuring the generated distribution remains close to the real-world data.</description>

      <title>An extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) Trees approach to Detect and Identify Unlawful Insider Trading (UIT) Transactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Corporate insiders have control of material non-public preferential information (MNPI). Occasionally, the insiders strategically bypass legal and regulatory safeguards to exploit MNPI in their execution of securities trading. Due to a large volume of transactions a detection of unlawful insider trading becomes an arduous task for humans to examine and identify underlying patterns from the insider's behavior. On the other hand, innovative machine learning architectures have shown promising results for analyzing large-scale and complex data with hidden patterns. One such popular technique is eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), the state-of-the-arts supervised classifier. We, hence, resort to and apply XGBoost to alleviate challenges of identification and detection of unlawful activities. The results demonstrate that XGBoost can identify unlawful transactions with a high accuracy of 97 percent and can provide ranking of the features that play the most important role in detecting fraudulent activities.</description>

      <title>Levy-stable scaling of risk and performance functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a finite-horizon model in which liquid-asset returns exhibit Levy-stable scaling on a data-driven window [tau_UV, tau_IR] and aggregate into a finite-variance regime outside. The window and the tail index alpha are identified from the log-log slope of the central body and a two-segment fit of scale versus horizon. With an anchor horizon tau_0, we derive horizon-correct formulas for Value-at-Risk, Expected Shortfall, Sharpe and Information ratios, Kelly under a Value-at-Risk constraint, and one-step drawdown, where each admits a closed-form Gaussian-bias term driven by the exponent gap (1/alpha - 1/2). The implementation is nonparametric up to alpha and fixed tail quantiles. The formulas are reproducible across horizons on the Levy window.</description>

      <title>Forecast-to-Fill: Benchmark-Neutral Alpha and Billion-Dollar Capacity in Gold Futures (2015-2025)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We test whether simple, interpretable state variables-trend and momentum-can generate durable out-of-sample alpha in one of the world's most liquid assets, gold. Using a rolling 10-year training and 6-month testing walk-forward from 2015 to 2025 (2,793 trading days), we convert a smoothed trend-momentum regime signal into volatility-targeted, friction-aware positions through fractional, impact-adjusted Kelly sizing and ATR-based exits. Out of sample, the strategy delivers a Sharpe ratio of 2.88 and a maximum drawdown of 0.52 percent, net of 0.7 basis-point linear cost and a square-root impact term (gamma = 0.02). A regression on spot-gold returns yields a 43 percent annualized return (CAGR approximately 43 percent) and a 37 percent alpha (Sharpe = 2.88, IR = 2.09) at a 15 percent volatility target with beta approximately 0.03, confirming benchmark-neutral performance. Bootstrap confidence intervals ([2.49, 3.27]) and SPA tests (p = 0.000) confirm statistical significance and robustness to latency, reversal, and cost stress. We conclude that forecast-to-fill engineering-linking transparent signals to executable trades with explicit risk, cost, and impact control-can transform modest predictability into allocator-grade, billion-dollar-scalable alpha.</description>
