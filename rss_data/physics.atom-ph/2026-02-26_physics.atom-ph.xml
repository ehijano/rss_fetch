      <title>Efimov Effect in Ultracold Microwave-Shielded Polar Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum-mechanical description is presented for the three-body physics of shielded dipolar molecules, including a prediction of observable Efimov physics. Despite the anisotropic and long-range nature of the interaction, shielding enables a regime in which universality emerges already at the two-body level and extends to the three-body sector, where Efimov physics emerges. On the negative side of the scattering-length resonance, computed trimer binding energies display the characteristic scaling expected for Efimov resonances. Finally, the sudden approximation can be used to create trimer bound states, starting from positive energy trap states as a way to create or detect these molecular trimers. Moreover, the three-body parameter expressed in dipolar units is found to be universal.</description>

      <title>Spectral Phase Pulse Shaping Alters Photoionization Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoionization is a key step in many attosecond processes. Accurately determining the photoionization time delay is critical to understanding electron dynamics during and after ionization and can guide future efforts to manipulate electron motion. Prior studies have shown that the photoionization time delay is non-zero and that pulse shaping through alteration of the spectral phase may change the number and timing of ionization events. In order to more quantitatively assess whether and how the spectral phase modifies the photoionization time delay, we use attosecond streaking simulations to extract the streaking time delay for ionizing pulses with identical power spectra, but different spectral phases. We compare streaking time delays for Gaussian, Airy, and fifth order phase extreme ultraviolet (XUV) pulses. We find that the streaking delay depends on the XUV spectral phase and that the sign of the delay is determined by the sign of the phase for large phases. Pulses with non-zero spectral phase show an asymmetry in the streaking spectrogram that is associated with phase-dependent spectral compression or broadening. Comparison of the streaking delays for short- and long-range potentials indicates that Coulomb-laser coupling contributions to the streaking shift are independent of spectral phase, confirming that the observed phase dependence arises from intrinsic photoionization dynamics. Overall, our work suggests that the spectral phase may open the door to new opportunities for controlling ionization timing and provide new avenues for coherent control of ultrafast electron</description>

      <title>Collisional-radiative data for tokamak disruption mitigation modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective tokamak disruption mitigation is crucial for ensuring the safety and integrity of fusion power reactors. Accurate collisional-radiative (CR) modeling of a radiative plasma is a critical component in predictive disruption mitigation design. In this paper, we focus on quasi-steady-state CR modeling applicable to the current quench phase of a tokamak disruption. We employ the ATOMIC collisional-radiative code from the Los Alamos suite and the newly developed Fusion Collisional-Radiative (FCR) code to model the atomic processes, providing high-fidelity data for radiative power loss, as well as average and effective charge states for hydrogen, helium, neon, and argon plasma species over a wide range of tokamak-relevant electron temperatures and electron densities. Fine-structure-resolved CR models are used for hydrogen and helium plasma species, while configuration-average CR models are implemented for neon and argon plasma species. The calculated values are compared with the superconfiguration CR model (FLYCHK) and the commonly used coronal equilibrium approximation to demonstrate the advantages and limitations of each model. To facilitate coupling of high-fidelity CR data to plasma simulation models, we represent the ATOMIC/FCR results over the relevant plasma parameter range using a smooth tensor product B-spline surface in electron temperature and electron density. This approach yields compact coefficient tables that can be evaluated efficiently while preserving spline smoothness across the domain. These data were previously used to examine ways to minimize runaway electrons in a tokamak current quench, and they are now made available in easy-to-use forms for community use and benchmarking.</description>

      <title>From raw data to processed spectra: A step-by-step guide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical spectroscopy is an important and widely used technique, for instance, to characterize new materials and to identify unknown compounds. Spectra are typically reported as a function of the wavelength of light, yet the information extracted from such spectra can be misleading. In contrast, spectra represented as a function of the frequency (or photon energy) allow for a more direct extraction of the intrinsic quantum-mechanical properties of the materials under investigation. Here we discuss this conversion for absorption, fluorescence and fluorescence excitation spectra. We show step-by-step the different factors that lead to a rescaling of the measured absorption and fluorescence signals. This paper will assist instructors who aim at developing an (under-)graduate lab to introduce into the methodology and terminology of spectroscopic experiments and to provide clear, step-by-step guidelines for data analysis and representation.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the action of conventional trapped-ion entangling gates in qudit space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Qudits, or multi-level quantum information carriers, present a promising path for scaling quantum computers. However, their use introduces increased complexity in quantum logic, necessitating careful control of relative phases between different qudit levels. In trapped-ion systems, entangling operations accumulate phases on specific levels that are no longer global, unlike in qubit architectures. Furthermore, the structure of multi-level gates becomes increasingly intricate with higher-dimensional Hilbert spaces. This work explores the theory of these additional entangling and non-entangling phases, accumulated in M\o lmer--S\o rensen and Light-shift gates. We propose methods to actively compensate for these phases, enhance gate robustness against parameter fluctuations, and simplify native gates for more efficient circuit decomposition. Our results pave the way toward the practical and scalable implementation of qudit-based quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Effects of Screening and Pressure Ionization on the Electron Broadening of Spectral Lines in Dense Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collisions between electrons and radiating atoms broaden spectral absorption and emission lines in dense plasmas. High densities also introduce screening and pressure ionization effects that distort the wavefunctions of both bound and free electrons. In order to study how dense plasma effects influence the electron broadening of spectral lines, this paper incorporates electron wavefunctions from an average-atom (AA) model to calculate the line width of the B III $2p-2s$ transition at $T = 10$ eV for mass densities ranging from $\rho=10^{-4}-0.4$ g/cc. The calculation method uses the impact approximation, allowing the line width to be written in terms of electron-collision cross sections and an interference term. Compared to an otherwise identical calculation that uses Coulomb free wavefunctions, the AA method is found to modify both the cross sections and the resulting line width at sufficiently high density by introducing screening and pressure ionized bound states. Screening lowers the cross sections at low energies and near electron excitation thresholds, while pressure ionized bound states introduce resonances into the continuum. Thus, as the density increases, the relative line width between the AA and Coulomb calculations follows a general decrease because of screening, with sharp increases at various intervals due to pressure ionization. The AA results are also compared with a common approach to introduce screening through the interaction potential and reduced models that use the Bethe formula for the inelastic electron-collision cross sections.</description>

      <title>Analysis of collision shift assessments in ion-based clocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider back-ground gas collision shifts in ion-based clocks. We give both a classical and quantum description of a collision between an ion and a polarizable particle with a simple hard-sphere repulsion. Both descriptions give consistent results, which shows that a collision shift bound is determined by the classical Langevin collision rate reduced by a readily calculated factor describing the decoupling of the clock laser from the ion due to the recoil motion. We also show that the result holds when using a more general Lennard-Jones potential to describe the interaction between the ion and its collision partner. This leads to a simple bound for the collision shift applicable to any single ion clock without resorting to large-scale Monte-Carlo simulations or determination of molecular potential energy curves describing the collision. It also provides a relatively straightforward means to measure the relevant collision rate.</description>

      <title>Suppression and enhancement of bosonic stimulation by atomic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tendency of identical bosons to bunch, seen in the Hanbury Brown-Twiss effect and Bose-Einstein condensation, is a hallmark of quantum statistics. This bunching can enhance the rates of fundamental processes such as atom-atom and atom-light scattering when atoms scatter into already occupied states. For non-interacting bosons, the enhancement of light scattering follows directly from the occupation of the atom's final momentum state. Here, we study scattering between off-resonant light and atoms in a quasi-homogeneous Bose gas with tunable interactions and show that even weak interactions, which do not significantly alter the momentum distribution, strongly affect atom-light scattering. Changes in local atomic correlations suppress the bosonic enhancement under weak repulsive interactions and increase the scattering rate under attractive ones. Moreover, if the interactions are rapidly tuned, light scattering reveals correlation dynamics that are orders of magnitude faster than the collisional dynamics of the momentum-space populations. Its extreme sensitivity to correlation effects makes off-resonant light scattering a powerful probe of many-body physics in ultracold atomic gases.</description>

      <title>Autler-Townes spectroscopy of a Rydberg ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ladder-type two-photon excitation of an atom from a ground state $|g\rangle$, to an intermediate excited state $|e\rangle$, and, finally, to a Rydberg state $|r\rangle$, has a variety of uses from quantum information to sensing. A common scheme for detecting this transition optically is through electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). However, in inverted wavelength schemes, where the ground-to-excited transition wavelength is shorter than the excited-to-Rydberg transition wavelength, the strength of the EIT feature on the lower-leg beam is strongly reduced in a Doppler-broadened medium. Here, we report on an alternative two-photon spectroscopic feature, which we term the two-photon Autler-Townes resonance, observed on the upper-leg beam. Compared to the EIT signal, this feature's superior signal-to-noise ratio allows one to resolve Rydberg resonances with principal quantum number as high as $n=80$. We also show that such a feature can be utilized to generate an error signal for stabilizing the frequency of the upper-leg beam.</description>

      <title>Shortcuts to Adiabaticity via Adaptive Quantum Zeno Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the quantum Zeno dynamics arising from monitoring a time-dependent projector. Starting from a stroboscopic measurement protocol, it is shown that the effective Hamiltonian for Zeno dynamics involves a nonadiabatic geometric connection that takes the form of the Kato-Avron Hamiltonian for parallel transport, stirring the evolution within the time-dependent Zeno subspace. The latter reduces to counterdiabatic driving when projective measurements are performed in the instantaneous energy eigenbasis of the quantum system. The effective Zeno Hamiltonian can also be derived in the context of continuous quantum measurements of a time-dependent observable and the non-Hermitian evolution with a complex absorbing potential varying in time. Our results thus provide a unified framework for realizing shortcuts to adiabaticity via adaptive quantum Zeno measurements.</description>
