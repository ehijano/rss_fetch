      <title>Exploration of Novel Neuromorphic Methodologies for Materials Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many of today's most interesting questions involve understanding and interpreting complex relationships within graph-based structures. For instance, in materials science, predicting material properties often relies on analyzing the intricate network of atomic interactions. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a popular approach for these tasks; however, they suffer from limitations such as inefficient hardware utilization and over-smoothing. Recent advancements in neuromorphic computing offer promising solutions to these challenges. In this work, we evaluate two such neuromorphic strategies known as reservoir computing and hyperdimensional computing. We compare the performance of both approaches for bandgap classification and regression using a subset of the Materials Project dataset. Our results indicate recent advances in hyperdimensional computing can be applied effectively to better represent molecular graphs.</description>

      <title>Q-Pilot: Field Programmable Qubit Array Compilation with Flying Ancillas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutral atom arrays have become a promising platform for quantum computing, especially the field programmable qubit array (FPQA) endowed with the unique capability of atom movement. This feature allows dynamic alterations in qubit connectivity during runtime, which can reduce the cost of executing long-range gates and improve parallelism. However, this added flexibility introduces new challenges in circuit compilation. Inspired by the placement and routing strategies for FPGAs, we propose to map all data qubits to fixed atoms while utilizing movable atoms to route for 2-qubit gates between data qubits. Coined flying ancillas, these mobile atoms function as ancilla qubits, dynamically generated and recycled during execution. We present Q-Pilot, a scalable compiler for FPQA employing flying ancillas to maximize circuit parallelism. For two important quantum applications, quantum simulation and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), we devise domain-specific routing strategies. In comparison to alternative technologies such as superconducting devices or fixed atom arrays, Q-Pilot effectively harnesses the flexibility of FPQA, achieving reductions of 1.4x, 27.7x, and 6.3x in circuit depth for 100-qubit random, quantum simulation, and QAOA circuits, respectively.</description>
