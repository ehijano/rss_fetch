      <title>Curb Your Attention: Causal Attention Gating for Robust Trajectory Prediction in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trajectory prediction models in autonomous driving are vulnerable to perturbations from non-causal agents whose actions should not affect the ego-agent's behavior. Such perturbations can lead to incorrect predictions of other agents' trajectories, potentially compromising the safety and efficiency of the ego-vehicle's decision-making process. Motivated by this challenge, we propose $\textit{Causal tRajecTory predICtion}$ $\textbf{(CRiTIC)}$, a novel model that utilizes a $\textit{Causal Discovery Network}$ to identify inter-agent causal relations over a window of past time steps. To incorporate discovered causal relationships, we propose a novel $\textit{Causal Attention Gating}$ mechanism to selectively filter information in the proposed Transformer-based architecture. We conduct extensive experiments on two autonomous driving benchmark datasets to evaluate the robustness of our model against non-causal perturbations and its generalization capacity. Our results indicate that the robustness of predictions can be improved by up to $\textbf{54%}$ without a significant detriment to prediction accuracy. Lastly, we demonstrate the superior domain generalizability of the proposed model, which achieves up to $\textbf{29%}$ improvement in cross-domain performance. These results underscore the potential of our model to enhance both robustness and generalization capacity for trajectory prediction in diverse autonomous driving domains.

      <title>A Realistic Model Reference Computed Torque Control Strategy for Human Lower Limb Exoskeletons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exoskeleton robots have become a promising tool in neurorehabilitation, offering effective physical therapy and recovery monitoring. The success of these therapies relies on precise motion control systems. Although computed torque control based on inverse dynamics provides a robust theoretical foundation, its practical application in rehabilitation is limited by its sensitivity to model accuracy, making it less effective when dealing with unpredictable payloads. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces a novel model reference computed torque controller that accounts for parametric uncertainties while optimizing computational efficiency. A dynamic model of a seven-degree-of-freedom human lower limb exoskeleton is developed, incorporating a realistic joint friction model to accurately reflect the physical behavior of the robot. To reduce computational demands, the control system is split into two loops: a slower loop that predicts joint torque requirements based on input trajectories and robot dynamics, and a faster PID loop that corrects trajectory tracking errors. Coriolis and centrifugal forces are excluded from the model due to their minimal impact on system dynamics relative to their computational cost. Experimental results show high accuracy in trajectory tracking, and statistical analyses confirm the controller's robustness and effectiveness in handling parametric uncertainties. This approach presents a promising advancement for improving the stability and performance of exoskeleton-based neurorehabilitation.</description>

      <title>Behavior Cloning for Mini Autonomous Car Path Following</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents the implementation and evaluation of a behavior cloning approach for route following with autonomous cars. Behavior cloning is a machine-learning technique in which a neural network is trained to mimic the driving behavior of a human operator. Using camera data that captures the environment and the vehicle's movement, the neural network learns to predict the control actions necessary to follow a predetermined route. Mini-autonomous cars, which provide a good benchmark for use, are employed as a testing platform. This approach simplifies the control system by directly mapping the driver's movements to the control outputs, avoiding the need for complex algorithms. We performed an evaluation in a 13-meter sizer route, where our vehicle was evaluated. The results show that behavior cloning allows for a smooth and precise route, allowing it to be a full-sized vehicle and enabling an effective transition from small-scale experiments to real-world implementations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel classification for Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs), into three phases and five steps, focusing on autonomous collision-free navigation. Additionally, it presents the main methods and widely accepted technologies for each phase of the proposed classification. The purpose of this classification is to facilitate understanding and establish connections between the independent input variables of the system (hardware, software) and autonomous navigation. By analyzing well-established technologies in terms of sensors and methods used for autonomous navigation, this paper aims to provide a foundation of knowledge that can be applied in future projects of mobile robots.</description>

      <title>On the Feasibility of A Mixed-Method Approach for Solving Long Horizon Task-Oriented Dexterous Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-hand manipulation of tools using dexterous hands in real-world is an underexplored problem in the literature. In addition to more complex geometry and larger size of the tools compared to more commonly used objects like cubes or cylinders, task oriented in-hand tool manipulation involves many sub-tasks to be performed sequentially. This may involve reaching to the tool, picking it up, reorienting it in hand with or without regrasping to reach to a desired final grasp appropriate for the tool usage, and carrying the tool to the desired pose. Research on long-horizon manipulation using dexterous hands is rather limited and the existing work focus on learning the individual sub-tasks using a method like reinforcement learning (RL) and combine the policies for different subtasks to perform a long horizon task. However, in general a single method may not be the best for all the sub-tasks, and this can be more pronounced when dealing with multi-fingered hands manipulating objects with complex geometry like tools. In this paper, we investigate the use of a mixed-method approach to solve for the long-horizon task of tool usage and we use imitation learning, reinforcement learning and model based control. We also discuss a new RL-based teacher-student framework that combines real world data into offline training. We show that our proposed approach for each subtask outperforms the commonly adopted reinforcement learning approach across different subtasks and in performing the long horizon task in simulation. Finally we show the successful transferability to real world.</description>

      <title>ACDC: Automated Creation of Digital Cousins for Robust Policy Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training robot policies in the real world can be unsafe, costly, and difficult to scale. Simulation serves as an inexpensive and potentially limitless source of training data, but suffers from the semantics and physics disparity beween simulated and real-world environments. These discrepancies can be minimized by training in digital twins,which serve as virtual replicas of a real scene but are expensive to generate and cannot produce cross-domain generalization. To address these limitations, we propose the concept of digital cousins, a virtual asset or scene that, unlike a digital twin,does not explicitly model a real-world counterpart but still exhibits similar geometric and semantic affordances. As a result, digital cousins simultaneously reduce the cost of generating an analogous virtual environment while also facilitating better robustness during sim-to-real domain transfer by providing a distribution of similar training scenes. Leveraging digital cousins, we introduce a novel method for the Automatic Creation of Digital Cousins (ACDC), and propose a fully automated real-to-sim-to-real pipeline for generating fully interactive scenes and training robot policies that can be deployed zero-shot in the original scene. We find that ACDC can produce digital cousin scenes that preserve geometric and semantic affordances, and can be used to train policies that outperform policies trained on digital twins, achieving 90% vs. 25% under zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.

      <title>A Rapid Trajectory Optimization and Control Framework for Resource-Constrained Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a computationally efficient model predictive control formulation that uses an integral Chebyshev collocation method to enable rapid operations of autonomous agents. By posing the finite-horizon optimal control problem and recursive re-evaluation of the optimal trajectories, minimization of the L2 norms of the state and control errors are transcribed into a quadratic program. Control and state variable constraints are parameterized using Chebyshev polynomials and are accommodated in the optimal trajectory generation programs to incorporate the actuator limits and keepout constraints. Differentiable collision detection of polytopes is leveraged for optimal collision avoidance. Results obtained from the collocation methods are benchmarked against the existing approaches on an edge computer to outline the performance improvements. Finally, collaborative control scenarios involving multi-agent space systems are considered to demonstrate the technical merits of the proposed work.</description>

      <title>TinyLidarNet: 2D LiDAR-based End-to-End Deep Learning Model for F1TENTH Autonomous Racing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior research has demonstrated the effectiveness of end-to-end deep learning for robotic navigation, where the control signals are directly derived from raw sensory data. However, the majority of existing end-to-end navigation solutions are predominantly camera-based. In this paper, we introduce TinyLidarNet, a lightweight 2D LiDAR-based end-to-end deep learning model for autonomous racing. An F1TENTH vehicle using TinyLidarNet won 3rd place in the 12th F1TENTH Autonomous Grand Prix competition, demonstrating its competitive performance. We systematically analyze its performance on untrained tracks and computing requirements for real-time processing. We find that TinyLidarNet's 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based architecture significantly outperforms widely used Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) based architecture. In addition, we show that it can be processed in real-time on low-end micro-controller units (MCUs).</description>

      <title>Autonomous Robotic System with Optical Coherence Tomography Guidance for Vascular Anastomosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vascular anastomosis, the surgical connection of blood vessels, is essential in procedures such as organ transplants and reconstructive surgeries. The precision required limits accessibility due to the extensive training needed, with manual suturing leading to variable outcomes and revision rates up to 7.9%. Existing robotic systems, while promising, are either fully teleoperated or lack the capabilities necessary for autonomous vascular anastomosis. We present the Micro Smart Tissue Autonomous Robot (micro-STAR), an autonomous robotic system designed to perform vascular anastomosis on small-diameter vessels. The micro-STAR system integrates a novel suturing tool equipped with Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) fiber-optic sensor and a microcamera, enabling real-time tissue detection and classification. Our system autonomously places sutures and manipulates tissue with minimal human intervention. In an ex vivo study, micro-STAR achieved outcomes competitive with experienced surgeons in terms of leak pressure, lumen reduction, and suture placement variation, completing 90% of sutures without human intervention. This represents the first instance of a robotic system autonomously performing vascular anastomosis on real tissue, offering significant potential for improving surgical precision and expanding access to high-quality care.</description>

      <title>G$^{2}$TR: Generalized Grounded Temporal Reasoning for Robot Instruction Following by Combining Large Pre-trained Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the scenario where a human cleans a table and a robot observing the scene is instructed with the task "Remove the cloth using which I wiped the table". Instruction following with temporal reasoning requires the robot to identify the relevant past object interaction, ground the object of interest in the present scene, and execute the task according to the human's instruction. Directly grounding utterances referencing past interactions to grounded objects is challenging due to the multi-hop nature of references to past interactions and large space of object groundings in a video stream observing the robot's workspace. Our key insight is to factor the temporal reasoning task as (i) estimating the video interval associated with event reference, (ii) performing spatial reasoning over the interaction frames to infer the intended object (iii) semantically track the object's location till the current scene to enable future robot interactions. Our approach leverages existing large pre-trained models (which possess inherent generalization capabilities) and combines them appropriately for temporal grounding tasks. Evaluation on a video-language corpus acquired with a robot manipulator displaying rich temporal interactions in spatially-complex scenes displays an average accuracy of 70.10%. The dataset, code, and videos are available at https://reail-iitdelhi.github.io/temporalreasoning.github.io/ .</description>

      <title>Force-Centric Imitation Learning with Force-Motion Capture System for Contact-Rich Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In most contact-rich manipulation tasks, humans apply time-varying forces to the target object, compensating for inaccuracies in the vision-guided hand trajectory. However, current robot learning algorithms primarily focus on trajectory-based policy, with limited attention given to learning force-related skills. To address this limitation, we introduce ForceMimic, a force-centric robot learning system, providing a natural, force-aware and robot-free robotic demonstration collection system, along with a hybrid force-motion imitation learning algorithm for robust contact-rich manipulation. Using the proposed ForceCapture system, an operator can peel a zucchini in 5 minutes, while force-feedback teleoperation takes over 13 minutes and struggles with task completion. With the collected data, we propose HybridIL to train a force-centric imitation learning model, equipped with hybrid force-position control primitive to fit the predicted wrench-position parameters during robot execution. Experiments demonstrate that our approach enables the model to learn a more robust policy under the contact-rich task of vegetable peeling, increasing the success rates by 54.5% relatively compared to state-of-the-art pure-vision-based imitation learning. Hardware, code, data and more results would be open-sourced on the project website at https://forcemimic.github.io.</description>

      <title>Streamlined shape of cyborg cockroach promotes traversability in confined environments by gap negotiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The centimeter-scale cyborg insects have a potential advantage for application in narrow environments where humans cannot operate. To realize such tasks, researchers have developed a small printed-circuit-board (PCB) which an insect can carry and control it. The electronic components usually remain bare on the board and the whole board is mounted on platform animals, resulting in uneven morphology of whole cyborg with sharp edges. It is well known that streamlined body shape in artificial vehicles or robots contributes to effective locomotion by reducing drag force in media. However, little is known how the entire body shape impacts on locomotor performance of cyborg insect. Here, we developed a 10 mm by 10 mm board which provided electrical stimulation via Sub-GHz communication and investigated the impact of physical arrangement of the board using Madagascar hissing cockroach. We compared the success rate of gap negotiation between the cyborg with mounted board and implanted board and found the latter outperformed the former. We demonstrated our cyborg cockroach with implanted board could follow faithfully to the locomotion command via antennal or cercal stimulation and traverse a narrow gap like air vent cover. In contrast to the conventional arrangement, our cyborg insects are suitable for application in a concealed environment.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Meta-Learning for All-Layer DNN-Based Adaptive Control with Stability Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A critical goal of adaptive control is enabling robots to rapidly adapt in dynamic environments. Recent studies have developed a meta-learning-based adaptive control scheme, which uses meta-learning to extract nonlinear features (represented by Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)) from offline data, and uses adaptive control to update linear coefficients online. However, such a scheme is fundamentally limited by the linear parameterization of uncertainties and does not fully unleash the capability of DNNs. This paper introduces a novel learning-based adaptive control framework that pretrains a DNN via self-supervised meta-learning (SSML) from offline trajectories and online adapts the full DNN via composite adaptation. In particular, the offline SSML stage leverages the time consistency in trajectory data to train the DNN to predict future disturbances from history, in a self-supervised manner without environment condition labels. The online stage carefully designs a control law and an adaptation law to update the full DNN with stability guarantees. Empirically, the proposed framework significantly outperforms (19-39%) various classic and learning-based adaptive control baselines, in challenging real-world quadrotor tracking problems under large dynamic wind disturbance.</description>

      <title>Imitation Learning with Limited Actions via Diffusion Planners and Deep Koopman Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based robot policies have demonstrated significant potential in imitating multi-modal behaviors. However, these approaches typically require large quantities of demonstration data paired with corresponding robot action labels, creating a substantial data collection burden. In this work, we propose a plan-then-control framework aimed at improving the action-data efficiency of inverse dynamics controllers by leveraging observational demonstration data. Specifically, we adopt a Deep Koopman Operator framework to model the dynamical system and utilize observation-only trajectories to learn a latent action representation. This latent representation can then be effectively mapped to real high-dimensional continuous actions using a linear action decoder, requiring minimal action-labeled data. Through experiments on simulated robot manipulation tasks and a real robot experiment with multi-modal expert demonstrations, we demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances action-data efficiency and achieves high task success rates with limited action data.</description>

      <title>Stop-N-Go: Search-based Conflict Resolution for Motion Planning of Multiple Robotic Manipulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the motion planning problem for multiple robotic manipulators in packed environments where shared workspace can result in goal positions occupied or blocked by other robots unless those other robots move away to make the goal positions free. While planning in a coupled configuration space (C-space) is straightforward, it struggles to scale with the number of robots and often fails to find solutions. Decoupled planning is faster but frequently leads to conflicts between trajectories.
  We propose a conflict resolution approach that inserts pauses into individually planned trajectories using an A* search strategy to minimize the makespan--the total time until all robots complete their tasks. This method allows some robots to stop, enabling others to move without collisions, and maintains short distances in the C-space. It also effectively handles cases where goal positions are initially blocked by other robots. Experimental results show that our method successfully solves challenging instances where baseline methods fail to find feasible solutions.</description>

      <title>Simplified POMDP Planning with an Alternative Observation Space and Formal Performance Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online planning under uncertainty in partially observable domains is an essential capability in robotics and AI. The partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) is a mathematically principled framework for addressing decision-making problems in this challenging setting. However, finding an optimal solution for POMDPs is computationally expensive and is feasible only for small problems. In this work, we contribute a novel method to simplify POMDPs by switching to an alternative, more compact, observation space and simplified model to speedup planning with formal performance guarantees. We introduce the notion of belief tree topology, which encodes the levels and branches in the tree that use the original and alternative observation space and models. Each belief tree topology comes with its own policy space and planning performance. Our key contribution is to derive bounds between the optimal Q-function of the original POMDP and the simplified tree defined by a given topology with a corresponding simplified policy space. These bounds are then used as an adaptation mechanism between different tree topologies until the optimal action of the original POMDP can be determined. Further, we consider a specific instantiation of our framework, where the alternative observation space and model correspond to a setting where the state is fully observable. We evaluate our approach in simulation, considering exact and approximate POMDP solvers and demonstrating a significant speedup while preserving solution quality. We believe this work opens new exciting avenues for online POMDP planning with formal performance guarantees.</description>

      <title>Patterned Structure Muscle : Arbitrary Shaped Wire-driven Artificial Muscle Utilizing Anisotropic Flexible Structure for Musculoskeletal Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Muscles of the human body are composed of tiny actuators made up of myosin and actin filaments. They can exert force in various shapes such as curved or flat, under contact forces and deformations from the environment. On the other hand, muscles in musculoskeletal robots so far have faced challenges in generating force in such shapes and environments. To address this issue, we propose Patterned Structure Muscle (PSM), artificial muscles for musculoskeletal robots. PSM utilizes patterned structures with anisotropic characteristics, wire-driven mechanisms, and is made of flexible material Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU) using FDM 3D printing. This method enables the creation of various shapes of muscles, such as simple 1 degree-of-freedom (DOF) muscles, Multi-DOF wide area muscles, joint-covering muscles, and branched muscles. We created an upper arm structure using these muscles to demonstrate wide range of motion, lifting heavy objects, and movements through environmental contact. These experiments show that the proposed PSM is capable of operating in various shapes and environments, and is suitable for the muscles of musculoskeletal robots.</description>

      <title>The Power of Input: Benchmarking Zero-Shot Sim-To-Real Transfer of Reinforcement Learning Control Policies for Quadrotor Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last decade, data-driven approaches have become popular choices for quadrotor control, thanks to their ability to facilitate the adaptation to unknown or uncertain flight conditions. Among the different data-driven paradigms, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is currently one of the most explored. However, the design of DRL agents for Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) remains an open challenge. While some works have studied the output configuration of these agents (i.e., what kind of control to compute), there is no general consensus on the type of input data these approaches should employ. Multiple works simply provide the DRL agent with full state information, without questioning if this might be redundant and unnecessarily complicate the learning process, or pose superfluous constraints on the availability of such information in real platforms. In this work, we provide an in-depth benchmark analysis of different configurations of the observation space. We optimize multiple DRL agents in simulated environments with different input choices and study their robustness and their sim-to-real transfer capabilities with zero-shot adaptation. We believe that the outcomes and discussions presented in this work supported by extensive experimental results could be an important milestone in guiding future research on the development of DRL agents for aerial robot tasks.</description>

      <title>PokeFlex: A Real-World Dataset of Deformable Objects for Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven methods have shown great potential in solving challenging manipulation tasks, however, their application in the domain of deformable objects has been constrained, in part, by the lack of data. To address this, we propose PokeFlex, a dataset featuring real-world paired and annotated multimodal data that includes 3D textured meshes, point clouds, RGB images, and depth maps. Such data can be leveraged for several downstream tasks such as online 3D mesh reconstruction, and it can potentially enable underexplored applications such as the real-world deployment of traditional control methods based on mesh simulations. To deal with the challenges posed by real-world 3D mesh reconstruction, we leverage a professional volumetric capture system that allows complete 360{\deg} reconstruction. PokeFlex consists of 18 deformable objects with varying stiffness and shapes. Deformations are generated by dropping objects onto a flat surface or by poking the objects with a robot arm. Interaction forces and torques are also reported for the latter case. Using different data modalities, we demonstrated a use case for the PokeFlex dataset in online 3D mesh reconstruction. We refer the reader to our website ( https://pokeflex-dataset.github.io/ ) for demos and examples of our dataset.</description>

      <title>Toward a Better Understanding of Robot Energy Consumption in Agroecological Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis and discussion of energy consumption in agricultural robots. Robots are emerging as a promising solution to address food production and agroecological challenges, offering potential reductions in chemical use and the ability to perform strenuous tasks beyond human capabilities. The automation of agricultural tasks introduces a previously unattainable level of complexity, enabling robots to optimize trajectories, control laws, and overall task planning. Consequently, automation can lead to higher levels of energy optimization in agricultural tasks. However, the energy consumption of robotic platforms is not fully understood, and a deeper analysis of contributing factors is essential to optimize energy use. We analyze the energy data of an automated agricultural tractor performing tasks throughout the year, revealing nontrivial correlations between the robot's velocity, the type of task performed, and energy consumption. This suggests a tradeoff between task efficiency, time to completion, and energy expenditure that can be harnessed to improve the energy efficiency of robotic agricultural operations.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Driving in Unstructured Environments: How Far Have We Come?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on autonomous driving in unstructured outdoor environments is less advanced than in structured urban settings due to challenges like environmental diversities and scene complexity. These environments-such as rural areas and rugged terrains-pose unique obstacles that are not common in structured urban areas. Despite these difficulties, autonomous driving in unstructured outdoor environments is crucial for applications in agriculture, mining, and military operations. Our survey reviews over 250 papers for autonomous driving in unstructured outdoor environments, covering offline mapping, pose estimation, environmental perception, path planning, end-to-end autonomous driving, datasets, and relevant challenges. We also discuss emerging trends and future research directions. This review aims to consolidate knowledge and encourage further research for autonomous driving in unstructured environments. To support ongoing work, we maintain an active repository with up-to-date literature and open-source projects at: https://github.com/chaytonmin/Survey-Autonomous-Driving-in-Unstructured-Environments.</description>

      <title>Lean Methodology for Garment Modernization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lean Methodology for Garment Modernization. This article presents the lean methodology for modernizing garment manufacturing, focusing on lean thinking, lean practices, automation development, VSM, and CRP, and how to integrate them effectively. While isolated automation of specific operations can improve efficiency and reduce cycle time, it does not necessarily enhance overall garment output and efficiency. To achieve these broader improvements, it is essential to consider the entire production line and process using VSM and CRP to optimize production and center balance. This approach can increase efficiency, and reduce manufacturing costs, labor time, and lead time, ultimately adding value to the company and factory.</description>

      <title>Design Method of a Kangaroo Robot with High Power Legs and an Articulated Soft Tail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the kangaroo, which has powerful legs capable of jumping and a soft and strong tail. To incorporate these unique structure into a robot for utilization, we propose a design method that takes into account both the feasibility as a robot and the kangaroo-mimetic structure. Based on the kangaroo's musculoskeletal structure, we determine the structure of the robot that enables it to jump by analyzing the muscle arrangement and prior verification in simulation. Also, to realize a tail capable of body support, we use an articulated, elastic structure as a tail. In order to achieve both softness and high power output, the robot is driven by a direct-drive, high-power wire-winding mechanism, and weight of legs and the tail is reduced by placing motors in the torso. The developed kangaroo robot can jump with its hind legs, moving its tail, and supporting its body using its hind legs and tail.</description>

      <title>PHODCOS: Pythagorean Hodograph-based Differentiable Coordinate System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents PHODCOS, an algorithm that assigns a moving coordinate system to a given curve. The parametric functions underlying the coordinate system, i.e., the path function, the moving frame and its angular velocity, are exact -- approximation free -- differentiable, and sufficiently continuous. This allows for computing a coordinate system for highly nonlinear curves, while remaining compliant with autonomous navigation algorithms that require first and second order gradient information. In addition, the coordinate system obtained by PHODCOS is fully defined by a finite number of coefficients, which may then be used to compute additional geometric properties of the curve, such as arc-length, curvature, torsion, etc. Therefore, PHODCOS presents an appealing paradigm to enhance the geometrical awareness of existing guidance and navigation on-orbit spacecraft maneuvers. The PHODCOS algorithm is presented alongside an analysis of its error and approximation order, and thus, it is guaranteed that the obtained coordinate system matches the given curve within a desired tolerance. To demonstrate the applicability of the coordinate system resulting from PHODCOS, we present numerical examples in the Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO) for the Lunar Gateway.</description>

      <title>Learning Low-Level Causal Relations using a Simulated Robotic Arm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal learning allows humans to predict the effect of their actions on the known environment and use this knowledge to plan the execution of more complex actions. Such knowledge also captures the behaviour of the environment and can be used for its analysis and the reasoning behind the behaviour. This type of knowledge is also crucial in the design of intelligent robotic systems with common sense. In this paper, we study causal relations by learning the forward and inverse models based on data generated by a simulated robotic arm involved in two sensorimotor tasks. As a next step, we investigate feature attribution methods for the analysis of the forward model, which reveals the low-level causal effects corresponding to individual features of the state vector related to both the arm joints and the environment features. This type of analysis provides solid ground for dimensionality reduction of the state representations, as well as for the aggregation of knowledge towards the explainability of causal effects at higher levels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles demand detailed maps to maneuver reliably through traffic, which need to be kept up-to-date to ensure a safe operation. A promising way to adapt the maps to the ever-changing road-network is to use crowd-sourced data from a fleet of vehicles. In this work, we present a mapping system that fuses local submaps gathered from a fleet of vehicles at a central instance to produce a coherent map of the road environment including drivable area, lane markings, poles, obstacles and more as a 3D mesh. Each vehicle contributes locally reconstructed submaps as lightweight meshes, making our method applicable to a wide range of reconstruction methods and sensor modalities. Our method jointly aligns and merges the noisy and incomplete local submaps using a scene-specific Neural Signed Distance Field, which is supervised using the submap meshes to predict a fused environment representation. We leverage memory-efficient sparse feature-grids to scale to large areas and introduce a confidence score to model uncertainty in scene reconstruction. Our approach is evaluated on two datasets with different local mapping methods, showing improved pose alignment and reconstruction over existing methods. Additionally, we demonstrate the benefit of multi-session mapping and examine the required amount of data to enable high-fidelity map learning for autonomous vehicles.</description>

      <title>Mastering Contact-rich Tasks by Combining Soft and Rigid Robotics with Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft robots have the potential to revolutionize the use of robotic systems with their capability of establishing safe, robust, and adaptable interactions with their environment, but their precise control remains challenging. In contrast, traditional rigid robots offer high accuracy and repeatability but lack the flexibility of soft robots. We argue that combining these characteristics in a hybrid robotic platform can significantly enhance overall capabilities. This work presents a novel hybrid robotic platform that integrates a rigid manipulator with a fully developed soft arm. This system is equipped with the intelligence necessary to perform flexible and generalizable tasks through imitation learning autonomously. The physical softness and machine learning enable our platform to achieve highly generalizable skills, while the rigid components ensure precision and repeatability.</description>

      <title>Robotic framework for autonomous manipulation of laboratory equipment with different degrees of transparency via 6D pose estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many modern robotic systems operate autonomously, however they often lack the ability to accurately analyze the environment and adapt to changing external conditions, while teleoperation systems often require special operator skills. In the field of laboratory automation, the number of automated processes is growing, however such systems are usually developed to perform specific tasks. In addition, many of the objects used in this field are transparent, making it difficult to analyze them using visual channels. The contributions of this work include the development of a robotic framework with autonomous mode for manipulating liquid-filled objects with different degrees of transparency in complex pose combinations. The conducted experiments demonstrated the robustness of the designed visual perception system to accurately estimate object poses for autonomous manipulation, and confirmed the performance of the algorithms in dexterous operations such as liquid dispensing. The proposed robotic framework can be applied for laboratory automation, since it allows solving the problem of performing non-trivial manipulation tasks with the analysis of object poses of varying degrees of transparency and liquid levels, requiring high accuracy and repeatability.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Vehicles Path Planning under Temporal Logic Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Path planning is an essential component of autonomous driving. A global planner is responsible for the high-level planning. It basically performs a shortest-path search on a known map, thereby defining waypoints used to control the local (low-level) planner. Local planning is a runtime verification method which is repeatedly run on the vehicle itself in real-time, so as to find the optimal short-horizon path which leads to the desired waypoint in a way which is both efficient and safe. The challenge is that the local planner has to take into account repeatedly incoming updates about the information available of the environment. In addition, it performs a complex task, as it has to take into account a large variety of requirements, originating from the necessity of collision avoidance with obstacles, respecting traffic rules, sticking to regulatory requirements, and lastly to reach the next waypoint efficiently. In this paper, we describe a logic-based specification mechanism which fulfills all these requirements.</description>

      <title>SwarmPath: Drone Swarm Navigation through Cluttered Environments Leveraging Artificial Potential Field and Impedance Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the area of multi-drone systems, navigating through dynamic environments from start to goal while providing collision-free trajectory and efficient path planning is a significant challenge. To solve this problem, we propose a novel SwarmPath technology that involves the integration of Artificial Potential Field (APF) with Impedance Controller. The proposed approach provides a solution based on collision free leader-follower behaviour where drones are able to adapt themselves to the environment. Moreover, the leader is virtual while drones are physical followers leveraging APF path planning approach to find the smallest possible path to the target. Simultaneously, the drones dynamically adjust impedance links, allowing themselves to create virtual links with obstacles to avoid them. As compared to conventional APF, the proposed SwarmPath system not only provides smooth collision-avoidance but also enable agents to efficiently pass through narrow passages by reducing the total travel time by 30% while ensuring safety in terms of drones connectivity. Lastly, the results also illustrate that the discrepancies between simulated and real environment, exhibit an average absolute percentage error (APE) of 6% of drone trajectories. This underscores the reliability of our solution in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Online DNN-driven Nonlinear MPC for Stylistic Humanoid Robot Walking with Step Adjustment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a three-layered architecture that enables stylistic locomotion with online contact location adjustment. Our method combines an autoregressive Deep Neural Network (DNN) acting as a trajectory generation layer with a model-based trajectory adjustment and trajectory control layers. The DNN produces centroidal and postural references serving as an initial guess and regularizer for the other layers. Being the DNN trained on human motion capture data, the resulting robot motion exhibits locomotion patterns, resembling a human walking style. The trajectory adjustment layer utilizes non-linear optimization to ensure dynamically feasible center of mass (CoM) motion while addressing step adjustments. We compare two implementations of the trajectory adjustment layer: one as a receding horizon planner (RHP) and the other as a model predictive controller (MPC). To enhance MPC performance, we introduce a Kalman filter to reduce measurement noise. The filter parameters are automatically tuned with a Genetic Algorithm. Experimental results on the ergoCub humanoid robot demonstrate the system's ability to prevent falls, replicate human walking styles, and withstand disturbances up to 68 Newton.

      <title>RDT-1B: a Diffusion Foundation Model for Bimanual Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bimanual manipulation is essential in robotics, yet developing foundation models is extremely challenging due to the inherent complexity of coordinating two robot arms (leading to multi-modal action distributions) and the scarcity of training data. In this paper, we present the Robotics Diffusion Transformer (RDT), a pioneering diffusion foundation model for bimanual manipulation. RDT builds on diffusion models to effectively represent multi-modality, with innovative designs of a scalable Transformer to deal with the heterogeneity of multi-modal inputs and to capture the nonlinearity and high frequency of robotic data. To address data scarcity, we further introduce a Physically Interpretable Unified Action Space, which can unify the action representations of various robots while preserving the physical meanings of original actions, facilitating learning transferrable physical knowledge. With these designs, we managed to pre-train RDT on the largest collection of multi-robot datasets to date and scaled it up to 1.2B parameters, which is the largest diffusion-based foundation model for robotic manipulation. We finally fine-tuned RDT on a self-created multi-task bimanual dataset with over 6K+ episodes to refine its manipulation capabilities. Experiments on real robots demonstrate that RDT significantly outperforms existing methods. It exhibits zero-shot generalization to unseen objects and scenes, understands and follows language instructions, learns new skills with just 1~5 demonstrations, and effectively handles complex, dexterous tasks.

      <title>Synergizing Morphological Computation and Generative Design: Automatic Synthesis of Tendon-Driven Grippers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robots' behavior and performance are determined both by hardware and software. The design process of robotic systems is a complex journey that involves multiple phases. Throughout this process, the aim is to tackle various criteria simultaneously, even though they often contradict each other. The ultimate goal is to uncover the optimal solution that resolves these conflicting factors. Generative, computation or automatic designs are the paradigms aimed at accelerating the whole design process. Within this paper we propose a design methodology to generate linkage mechanisms for robots with morphological computation. We use a graph grammar and a heuristic search algorithm to create robot mechanism graphs that are converted into simulation models for testing the design output. To verify the design methodology we have applied it to a relatively simple quasi-static problem of object grasping. We found a way to automatically design an underactuated tendon-driven gripper that can grasp a wide range of objects. This is possible because of its structure, not because of sophisticated planning or learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents L-VITeX, a lightweight visual intuition system for terrain exploration designed for resource-constrained robots and swarms. L-VITeX aims to provide a hint of Regions of Interest (RoIs) without computationally expensive processing. By utilizing the Faster Objects, More Objects (FOMO) tinyML architecture, the system achieves high accuracy (&gt;99%) in RoI detection while operating on minimal hardware resources (Peak RAM usage &lt; 50 KB) with near real-time inference (&lt;200 ms). The paper evaluates L-VITeX's performance across various terrains, including mountainous areas, underwater shipwreck debris regions, and Martian rocky surfaces. Additionally, it demonstrates the system's application in 3D mapping using a small mobile robot run by ESP32-Cam and Gaussian Splats (GS), showcasing its potential to enhance exploration efficiency and decision-making.</description>

      <title>Constrained Skill Discovery: Quadruped Locomotion with Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Representation learning and unsupervised skill discovery can allow robots to acquire diverse and reusable behaviors without the need for task-specific rewards. In this work, we use unsupervised reinforcement learning to learn a latent representation by maximizing the mutual information between skills and states subject to a distance constraint. Our method improves upon prior constrained skill discovery methods by replacing the latent transition maximization with a norm-matching objective. This not only results in a much a richer state space coverage compared to baseline methods, but allows the robot to learn more stable and easily controllable locomotive behaviors. We successfully deploy the learned policy on a real ANYmal quadruped robot and demonstrate that the robot can accurately reach arbitrary points of the Cartesian state space in a zero-shot manner, using only an intrinsic skill discovery and standard regularization rewards.</description>

      <title>Understanding Human Activity with Uncertainty Measure for Novelty in Graph Convolutional Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding human activity is a crucial aspect of developing intelligent robots, particularly in the domain of human-robot collaboration. Nevertheless, existing systems encounter challenges such as over-segmentation, attributed to errors in the up-sampling process of the decoder. In response, we introduce a promising solution: the Temporal Fusion Graph Convolutional Network. This innovative approach aims to rectify the inadequate boundary estimation of individual actions within an activity stream and mitigate the issue of over-segmentation in the temporal dimension.
  Moreover, systems leveraging human activity recognition frameworks for decision-making necessitate more than just the identification of actions. They require a confidence value indicative of the certainty regarding the correspondence between observations and training examples. This is crucial to prevent overly confident responses to unforeseen scenarios that were not part of the training data and may have resulted in mismatches due to weak similarity measures within the system. To address this, we propose the incorporation of a Spectral Normalized Residual connection aimed at enhancing efficient estimation of novelty in observations. This innovative approach ensures the preservation of input distance within the feature space by imposing constraints on the maximum gradients of weight updates. By limiting these gradients, we promote a more robust handling of novel situations, thereby mitigating the risks associated with overconfidence. Our methodology involves the use of a Gaussian process to quantify the distance in feature space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel multimodal perception system for a real open environment. The proposed system includes an embedded computation platform, cameras, ultrasonic sensors, GPS, and IMU devices. Unlike the traditional frameworks, our system integrates multiple sensors with advanced computer vision algorithms to help users walk outside reliably. The system can efficiently complete various tasks, including navigating to specific locations, passing through obstacle regions, and crossing intersections. Specifically, we also use ultrasonic sensors and depth cameras to enhance obstacle avoidance performance. The path planning module is designed to find the locally optimal route based on various feedback and the user's current state. To evaluate the performance of the proposed system, we design several experiments under different scenarios. The results show that the system can help users walk efficiently and independently in complex situations.</description>

      <title>Fron CAD to URDF: Co-Design of a Jet-Powered Humanoid Robot Including CAD Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Co-design optimization strategies usually rely on simplified robot models extracted from CAD. While these models are useful for optimizing geometrical and inertial parameters for robot control, they might overlook important details essential for prototyping the optimized mechanical design. For instance, they may not account for mechanical stresses exerted on the optimized geometries and the complexity of assembly-level design. In this paper, we introduce a co-design framework aimed at improving both the control performance and mechanical design of our robot. Specifically, we identify the robot links that significantly influence control performance. The geometric characteristics of these links are parameterized and optimized using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to achieve optimal control performance. Additionally, an automated Finite Element Method (FEM) analysis is integrated into the framework to filter solutions not satisfying the required structural safety margin. We validate the framework by applying it to enhance the mechanical design for flight performance of the jet-powered humanoid robot iRonCub.</description>

      <title>Towards Synergistic, Generalized, and Efficient Dual-System for Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing demand for versatile robotic systems to operate in diverse and dynamic environments has emphasized the importance of a generalist policy, which leverages a large cross-embodiment data corpus to facilitate broad adaptability and high-level reasoning. However, the generalist would struggle with inefficient inference and cost-expensive training. The specialist policy, instead, is curated for specific domain data and excels at task-level precision with efficiency. Yet, it lacks the generalization capacity for a wide range of applications. Inspired by these observations, we introduce RoboDual, a synergistic dual-system that supplements the merits of both generalist and specialist policy. A diffusion transformer-based specialist is devised for multi-step action rollouts, exquisitely conditioned on the high-level task understanding and discretized action output of a vision-language-action (VLA) based generalist. Compared to OpenVLA, RoboDual achieves 26.7% improvement in real-world setting and 12% gain on CALVIN by introducing a specialist policy with merely 20M trainable parameters. It maintains strong performance with 5% of demonstration data only, and enables a 3.8 times higher control frequency in real-world deployment. Code would be made publicly available.

      <title>Dynamic Object Catching with Quadruped Robot Front Legs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a framework for dynamic object catching using a quadruped robot's front legs while it stands on its rear legs. The system integrates computer vision, trajectory prediction, and leg control to enable the quadruped to visually detect, track, and successfully catch a thrown object using an onboard camera. Leveraging a fine-tuned YOLOv8 model for object detection and a regression-based trajectory prediction module, the quadruped adapts its front leg positions iteratively to anticipate and intercept the object. The catching maneuver involves identifying the optimal catching position, controlling the front legs with Cartesian PD control, and closing the legs together at the right moment. We propose and validate three different methods for selecting the optimal catching position: 1) intersecting the predicted trajectory with a vertical plane, 2) selecting the point on the predicted trajectory with the minimal distance to the center of the robot's legs in their nominal position, and 3) selecting the point on the predicted trajectory with the highest likelihood on a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) modelling the robot's reachable space. Experimental results demonstrate robust catching capabilities across various scenarios, with the GMM method achieving the best performance, leading to an 80% catching success rate.

      <title>LiPO: LiDAR Inertial Odometry for ICP Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a LiDAR inertial odometry (LIO) framework, called LiPO, that enables direct comparisons of different iterative closest point (ICP) point cloud registration methods. The two common ICP methods we compare are point-to-point (P2P) and point-to-feature (P2F). In our experience, within the context of LIO, P2F-ICP results in less drift and improved mapping accuracy when robots move aggressively through challenging environments when compared to P2P-ICP. However, P2F-ICP methods require more hand-tuned hyper-parameters that make P2F-ICP less general across all environments and motions. In real-world field robotics applications where robots are used across different environments, more general P2P-ICP methods may be preferred despite increased drift. In this paper, we seek to better quantify the trade-off between P2P-ICP and P2F-ICP to help inform when each method should be used. To explore this trade-off, we use LiPO to directly compare ICP methods and test on relevant benchmark datasets as well as on our custom unpiloted ground vehicle (UGV). We find that overall, P2F-ICP has reduced drift and improved mapping accuracy, but, P2P-ICP is more consistent across all environments and motions with minimal drift increase.</description>

      <title>On the Evaluation of Generative Robotic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the difficulty of acquiring extensive real-world data, robot simulation has become crucial for parallel training and sim-to-real transfer, highlighting the importance of scalable simulated robotic tasks. Foundation models have demonstrated impressive capacities in autonomously generating feasible robotic tasks. However, this new paradigm underscores the challenge of adequately evaluating these autonomously generated tasks. To address this, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework tailored to generative simulations. Our framework segments evaluation into three core aspects: quality, diversity, and generalization. For single-task quality, we evaluate the realism of the generated task and the completeness of the generated trajectories using large language models and vision-language models. In terms of diversity, we measure both task and data diversity through text similarity of task descriptions and world model loss trained on collected task trajectories. For task-level generalization, we assess the zero-shot generalization ability on unseen tasks of a policy trained with multiple generated tasks. Experiments conducted on three representative task generation pipelines demonstrate that the results from our framework are highly consistent with human evaluations, confirming the feasibility and validity of our approach. The findings reveal that while metrics of quality and diversity can be achieved through certain methods, no single approach excels across all metrics, suggesting a need for greater focus on balancing these different metrics. Additionally, our analysis further highlights the common challenge of low generalization capability faced by current works.

      <title>Learning responsibility allocations for multi-agent interactions: A differentiable optimization approach with control barrier functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From autonomous driving to package delivery, ensuring safe yet efficient multi-agent interaction is challenging as the interaction dynamics are influenced by hard-to-model factors such as social norms and contextual cues. Understanding these influences can aid in the design and evaluation of socially-aware autonomous agents whose behaviors are aligned with human values. In this work, we seek to codify factors governing safe multi-agent interactions via the lens of responsibility, i.e., an agent's willingness to deviate from their desired control to accommodate safe interaction with others. Specifically, we propose a data-driven modeling approach based on control barrier functions and differentiable optimization that efficiently learns agents' responsibility allocation from data. We demonstrate on synthetic and real-world datasets that we can obtain an interpretable and quantitative understanding of how much agents adjust their behavior to ensure the safety of others given their current environment.</description>

      <title>NeRF-Accelerated Ecological Monitoring in Mixed-Evergreen Redwood Forest</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forest mapping provides critical observational data needed to understand the dynamics of forest environments. Notably, tree diameter at breast height (DBH) is a metric used to estimate forest biomass and carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) sequestration. Manual methods of forest mapping are labor intensive and time consuming, a bottleneck for large-scale mapping efforts. Automated mapping relies on acquiring dense forest reconstructions, typically in the form of point clouds. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and mobile laser scanning (MLS) generate point clouds using expensive LiDAR sensing, and have been used successfully to estimate tree diameter. Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) are an emergent technology enabling photorealistic, vision-based reconstruction by training a neural network on a sparse set of input views. In this paper, we present a comparison of MLS and NeRF forest reconstructions for the purpose of trunk diameter estimation in a mixed-evergreen Redwood forest. In addition, we propose an improved DBH-estimation method using convex-hull modeling. Using this approach, we achieved 1.68 cm RMSE, which consistently outperformed standard cylinder modeling approaches.

      <title>Zero-Shot Generalization of Vision-Based RL Without Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalizing vision-based reinforcement learning (RL) agents to novel environments remains a difficult and open challenge. Current trends are to collect large-scale datasets or use data augmentation techniques to prevent overfitting and improve downstream generalization. However, the computational and data collection costs increase exponentially with the number of task variations and can destabilize the already difficult task of training RL agents. In this work, we take inspiration from recent advances in computational neuroscience and propose a model, Associative Latent DisentAnglement (ALDA), that builds on standard off-policy RL towards zero-shot generalization. Specifically, we revisit the role of latent disentanglement in RL and show how combining it with a model of associative memory achieves zero-shot generalization on difficult task variations without relying on data augmentation. Finally, we formally show that data augmentation techniques are a form of weak disentanglement and discuss the implications of this insight.</description>

      <title>A Visual Cooperative Localization Method for Airborne Magnetic Surveying Based on a Manifold Sensor Fusion Algorithm Using Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in UAV technology have spurred interest in developing multi-UAV aerial surveying systems for use in confined environments where GNSS signals are blocked or jammed. This paper focuses airborne magnetic surveying scenarios. To obtain clean magnetic measurements reflecting the Earth's magnetic field, the magnetic sensor must be isolated from other electronic devices, creating a significant localization challenge. We propose a visual cooperative localization solution. The solution incorporates a visual processing module and an improved manifold-based sensor fusion algorithm, delivering reliable and accurate positioning information. Real flight experiments validate the approach, demonstrating single-axis centimeter-level accuracy and decimeter-level overall 3D positioning accuracy.</description>

      <title>LaB-CL: Localized and Balanced Contrastive Learning for improving parking slot detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parking slot detection is an essential technology in autonomous parking systems. In general, the classification problem of parking slot detection consists of two tasks, a task determining whether localized candidates are junctions of parking slots or not, and the other that identifies a shape of detected junctions. Both classification tasks can easily face biased learning toward the majority class, degrading classification performances. Yet, the data imbalance issue has been overlooked in parking slot detection. We propose the first supervised contrastive learning framework for parking slot detection, Localized and Balanced Contrastive Learning for improving parking slot detection (LaB-CL). The proposed LaB-CL framework uses two main approaches. First, we propose to include class prototypes to consider representations from all classes in every mini batch, from the local perspective. Second, we propose a new hard negative sampling scheme that selects local representations with high prediction error. Experiments with the benchmark dataset demonstrate that the proposed LaB-CL framework can outperform existing parking slot detection methods.</description>

      <title>Soothing Sensations: Enhancing Interactions with a Socially Assistive Robot through Vibrotactile Heartbeats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical interactions with socially assistive robots (SARs) positively affect user wellbeing. However, haptic experiences when touching a SAR are typically limited to perceiving the robot's movements or shell texture, while other modalities that could enhance the touch experience with the robot, such as vibrotactile stimulation, are under-explored. In this exploratory qualitative study, we investigate the potential of enhancing human interaction with the PARO robot through vibrotactile heartbeats, with the goal to regulate subjective wellbeing during stressful situations. We conducted in-depth one-on-one interviews with 30 participants, who watched three horror movie clips alone, with PARO, and with a PARO that displayed a vibrotactile heartbeat. Our findings show that PARO's presence and its interactive capabilities can help users regulate emotions through attentional redeployment from a stressor toward the robot. The vibrotactile heartbeat further reinforced PARO's physical and social presence, enhancing the socio-emotional support provided by the robot and its perceived life-likeness. We discuss the impact of individual differences in user experience and implications for the future design of life-like vibrotactile stimulation for SARs.</description>

      <title>Understanding Spatio-Temporal Relations in Human-Object Interaction using Pyramid Graph Convolutional Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human activities recognition is an important task for an intelligent robot, especially in the field of human-robot collaboration, it requires not only the label of sub-activities but also the temporal structure of the activity. In order to automatically recognize both the label and the temporal structure in sequence of human-object interaction, we propose a novel Pyramid Graph Convolutional Network (PGCN), which employs a pyramidal encoder-decoder architecture consisting of an attention based graph convolution network and a temporal pyramid pooling module for downsampling and upsampling interaction sequence on the temporal axis, respectively. The system represents the 2D or 3D spatial relation of human and objects from the detection results in video data as a graph. To learn the human-object relations, a new attention graph convolutional network is trained to extract condensed information from the graph representation. To segment action into sub-actions, a novel temporal pyramid pooling module is proposed, which upsamples compressed features back to the original time scale and classifies actions per frame.
  We explore various attention layers, namely spatial attention, temporal attention and channel attention, and combine different upsampling decoders to test the performance on action recognition and segmentation. We evaluate our model on two challenging datasets in the field of human-object interaction recognition, i.e. Bimanual Actions and IKEA Assembly datasets. We demonstrate that our classifier significantly improves both framewise action recognition and segmentation, e.g., F1 micro and F1@50 scores on Bimanual Actions dataset are improved by $4.3\%$ and $8.5\%$ respectively.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Satisfaction of Temporal Logic Constraints in Reinforcement Learning via Adaptive Policy-Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) is a subset of machine learning that introduces constraints into the traditional reinforcement learning (RL) framework. Unlike conventional RL which aims solely to maximize cumulative rewards, CRL incorporates additional constraints that represent specific mission requirements or limitations that the agent must comply with during the learning process. In this paper, we address a type of CRL problem where an agent aims to learn the optimal policy to maximize reward while ensuring a desired level of temporal logic constraint satisfaction throughout the learning process. We propose a novel framework that relies on switching between pure learning (reward maximization) and constraint satisfaction. This framework estimates the probability of constraint satisfaction based on earlier trials and properly adjusts the probability of switching between learning and constraint satisfaction policies. We theoretically validate the correctness of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate its performance and scalability through comprehensive simulations.</description>

      <title>UW-SDF: Exploiting Hybrid Geometric Priors for Neural SDF Reconstruction from Underwater Multi-view Monocular Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the unique characteristics of underwater environments, accurate 3D reconstruction of underwater objects poses a challenging problem in tasks such as underwater exploration and mapping. Traditional methods that rely on multiple sensor data for 3D reconstruction are time-consuming and face challenges in data acquisition in underwater scenarios. We propose UW-SDF, a framework for reconstructing target objects from multi-view underwater images based on neural SDF. We introduce hybrid geometric priors to optimize the reconstruction process, markedly enhancing the quality and efficiency of neural SDF reconstruction. Additionally, to address the challenge of segmentation consistency in multi-view images, we propose a novel few-shot multi-view target segmentation strategy using the general-purpose segmentation model (SAM), enabling rapid automatic segmentation of unseen objects. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on diverse datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the traditional underwater 3D reconstruction method and other neural rendering approaches in the field of underwater 3D reconstruction.</description>

      <title>SG-Nav: Online 3D Scene Graph Prompting for LLM-based Zero-shot Object Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new framework for zero-shot object navigation. Existing zero-shot object navigation methods prompt LLM with the text of spatially closed objects, which lacks enough scene context for in-depth reasoning. To better preserve the information of environment and fully exploit the reasoning ability of LLM, we propose to represent the observed scene with 3D scene graph. The scene graph encodes the relationships between objects, groups and rooms with a LLM-friendly structure, for which we design a hierarchical chain-of-thought prompt to help LLM reason the goal location according to scene context by traversing the nodes and edges. Moreover, benefit from the scene graph representation, we further design a re-perception mechanism to empower the object navigation framework with the ability to correct perception error. We conduct extensive experiments on MP3D, HM3D and RoboTHOR environments, where SG-Nav surpasses previous state-of-the-art zero-shot methods by more than 10% SR on all benchmarks, while the decision process is explainable. To the best of our knowledge, SG-Nav is the first zero-shot method that achieves even higher performance than supervised object navigation methods on the challenging MP3D benchmark.</description>

      <title>SPA: 3D Spatial-Awareness Enables Effective Embodied Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce SPA, a novel representation learning framework that emphasizes the importance of 3D spatial awareness in embodied AI. Our approach leverages differentiable neural rendering on multi-view images to endow a vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) with intrinsic spatial understanding. We present the most comprehensive evaluation of embodied representation learning to date, covering 268 tasks across 8 simulators with diverse policies in both single-task and language-conditioned multi-task scenarios. The results are compelling: SPA consistently outperforms more than 10 state-of-the-art representation methods, including those specifically designed for embodied AI, vision-centric tasks, and multi-modal applications, while using less training data. Furthermore, we conduct a series of real-world experiments to confirm its effectiveness in practical scenarios. These results highlight the critical role of 3D spatial awareness for embodied representation learning. Our strongest model takes more than 6000 GPU hours to train and we are committed to open-sourcing all code and model weights to foster future research in embodied representation learning.

      <title>Co-Design Optimisation of Morphing Topology and Control of Winged Drones</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13948v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The design and control of winged aircraft and drones is an iterative process aimed at identifying a compromise of mission-specific costs and constraints. When agility is required, shape-shifting (morphing) drones represent an efficient solution. However, morphing drones require the addition of actuated joints that increase the topology and control coupling, making the design process more complex. We propose a co-design optimisation method that assists the engineers by proposing a morphing drone's conceptual design that includes topology, actuation, morphing strategy, and controller parameters. The method consists of applying multi-objective constraint-based optimisation to a multi-body winged drone with trajectory optimisation to solve the motion intelligence problem under diverse flight mission requirements, such as energy consumption and mission completion time. We show that co-designed morphing drones outperform fixed-winged drones in terms of energy efficiency and mission time, suggesting that the proposed co-design method could be a useful addition to the aircraft engineering toolbox.</description>

      <title>AO-Grasp: Articulated Object Grasp Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15928v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce AO-Grasp, a grasp proposal method that generates 6 DoF grasps that enable robots to interact with articulated objects, such as opening and closing cabinets and appliances. AO-Grasp consists of two main contributions: the AO-Grasp Model and the AO-Grasp Dataset. Given a segmented partial point cloud of a single articulated object, the AO-Grasp Model predicts the best grasp points on the object with an Actionable Grasp Point Predictor. Then, it finds corresponding grasp orientations for each of these points, resulting in stable and actionable grasp proposals. We train the AO-Grasp Model on our new AO-Grasp Dataset, which contains 78K actionable parallel-jaw grasps on synthetic articulated objects. In simulation, AO-Grasp achieves a 45.0 % grasp success rate, whereas the highest performing baseline achieves a 35.0% success rate. Additionally, we evaluate AO-Grasp on 120 real-world scenes of objects with varied geometries, articulation axes, and joint states, where AO-Grasp produces successful grasps on 67.5% of scenes, while the baseline only produces successful grasps on 33.3% of scenes. To the best of our knowledge, AO-Grasp is the first method for generating 6 DoF grasps on articulated objects directly from partial point clouds without requiring part detection or hand-designed grasp heuristics.

      <title>Safe Task Planning for Language-Instructed Multi-Robot Systems using Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15368v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses task planning problems for language-instructed robot teams. Tasks are expressed in natural language (NL), requiring the robots to apply their capabilities at various locations and semantic objects. Several recent works have addressed similar planning problems by leveraging pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to design effective multi-robot plans. However, these approaches lack mission completion guarantees. To address this challenge, we introduce a new distributed LLM-based planner, called S-ATLAS for Safe plAnning for Teams of Language-instructed AgentS, that is capable of achieving user-defined mission success rates. This is accomplished by leveraging conformal prediction (CP), a distribution-free uncertainty quantification tool in black-box models. CP allows the proposed multi-robot planner to reason about its inherent uncertainty in a distributed fashion, enabling robots to make individual decisions when they are sufficiently certain and seek help otherwise. We show, both theoretically and empirically, that the proposed planner can achieve user-specified task success rates while minimizing the overall number of help requests. We provide comparative experiments against related works showing that our method is significantly more computational efficient and achieves lower help rates. The advantage of our algorithm over baselines becomes more pronounced with increasing robot team size.</description>

      <title>SE(3) Linear Parameter Varying Dynamical Systems for Globally Asymptotically Stable End-Effector Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear Parameter Varying Dynamical Systems (LPV-DS) encode trajectories into an autonomous first-order DS that enables reactive responses to perturbations, while ensuring globally asymptotic stability at the target. However, the current LPV-DS framework is established on Euclidean data only and has not been applicable to broader robotic applications requiring pose control. In this paper we present an extension to the current LPV-DS framework, named Quaternion-DS, which efficiently learns a DS-based motion policy for orientation. Leveraging techniques from differential geometry and Riemannian statistics, our approach properly handles the non-Euclidean orientation data in quaternion space, enabling the integration with positional control, namely SE(3) LPV-DS, so that the synergistic behaviour within the full SE(3) pose is preserved. Through simulation and real robot experiments, we validate our method, demonstrating its ability to efficiently and accurately reproduce the original SE(3) trajectory while exhibiting strong robustness to perturbations in task space.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Orchestrating Bimanual Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although there has been rapid progress in endowing robots with the ability to solve complex manipulation tasks, generating control policies for bimanual robots to solve tasks involving two hands is still challenging because of the difficulties in effective temporal and spatial coordination. With emergent abilities in terms of step-by-step reasoning and in-context learning, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising potential in a variety of robotic tasks. However, the nature of language communication via a single sequence of discrete symbols makes LLM-based coordination in continuous space a particular challenge for bimanual tasks. To tackle this challenge, we present LAnguage-model-based Bimanual ORchestration (LABOR), an agent utilizing an LLM to analyze task configurations and devise coordination control policies for addressing long-horizon bimanual tasks. We evaluate our method through simulated experiments involving two classes of long-horizon tasks using the NICOL humanoid robot. Our results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline in terms of success rate. Additionally, we thoroughly analyze failure cases, offering insights into LLM-based approaches in bimanual robotic control and revealing future research trends.

Abstract: Mainstream autonomous exploration methods usually perform excessively-repeated explorations for the same region, leading to long exploration time and exploration trajectory in complex scenes. To handle this issue, we propose a novel semantic region aware autonomous exploration method, the core idea of which is considering the information of semantic regions to optimize the autonomous navigation strategy. Our method enables the mobile robot to fully explore the current semantic region before moving to the next region, contributing to avoid excessively-repeated explorations and accelerate the exploration speed. In addition, compared with existing au?tonomous exploration methods that usually construct the single-type map, our method allows to construct four types of maps including point cloud map, occupancy grid map, topological map, and semantic map. The experiment results demonstrate that our method achieves the highest 50.7% exploration time reduction and 48.1% exploration trajectory length reduction while maintaining &gt;98% exploration rate when comparing with the classical RRT (Rapid-exploration Random Tree) based autonomous exploration method.</description>

      <title>DragTraffic: Interactive and Controllable Traffic Scene Generation for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evaluating and training autonomous driving systems require diverse and scalable corner cases. However, most existing scene generation methods lack controllability, accuracy, and versatility, resulting in unsatisfactory generation results. Inspired by DragGAN in image generation, we propose DragTraffic, a generalized, interactive, and controllable traffic scene generation framework based on conditional diffusion. DragTraffic enables non-experts to generate a variety of realistic driving scenarios for different types of traffic agents through an adaptive mixture expert architecture. We employ a regression model to provide a general initial solution and a refinement process based on the conditional diffusion model to ensure diversity. User-customized context is introduced through cross-attention to ensure high controllability. Experiments on a real-world driving dataset show that DragTraffic outperforms existing methods in terms of authenticity, diversity, and freedom. Demo videos and code are available at https://chantsss.github.io/Dragtraffic/.</description>

      <title>Cross-Embodied Affordance Transfer through Learning Affordance Equivalences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Affordances represent the inherent effect and action possibilities that objects offer to the agents within a given context. From a theoretical viewpoint, affordances bridge the gap between effect and action, providing a functional understanding of the connections between the actions of an agent and its environment in terms of the effects it can cause. In this study, we propose a deep neural network model that unifies objects, actions, and effects into a single latent vector in a common latent space that we call the affordance space. Using the affordance space, our system can generate effect trajectories when action and object are given and can generate action trajectories when effect trajectories and objects are given. Our model does not learn the behavior of individual objects acted upon by a single agent. Still, rather, it forms a `shared affordance representation' spanning multiple agents and objects, which we call Affordance Equivalence. Affordance Equivalence facilitates not only action generalization over objects but also Cross Embodiment transfer linking actions of different robots. In addition to the simulation experiments that demonstrate the proposed model's range of capabilities, we also showcase that our model can be used for direct imitation in real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Learning to Plan Maneuverable and Agile Flight Trajectory with Optimization Embedded Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07736v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent times, an increasing number of researchers have been devoted to utilizing deep neural networks for end-to-end flight navigation. This approach has gained traction due to its ability to bridge the gap between perception and planning that exists in traditional methods, thereby eliminating delays between modules. However, the practice of replacing original modules with neural networks in a black-box manner diminishes the overall system's robustness and stability. It lacks principled explanations and often fails to consistently generate high-quality motion trajectories. Furthermore, such methods often struggle to rigorously account for the robot's kinematic constraints, resulting in the generation of trajectories that cannot be executed satisfactorily. In this work, we combine the advantages of traditional methods and neural networks by proposing an optimization-embedded neural network. This network can learn high-quality trajectories directly from visual inputs without the need of mapping, while ensuring dynamic feasibility. Here, the deep neural network is employed to directly extract environment safety regions from depth images. Subsequently, we employ a model-based approach to represent these regions as safety constraints in trajectory optimization. Leveraging the availability of highly efficient optimization algorithms, our method robustly converges to feasible and optimal solutions that satisfy various user-defined constraints. Moreover, we differentiate the optimization process, allowing it to be trained as a layer within the neural network. This approach facilitates the direct interaction between perception and planning, enabling the network to focus more on the spatial regions where optimal solutions exist. As a result, it further enhances the quality and stability of the generated trajectories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17665v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a prototype for a new approach to assistive robotics, integrating edge computing with Natural Language Processing (NLP) and computer vision to enhance the interaction between humans and robotic systems. Our proof of concept demonstrates the feasibility of using large language models (LLMs) and vision systems in tandem for interpreting and executing complex commands conveyed through natural language.

      <title>Deployment of Large Language Models to Control Mobile Robots at the Edge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17670v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the possibility of intuitive human-robot interaction through the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) in mobile robotics. This work aims to explore the feasibility of using these technologies for edge-based deployment, where traditional cloud dependencies are eliminated. The study specifically contrasts the performance of GPT-4-Turbo, which requires cloud connectivity, with an offline-capable, quantized version of LLaMA 2 (LLaMA 2-7B.Q5 K M). These results show that GPT-4-Turbo delivers superior performance in interpreting and executing complex commands accurately, whereas LLaMA 2 exhibits significant limitations in consistency and reliability of command execution. Communication between the control computer and the mobile robot is established via a Raspberry Pi Pico W, which wirelessly receives commands from the computer without internet dependency and transmits them through a wired connection to the robot's Arduino controller. This study highlights the potential and challenges of implementing LLMs and NLP at the edge, providing groundwork for future research into fully autonomous and network-independent robotic systems.

      <title>HBTP: Heuristic Behavior Tree Planning with Large Language Model Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00965v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Behavior Trees (BTs) are increasingly becoming a popular control structure in robotics due to their modularity, reactivity, and robustness. In terms of BT generation methods, BT planning shows promise for generating reliable BTs. However, the scalability of BT planning is often constrained by prolonged planning times in complex scenarios, largely due to a lack of domain knowledge. In contrast, pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated task reasoning capabilities across various domains, though the correctness and safety of their planning remain uncertain. This paper proposes integrating BT planning with LLM reasoning, introducing Heuristic Behavior Tree Planning (HBTP)-a reliable and efficient framework for BT generation. The key idea in HBTP is to leverage LLMs for task-specific reasoning to generate a heuristic path, which BT planning can then follow to expand efficiently. We first introduce the heuristic BT expansion process, along with two heuristic variants designed for optimal planning and satisficing planning, respectively. Then, we propose methods to address the inaccuracies of LLM reasoning, including action space pruning and reflective feedback, to further enhance both reasoning accuracy and planning efficiency. Experiments demonstrate the theoretical bounds of HBTP, and results from four datasets confirm its practical effectiveness in everyday service robot applications.</description>

      <title>C$^3$P-VoxelMap: Compact, Cumulative and Coalescible Probabilistic Voxel Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a compact, cumulative and coalescible probabilistic voxel mapping method to enhance performance, accuracy and memory efficiency in LiDAR odometry. Probabilistic voxel mapping requires storing past point clouds and re-iterating on them to update the uncertainty every iteration, which consumes large memory space and CPU cycles. To solve this problem, we propose a two-folded strategy. First, we introduce a compact point-free representation for probabilistic voxels and derive a cumulative update of the planar uncertainty without caching original point clouds. Our voxel structure only keeps track of a predetermined set of statistics for points that lie inside it. This method reduces the runtime complexity from $O(MN)$ to $O(N)$ and the space complexity from $O(N)$ to $O(1)$ where $M$ is the number of iterations and $N$ is the number of points. Second, to further minimize memory usage and enhance mapping accuracy, we provide a strategy to dynamically merge voxels associated with the same physical planes by taking advantage of the geometric features in the real world. Rather than scanning for these coalescible voxels constantly at every iteration, our merging strategy accumulates voxels in a locality-sensitive hash and triggers merging lazily. On-demand merging not only reduces memory footprint with minimal computational overhead but also improves localization accuracy thanks to cross-voxel denoising. Experiments exhibit 20% higher accuracy, 20% faster performance and 70% lower memory consumption than the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-based robot policy learning, which maps visual inputs to actions, necessitates a holistic understanding of diverse visual tasks beyond single-task needs like classification or segmentation. Inspired by this, we introduce Theia, a vision foundation model for robot learning that distills multiple off-the-shelf vision foundation models trained on varied vision tasks. Theia's rich visual representations encode diverse visual knowledge, enhancing downstream robot learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Theia outperforms its teacher models and prior robot learning models using less training data and smaller model sizes. Additionally, we quantify the quality of pre-trained visual representations and hypothesize that higher entropy in feature norm distributions leads to improved robot learning performance. Code, models, and demo are available at https://theia.theaiinstitute.com.</description>

      <title>YoloTag: Vision-based Robust UAV Navigation with Fiducial Markers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By harnessing fiducial markers as visual landmarks in the environment, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can rapidly build precise maps and navigate spaces safely and efficiently, unlocking their potential for fluent collaboration and coexistence with humans. Existing fiducial marker methods rely on handcrafted feature extraction, which sacrifices accuracy. On the other hand, deep learning pipelines for marker detection fail to meet real-time runtime constraints crucial for navigation applications. In this work, we propose YoloTag -a real-time fiducial marker-based localization system. YoloTag uses a lightweight YOLO v8 object detector to accurately detect fiducial markers in images while meeting the runtime constraints needed for navigation. The detected markers are then used by an efficient perspective-n-point algorithm to estimate UAV states. However, this localization system introduces noise, causing instability in trajectory tracking. To suppress noise, we design a higher-order Butterworth filter that effectively eliminates noise through frequency domain analysis. We evaluate our algorithm through real-robot experiments in an indoor environment, comparing the trajectory tracking performance of our method against other approaches in terms of several distance metrics.</description>

      <title>DRAL: Deep Reinforcement Adaptive Learning for Multi-UAVs Navigation in Unknown Indoor Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous indoor navigation of UAVs presents numerous challenges, primarily due to the limited precision of GPS in enclosed environments. Additionally, UAVs' limited capacity to carry heavy or power-intensive sensors, such as overheight packages, exacerbates the difficulty of achieving autonomous navigation indoors. This paper introduces an advanced system in which a drone autonomously navigates indoor spaces to locate a specific target, such as an unknown Amazon package, using only a single camera. Employing a deep learning approach, a deep reinforcement adaptive learning algorithm is trained to develop a control strategy that emulates the decision-making process of an expert pilot. We demonstrate the efficacy of our system through real-time simulations conducted in various indoor settings. We apply multiple visualization techniques to gain deeper insights into our trained network. Furthermore, we extend our approach to include an adaptive control algorithm for coordinating multiple drones to lift an object in an indoor environment collaboratively. Integrating our DRAL algorithm enables multiple UAVs to learn optimal control strategies that adapt to dynamic conditions and uncertainties. This innovation enhances the robustness and flexibility of indoor navigation and opens new possibilities for complex multi-drone operations in confined spaces. The proposed framework highlights significant advancements in adaptive control and deep reinforcement learning, offering robust solutions for complex multi-agent systems in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Unpacking Failure Modes of Generative Policies: Runtime Monitoring of Consistency and Progress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robot behavior policies trained via imitation learning are prone to failure under conditions that deviate from their training data. Thus, algorithms that monitor learned policies at test time and provide early warnings of failure are necessary to facilitate scalable deployment. We propose Sentinel, a runtime monitoring framework that splits the detection of failures into two complementary categories: 1) Erratic failures, which we detect using statistical measures of temporal action consistency, and 2) task progression failures, where we use Vision Language Models (VLMs) to detect when the policy confidently and consistently takes actions that do not solve the task. Our approach has two key strengths. First, because learned policies exhibit diverse failure modes, combining complementary detectors leads to significantly higher accuracy at failure detection. Second, using a statistical temporal action consistency measure ensures that we quickly detect when multimodal, generative policies exhibit erratic behavior at negligible computational cost. In contrast, we only use VLMs to detect failure modes that are less time-sensitive. We demonstrate our approach in the context of diffusion policies trained on robotic mobile manipulation domains in both simulation and the real world. By unifying temporal consistency detection and VLM runtime monitoring, Sentinel detects 18% more failures than using either of the two detectors alone and significantly outperforms baselines, thus highlighting the importance of assigning specialized detectors to complementary categories of failure.

Abstract: Planar-symmetric hands, such as parallel grippers, are widely adopted in both research and industrial fields. Their symmetry, however, introduces ambiguity and discontinuity in the SO(3) representation, which hinders both the training and inference of neural-network-based grasp detectors. We propose a novel SO(3) representation that can parametrize a pair of planar-symmetric poses with a single parameter set by leveraging the 2D Bingham distribution. We also detail a grasp detector based on our representation, which provides a more consistent rotation output. An intensive evaluation with multiple grippers and objects in both the simulation and the real world quantitatively shows our approach's contribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning from Demonstration (LfD) is a powerful type of machine learning that can allow novices to teach and program robots to complete various tasks. However, the learning process for these systems may still be difficult for novices to interpret and understand, making effective teaching challenging. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) aims to address this challenge by explaining a system to the user. In this work, we investigate XAI within LfD by implementing an adaptive explanatory feedback system on an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) algorithm. The feedback is implemented by demonstrating selected learnt trajectories to users. The system adapts to user teaching by categorizing and then selectively sampling trajectories shown to a user, to show a representative sample of both successful and unsuccessful trajectories. The system was evaluated through a user study with 26 participants teaching a robot a navigation task. The results of the user study demonstrated that the proposed explanatory feedback system can improve robot performance, teaching efficiency and user understanding of the robot.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grasping a variety of objects remains a key challenge in the development of versatile robotic systems. The human hand is remarkably dexterous, capable of grasping and manipulating objects with diverse shapes, mechanical properties, and textures. Inspired by how humans use two fingers to pick up thin and large objects such as fabric or sheets of paper, we aim to develop a gripper optimized for grasping such deformable objects. Observing how the soft and flexible fingertip joints of the hand approach and grasp thin materials, a hybrid gripper design that incorporates both soft and rigid components was proposed. The gripper utilizes a soft pneumatic ring wrapped around a rigid revolute joint to create a flexible two-fingered gripper. Experiments were conducted to characterize and evaluate the gripper performance in handling sheets of paper and other objects. Compared to rigid grippers, the proposed design improves grasping efficiency and reduces the gripping distance by up to eightfold.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid algorithm designed to interpret natural human commands in tabletop scenarios. By integrating multiple sources of information, including speech, gestures, and scene context, the system extracts actionable instructions for a robot, identifying relevant objects and actions. The system operates in a zero-shot fashion, without reliance on predefined object models, enabling flexible and adaptive use in various environments. We assess the integration of multiple deep learning models, evaluating their suitability for deployment in real-world robotic setups. Our algorithm performs robustly across different tasks, combining language processing with visual grounding. In addition, we release a small dataset of video recordings used to evaluate the system. This dataset captures real-world interactions in which a human provides instructions in natural language to a robot, a contribution to future research on human-robot interaction. We discuss the strengths and limitations of the system, with particular focus on how it handles multimodal command interpretation, and its ability to be integrated into symbolic robotic frameworks for safe and explainable decision-making.</description>

      <title>Grounding Robot Policies with Visuomotor Language Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in the fields of natural language processing and computer vision have shown great potential in understanding the underlying dynamics of the world from large-scale internet data. However, translating this knowledge into robotic systems remains an open challenge, given the scarcity of human-robot interactions and the lack of large-scale datasets of real-world robotic data. Previous robot learning approaches such as behavior cloning and reinforcement learning have shown great capabilities in learning robotic skills from human demonstrations or from scratch in specific environments. However, these approaches often require task-specific demonstrations or designing complex simulation environments, which limits the development of generalizable and robust policies for new settings. Aiming to address these limitations, we propose an agent-based framework for grounding robot policies to the current context, considering the constraints of a current robot and its environment using visuomotor-grounded language guidance. The proposed framework is composed of a set of conversational agents designed for specific roles -- namely, high-level advisor, visual grounding, monitoring, and robotic agents. Given a base policy, the agents collectively generate guidance at run time to shift the action distribution of the base policy towards more desirable future states. We demonstrate that our approach can effectively guide manipulation policies to achieve significantly higher success rates both in simulation and in real-world experiments without the need for additional human demonstrations or extensive exploration.

      <title>CitDet: A Benchmark Dataset for Citrus Fruit Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05645v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we present a new dataset to advance the state of the art in detecting citrus fruit and accurately estimate yield on trees affected by the Huanglongbing (HLB) disease in orchard environments via imaging. Despite the fact that significant progress has been made in solving the fruit detection problem, the lack of publicly available datasets has complicated direct comparison of results. For instance, citrus detection has long been of interest to the agricultural research community, yet there is an absence of work, particularly involving public datasets of citrus affected by HLB. To address this issue, we enhance state-of-the-art object detection methods for use in typical orchard settings. Concretely, we provide high-resolution images of citrus trees located in an area known to be highly affected by HLB, along with high-quality bounding box annotations of citrus fruit. Fruit on both the trees and the ground are labeled to allow for identification of fruit location, which contributes to advancements in yield estimation and potential measure of HLB impact via fruit drop. The dataset consists of over 32,000 bounding box annotations for fruit instances contained in 579 high-resolution images. In summary, our contributions are the following: (i) we introduce a novel dataset along with baseline performance benchmarks on multiple contemporary object detection algorithms, (ii) we show the ability to accurately capture fruit location on tree or on ground, and finally (ii) we present a correlation of our results with yield estimations.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Unseen: Unified Promptable Panoptic Mapping with Dynamic Labeling using Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02162v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of robotics and computer vision, efficient and accurate semantic mapping remains a significant challenge due to the growing demand for intelligent machines that can comprehend and interact with complex environments. Conventional panoptic mapping methods, however, are limited by predefined semantic classes, thus making them ineffective for handling novel or unforeseen objects. In response to this limitation, we introduce the Unified Promptable Panoptic Mapping (UPPM) method. UPPM utilizes recent advances in foundation models to enable real-time, on-demand label generation using natural language prompts. By incorporating a dynamic labeling strategy into traditional panoptic mapping techniques, UPPM provides significant improvements in adaptability and versatility while maintaining high performance levels in map reconstruction. We demonstrate our approach on real-world and simulated datasets. Results show that UPPM can accurately reconstruct scenes and segment objects while generating rich semantic labels through natural language interactions. A series of ablation experiments validated the advantages of foundation model-based labeling over fixed label sets.</description>

      <title>Open-Vocabulary Action Localization with Iterative Visual Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17422v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video action localization aims to find the timings of specific actions from a long video. Although existing learning-based approaches have been successful, they require annotating videos, which comes with a considerable labor cost. This paper proposes a learning-free, open-vocabulary approach based on emerging off-the-shelf vision-language models (VLMs). The challenge stems from the fact that VLMs are neither designed to process long videos nor tailored for finding actions. We overcome these problems by extending an iterative visual prompting technique. Specifically, we sample video frames and create a concatenated image with frame index labels, making a VLM guess a frame that is considered to be closest to the start and end of the action. Iterating this process by narrowing a sampling time window results in finding the specific frames corresponding to the start and end of an action. We demonstrate that this technique yields reasonable performance, achieving results comparable to state-of-the-art zero-shot action localization. These results illustrate a practical extension of VLMs for understanding videos. A sample code is available at https://microsoft.github.io/VLM-Video-Action-Localization/.</description>

      <title>An Algorithm for Distributed Computation of Reachable Sets for Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of distributed reachable set computation for multi-agent systems (MASs) interacting over an undirected, stationary graph. A full state-feedback control input for such MASs depends no only on the current agent's state, but also of its neighbors. However, in most MAS applications, the dynamics are obscured by individual agents. This makes reachable set computation, in a fully distributed manner, a challenging problem. We utilize the ideas of polytopic reachable set approximation and generalize it to a MAS setup. We formulate the resulting sub-problems in a fully distributed manner and provide convergence guarantees for the associated computations. The proposed algorithm's convergence is proved for two cases: static MAS graphs, and time-varying graphs under certain restrictions.</description>

      <title>Towards Realistic UAV Vision-Language Navigation: Platform, Benchmark, and Methodology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing agents capable of navigating to a target location based on language instructions and visual information, known as vision-language navigation (VLN), has attracted widespread interest. Most research has focused on ground-based agents, while UAV-based VLN remains relatively underexplored. Recent efforts in UAV vision-language navigation predominantly adopt ground-based VLN settings, relying on predefined discrete action spaces and neglecting the inherent disparities in agent movement dynamics and the complexity of navigation tasks between ground and aerial environments. To address these disparities and challenges, we propose solutions from three perspectives: platform, benchmark, and methodology. To enable realistic UAV trajectory simulation in VLN tasks, we propose the OpenUAV platform, which features diverse environments, realistic flight control, and extensive algorithmic support. We further construct a target-oriented VLN dataset consisting of approximately 12k trajectories on this platform, serving as the first dataset specifically designed for realistic UAV VLN tasks. To tackle the challenges posed by complex aerial environments, we propose an assistant-guided UAV object search benchmark called UAV-Need-Help, which provides varying levels of guidance information to help UAVs better accomplish realistic VLN tasks. We also propose a UAV navigation LLM that, given multi-view images, task descriptions, and assistant instructions, leverages the multimodal understanding capabilities of the MLLM to jointly process visual and textual information, and performs hierarchical trajectory generation. The evaluation results of our method significantly outperform the baseline models, while there remains a considerable gap between our results and those achieved by human operators, underscoring the challenge presented by the UAV-Need-Help task.</description>
