      <title>Evolution of the electrical characteristics of the ATLAS18 ITk strip sensors with HL-LHC radiation exposure range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of the study is to evaluate the evolution of the performance of the new ATLAS Inner-Tracker (ITk) strip sensors as a function of radiation exposure, to ensure the proper operation of the upgraded detector during the lifetime of the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). Full-size ATLAS ITk Barrel Short-Strip (SS) sensors with final layout design, ATLAS18SS, have been irradiated with neutrons and gammas, to confirm the results obtained with prototypes and miniature sensors during the development phase. The irradiations cover a wide range of fluences and doses that ITk will experience, going from 1e13 neq/cm2 and 0.49 Mrad, to 1.6e15 neq/cm2 and 80 Mrad. The split irradiation enables a proper combination of fluence and dose values of the HL-LHC, including a 1.5 safety factor. A complete electrical characterization of the key sensor parameters before and after irradiation is presented, studying the leakage current, bulk capacitance, single-strip and inter-strip characteristics. The results confirm the fulfilment of the ATLAS specifications throughout the whole experiment. The study of a wide range of fluences and doses also allows to obtain detailed results, such as the frequency dependence of the bulk capacitance measurements for highly irradiated sensors, or the evolution of the punch-through protection and inter-strip resistance with radiation.</description>

      <title>Post-irradiation examination of a prototype tantalum-clad target for the Beam Dump Facility at CERN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Beam Dump Facility (BDF) is a planned fixed-target installation in CERN's North Area, set to start operating in 2031. A proton beam of 400 GeV/c will be delivered in 1 s pulses of 4e13 protons every 7.2 s, amounting to 4e19 protons on target (PoT) per year, with an average thermal power deposition of 305 kW. The experiment requires high-Z and high-density materials and involves challenging thermomechanical conditions; hence, a water-cooled refractory metal core is proposed. To prevent corrosion and erosion, the target materials - tungsten and a molybdenum-based alloy, TZM-, are clad with a tantalum alloy using hot isostatic pressing. To verify the reliability of the target design and manufacturing process, a reduced-scale prototype target was manufactured and irradiated with 2.4e16 PoT in 2018. This paper presents the findings of the post-irradiation examination (PIE) conducted 2.5 years later. The PIE consisted of non-destructive and destructive activities, including film imaging, microscopy, metrology, ultrasonic testing, microstructural analysis, and mechanical and thermal characterization. No irradiation effects resulting from thermal stresses, such as geometrical changes or cracks in the cladding, were observed, and it was determined that the bonding between the core and cladding materials was robust. Moreover, no changes were detected in the microstructures or mechanical properties of the bulk materials. In conclusion, the robustness of the target baseline design and manufacturing process was confirmed, validating its suitability for operating under the desired conditions. Nonetheless, the observed brittleness of sintered tungsten indicates a potential area for improvement to enhance the lifetime of the BDF target. Overall, the examinations provided valuable insights into the performance of the prototype and indicated potential refinements for the future BDF target complex.</description>

      <title>The calibrations of DAMPE $\gamma$-ray effective area</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) is a cosmic-ray detector as well as a pair-converting $\gamma$-ray telescope. The effective area, reflecting the geometrical cross-section area, the $\gamma$-ray conversion probability and the photon selection efficiency, is important in the $\gamma$-ray analyses. In the work, we find a significant time variation in the effective area, as large as $\sim -4\%/{\rm yr}$ at 2 GeV for the high-energy trigger. We derive the data-based correction factors to the effective areas and apply corrections to both the effective areas and the exposure maps. The calibrated exposure can be $\sim 12\%$ smaller than the Monte Carlo one on average at 2 GeV. The calibration is further verified using the observation of the Vela pulsar, showing the spectral parameters with the correction are more consistent with those in the Fermi-LAT catalog than the ones without correction. All the corrections are now implemented in the latest version of the DAMPE $\gamma$-ray analysis toolkit DmpST.</description>

      <title>Megahertz cycling of ultrafast structural dynamics enabled by nanosecond thermal dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light-matter interactions are of fundamental scientific and technological interest. Ultrafast electron microscopy and diffraction with combined femtosecond-nanometer resolution elucidate the laser-induced dynamics in structurally heterogeneous systems. These measurements, however, remain challenging due to the brightness limitation of pulsed electron sources, leading to an experimental trade-off between resolution and contrast. Higher signals without compromising the electron beam coherence can be achieved by enhanced duty cycles, thus far limited to few-kHz repetition rates by the cooling times in thin-film specimens. Here, we combine nanometric electron-beam probing with sample support structures tailored to accommodate rapid thermal relaxation. A charge-density wave (CDW) phase transformation allows us to quantify the mean temperature increase induced by pulsed laser illumination. Varying the excitation fluence and repetition rate, we gauge the impact of excitation confinement and efficient dissipation on the thermal relaxation of different sample designs. In particular, a thermally optimized support can dissipate average laser intensities of up to \SI{200}{\micro\watt\per\um^2} within a few nanoseconds, allowing for reversible driving and probing of the CDW transition at a repetition rate of \SI{2}{\MHz}. Sample designs tailored to ultrafast measurement schemes will thus extend the capabilities of electron diffraction and microscopy, enabling high-resolution investigations of structural dynamics.</description>

      <title>Cascade switching current detectors based on arrays of Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cascade multiplication is a common technique to enhance the sensitivity of photon detectors. In this study, we demonstrate novel cascade-amplified superconducting detectors utilizing arrays of Josephson junctions. The mutual coupling between junctions induces avalanche-like switching of multiple junctions upon photon absorption, leading to cascade amplification of the readout voltage. We present two prototypes featuring either low-Tc linear Nb/NbxSi1-x/Nb arrays, or high-Tc stacked intrinsic Josephson junctions. Both devices exhibit clear antenna effects in microwave directivities, indicating good impedance matching and absorption efficiency. The combination of high absorption efficiency and large cascade amplification has the potential to produce broadband THz sensors with sensitivity exceeding 10^13 V/W.</description>

      <title>Performance of a radio-frequency two-photon atomic magnetometer in different magnetic induction measurement geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurements monitoring the inductive coupling between oscillating radio-frequency magnetic fields and objects of interest create versatile platforms for non-destructive testing. The benefits of ultra low frequency measurements, i.e., below 3 kHz, are sometimes outweighed by the fundamental and technical difficulties related to operating pick-up coils or other field sensors in this frequency range. Inductive measurements with the detection based on a two-photon interaction in rf atomic magnetometers address some of these issues, as the sensor gains an uplift in its operational frequency. The developments reported here integrate the fundamental and applied aspects of the two-photon process in magnetic induction measurements. In this paper, all spectral components of the two-photon process are identified, which result from the non-linear interactions between the rf fields and atoms. A method for the retrieval of the two-photon phase information, which is critical for inductive measurements, is also demonstrated. Furthermore, a self-compensation configuration is introduced, whereby high contrast measurements of defects can be obtained due to the sensor's insensitivity to the primary field, including using simplified instrumentation for this configuration by producing two rf fields with a single rf coil.</description>
