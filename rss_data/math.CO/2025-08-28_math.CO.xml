      <title>Delta-system method: a survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1960 Erd\H os and Rado published a paper that, in retrospect, became one of the most influential papers in extremal set theory. They proved a result of Ramsey theoretic flavour, stating that in any sufficiently large family of sets of bounded size there is a homogeneous substructure, called a $\Delta$-system (also known under the name of a sunflower). For many qualitative results in Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science, this has become a very powerful tool to analyze complex set families. Extremal set theory flourished in the 1970's--80's, and many exciting developments happened then. One of them was the development of the $\Delta$-system method in the works of Frankl and F\"uredi. In this survey, we try to give a concise picture of this method starting from its early stages and to the modern day. We also tried to present the proofs of most of the key results. On top of this, we survey the literature on the problems that the Delta-systems was applied to.</description>

      <title>Chromatic quasisymmetric functions for signed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1995, Stanley introduced the chromatic symmetric function of a graph, which specializes to its chromatic polynomial, and which has been the focus of intense research. In 2017, Shareshian, Wachs, and Ellzey defined a refinement of this function for a directed graph, that appears to be in $QSym$, the algebra of quasisymmetric functions, which is of great interest in algebraic combinatorics. Our goal is to extend this work to signed graphs, taking into account the perspective of the hyperplane arrangement associated with a signed graph, developed by Zaslavsky. We introduce the signed chromatic quasisymmetric invariant, and obtain structural properties. As a consequence, we define and study $SQSym$, the algebra of signed quasisymmetric functions.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial proof of a permuted basement Macdonald polynomial identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A well-known and fundamental property of the Macdonald polynomials $P_\lambda(x;q,t)$ is their invariance under the transformation sending $(q,t)$ to $(q^{-1},t^{-1})$. Recently, Concha and Lapointe showed that this property extends in an interesting, nontrivial way to an identity for partially symmetric Macdonald polynomials. Their identity played a key role in the work of Bechtloff Weising and Orr linking partially symmetric Macdonald polynomials to parabolic flag Hilbert schemes. In this paper, we refine the Concha-Lapointe identity to a sub-family of Alexandersson's permuted basement Macdonald polynomials and give a combinatorial proof of the refined identity. We show also that the Concha-Lapointe identity is equivalent to the assertion that (normalized) partially symmetric Macdonald polynomials are fixed under the Kazhdan-Lusztig involution.</description>

      <title>Three Generalizations of Erd\H{o}s Szekeres: $k$-Modal Subsequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Erd\H{o}s and Szekeres showed that given a permutation $p$ of $[n]$, and the sequence defined by \newline $(p(1), p(2), \ldots, p(n))$, there exists either a decreasing or increasing subsequence, not necessarily contiguous, of length at least $\sqrt{n}$. Fan Chung considered subsequences that can have at most one change of direction, i.e. an increasing and then decreasing subsequence, or a decreasing and then increasing subsequence. She called these unimodal subsequences, and showed there exists a unimodal subsequence of length at least $\sqrt{3n}$, up to some constants \cite{chung}. She conjectured that a permutation of $n$ contains a $k$-modal (at most $k$ changes in direction) subsequence of length at least $\sqrt{(2k+1)n}$ up to some constants. Zijian Xu proved this conjecture in 2024 \cite{xu}, and we will provide another substantially different proof using "sophisticated labeling arguments" instead of "underlying poset structures behind k-modal subsequences." We also show that there exists an increasing first $k$-modal subsequence of length at least $\sqrt{2kn}$.</description>

      <title>Results on proper conflict-free list coloring of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ and a mapping $f:V(G) \to \mathbb{N}$, an $f$-list assignment of $G$ is a function that maps each $v \in V(G)$ to a set of at least $f(v)$ colors. For an $f$-list assignment $L$ of a graph $G$, a proper conflict-free $L$-coloring of $G$ is a proper coloring $\phi$ of $G$ such that $\phi(v) \in L(v)$ for every vertex $v\in V(G)$ and $v$ has a color that appears precisely once at its neighborhood for every non-isolated vertex $v\in V(G)$. We say that $G$ is proper conflict-free $f$-choosable if for any $f$-list assignment $L$ of $G$, there exists a proper conflict-free $L$-coloring of $G$. For a non-negative integer $k$, we say that $G$ is \emph{proper conflict-free $({\rm degree}+k)$-choosable} if $G$ is proper conflict-free $f$-choosable where $f$ is a mapping with $f(v)= d_G(v)+k$ for every vertex $v\in V(G)$.
  Motivated by degree-choosability of graphs, we investigate the proper conflict-free $({\rm degree}+k)$-choosability of graphs, especially for cases $k=1,2,3$. As the 5-cycle is not proper conflict-free $({\rm degree}+2)$-choosable and it is the only such graph we know, it is possible that every connected graph other than the 5-cycle is proper conflict-free $({\rm degree}+2)$-choosable and thus every graph is proper conflict-free $({\rm degree}+3)$-choosable. To support these, we show that every connected graph with maximum degree at most 3 distinct from the 5-cycle is proper conflict-free $(\text{degree}+2)$-choosable, and that $S(G)$ is proper conflict-free $(\text{degree}+2)$-choosable for every graph $G$, where $S(G)$ is a graph obtained from $G$ by subdividing each edge once. Furthermore, by adapting the technique of DP-colorings, we prove that every graph with maximum degree at most $4$ is proper conflict-free $({\rm degree}+3)$-choosable.</description>

      <title>Normal 6-edge-colorings of cubic graphs with oddness 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A normal edge-coloring of a cubic graph is a proper edge-coloring, in which every edge is adjacent to edges colored with four distinct colors or to edges colored with two distinct colors. It is conjectured that $5$ colors suffice for a normal edge-coloring of any bridgeless cubic graph and this statement is equivalent to the Petersen Coloring Conjecture.
  In this paper, we extend the result of Mazzuoccolo and Mkrtchyan (Normal 6-edge-colorings of some bridgeless cubic graphs, Discrete Appl. Math. 277 (2020), 252--262), who proved that every cycle permutation graph admits a normal edge-coloring with at most $6$ colors. In particular, we show that every cubic graph with oddness $2$ admits a normal edge-coloring with at most $6$ colors.</description>

      <title>On the extrema of the mean subtree order of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been conjectured that the minimum and maximum of the mean subtree order among connected graphs of order $n$ are attained by the path $P_n$ and clique $K_n$, respectively. Extending ideas due to Haslegrave and Vince, we confirm that the minimum is indeed attained by $P_n$. On the other hand, we discuss different approaches (both promising and flawed) that could lead to a proof of the extremality of $K_n$.</description>

      <title>Neighborly boxes and strings with jokers; constructions and asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study families of axis-aligned boxes in a $d$-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$ whose placement is restricted by bounds on the dimension of their pairwise intersections. More specifically, two such boxes in $\mathbb{R}^d$ are said to be \emph{$k$-neighborly} if their intersection has dimension at least $d-k$ and at most $d-1$. The maximum number of pairwise $k$-neighborly boxes in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is denoted by $n(k,d)$. It is known that $n(k,d)=\Theta(d^k)$, for fixed $1\leqslant k\leqslant d$, however, exact formulas are known only in three cases: $k=1$, $k=d-1$, and $k=d$. In particular, the equality $n(1,d)=d+1$ is equivalent to the famous theorem of Graham and Pollak concerning partitions of complete graphs into complete bipartite graphs.
  In our main result we give a new construction of families of $k$-neighborly boxes which improves the lower bound for $n(k,d)$ when $k$ is close to $d$. Together with some recent upper bounds on $n(k,d)$, it gives the asymptotic equality $n(d-s,d)\thicksim\frac{2^s+1}{2^{s+1}}\cdot2^d$, for every fixed $s\leqslant d/2$. In our constructions we use a familiar interpretation of the problem in the language of Hamming cubes represented by binary strings with a special blank symbol, called \emph{joker}.</description>

      <title>Uniform Tur\'an density beyond 3-graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the 1980s, Erd\H{o}s and S\'os first introduced an extremal problem on hypergraphs with density constraints. Given an $r$-uniform hypergraph $F$ (or $r$-graph for short), its uniform Tur\'an density $\pi_u(F)$ is the smallest value of $d$ in which every hypergraph $H$ in which every linear-sized subhypergraph of $H$ has edge density at least $d$ contains $F$ as a subgraph. The first non-zero value of $\pi_u(F)$ was not found until 30 years later.
  Progress in studying the set of values of the uniform Tur\'an density of $r$-graphs has been uneven in terms of $r$: to this day there are infinitely many non-zero values known for $r=3$, a single non-zero value known for $r=4$ and none for $r\geq 5$. In this paper we obtain the first explicit values of $\pi_u$ for all uniformities, by proving that for every $r\geq 3$ there exist $r$-graphs $F$ with $\pi_u(F)=1/4$ and with $\pi_u(F)=\binom{r}{2}^{-\binom{r}{2}}$.</description>

      <title>Classification of flag-transitive $2$-$(v, k, \lambda)$ designs with alternating group $A_n$($n \le 10$) as socle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the classification of all flag-transitive point-primitive non-trivial $2$-$(v, k, \lambda)$ designs with the alternating group $A_n$($n \le 10$) as the socle of their automorphism groups, and 87 different designs are obtained up to isomorphism. The results of this study further improve the classification theory of designs under the action of almost simple groups, and provide reference for the follow-up study of similar problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study VERSs (vertex and edge replacement systems) as a technology of graph expansions. We consider its history graph, an augmented tree that records each graph expansion, and we provide sufficient conditions under which it is hyperbolic. When hyperbolic, its Gromov boundary is what we call the limit space of the VERS. We provide three examples from different areas of mathematics: Schreier graphs and limit spaces of finitely generated contracting self-similar groups, injective post-critically finite iterated function systems and limit spaces of edge replacement systems.</description>

      <title>Enumerating submonoids of finite commutative monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite commutative monoid $M$, we show that submonoids of $M\times [n]$ - where $[n] = \{0,1,\ldots,n\}$ is equipped with the max operation $\vee$ - may be enumerated via the transfer matrix method. When $M$ is also idempotent, we show that there are finitely many integers $\lambda$ and rational numbers $b_\lambda$ (only depending on $M$) such that the number of submonoids of $M\times [n]$ is $\sum_\lambda b_\lambda\lambda^n$. This answers a question of Knuth regarding ternary (and higher order) max-closed relations, and has applications to the enumeration of saturated transfer systems in equivariant infinite loop space theory.</description>

      <title>Beyond Nash-Williams: Counterexamples to Clique Decomposition Thresholds for All Cliques Larger than Triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central open question in extremal design theory is Nash-Williams' Conjecture from 1970 that every $K_3$-divisible graph on $n$ vertices (for $n$ large enough) with minimum degree at least $3n/4$ has a $K_3$-decomposition. A folklore generalization of Nash-Williams' Conjecture extends this to all $q\ge 4$ by positing that every $K_q$-divisible graph on $n$ vertices (for $n$ large enough) with minimum degree at least $\left(1-\frac{1}{q+1}\right)n$ has a $K_q$-decomposition. We disprove this conjecture for all $q\ge 4$; namely, we show that for each $q\ge 4$, there exists $c &gt; 1$ such that there exist infinitely many $K_q$-divisible graphs $G$ with minimum degree at least $\left(1-\frac{1}{c\cdot(q+1)}\right)v(G)$ and no $K_q$-decomposition; indeed we construct them admitting no fractional $K_q$-decomposition thus disproving the fractional relaxation of this conjecture. Our result also disproves the more general partite version. Indeed, we even show the folklore conjecture is off by a multiplicative factor by showing that for every $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ and every large enough integer $q$, there exist infinitely many $K_q$-divisible graphs $G$ with minimum degree at least $\bigg(1-\frac{1}{\left(\frac{1+\sqrt{2}}{2}-\varepsilon\right)\cdot (q+1)}\bigg)v(G)$ with no (fractional) $K_q$-decomposition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computers and algorithms play an ever-increasing role in obtaining new results in graph theory. In this survey, we present a broad range of techniques used in computer-assisted graph theory, including the exhaustive generation of all pairwise non-isomorphic graphs within a given class, the use of searchable databases containing graphs and invariants as well as other established and emerging algorithmic paradigms. We cover approaches based on mixed integer linear programming, semidefinite programming, dynamic programming, SAT solving, metaheuristics and machine learning. The techniques are illustrated with numerous detailed results covering several important subareas of graph theory such as extremal graph theory, graph coloring, structural graph theory, spectral graph theory, regular graphs, topological graph theory, special sets in graphs, algebraic graph theory and chemical graph theory. We also present some smaller new results that demonstrate how readily a computer-assisted graph theory approach can be applied once the appropriate tools have been developed.</description>

      <title>On Generalized Rickart $*$-rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A ring $R$ with an involution $*$ is a generalized Rickart $*$-ring if for all $x\in R$ the right annihilator of $x^n$ is generated by a projection for some positive integer $n$ depending on $x$. In this work, we introduce generalized right projection of an element in a $*$-ring and prove that every element in a generalized Rickart $*$-ring has generalized right projection. Various characterizations of generalized Rickart $*$-rings are obtained. We introduce the concept of generalized weakly Rickart $*$-ring and provide a characterization of generalized Rickart $*$-rings in terms of weakly generalized Rickart $*$-rings. It is shown that generalized Rickart $*$-rings satisfy the parallelogram law. A sufficient condition is established for partial comparability in generalized Rickart $*$-rings. Furthermore, it is proved that pair of projections in a generalized Rickart $*$-ring possess orthogonal decomposition.</description>

      <title>Tur\'an's theorem for Dowling geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dowling geometry $Q_n(\Gamma)$, where $\Gamma$ is a finite group, is a matroid that generalizes the complete-graphic matroid $M(K_{n+1})$. We determine the maximum size of an $N$-free submatroid of $Q_n(\Gamma)$ for various choices of $N$, including subgeometries $Q_m(\Gamma')$, lines $U_{2,\ell}$, and graphic matroids $M(H)$. When the group $\Gamma$ is trivial and $N=M(K_t)$, this problem reduces to Tur\'{a}n's classical result in extremal graph theory. We show that when $\Gamma$ is nontrivial, a complex dependence on $\Gamma$ emerges, even when $N=M(K_4)$.</description>

      <title>Falling stars: a fall-decorated rational shuffle theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we formulate a rational analog of the fall Delta theorem and the Delta square conjecture.
  We find a new dinv statistic on fall-decorated paths on a $(m+k) \times (n+k)$ rectangle that simultaneously extends the previously known dinv statistics on decorated square objects and non-decorated rectangular objects.
  We prove a symmetric function formula for the $q,t$-generating function of fall-decorated rectangular Dyck paths as a skewing operator applied to $e_{m,n+km}$ and, conditionally on the rectangular paths conjecture, an analog formula for fall-decorated rectangular paths.</description>

      <title>Vertex-Based Localization of generalized Tur\'{a}n Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a family of graphs. A graph is called $\mathcal{F}$-free if it does not contain any member of $\mathcal{F}$. Generalized Tur\'{a}n problems aim to maximize the number of copies of a graph $H$ in an $n$-vertex $\mathcal{F}$-free graph. This maximum is denoted by $ex(n, H, \mathcal{F})$. When $H \cong K_2$, it is simply denoted by $ex(n,F)$. Erd\H{o}s and Gallai established the bounds $ex(n, P_{k+1}) \leq \frac{n(k-1)}{2}$ and $ex(n, C_{\geq k+1}) \leq \frac{k(n-1)}{2}$. This was later extended by Luo \cite{luo2018maximum}, who showed that $ex(n, K_s, P_{k+1}) \leq \frac{n}{k} \binom{k}{s}$ and $ex(n, K_s, C_{\geq k+1}) \leq \frac{n-1}{k-1} \binom{k}{s}$. Let $N(G,K_s)$ denote the number of copies of $K_s$ in $G$. In this paper, we use the vertex-based localization framework, introduced in \cite{adak2025vertex}, to generalize Luo's bounds. In a graph $G$, for each $v \in V(G)$, define $p(v)$ to be the length of the longest path that contains $v$. We show that \[N(G,K_s) \leq \sum_{v \in V(G)} \frac{1}{p(v)+1}{p(v)+1\choose s} = \frac{1}{s}\sum_{v \in V(G)}{p(v) \choose s-1}\] We strengthen the cycle bound from \cite{luo2018maximum} as follows: In graph $G$, for each $v \in V(G)$, let $c(v)$ be the length of the longest cycle that contains $v$, or $2$ if $v$ is not part of any cycle. We prove that \[N(G,K_s) \leq \left(\sum_{v\in V(G)}\frac{1}{c(v)-1}{c(v) \choose s}\right) - \frac{1}{c(u)-1}{c(u) \choose s}\] where $c(u)$ denotes the circumference of $G$. We provide full proofs for the cases $s = 1$ and $s \geq 3$, while the case $s = 2$ follows from the result in \cite{adak2025vertex}. \newline Furthermore, we characterize the class of extremal graphs that attain equality for these bounds.</description>

      <title>Localized Clique Bounds in Bounded-Degree and Bounded-Path Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a family of graphs. A graph is said to be $\mathcal{F}$-free if it contains no member of $\mathcal{F}$. The generalized Tur\'{a}n number $ex(n,H,\mathcal{F})$ denotes the maximum number of copies of a graph $H$ in an $n$-vertex $\mathcal{F}$-free graph, while the generalized edge Tur\'{a}n number $mex(m,H,\mathcal{F})$ denotes the maximum number of copies of $H$ in an $m$-edge $\mathcal{F}$-free graph.
  It is well known that if a graph has maximum degree $d$, then it is $K_{1,d+1}$-free. Wood \cite{wood} proved that $ex(n,K_t,K_{1,d+1}) \leq \frac{n}{d+1}\binom{d+1}{t}$. More recently, Chakraborty and Chen \cite{CHAKRABORTI2024103955} established analogous bounds for graphs with bounded maximum path length: $mex(m,K_t,P_{r+1}) \leq \frac{m}{\binom{r}{2}}\binom{r}{t}$.
  In this paper, we improve these bounds using the localization technique, based on suitably defined local parameters. Furthermore, we characterize the extremal graphs attaining these improved bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By definition, the edge-connectivity of a connected graph is no larger than its minimum degree. In this paper, we prove that the edge connectivity of a finite connected graph with non-negative Lin-Lu-Yau curvature is equal to its minimum degree. This answers an open question of Chen, Liu and You. Notice that our conclusion would be false if we did not require the graph to be finite. We actually classify all connected graphs with non-negative Lin-Lu-Yau curvature and edge-connectivity smaller than their minimum degree. In particular, they are all infinite.</description>

      <title>The Ordered Zeckendorf Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and analyze the ordered Zeckendorf game, a novel combinatorial two-player game inspired by Zeckendorf's Theorem, which guarantees a unique decomposition of every positive integer as a sum of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers. Building on the original Zeckendorf game\ -- previously studied in the context of unordered multisets\ -- we impose a new constraint: all moves must respect the order of summands. The result is a richer and more nuanced strategic landscape that significantly alters game dynamics.
  Unlike the classical version, where Player 2 has a dominant strategy for all $n &gt; 2$, our ordered variant reveals a more balanced and unpredictable structure. In particular, we find that Player 1 wins for nearly all values $n \leq 25$, with a single exception at $n = 18$. This shift in strategic outcomes is driven by our game's key features: adjacency constraints that limit allowable merges and splits to neighboring terms, and the introduction of a switching move that reorders pairs.
  We prove that the game always terminates in the Zeckendorf decomposition\ -- now in ascending order\ -- by constructing a strictly decreasing monovariant. We further establish bounds on game complexity: the shortest possible game has length exactly $n - Z(n)$, where $Z(n)$ is the number of summands in the Zeckendorf decomposition of $n$, while the longest game exhibits quadratic growth, with $M(n) \sim \frac{n^2}{2}$ as $n \to \infty$.
  Empirical simulations suggest that random game trajectories exhibit log-normal convergence in their move distributions. Overall, the ordered Zeckendorf game enriches the landscape of number-theoretic games, posing new algorithmic challenges and offering fertile ground for future exploration into strategic complexity, probabilistic behavior, and generalizations to other recurrence relations.</description>

      <title>Decompositions of augmentation varieties via weaves and rulings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The braid variety of a positive braid and the augmentation variety of a Legendrian link both admit decompositions coming from weaves and rulings, respectively. We prove that these decompositions agree under an isomorphism between the braid variety and the augmentation variety. We also prove that both decompositions coincide with a Deodhar decomposition and another decomposition coming from the microlocal theory of sheaves. Our proof relies on a detailed comparison between weaves and Morse complex sequences. Among other things, we show that the cluster variables of the maximal cluster torus of the augmentation variety can be computed from the Legendrian via Morse complex sequences.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the binomial edge ring associated with the skew Ferrers diagram. By employing Sagbi basis theory, we construct a quadratic Gr\"{o}bner basis for its defining ideal. As an application, we prove that this ring is a Koszul, Cohen-Macaulay, normal domain.

      <title>A map between arborifications of multiple zeta values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Arborified multiple zeta values are a generalization of multiple zeta values associated with rooted trees. There are two types of decorated rooted trees, corresponding respectively to the series and the integral expressions. Manchon introduces the contracting arborification (resp. the simple arborification), which is maps from the BCK Hopf algebras of the decorated rooted trees corresponding to the series expression (resp. the integral expression) to the non-commutative polynomial algebras of the set $\mathbb{N}$ (resp. the set $\{0,1\}$). There is a natural map between the two non-commutative polynomial algebras. Manchon posed the question of finding a natural map between the two BCK Hopf algebras that would make the diagram commutative. In this paper, we consider planar rooted trees and use a recursive method to construct such a map between the two BCK Hopf algebras, making the diagram commutative.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a generalized class of weighted $k$-regular partitions defined by \[ \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_{k, r_1, r_2}(n) q^n = \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(1 - q^{nk})^{r_1}}{(1 - q^n)^{r_2}}, \] which extends the classical $k$-regular partition function $b_k(n)$. We establish new infinite families of Ramanujan-type congruences, divisibility results, and positive-density prime sets for which $c_{k, r_1, r_2}(n)$ vanishes modulo a given prime. These results generalize recent work on $5$-regular partitions and reveal deeper modular and combinatorial structures underlying weighted partition functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{P}$ be a chiral polytope with type $\{k_1, k_2\}$ and $G=Aut(\mathcal{P})$. Suppose $|G|=2p^m$, where $k_1, k_2\geq 3$ and $p$ is an odd prime. Let $P$ be a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$. We prove that $G \cong P \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2$, $d(P)=2$, $P' \ne 1$(so $m \geq 3$) and up to duality, $\{k_1, k_2\}=\{p^{l_1}, 2p^{l_2}\}$ for some integral $l_1, l_2 \geq 1$. Moreover, we show that $\mathcal{P}$ is tight $(k_1k_2=2p^m$) if and only if $P$ is metacyclic group. Furthermore, if $m=3$ or $4$, then $\mathcal{P}$ must be tight, and if $m \geq 5$, where either $m$ is odd, or $m$ is even and $m \geq p+3$, there exists a non-tight chiral polytope $\mathcal{P}$.</description>

In particular, we focus on deriving general bounds for arbitrary transitive groups, and on the asymptotic behaviour of certain families of primitive groups.</description>

      <title>Sharp Online Hardness for Large Balanced Independent Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the algorithmic problem of finding large $\gamma$-balanced independent sets in dense random bipartite graphs; an independent set is $\gamma$-balanced if a $\gamma$ proportion of its vertices lie on one side of the bipartition. In the sparse regime, Perkins and Wang established tight bounds within the low-degree polynomial (LDP) framework, showing a factor-$1/(1-\gamma)$ statistical-computational gap via the Overlap Gap Property (OGP) framework tailored for stable algorithms. However, these techniques do not appear to extend to the dense setting. For the related large independent set problem in dense random graph, the best known algorithm is an online greedy procedure that is inherently unstable, and LDP algorithms are conjectured to fail even in the "easy" regime where greedy succeeds. We show that the largest $\gamma$-balanced independent set in dense random bipartite graphs has size $\alpha:=\frac{\log_b n}{\gamma(1-\gamma)}$ whp, where $n$ is the size of each bipartition, $p$ is the edge probability, and $b=1/(1-p)$. We design an online algorithm that achieves $(1-\epsilon)(1-\gamma)\alpha$ whp for any $\epsilon&gt;0$. We complement this with a sharp lower bound, showing that no online algorithm can achieve $(1+\epsilon)(1-\gamma)\alpha$ with nonnegligible probability. Our results suggest that the same factor-$1/(1-\gamma)$ gap is also present in the dense setting, supporting its conjectured universality. While the classical greedy procedure on $G(n,p)$ is straightforward, our algorithm is more intricate: it proceeds in two stages, incorporating a stopping time and suitable truncation to ensure that $\gamma$-balancedness-a global constraint-is met despite operating with limited information. Our lower bound utilizes the OGP framework; we build on a recent refinement of this framework for online models and extend it to the bipartite setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Under mild assumptions, we show that a connected weighted graph $G$ with lower Ricci curvature bound $K&gt;0$ in the sense of Bakry-\'Emery and the $d$-th non-zero Laplacian eigenvalue $\lambda_d$ close to $K$, with $d$ being the maximal combinatorial vertex degree of $G$, has an underlying combinatorial structure of the $d$-dimensional hypercube graph. Moreover, such a graph $G$ is close in terms of Frobenius distance to a properly weighted hypercube graph. Furthermore, we establish their closeness in terms of eigenfunctions. Our results can be viewed as discrete analogies of the almost rigidity theorem and quantitative Obata's theorem on Rimennian manifolds.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for every integer $n &gt; 0$ and for every alphabet $\Sigma_k$ of size $k \geq 3$, there exists a necklace of length $n$ whose Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) is completely unclustered, i.e., it consists of exactly $n$ runs with no two consecutive equal symbols. These words represent the worst-case behavior of the BWT for clustering, since the number of BWT runs is maximized. We also establish a lower bound on their number. This contrasts with the binary case, where the existence of infinitely many completely unclustered BWTs is still an open problem, related to Artin's conjecture on primitive roots.</description>

      <title>Lattice path combinatorics in superconformal Yang-Mills theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of observables in four-dimensional superconformal Yang--Mills theories which, in the planar limit at finite 't Hooft coupling, can be expressed as determinants of semi-infinite matrices built from Bessel functions. This determinant representation points to an underlying integrable structure, which we make explicit by showing that the observables satisfy a nonlinear differential-difference equation. We argue that the solution to this equation admits an expansion in terms of iterated Chen integrals of uniform transcendental weight. Remarkably, the coefficients in this expansion are universal positive integers, independent of the particular observable, suggesting a hidden combinatorial origin. Building on this observation, we show that the resulting expressions possess a natural interpretation in enumerative combinatorics: they coincide with the partition function (or generating function) of an ensemble of lattice paths constrained to a nontrivial domain. This correspondence extends and generalizes the classical Dyck paths to a richer family of path ensembles relevant in gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Planar percolation and the loop O(n) model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a large class of site percolation processes on any planar graph contains either zero or infinitely many infinite connected components. The assumptions that we require are: tail triviality, positive association (FKG) and that the set of open vertices is stochastically dominated by the set of closed ones. This covers the case of Bernoulli site percolation at parameter $p\leq 1/2$ and resolves Conjecture 8 from the work of Benjamini and Schramm from 1996. Our result also implies that $p_c\geq 1/2$ for any invariantly amenable unimodular random rooted planar graph.
  Furthermore, we apply our statement to the loop O(n) model on the hexagonal lattice and confirm a part of the phase diagram conjectured by Nienhuis in 1982: the existence of infinitely many loops around every face whenever $n\in [1,2]$ and $x\in [1/\sqrt{2},1]$. The point $n=2,x=1/\sqrt{2}$ is conjectured to be critical. This is the first instance that this behavior has been proven in such a large region of parameters. In a big portion of this region, the loop O(n) model has no known FKG representation. We apply our percolation result to quenched distributions that can be described as divide and color models.</description>

      <title>On the non-existence of perfect codes in the sum-rank metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study perfect codes in the sum-rank metric, a generalization of both the Hamming and rank metrics relevant in multishot network coding and space-time coding. A perfect code attains equality in the sphere-packing bound, corresponding to a partition of the ambient space into disjoint metric balls. While perfect codes in the Hamming and rank metrics are completely classified, the existence of nontrivial perfect codes in the sum-rank metric remains largely open. In this paper, we investigate linear perfect codes in the sum-rank metric. We analyze the geometry of balls and derive bounds on their volumes, showing how the sphere-packing bound applies. For two-block spaces, we determine explicit parameter constraints for the existence of perfect codes. For multiple-block spaces, we establish non-existence results for various ranges of minimum distance, divisibility conditions, and code dimensions. We further provide computational evidence based on congruence conditions imposed by the volume of metric balls.</description>

      <title>Measuring Ransomware Lateral Movement Susceptibility via Privilege-Weighted Adjacency Matrix Exponentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ransomware impact hinges on how easily an intruder can move laterally and spread to the maximum number of assets. We present a graph-theoretic method to measure lateral-movement susceptibility and estimate blast radius. We build a directed multigraph where vertices represent assets and edges represent reachable services (e.g., RDP/SSH) between them. We model lateral movement as a probabilistic process using a pivot potential factor $\pi(s)$ for each service. This allows us to iteratively compute a $K$-hop compromise probability matrix that captures how compromise propagates through the network. Metrics derived from this model include: (1) Lateral-Movement Susceptibility (LMS$_K$): the average probability of a successful lateral movement between any two assets (0-1 scale); and (2) Blast-Radius Estimate (BRE$_K$): the expected percentage of assets compromised in an average attack scenario. Interactive control (SSH 22, RDP 3389) gets higher $\pi(s)$ than app-only ports (MySQL 3306, MSSQL 1433), which seldom enable pivoting without an RCE. Across anonymized enterprise snapshots, pruning high-$\pi(s)$ edges yields the largest LMS$_K$/BRE$_K$ drop, aligning with CISA guidance, MITRE ATT\&amp;CK (TA0008: Lateral Movement), and NIST SP~800-207. The framework evaluates (micro)segmentation and helps prioritize controls that reduce lateral movement susceptibility and shrink blast radius.</description>

      <title>Blow-up lemmas for sparse graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00622</link>
      <description>arXiv:1612.00622v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The blow-up lemma states that a system of super-regular pairs contains all bounded degree spanning graphs as subgraphs that embed into a corresponding system of complete pairs. This lemma has far-reaching applications in extremal combinatorics.
  We prove sparse analogues of the blow-up lemma for subgraphs of random and of pseudorandom graphs. Our main results are the following three sparse versions of the blow-up lemma: one for embedding spanning graphs with maximum degree $\Delta$ in subgraphs of $G(n,p)$ with $p=C(\log n/n)^{1/\Delta}$; one for embedding spanning graphs with maximum degree $\Delta$ and degeneracy $D$ in subgraphs of $G(n,p)$ with $p=C_\Delta\big(\log n/n\big)^{1/(2D+1)}$; and one for embedding spanning graphs with maximum degree $\Delta$ in $(p,cp^{\max(4,(3\Delta+1)/2)}n)$-bijumbled graphs.
  We also consider various applications of these lemmas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the cliques of maximal size in the confluence graph of an arbitrary unital of order $q&gt;2$ have size $q^2$, and that these cliques are the pencils of all blocks through a given point. This solves the Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado problem for all unitals. We also determine all maximal cliques of the confluence graph of the Hermitian unitals. As an application, we show that the confluence graph of an arbitrary unital unambiguously determines the unital. Along the way, we show that each linear space with $q^2$ points such that the sizes of both point rows and line pencils are bounded above by $q+1$ embeds in a projective plane of order $q$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given any $m$-dimensional complex representation $\eta$ of a finite group $G$ and any highest weight representation $V^{\lambda}$ of $\mathrm{GL}_{nm}(\mathbb{C})$ we may define an action of $G^n \rtimes \mathfrak{S}_n$ on $V^{\lambda}$ using the embedding $\mathrm{GL}_{m}(\mathbb{C})^n \rtimes \mathfrak{S}_n \leq \mathrm{GL}_{nm}(\mathbb{C})$ and $\eta: G \rightarrow \mathrm{GL}_m(\mathbb{C})$. We derive a branching rule for the multiplicities of irreducible $G^n \rtimes \mathfrak{S}_n$ representations in $V^{\lambda}.$ The formula generalizes Littlewood's reciprocity rule for branching between $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{C})$ and the symmetric group of permutation matrices $\mathfrak{S}_n \leq \mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{C}).$</description>

Abstract: We obtain explicit bounds on the truncation error of the cumulant series of a bounded complex function of a random vector with independent components. The bounds are based on multidimensional differences. This extends the theory of the author with Brendan McKay and Rui-Ray Zhang (J. Combin. Th., Ser. B, 2025) from real functions to complex functions. We demonstrate some initial applications including a Berry--Esseen bound, an Edgeworth expansion for triangles in random graphs, and enumeration of regular graphs.</description>

      <title>Cryptarithmically unique terms in integer sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21427v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A cryptarithm (or alphametic) is a mathematical puzzle in which numbers are represented with words in such a way that identical letters stand for equal digits and distinct letters for unequal digits. An alphametic puzzle is usually given in the form of an equation that needs to be solved, such as SEND + MORE = MONEY. Alternatively, here we will consider cryptarithms constrained not by an equation but by a particular subsequence of natural numbers, for example perfect squares or primes. Such a cryptarithm has a unique solution if there is exactly one term in the sequence that has the corresponding pattern of digits. We will call such terms cryptarithmically unique. Here we estimate the density of such terms in an arbitrary sequence for which the overall density of terms among integers is known. In particular, among all perfect squares below 10^12, slightly less than one half are cryptarithmically unique, their density increasing toward larger numbers. Cryptarithmically unique prime numbers, however, are initially very scarce. Combinatorial estimates suggest that their density should drop below 10^-300 for decimal lengths of approximately 1829 digits, but then it recovers and is asymptotic to unity for very large primes. Finally, we introduce and discuss primonumerophobic digit patterns that no prime number happens to have.</description>

Abstract: We consider entropy-optimal graphons associated with extreme and near-extreme constraints on the densities of edges and triangles. We prove that the optimizers for near-extreme constraints are unique and multipodal and are perturbations of the previously known unique optimzers for extreme constraints. This proves the existence of infinitely many phases. We determine the podal structures in these phases and prove the existence of phase transitions between them.</description>

      <title>Quantum Optimization Benchmarking Library - The Intractable Decathlon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Through recent progress in hardware development, quantum computers have advanced to the point where benchmarking of (heuristic) quantum algorithms at scale is within reach. Particularly in combinatorial optimization - where most algorithms are heuristics - it is key to empirically analyze their performance on hardware and track progress towards quantum advantage. To this extent, we present ten optimization problem classes that are difficult for existing classical algorithms and can (mostly) be linked to practically relevant applications, with the goal to enable systematic, fair, and comparable benchmarks for quantum optimization methods. Further, we introduce the Quantum Optimization Benchmarking Library (QOBLIB) where the problem instances and solution track records can be found. The individual properties of the problem classes vary in terms of objective and variable type, coefficient ranges, and density. Crucially, they all become challenging for established classical methods already at system sizes ranging from less than 100 to, at most, an order of 100,000 decision variables, allowing to approach them with today's quantum computers. We reference the results from state-of-the-art solvers for instances from all problem classes and demonstrate exemplary baseline results obtained with quantum solvers for selected problems. The baseline results illustrate a standardized form to present benchmarking solutions, which has been designed to ensure comparability of the used methods, reproducibility of the respective results, and trackability of algorithmic and hardware improvements over time. We encourage the optimization community to explore the performance of available classical or quantum algorithms and hardware platforms with the benchmarking problem instances presented in this work toward demonstrating quantum advantage in optimization.</description>

Abstract: Experimental calculations suggest that the $h$-fold sumset sizes of 4-element sets of integers are concentrated at $h$ numbers that are differences of tetrahedral numbers. In this paper it is proved that these "popular" sumset sizes always exist. Explicit $h$-adically defined sets are constructed for each of these numbers.</description>

      <title>Strong Sparsification for 1-in-3-SAT via Polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new notion of sparsification, called \emph{strong sparsification}, in which constraints are not removed but variables can be merged. As our main result, we present a strong sparsification algorithm for 1-in-3-SAT. The correctness of the algorithm relies on establishing a sub-quadratic bound on the size of certain sets of vectors in $\mathbb{F}_2^d$. This result, obtained using the recent \emph{Polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa Theorem} (Gowers, Green, Manners and Tao, Ann. Math. 2025), could be of independent interest. As an application, we improve the state-of-the-art algorithm for approximating linearly-ordered colourings of 3-uniform hypergraphs (H{\aa}stad, Martinsson, Nakajima and{\v{Z}}ivn{\'{y}}, APPROX 2024).</description>

Abstract: Coordinating the motion of multiple agents in constrained environments is a fundamental challenge in robotics, motion planning, and scheduling. A motivating example involves $n$ robotic arms, each represented as a line segment. The objective is to rotate each arm to its vertical orientation, one at a time (clockwise or counterclockwise), without collisions nor rotating any arm more than once. This scenario is an example of the more general $k$-Compatible Ordering problem, where $n$ agents, each capable of $k$ state-changing actions, must transition to specific target states under constraints encoded as a set $\mathcal{G}$ of $k$ pairs of directed graphs.
  We show that $k$-Compatible Ordering is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete, even when $\mathcal{G}$ is planar, degenerate, or acyclic. On the positive side, we provide polynomial-time algorithms for cases such as when $k = 1$ or $\mathcal{G}$ has bounded treewidth. We also introduce generalized variants supporting multiple state-changing actions per agent, broadening the applicability of our framework. These results extend to a wide range of scheduling, reconfiguration, and motion planning applications in constrained environments.</description>
