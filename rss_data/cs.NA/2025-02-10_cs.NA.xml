      <title>PASE: A Massively Parallel Augmented Subspace Eigensolver for Large Scale Eigenvalue Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel parallel augmented subspace method and build a package Parallel Augmented Subspace Eigensolver (PASE) for solving large scale eigenvalue problems by the massively parallel finite element discretization. Based on the augmented subspace, solving high dimensional eigenvalue problems can be transformed to solving the corresponding linear equations and low dimensional eigenvalue problems on the augmented subspace. Thus the complexity of solving the eigenvalue problems by augmented subspace method will be comparable to that of solving the same dimensinal linear equations. In order to improve the scalability and efficiency, we also present some implementing techniques for the parallel augmented subspace method. Based on parallel augmented subspace method and the concerned implementing techniques, a package PASE is built for solving large scale eigenvalue problems. Some numerical examples are provided to validate the efficiency and scalability of the proposed numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Relative Entropy Methods for Calculating Committors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by challenges arising in molecular simulation, we analyze and develop methods of computing reactive trajectories and committor functions for systems described by the overdamped Langevin dynamics. Our main technical advance is a new loss function that measures the accuracy of approximations to the committor function related to a given chemical reaction or other rare transition event. Our loss admits a simple interpretation in terms of the distribution of reactive trajectories, and it can be computed in practice to compare the accuracies of different approximations of the committor. We also derive a method of calculating committors by direct minimization of the loss via stochastic gradient descent.</description>

      <title>Energy dissipation law and maximum bound principle-preserving linear BDF2 schemes with variable steps for the Allen-Cahn equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose and analyze a linear, structure-preserving scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) method for solving the Allen--Cahn equation based on the second-order backward differentiation formula (BDF2) with variable time steps. To this end, we first design a novel and essential auxiliary functional that serves twofold functions: (i) ensuring that a first-order approximation to the auxiliary variable, which is essentially important for deriving the unconditional energy dissipation law, does not affect the second-order temporal accuracy of the phase function $\phi$; and (ii) allowing us to develop effective stabilization terms that are helpful to establish the MBP-preserving linear methods. Together with this novel functional and standard central difference stencil, we then propose a linear, second-order variable-step BDF2 type stabilized exponential SAV scheme, namely BDF2-sESAV-I, which is shown to preserve both the discrete modified energy dissipation law under the temporal stepsize ratio $ 0 &lt; r_{k} := \tau_{k}/\tau_{k-1} &lt; 4.864 - \delta $ with a positive constant $\delta$ and the MBP under $ 0 &lt; r_{k} &lt; 1 + \sqrt{2} $. Moreover, an analysis of the approximation to the original energy by the modified one is presented. With the help of the kernel recombination technique, optimal $ H^{1}$- and $ L^{\infty}$-norm error estimates of the variable-step BDF2-sESAV-I scheme are rigorously established. Numerical examples are carried out to verify the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a new type of generalized inverse called dual core-EP generalized inverse (in short DCEPGI) for dual square matrices. We analyze the existence and uniqueness of the DCEPGI inverse and its compact formula using dual Drazin and dual MP inverse. Moreover, some characterizations using core-EP decomposition are obtained. We present a new dual matrix decomposition named the dual core-EP decomposition for square dual matrices. In addition, some relationships with other dual generalized inverses are established. As an application, solutions to some inconsistent system of linear dual equations are derived.</description>

      <title>Rigorous Perturbation Bounds for the QX Decomposition for Centrosymmetric Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Konrad Burnik suggests a structure-preserving QR factorization for centrosymmetric matrices, known as QX factorization. In this article, we obtain the explicit expressions for rigorous perturbation bounds of the QX factorization when the original matrix is perturbed, either norm-wise or component-wise. First, using the matrix-equation approach, weak rigorous perturbation bounds are derived. Then, strong rigorous perturbation bounds are obtained by combining the modified matrix-vector equation approach with the strategy for the Lyapunov majorant function and the Banach fixed-point theorem. The mixed and component-wise condition numbers and their upper bounds are also explicitly expressed. Numerical tests illustrate the validity of the obtained results.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Regression of Data-Driven Reduced Order Model Closures for Under-Resolved, Convection-Dominated Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven closures correct the standard reduced order models (ROMs) to increase their accuracy in under-resolved, convection-dominated flows. There are two types of data-driven ROM closures in current use: (i) structural, with simple ansatzes (e.g., linear or quadratic); and (ii) machine learning-based, with neural network ansatzes. We propose a novel symbolic regression (SR) data-driven ROM closure strategy, which combines the advantages of current approaches and eliminates their drawbacks. As a result, the new data-driven SR closures yield ROMs that are interpretable, parsimonious, accurate, generalizable, and robust. To compare the data-driven SR-ROM closures with the structural and machine learning-based ROM closures, we consider the data-driven variational multiscale ROM framework and two under-resolved, convection-dominated test problems: the flow past a cylinder and the lid-driven cavity flow at Reynolds numbers Re = 10000, 15000, and 20000. This numerical investigation shows that the new data-driven SR-ROM closures yield more accurate and robust ROMs than the structural and machine learning ROM closures.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Modified Weak Galerkin Method for Obstacle Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces a novel residual-based a posteriori error estimators for the Modified Weak Galerkin (MWG) finite element method applied to the obstacle problem. To the best of the author's knowledge, this work represents the first integration of the MWG method into an adaptive finite element framework for variational inequalities. The proposed error estimators is rigorously proven to be both reliable and efficient in quantifying the approximation error, measured in a natural energy norm. A key aspect of the analysis involves decomposing the discrete solution into conforming and non-conforming components, which plays a central role in the error estimation process. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the theoretical findings, demonstrating the reliability and efficiency of the proposed error estimator.</description>

      <title>A symmetric boundary integral formulation for time-domain acoustic-elastic scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A symmetric boundary integral formulation for the transient scattering of acoustic waves off homogeneous elastic obstacles is analyzed. Both the acoustic scattered field and the elastodynamic excited field are represented through a direct integral representation, resulting in a coupled system of interior/exterior integral equations that is symmetrized through the introduction of an auxiliary mortar variable. The analysis of each system and of its Galerkin discretization is done through the passage to the Laplace domain, which allows for the use of convolution quadrature for time discretization. Since the operators of the acustic and elastic Calder\'on calculus appear independently of each other, the formulation is well suited for non-intrusive numerical impementations (i.e. existing codes for acoustic and elastic problems can be used without any modification). Numerical examples are provided for two-dimensional examples.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional stochastic finite volumes using the tensor train format</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method for the uncertainty quantification of nonlinear hyperbolic equations with many uncertain parameters. The method combines the stochastic finite volume method and tensor trains in a novel way: the physical space and time dimensions are kept as full tensors, while all stochastic dimensions are compressed together into a tensor train. The resulting hybrid format has one tensor train for each spatial cell and each time step. We adapt a MUSCL scheme to this hybrid format and show the feasibility of the approach using several classical test cases. A convergence study is done on the Burgers' equation with three stochastic parameters. We also solve the Burgers' equation for an increasing number of stochastic dimensions and show an example with the Euler equations. The presented method opens new avenues for combining uncertainty quantification with well-known numerical schemes for conservation law.</description>

      <title>Finite volume element method for Landau-Lifshitz equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Landau-Lifshitz equation describes the dynamics of magnetization in ferromagnetic materials. Due to the essential nonlinearity and nonconvex constraint, it is typically solved numerically. In this paper, we developed a finite volume element method (FVEM) with the Gauss-Seidel projection method (GSPM) for the micromagnetics simulations. We give the error estimate for FVEM in space and depict the discretized energy dissipation. Owing to the application of the GSPM, the nonlinear vector system is decoupled and the computational complexity is comparable to that of implicitly solving the scalar heat equation, which accelerates the real simulations significantly. We present several numerical experiments to verify the theoretical analysis. Furthermore, we study the blow-up solution and efficiently simulate the 2D magnetic textures using the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Enriching continuous Lagrange finite element approximation spaces using neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a preliminary study combining two approaches in the context of solving PDEs: the classical finite element method (FEM) and more recent techniques based on neural networks. Indeed, in recent years, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have become particularly interesting for rapidly solving such problems, especially in high dimensions. However, their lack of accuracy is a significant drawback in this context, hence the interest in combining them with FEM, for which error estimators are already known. The complete pipeline proposed here, therefore, consists of modifying classical FEM approximation spaces by taking information from a prior, chosen here as the prediction of a neural network. On the one hand, this combination improves and certifies the prediction of neural networks to obtain a fast and accurate solution. On the other hand, error estimates are proven, showing that such strategies outperform classical ones by a factor that depends only on the quality of the prior. We validate our approach with numerical results obtained for this preliminary work on parametric problems with one- and two-dimensional geometries. They demonstrate that to achieve a fixed error target, a coarser mesh can be used with our enhanced FEM compared to the standard one, leading to reduced computation time, particularly for parametric problems.</description>

      <title>On modified Euler methods for McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations with super-linear coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of numerical methods for solving McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations, which are relevant in the context of distribution-dependent or mean-field models, under super-linear growth conditions for both the drift and diffusion coefficients. Under certain non-globally Lipschitz conditions, the proposed numerical approaches have half-order convergence in the strong sense to the corresponding system of interacting particles associated with McKean-Vlasov SDEs. By leveraging a result on the propagation of chaos, we establish the full convergence rate of the modified Euler approximations to the solution of the McKean-Vlasov SDEs. Numerical experiments are included to validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear manifold approximation using compositional polynomial networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of approximating a subset $M$ of a Hilbert space $X$ by a low-dimensional manifold $M_n$, using samples from $M$. We propose a nonlinear approximation method where $M_n $ is defined as the range of a smooth nonlinear decoder $D$ defined on $\mathbb{R}^n$ with values in a possibly high-dimensional linear space $X_N$, and a linear encoder $E$ which associates to an element from $ M$ its coefficients $E(u)$ on a basis of a $n$-dimensional subspace $X_n \subset X_N$, where $X_n$ and $X_N$ are optimal or near to optimal linear spaces, depending on the selected error measure. The linearity of the encoder allows to easily obtain the parameters $E(u)$ associated with a given element $u$ in $M$. The proposed decoder is a polynomial map from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $X_N$ which is obtained by a tree-structured composition of polynomial maps, estimated sequentially from samples in $M$. Rigorous error and stability analyses are provided, as well as an adaptive strategy for constructing a decoder that guarantees an approximation of the set $M$ with controlled mean-squared or wort-case errors, and a controlled stability (Lipschitz continuity) of the encoder and decoder pair. We demonstrate the performance of our method through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>A generalized Active Flux method of arbitrarily high order in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Active Flux method can be seen as an extended finite volume method. The degrees of freedom of this method are cell averages, as in finite volume methods, and in addition shared point values at the cell interfaces, giving rise to a globally continuous reconstruction. Its classical version was introduced as a one-stage fully discrete, third-order method. Recently, a semi-discrete version of the Active Flux method was presented with various extensions to arbitrarily high order in one space dimension. In this paper we extend the semi-discrete Active Flux method on two-dimensional Cartesian grids to arbitrarily high order, by including moments as additional degrees of freedom (hybrid finite element--finite volume method). The stability of this method is studied for linear advection. For a fully discrete version, using an explicit Runge-Kutta method, a CFL restriction is derived. We end by presenting numerical examples for hyperbolic conservation laws.</description>

      <title>Sketchy Moment Matching: Toward Fast and Provable Data Selection for Finetuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06120v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit data selection in a modern context of finetuning from a fundamental perspective. Extending the classical wisdom of variance minimization in low dimensions to high-dimensional finetuning, our generalization analysis unveils the importance of additionally reducing bias induced by low-rank approximation. Inspired by the variance-bias tradeoff in high dimensions from the theory, we introduce Sketchy Moment Matching (SkMM), a scalable data selection scheme with two stages. (i) First, the bias is controlled using gradient sketching that explores the finetuning parameter space for an informative low-dimensional subspace $\mathcal{S}$; (ii) then the variance is reduced over $\mathcal{S}$ via moment matching between the original and selected datasets. Theoretically, we show that gradient sketching is fast and provably accurate: selecting $n$ samples by reducing variance over $\mathcal{S}$ preserves the fast-rate generalization $O(\dim(\mathcal{S})/n)$, independent of the parameter dimension. Empirically, we concretize the variance-bias balance via synthetic experiments and demonstrate the effectiveness of SkMM for finetuning in real vision tasks.</description>

Abstract: While Fourier-based neural operators are best suited to learning mappings between functions on periodic domains, several works have introduced techniques for incorporating non trivial boundary conditions. However, all previously introduced methods have restrictions that limit their applicability. In this work, we introduce an alternative approach to imposing boundary conditions inspired by volume penalization from numerical methods and Mixture of Experts (MoE) from machine learning. By introducing competing experts, the approach additionally allows for model selection. To demonstrate the method, we combine a spatially conditioned MoE with the Fourier based, Modal Operator Regression for Physics (MOR-Physics) neural operator and recover a nonlinear operator on a disk and quarter disk. Next, we extract a large eddy simulation (LES) model from direct numerical simulation of channel flow and show the domain decomposition provided by our approach. Finally, we train our LES model with Bayesian variational inference and obtain posterior predictive samples of flow far past the DNS simulation time horizon.</description>

      <title>Complexity Analysis of Normalizing Constant Estimation: from Jarzynski Equality to Annealed Importance Sampling and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an unnormalized probability density $\pi\propto\mathrm{e}^{-V}$, estimating its normalizing constant $Z=\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}\mathrm{e}^{-V(x)}\mathrm{d}x$ or free energy $F=-\log Z$ is a crucial problem in Bayesian statistics, statistical mechanics, and machine learning. It is challenging especially in high dimensions or when $\pi$ is multimodal. To mitigate the high variance of conventional importance sampling estimators, annealing-based methods such as Jarzynski equality and annealed importance sampling are commonly adopted, yet their quantitative complexity guarantees remain largely unexplored. We take a first step toward a non-asymptotic analysis of annealed importance sampling. In particular, we derive an oracle complexity of $\widetilde{O}\left(\frac{d\beta^2{\mathcal{A}}^2}{\varepsilon^4}\right)$ for estimating $Z$ within $\varepsilon$ relative error with high probability, where $\beta$ is the smoothness of $V$ and $\mathcal{A}$ denotes the action of a curve of probability measures interpolating $\pi$ and a tractable reference distribution. Our analysis, leveraging Girsanov theorem and optimal transport, does not explicitly require isoperimetric assumptions on the target distribution. Finally, to tackle the large action of the widely used geometric interpolation of probability distributions, we propose a new normalizing constant estimation algorithm based on reverse diffusion samplers and establish a framework for analyzing its complexity.</description>

      <title>A time-dependent inverse source problem for a semilinear pseudo-parabolic equation with Neumann boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the inverse problem for determining an unknown time-dependent source coefficient in a semilinear pseudo-parabolic equation with variable coefficients and Neumann boundary condition. This unknown source term is recovered from the integral measurement over the domain $\Omega$. Based on Rothe's method, the existence and uniqueness of a weak solution, under suitable assumptions on the data, is established. A numerical time-discrete scheme for the unique weak solution and the unknown source coefficient is designed, and the convergence of the approximations is proved. Some numerical experiments are presented to support the obtained theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Discrepancies are Virtue: Weak-to-Strong Generalization through Lens of Intrinsic Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weak-to-strong (W2S) generalization is a type of finetuning (FT) where a strong (large) student model is trained on pseudo-labels generated by a weak teacher. Surprisingly, W2S FT often outperforms the weak teacher. We seek to understand this phenomenon through the observation that FT often occurs in intrinsically low-dimensional spaces. Leveraging the low intrinsic dimensionality of FT, we analyze W2S in the ridgeless regression setting from a variance reduction perspective. For a strong student - weak teacher pair with sufficiently expressive low-dimensional feature subspaces $\mathcal{V}_s, \mathcal{V}_w$, we provide an exact characterization of the variance that dominates the generalization error of W2S. This unveils a virtue of discrepancy between the strong and weak models in W2S: the variance of the weak teacher is inherited by the strong student in $\mathcal{V}_s \cap \mathcal{V}_w$, while reduced by a factor of $\dim(\mathcal{V}_s)/N$ in the subspace of discrepancy $\mathcal{V}_w \setminus \mathcal{V}_s$ with $N$ pseudo-labels for W2S. Further, our analysis casts light on the sample complexities and the scaling of performance gap recovery in W2S. The analysis is supported with experiments on both synthetic regression problems and real vision tasks.</description>

      <title>Non-linear Quantum Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mean of a random variable can be understood as a $\textit{linear}$ functional on the space of probability distributions. Quantum computing is known to provide a quadratic speedup over classical Monte Carlo methods for mean estimation. In this paper, we investigate whether a similar quadratic speedup is achievable for estimating $\textit{non-linear}$ functionals of probability distributions. We propose a quantum-inside-quantum Monte Carlo algorithm that achieves such a speedup for a broad class of non-linear estimation problems, including nested conditional expectations and stochastic optimization. Our algorithm improves upon the direct application of the quantum multilevel Monte Carlo algorithm introduced by An et al.. The existing lower bound indicates that our algorithm is optimal up polylogarithmic factors. A key innovation of our approach is a new sequence of multilevel Monte Carlo approximations specifically designed for quantum computing, which is central to the algorithm's improved performance.</description>

      <title>Data-Parallel Neural Network Training via Nonlinearly Preconditioned Trust-Region Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parallel training methods are increasingly relevant in machine learning (ML) due to the continuing growth in model and dataset sizes. We propose a variant of the Additively Preconditioned Trust-Region Strategy (APTS) for training deep neural networks (DNNs). The proposed APTS method utilizes a data-parallel approach to construct a nonlinear preconditioner employed in the nonlinear optimization strategy. In contrast to the common employment of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), which are both variants of gradient descent (GD) algorithms, the APTS method implicitly adjusts the step sizes in each iteration, thereby removing the need for costly hyperparameter tuning. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed APTS variant using the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The results obtained indicate that the APTS variant proposed here achieves comparable validation accuracy to SGD and Adam, all while allowing for parallel training and obviating the need for expensive hyperparameter tuning.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the diffusion coefficient of overdamped Langevin dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12087v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Overdamped Langevin dynamics are reversible stochastic differential equations which are commonly used to sample probability measures in high-dimensional spaces, such as the ones appearing in computational statistical physics and Bayesian inference. By varying the diffusion coefficient, there are in fact infinitely many overdamped Langevin dynamics which are reversible with respect to the target probability measure at hand. This suggests to optimize the diffusion coefficient in order to increase the convergence rate of the dynamics, as measured by the spectral gap of the generator associated with the stochastic differential equation. We analytically study this problem here, obtaining in particular necessary conditions on the optimal diffusion coefficient. We also derive an explicit expression of the optimal diffusion in some appropriate homogenized limit. Numerical results, both relying on discretizations of the spectral gap problem and Monte Carlo simulations of the stochastic dynamics, demonstrate the increased quality of the sampling arising from an appropriate choice of the diffusion coefficient.</description>

      <title>Balanced truncation with conformal maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of constructing reduced models for large scale systems with poles in general domains in the complex plane (as opposed to, e.g., the open left-half plane or the open unit disk). Our goal is to design a model reduction scheme, building upon theoretically established methodologies, yet encompassing this new class of models. To this aim, we develop a balanced truncation framework through conformal maps to handle poles in general domains. The major difference from classical balanced truncation resides in the formulation of the Gramians. We show that these new Gramians can still be computed by solving modified Lyapunov equations for specific conformal maps. A numerical algorithm to perform balanced truncation with conformal maps is developed and is tested on three numerical examples, namely a heat model, the Schr\"odinger equation, and the undamped linear wave equation, the latter two having spectra on the imaginary axis.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous Galerkin method for a three-dimensional coupled fluid-poroelastic model with applications to brain fluid mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The modeling of the interaction between a poroelastic medium and a fluid in a hollow cavity is crucial for understanding, e.g., the multiphysics flow of blood and Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) in the brain, the supply of blood by the coronary arteries in heart perfusion, or the interaction between groundwater and rivers or lakes. In particular, the cerebral tissue's elasticity and its perfusion by blood and interstitial CSF can be described by Multi-compartment Poroelasticity (MPE), while CSF flow in the brain ventricles can be modeled by the (Navier-)Stokes equations, the overall system resulting in a coupled MPE-(Navier-)Stokes system. The aim of this paper is three-fold. First, we aim to extend a recently presented discontinuous Galerkin method on polytopal grids (PolyDG) to incorporate three-dimensional geometries and physiological interface conditions. Regarding the latter, we consider the Beavers-Joseph-Saffman (BJS) conditions at the interface, modeling the friction between the fluid and the porous medium. Second, we analyze the computational efficiency of the proposed method on a domain with small geometrical features, thus demonstrating the advantages of employing polyhedral meshes. Finally, by a comparative numerical investigation, we assess the fluid-dynamics effects of the BJS conditions and of employing either Stokes or Navier-Stokes equations to model the CSF flow. The semidiscrete numerical scheme for the coupled problem is stable and optimally convergent. Temporal discretization is obtained using Newmark's $\beta$-method for the elastic wave equation and the $\theta$-method for the remaining equations. The theoretical error estimates are verified by numerical simulations on a test case with a manufactured solution, and a numerical investigation is carried out on a three-dimensional geometry to assess the effects of interface conditions and fluid inertia on the system.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scale Frequency-Enhanced Deep D-bar Method for Electrical Impedance Tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The regularized D-bar method is a popular method for solving Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) problems due to its efficiency and simplicity. It utilizes the low-pass truncated scattering data in the non-linear Fourier domain to solve the associated D-bar integral equations, yielding a smooth conductivity approximation. However, the D-bar reconstruction often presents low contrast and resolution due to the absence of accurate high-frequency information and the ill-posedness of the problem. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based supervised approach for real-time EIT reconstruction. Based on the D-bar method, we propose to utilize both multi-scale frequency enhancement and spatial consistency for a high image quality reconstruction. Additionally, we propose a fixed-point iteration for solving discrete D-bar systems on GPUs for fast computation. Numerical results are performed for both the continuum model and complete electrode model simulation on KIT4 and ACT4 datasets to demonstrate notable improvements in absolute EIT imaging quality.</description>

      <title>Parametric holomorphy of elliptic eigenvalue problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01227v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of parameter-dependent partial differential equations (parametric PDEs) with countably many parameters has been actively studied for the last few decades. In particular, it has been well known that a certain type of parametric holomorphy of the PDE solutions allows the application of deep neural networks without encountering the curse of dimensionality. This paper aims to propose a general framework for verifying the desired parametric holomorphy by utilizing the bounds on parametric derivatives. The framework is illustrated with examples of parametric elliptic eigenvalue problems (EVPs), encompassing both linear and semilinear cases. As the results, it will be shown that the ground eigenpairs have the desired holomorphy. Furthermore, under the same conditions, the bounds for the mixed derivatives of the ground eigenpairs are derived. These bounds are well known to take a crucial role in the error analysis of quasi-Monte Carlo methods.</description>

      <title>An improved Shifted CholeskyQR based on columns</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06311v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among all the deterministic CholeskyQR-type algorithms, Shifted CholeskyQR3 is specifically designed to address the QR factorization of ill-conditioned matrices. This algorithm introduces a shift parameter $s$ to prevent failure during the initial Cholesky factorization step, making the choice of this parameter critical for the algorithm's effectiveness. Our goal is to identify a smaller $s$ compared to the traditional selection based on $\norm{X}_{2}$. In this research, we propose a new matrix norm called the $g$-norm, which is based on the column properties of $X$. This norm allows us to obtain a reduced shift parameter $s$ for the Shifted CholeskyQR3 algorithm, thereby improving the sufficient condition of $\kappa_{2}(X)$ for this method. We provide rigorous proofs of orthogonality and residuals for the improved algorithm using our proposed $s$. Numerical experiments confirm the enhanced numerical stability of orthogonality and residuals with the reduced $s$. We find that Shifted CholeskyQR3 can effectively handle ill-conditioned $X$ with a larger $\kappa_{2}(X)$ when using our reduced $s$ compared to the original $s$. Furthermore, we compare CPU times with other algorithms to assess performance improvements.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Deep Inverse Operator Networks for Solving PDE Inverse Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inverse problems involving partial differential equations (PDEs) can be seen as discovering a mapping from measurement data to unknown quantities, often framed within an operator learning approach. However, existing methods typically rely on large amounts of labeled training data, which is impractical for most real-world applications. Moreover, these supervised models may fail to capture the underlying physical principles accurately. To address these limitations, we propose a novel architecture called Physics-Informed Deep Inverse Operator Networks (PI-DIONs), which can learn the solution operator of PDE-based inverse problems without labeled training data. We extend the stability estimates established in the inverse problem literature to the operator learning framework, thereby providing a robust theoretical foundation for our method. These estimates guarantee that the proposed model, trained on a finite sample and grid, generalizes effectively across the entire domain and function space. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that PI-DIONs can effectively and accurately learn the solution operators of the inverse problems without the need for labeled data.</description>

Abstract: We study learning-theoretic foundations of operator learning, using the linear layer of the Fourier Neural Operator architecture as a model problem. First, we identify three main errors that occur during the learning process: statistical error due to finite sample size, truncation error from finite rank approximation of the operator, and discretization error from handling functional data on a finite grid of domain points. Finally, we analyze a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) based least squares estimator, establishing both upper and lower bounds on the aforementioned errors.</description>

      <title>Accuracy of the Ensemble Kalman Filter in the Near-Linear Setting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The filtering distribution captures the statistics of the state of a dynamical system from partial and noisy observations. Classical particle filters provably approximate this distribution in quite general settings; however they behave poorly for high dimensional problems, suffering weight collapse. This issue is circumvented by the ensemble Kalman filter which is an equal-weight interacting particle system. However, this finite particle system is only proven to approximate the true filter in the linear Gaussian case. In practice, however, it is applied in much broader settings; as a result, establishing its approximation properties more generally is important. There has been recent progress in the theoretical analysis of the algorithm, establishing stability and error estimates in non-Gaussian settings, but the assumptions on the dynamics and observation models rule out the unbounded vector fields that arise in practice and the analysis applies only to the mean field limit of the ensemble Kalman filter. The present work establishes error bounds between the filtering distribution and the finite particle ensemble Kalman filter when the dynamics and observation vector fields may be unbounded, allowing linear growth.</description>

      <title>Representation of solutions of the one-dimensional Dirac equation in terms of Neumann series of Bessel functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A representation of solutions of the one-dimensional Dirac equation is obtained. The solutions are represented as Neumann series of Bessel functions. The representations are shown to be uniformly convergent with respect to the spectral parameter. Explicit formulas for the coefficients are obtained via a system of recursive integrals. The result is based on the Fourier-Legendre series expansion of the transmutation kernel. An efficient numerical method for solving initial-value and spectral problems based on this approach is presented with a numerical example. The method can compute large sets of eigendata with non-deteriorating accuracy.</description>

      <title>A Novel Approach to the Initial Value Problem with a complete validated algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Initial Value Problem (IVP) is concerned with finding solutions to a system of autonomous ordinary differential equations (ODE)
  \begin{equation}
  \textbf{x}' = \textbf{f}(\textbf{x})
  \end{equation} with given initial condition $\textbf{x}(0)\in B_0$ for some box $B_0\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$. Here $\textbf{f}:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\textbf{x}:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}^n$ where $\textbf{f}$ and $\textbf{x}$ are $C^1$-continuous. Let $\texttt{IVP}_\textbf{f}(B_0)$ denote the set of all such solutions $\textbf{x}$. Despite over 40 years of development to design a validated algorithm for the IVP problem, no complete algorithm currently exists.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel way to exploit the theory of $\textbf{logarithmic norms}$: we introduce the concept of a $\textbf{radical transform}$ $\pi:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^n$ to convert the above $(\textbf{x},\textbf{f})$-system into another system $\textbf{y}' = \textbf{g}(\textbf{y})$ so that the $(\textbf{y},\textbf{g})$-space has negative logarithmic norm in any desired small enough neighborhood.
  Based on such radical transform steps, we construct a complete validated algorithm for the following $\textbf{End-Enclosure Problem}$:
  \begin{equation} INPUT: (\textbf{f}, B_0,\varepsilon), \qquad\qquad OUTPUT: (\underline{B}_0,B_1)
  \end{equation} where $B_0\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is a box, $\varepsilon&gt;0$, such that $\underline{B}_0\subseteq B_0$, the diameter of $B_1$ is at most $\varepsilon$, and $B_1$ is an end-enclosure for $\texttt{IVP}(\underline{B}_0)$, i.e., for all $\textbf{x}\in \texttt{IVP}(\underline{B}_0)$, $\textbf{x}(1)\in B_1$.
  A preliminary implementation of our algorithm shows promise.</description>
