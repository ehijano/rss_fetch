      <title>On the Hamiltonian structure of the intrinsic evolution of a closed vortex sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the work of previous authors on vortex sheets and their applications, the inviscid evolution equations of a closed vortex sheet in a plane, separating two piecewise constant density fluids, and their Hamiltonian form are investigated. The model has potential applications to bubble dynamics. A Poisson bracket is obtained containing the curve-tangential derivative. A Lagrangian invariant of the sheet motion by its self-induced velocity--the Cauchy principal value of the Biot-Savart integral--is derived.</description>

      <title>Streamwise energy-transfer mechanisms in zero- and adverse-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study investigates streamwise ($\overline{u^2}$) energy-transfer mechanisms in the inner and outer regions of turbulent boundary layers (TBLs). Particular focus is placed on the $\overline{u^2}$-production, its inter-component and wall-normal transport as well as dissipation, all of which become statistically significant in the outer region with increasing friction Reynolds number ($Re_{\tau}$). These properties are analyzed using published data sets of zero, weak and moderately strong adverse-pressure-gradient (APG) TBLs across a decade of $Re_{\tau}$, revealing similarity in energy-transfer pathways for all these TBLs. It is found that both the inner and outer peaks of $\overline{u^2}$ are always associated with local maxima in the $\overline{u^2}$-production and its inter-component transport, and the regions below/above each of these peaks are always dominated by wall-ward/away-from-wall transport of $\overline{u^2}$, thereby classifying the $\overline{u^2}$-profiles into four distinct regimes. This classification reveals existence of phenomenologically similar energy-transfer mechanisms in the `inner' and `outer' regions of moderately strong APG TBLs, which meet at an intermediate location coinciding with the minimum in $\overline{u^2}$ profiles. Given that the wall-ward/away-from-wall transport of $\overline{u^2}$ is governed by the $\rm Q_4$(sweeps)/$\rm Q_2$(ejections) quadrants of the Reynolds shear stress, it is argued that the emergence of the $\overline{u^2}$ outer peak corresponds with the statistical dominance of $\rm Q_4$ events in the outer region. Besides unravelling the dynamical significance of $\rm Q_2$ and $\rm Q_4$ events in the outer region of turbulent boundary layers, the present analysis also proposes new phenomenological arguments for testing on canonical wall-turbulence data at very high $Re_{\tau}$.</description>

      <title>A Divide-and-Conquer Machine Learning Approach for Modelling Turbulent Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel zonal machine learning (ML) approach for Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence modelling based on the divide-and-conquer technique is introduced. This approach involves partitioning the flow domain into regions of flow physics called zones, training one ML model in each zone, then validating and testing them on their respective zones. The approach was demonstrated with the tensor basis neural network (TBNN) and another neural net called the turbulent kinetic energy neural network (TKENN). These were used to predict Reynolds stress anisotropy and turbulent kinetic energy respectively in test cases of flow over a solid block, which contain regions of different flow physics including separated flows. The results show that the combined predictions given by the zonal TBNNs and TKENNs were significantly more accurate than their corresponding standard non-zonal models. Most notably, shear anisotropy component in the test cases was predicted at least 20% and 55% more accurately on average by the zonal TBNNs compared to the non-zonal TBNN and RANS, respectively. The Reynolds stress constructed with the zonal predictions was also found to be at least 23% more accurate than those obtained with the non-zonal approach and 30% more accurate than the Reynolds stress predicted by RANS on average. These improvements were attributed to the shape of the zones enabling the zonal models to become highly locally optimized at predicting the output.</description>

      <title>Effective Block Preconditioners for Fluid Dynamics Coupled to Reduced Models of a Non-Local Nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling cardiovascular blood flow is central to many applications in biomedical engineering. To accommodate the complexity of the cardiovascular system, in terms of boundary conditions and surrounding vascular tissue, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) often are coupled to reduced circuit and/or solid mechanics models. These allow for realistic simulations of hemodynamics in the heart or the aorta, but come at additional computational cost and complexity. In this contribution, we design a novel block preconditioner for the solution of the stabilized Navier-Stokes equations coupled to reduced-order models of a non-local nature. These models encompass lumped-parameter systems that impose flux-dependent boundary tractions, and Galerkin reduced-order models that can be used to account for outlying mechanical structures. Here we propose a 3x3 preconditioner derived from the block factorization and approximation to the Schur complement(s). The solver performance is demonstrated for a series of examples with increasing complexity, culminating in a reduced FSI simulation in a patient-specific contracting left heart model. For all test cases, we show that our proposed approach is superior to other frequently presented 2x2 schemes that merge stiffness contributions from reduced models into the fluid Jacobian or consolidate some variables for the purpose of efficiency - with an up to six times shorter overall computing time and/or only half as many linear iterations.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of bacterial rheotaxis in non-Newtonian fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bacteria often exhibit upstream swimming, which can cause the contamination of biomedical devices and the infection of organs including the urethra or lungs. This process, called rheotaxis, has been studied extensively in Newtonian fluids. However, most microorganisms thrive in non-Newtonian fluids that contain suspended polymers such as mucus and biofilms. Here, we investigate the rheotatic behavior of E. coli near walls in non-Newtonian fluids. Our experiments demonstrate that bacterial upstream swimming is enhanced by an order of magnitude in shear-thinning polymeric fluids relative to Newtonian fluids. This result is explained by direct numerical simulations, revealing a torque that promotes the alignment of bacteria against the flow. From this analysis, we develop a theoretical model that accurately describes experimental rheotatic data in both Newtonian and shear-thinning fluids.</description>

      <title>Towards a universal law for blood flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite decades of research on blood flow, an analogue of Navier-Stokes equations that accurately describe blood flow properties has not been established yet. The reason behind this is that the properties of blood flow seem \`a priori non universal as they depend on various factors such as global concentration of red blood cells (RBCs) and channel width. Here, we have discovered a universal law when the stress and strain rate are measured at a given local RBCs concentration. However, the local concentration must be determined in order to close the problem. We propose a non-local diffusion equation of RBCs concentration that agrees with the full simulation. The universal law is exemplified for both shear and pressure driven flows. While the theory is restricted to a simplistic geometry (straight channel) it provides a fundamental basis for future research on blood flow dynamics and could lead to the development of a new theory that accurately describes blood flow properties under various conditions, such as in complex vascular networks.</description>

      <title>Physical structures of boundary fluxes of orbital rotation and spin for incompressible viscous flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vorticity is locally created on a boundary at the rate measured by the boundary vorticity flux, which can be further decomposed as the sum of the orbital rotation and the (generalized) spin. For incompressible viscous flow interacting with a stationary wall, the full expressions of the boundary fluxes of the orbital rotation and the spin are derived, for the first time, to elucidate their boundary creation mechanisms, respectively. Then, these new findings are successfully extended to the study of the boundary enstrophy dynamics, as well as the Lyman vorticity dynamics as an alternative interpretation to the boundary vorticity dynamics. Interestingly, it is found that the boundary coupling of the longitudinal and transverse processes is only embodied in the boundary spin flux, which is definitely not responsible for the generation of the boundary orbital-rotation flux. In addition, the boundary fluxes of enstrophy are directly associated with the boundary source of the second principal invariant of the velocity gradient tensor, and the two quadratic forms representing the spin-geometry interaction. The present exposition provides a new perspective to the vorticity dynamics on boundaries, which could be valuable in clarifying the formation mechanisms of near-wall coherent structures and flow noise at the fundamental level.</description>

      <title>Correlations for aerodynamic force coefficients of non-spherical particles in compressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents particle-resolved direct numerical simulations using three-dimensional body-fitted hexahedral grids to investigate the aerodynamic force and torque coefficients of non-spherical particles in compressible flows. The simulations focus on three particle shapes: a prolate spheroid, an oblate spheroid, and a rod-like particle, across a range of Mach numbers (0.3 to 2.0), angles of attack (0\degree to 90\degree), and particle Reynolds numbers (100 to 300). Results show that particle shape significantly impacts the aerodynamic forces on a particle in a compressible flow, with oblate spheroids exhibiting the highest drag, lift, and torque values. Correlations for these aerodynamic coefficients of the particles in a compressible flow are developed and validated. These correlations advance multiphase flow modeling by improving the accuracy of point-particle simulations for non-spherical particles in compressible flows.</description>

      <title>Fluid wetting and penetration characteristics in T-shaped microchannels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A thorough understanding of media tightness in automotive electronics is crucial for ensuring more reliable and compact product designs, ultimately improving product quality. Concerning the fundamental characteristics of fluid leakage issues, the dynamic wetting and penetration behavior on small scales is of special interest and importance. In this work, four T-shaped microchannels with one inlet and two outlets are experimentally investigated in terms of contact angle dynamics and interface movement over time, generating novel insight into the wetting mechanisms and fluid distribution. With a main channel width of 1 mm, a crevice width of w = 0.3 mm, 0.4 mm and a rounding edge radius of r = 0.1 mm, 0.2 mm, the geometrical effects on the fluid penetration depth in the crevice and the interface edge pinning effect are analyzed quantitatively using an automated image processing procedure. It is found that the measured dynamic contact angles in all parts can be well described by molecular kinetic theory using local contact line velocities, even with local surface effects and abrupt geometry changes. Moreover, a smaller crevice width, a sharper edge and a larger flow velocity tend to enhance the interface pinning effect and prevent fluid penetration into the crevice. The rounding radius has a more significant effect on the interface pinning compared with crevice width. The experimental data and image processing algorithm are made publicly available.</description>

      <title>An open-source, adaptive solver for particle-resolved simulations with both subcycling and non-subcycling methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the IAMReX, an adaptive and parallel solver for particle-resolved simulations on the multi-level grid. The fluid equations are solved using a finite-volume scheme on the block-structured semi-staggered grids with both subcycling and non-subcycling methods. The particle-fluid interaction is resolved using the multidirect forcing immersed boundary method. The associated Lagrangian markers used to resolve fluid-particle interface only exist on the finest-level grid, which greatly reduces memory usage. The volume integrals are numerically calculated to capture the free motion of particles accurately, and the repulsive potential model is also included to account for the particle-particle collision. We demonstrate the versatility, accuracy, and efficiency of the present multi-level framework by simulating fluid-particle interaction problems with various types of kinematic constraints. The cluster of monodisperse particles case is presented at the end to show the capability of the current solver in handing with multiple particles. The source code and testing cases used in this work can be accessed at https://github.com/ruohai0925/IAMR/tree/development. Input scripts and raw postprocessing data are also available for reproducing all results.</description>

      <title>Efficient Active Flow Control Strategy for Confined Square Cylinder Wake Using Deep Learning-Based Surrogate Model and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a deep learning model-based reinforcement learning (DL-MBRL) approach for active control of two-dimensional (2D) wake flow past a square cylinder using antiphase jets. The DL-MBRL framework alternates between interacting with a deep learning surrogate model (DL-SM) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to suppress wake vortex shedding, significantly reducing computational costs. The DL-SM, which combines a Transformer and a multiscale enhanced super-resolution generative adversarial network (MS-ESRGAN), effectively models complex flow dynamics, efficiently emulating the CFD environment. Trained on 2D direct numerical simulation (DNS) data, the Transformer and MS-ESRGAN demonstrated excellent agreement with DNS results, validating the DL-SM's accuracy. Error analysis suggests replacing the DL-SM with CFD every five interactions to maintain reliability. While DL-MBRL showed less robust convergence than model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL) during training, it reduced training time by 49.2%, from 41.87 hours to 20.62 hours. Both MFRL and DL-MBRL achieved a 98% reduction in shedding energy and a 95% reduction in the standard deviation of the lift coefficient (C_L). However, MFRL exhibited a nonzero mean lift coefficient due to insufficient exploration, whereas DL-MBRL improved exploration by leveraging the randomness of the DL-SM, resolving the nonzero mean C_L issue. This study demonstrates that DL-MBRL is not only comparably effective but also superior to MFRL in flow stabilization, with significantly reduced training time, highlighting the potential of combining deep reinforcement learning with DL-SM for enhanced active flow control.</description>

      <title>Spectrally Informed Learning of Fluid Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient fluid flow models are essential for applications relating to many physical phenomena including geophysical, aerodynamic, and biological systems. While these flows may exhibit rich and multiscale dynamics, in many cases underlying low-rank structures exist which describe the bulk of the motion. These structures tend to be spatially large and temporally slow, and may contain most of the energy in a given flow. The extraction and parsimonious representation of these low-rank dynamics from high-dimensional data is a key challenge. Inspired by the success of physics-informed machine learning methods, we propose a spectrally-informed approach to extract low-rank models of fluid flows by leveraging known spectral properties in the learning process. We incorporate this knowledge by imposing regularizations on the learned dynamics, which bias the training process towards learning low-frequency structures with corresponding higher power. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method to improve prediction and produce learned models which better match the underlying spectral properties of prototypical fluid flows.</description>

      <title>Improving propulsive efficiency using bio-inspired intermittent locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many swimmers, especially small to medium-sized animals, use intermittent locomotion that differs from continuous swimming of large species. This type of locomotion, called burst-and-coast, is often associated with an energetic advantage. In this work, we investigate the intermittent locomotion inspired by fish locomotion but applied to a propeller. The energy consumption of burst-and-coast cycles is measured and compared to the continuous rotation regime. We show that a substantial drag contrast between the active and passive phases of the motion, as observed in fish, is critical for energy savings. Such a contrast can be obtained using a folding propeller that passively opens and closes as the propeller starts and stops rotating. For this reconfigurable propeller, intermittent propulsion is found to be energetically advantageous, saving up to 24\% of the energy required to cruise at a given speed. Using an analytical model, we show that intermittent motion is more efficient than continuous motion when the drag reduction in the coast phase exceeds 65\%. For fish-like locomotion, this threshold seems to be closer to 30\%. A formal analogy allows us to explain the difference between propeller propulsion and fish locomotion.</description>

      <title>Tunneling in a Lorenz-like model for an active wave-particle entity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active wave-particle entities (WPEs) emerge as self-propelled oil droplets on the free surface of a vibrating oil bath. The particle (droplet) periodically imprints decaying waves on the liquid surface which in turn guide the particle motion, resulting in a two-way coupling between the particle and its self-generated waves. Such WPEs have been shown to exhibit hydrodynamic analogs of various quantum features. In this work, we theoretically and numerically explore a dynamical analog of tunneling by considering the setup of a one-dimensional WPE incident on an isolated Gaussian potential barrier. Our idealized model takes the form of a perturbed Lorenz system which we use to explore the dynamics and statistics of barrier crossing as a function of initial conditions and system parameters. Our work highlights that velocity fluctuations of the WPE at high memories that are rooted in non-equilibrium features of the Lorenz system, such as spiraling motion towards equilibrium points and transient chaos, give rise to - (i) sensitivity and unpredictability in barrier crossing, (ii) smooth variations in transmission probability as a function of system parameters, and (iii) wave-like features in the transmitted and reflected probability density profiles.</description>

      <title>Most Likely Noise-Induced Overturning Circulation Collapse in a 2D Boussinesq Fluid Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a reasonable possibility that the present-day Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation is in a bi-stable regime and hence it is relevant to compute probabilities and pathways of noise-induced transitions between the stable equilibrium states. Here, the most probable transition pathway of a noise-induced collapse of the northern overturning circulation in a spatially-continuous two-dimensional model with surface temperature and stochastic salinity forcings is directly computed using Large Deviation Theory (LDT). This pathway reveals the fluid dynamical mechanisms of such a collapse. Paradoxically it starts off with a strengthening of the northern overturning circulation before a short but strong salinity pulse induces a second overturning cell. The increased atmospheric energy input of this two-cell configuration cannot be mixed away quickly enough, leading to the collapse of the northern overturning cell and finally resulting in a southern overturning circulation. Additionally, the approach allows us to compare the probability of this collapse under different parameters in the deterministic part of the salinity surface forcing, which quantifies the increase in collapse probability as the bifurcation point of the system is approached.</description>

      <title>A domain decomposition-based autoregressive deep learning model for unsteady and nonlinear partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14461v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a domain-decomposition-based deep learning (DL) framework, named transient-CoMLSim, for accurately modeling unsteady and nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). The framework consists of two key components: (a) a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based autoencoder architecture and (b) an autoregressive model composed of fully connected layers. Unlike existing state-of-the-art methods that operate on the entire computational domain, our CNN-based autoencoder computes a lower-dimensional basis for solution and condition fields represented on subdomains. Timestepping is performed entirely in the latent space, generating embeddings of the solution variables from the time history of embeddings of solution and condition variables. This approach not only reduces computational complexity but also enhances scalability, making it well-suited for large-scale simulations. Furthermore, to improve the stability of our rollouts, we employ a curriculum learning (CL) approach during the training of the autoregressive model. The domain-decomposition strategy enables scaling to out-of-distribution domain sizes while maintaining the accuracy of predictions -- a feature not easily integrated into popular DL-based approaches for physics simulations. We benchmark our model against two widely-used DL architectures, Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) and U-Net, and demonstrate that our framework outperforms them in terms of accuracy, extrapolation to unseen timesteps, and stability for a wide range of use cases.</description>

      <title>Robust Solid Boundary Treatment for Compressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06231v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The unavailability of accurate boundary treatment methods for compressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) severely limits its ability to simulate flows in and around bodies. To this end, challenges specific to compressible flows with SPH are carefully considered. Based on these, robust and widely applicable boundary treatment methods for compressible SPH are proposed. These are accompanied by a novel technique to prevent particle penetration at boundaries. The proposed methods are shown to be significantly better than other recent approaches. A wide variety of test problems, many of which are not shown to be simulated with SPH thus far, are employed to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed methods. The implementation is open source and the results are automated in the interest of reproducibility. Overall, this research contributes to the advancement of SPH as a viable alternative to mesh-based methods for compressible flow simulations.</description>

      <title>Active and inactive contributions to the wall pressure and wall-shear stress in turbulent boundary layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A phenomenological description is presented to explain the intermediate and low-frequency/large-scale contributions to the wall-shear-stress (${\tau}_w$) and wall-pressure (${p}_w$) spectra of canonical turbulent boundary layers, which are well known to increase with Reynolds number. The explanation is based on the concept of active and inactive motions (Townsend, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 11, 1961) associated with the attached-eddy hypothesis. Unique data sets of simultaneously acquired ${\tau}_w$, ${p}_w$ and velocity fluctuation time series in the log region are considered, across friction-Reynolds-number ($Re_{\tau}$) range of $\mathcal{O}$($10^3$) $\lesssim$ $Re_{\tau}$ $\lesssim$ $\mathcal{O}$($10^6$). A recently proposed energy-decomposition methodology (Deshpande et al., J. Fluid Mech., vol. 914, 2021) is implemented to reveal the active and inactive contributions to the ${\tau}_w$- and $p_w$-spectra. Empirical evidence is provided in support of Bradshaw's (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 30, 1967) hypothesis that the inactive motions are responsible for the non-local wall-ward transport of the large-scale inertia-dominated energy, which is produced in the log region by active motions. This explains the large-scale signatures in the ${\tau}_w$-spectrum, which grow with $Re_{\tau}$ despite the statistically weak signature of large-scale turbulence production, in the near-wall region. For wall pressure, active and inactive motions respectively contribute to the intermediate and large scales of the $p_w$-spectrum. Both these contributions are found to increase with increasing $Re_{\tau}$ owing to the broadening and energization of the wall-scaled (attached) eddy hierarchy. This potentially explains the rapid $Re_{\tau}$-growth of the $p_w$-spectra relative to ${\tau}_w$, given the dependence of the latter only on the inactive contributions.</description>

      <title>Resonant excitation of Kelvin waves by interactions of subtropical Rossby waves and the zonal mean flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Equatorial Kelvin waves can be affected by subtropical Rossby wave dynamics. Previous research has demonstrated the Kelvin wave growth in response to subtropical forcing and the resonant growth due to eddy momentum flux convergence. However, the relative importance of the wave-mean flow and wave-wave interactions for the Kelvin wave growth compared to the direct wave excitation by the external forcing has not been made clear. This study demonstrates the resonant Kelvin wave excitation by interactions of subtropical Rossby waves and the mean flow using a spherical shallow-water model. The use of Hough harmonics as basis functions makes Rossby and Kelvin waves prognostic variables of the model and allows the quantification of terms contributing to their tendencies in physical and wave space. The simulations show that Kelvin waves are resonantly excited by interactions of Rossby waves and the balanced zonal mean flow in the subtropics, provided the Rossby and Kelvin wave frequencies, which are modified by the mean flow, match. The resonance mechanism is substantiated by analytical expressions. The Kelvin wave tendencies are caused by velocity and depth tendencies: The velocity tendencies due to the meridional advection of zonal mean velocity can be outweighed by the zonal advection of Rossby wave velocity or by the depth tendencies due to Rossby wave divergence. Identifying the resonant excitation mechanism in data should contribute to the quantification of Kelvin wave variability originating in the subtropics.</description>

      <title>Effective Viscosity of a Suspension of Hot Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active particles with a temperature distribution, "hot particles", have a distinct effect on the fluid that surrounds them. The temperature gradients they create deem the fluid's viscosity spatially dependent, therefore violating the linearity of the problem, making a full description of velocity and pressure fields challenging. Using energy dissipation analysis and Lorentz Reciprocal Theorem, we show that it is still possible to study global properties of such hot suspensions. Namely, we calculate the effective viscosity of a dilute hot suspension, adding a correction that includes contributions from the bulk fluid and the particles themselves. As examples of this method, we derive the effective viscosity of a suspension of spherical particles with different heat distributions. We show that when the particles are non-Brownian and are all oriented in the same direction, the viscosity is no longer isotropic and depends on the direction of the shear relative to the orientation of the particles. If the particles' orientation is fixed due to an external field, the stress tensor is no longer symmetric, and the viscosity has odd components.</description>
