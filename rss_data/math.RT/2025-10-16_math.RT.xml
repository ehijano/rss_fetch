      <title>Supercuspidal representations: construction, classification, and characters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The building blocks for irreducible smooth representations of p-adic groups are the supercuspidal representations. In these notes that are an expansion of a lecture series given during the IHES summer school 2022 we will explore an explicit exhaustive construction of these supercuspidal representations and their character formulas and observe a striking parallel between a large class of these representations and discrete series representations of real algebraic Lie groups. A key ingredient for the construction of supercuspidal representations is the Bruhat-Tits theory and Moy-Prasad filtration, which we will recall in this survey.</description>

      <title>Instantons on ALE spaces for classical groups, involutions on quiver varieties, and quantum symmetric pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13007v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moduli spaces of instantons on ALE spaces for classical groups are examples of fixed point sets of involutions on quiver varieties, i.e., $\sigma$-quiver varieties. In 2018 Yiqiang Li considered their equivariant cohomology, and by stable envelope of Maulik-Okounkov, constructed representations of coideal subalgebras of Maulik-Okounkov Yangian, called twisted Yangian. We calculate $K$-matrices as matrices in examples, identified the twisted Yangians with ones studied in other literature, and clarify conditions which we should impose to make them well-defined.</description>

      <title>A categorification of representations of $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}_{1|1})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We categorify the action of $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}_{1|1})$ on the tensor product of its vector representations $(\mathbb{C}^{1|1})^{\otimes N}$. The generators $E$ and $F$ are represented by Fourier-Mukai functors between the derived categories of coherent sheaves on the total spaces of "semi-parabolic" vector bundles over the Grassmannians $Gr(k,N)$.</description>

      <title>Weak unipotence and Langlands duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak unipotence of primitive ideals is a crucial property in the study of unitary representations of reductive groups. We establish a sufficient condition, referred to as mild unipotence, which guarantees weak unipotence and is more accessible in practice. We establish mild unipotence for both the $q$-unipotent ideals defined by McGovern and unipotent ideals attached to nilpotent orbit covers defined by Losev-Mason-Brown-Matvieievskyi (arXiv:2108.03453 [math.RT]). Our proof is conceptual and uses the bijection between special orbits in type $D$ and metaplectic special orbits in type $C$ found by Barbasch-Ma-Sun-Zhu (arXiv:2010.16089 [math.RT]) in an essential way.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce mock-Lie superalgebras, we give some definitions, properties, constructions, and we study their representations. Moreover we introduce pseudo-euclidean mock-Lie superalgebras which are mock-Lie superalgebras with even non-degenerate supersymmetric and invariant bilinear forms. Finally, we study the double extensions and generalized double extensions of mock-Lie superalgebras and their isometries.</description>

      <title>Matrix Points on Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cohomology of $C_n(X)$, the moduli space of commuting $n$-by-$n$ matrices satisfying the equations defining a variety $X$. This space can be viewed as a non-commutative Weil restriction from the algebra of $n$-by-$n$ matrices to the ground field. We introduce a ``Fermionic" counterpart $S_n(X)$, constructed as a convolution $X^n \times^{S_n} \mathrm{GL}_n/\mathrm{T}_n$. Our main result establishes that a natural map $\sigma \colon S_n(X) \to C_n(X)$ induces an isomorphism on $\ell$-adic cohomology under mild conditions on $X$ or the characteristic of the field. This confirms a heuristic derived from the classical theory of Weil restrictions and highlights a version of Boson-Fermion correspondence. Furthermore, we derive explicit combinatorial formulae for the Betti numbers of $C_n(X)$ and a Macdonald-type generating series. Finally we prove a Hermitian variant of our main result.</description>

      <title>Solid locally analytic representations in mixed characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of locally analytic representations of $p$-adic Lie groups with $\mathbf{Q}_p$-coefficients is a powerful tool in $p$-adic Hodge theory and in the $p$-adic Langlands program. This perspective reveals important differential structures, such as the Sen and Casimir operators.
  Rodr\'iguez Camargo and Rodrigues Jacinto developed in \cite{RJRC22} a solid version of this theory using the language of condensed mathematics. This provides more robust homological tools (comparison theorems, spectral sequences...) for studying these representations.
  In this article, we extend the solid theory of locally analytic representations to a much broader class of mixed characteristic coefficients, such as $\mathbf{F}_p((X))$ or $\mathbf{Z}_p[[X]]\langle p/X\rangle[1/X]$, as well as to semilinear representations. In the introduction, we explain how these ideas could relate to mixed characteristic phenomena in $p$-adic Hodge theory, extend eigenvarieties, and the Langlands program.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Polynomial Extensions of Nonsymmetric Macdonald-Koornwinder Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10609v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent joint paper with S. Sahi and V. Venkateswaran (2025), families of actions of the double affine Hecke algebra on spaces of quasi-polynomials were introduced. These so-called quasi-polynomial representations led to the introduction of quasi-polynomial extensions of the nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials, which reduce to metaplectic Iwahori-Whittaker functions in the $\mathfrak{p}$-adic limit. In this paper, these quasi-polynomial representations are extended to Sahi's 5-parameter double affine Hecke algebra, and the quasi-polynomial extensions of the nonsymmetric Koornwinder polynomials are introduced.</description>

      <title>Invariants for $\mathbb G_{(r)}$-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the constructions given by J. Pevtsova and the author of refined invariants for finite dimensional representations of infinitesimal group schemes $\mathbb G_{(r)}$ over a field $k$ of characteristic $p&gt;0$. Our focus is on the universal $p$-nilpotent operator seen as an element in the group algebra of the group scheme $\mathbb G_{(r),X}$ over $X$, where $X$ is either the moduli space $V_r(\mathbb G)$ of height $r$ $1$-parameter subgroups of $\mathbb G$ or the moduli space $\mathcal C_r(\mathcal N_p(\mathfrak g))$ of $r$-tuples of $p$-nilpotent, pair-wise commuting elements of the Lie algebra of $\mathbb G$. We formalize Jordan type function using several variants of the continuous function $JT_{\mathbb G,r,M}(-): \mathbb P V_r(\mathbb G) \to \mathcal Y$ where $\mathcal Y$ is the poset of Young diagrams with $p$-columns. One of these variants is designed to be more conducive to computation. The vector bundle construction given by J. Pevtsova and the author is extended to all finite dimensional $\mathbb G_{(r)}$-modules, producing coherent sheaves on $X$ which are locally free on the strata of $X$ associated to $JT_{\mathbb G,r,M}(-)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce the singular twin monoid and its corresponding group, constructed from both algebraic and topological perspectives. We then classify all complex homogeneous $2$-local representations of this constructed group. Moreover, we study the irreducibility of these representations and provide clear conditions under which irreducibility holds. Our results give a structured approach to understanding this new algebraic object and its representations.</description>

      <title>Stranding $\mathfrak{sl}_n$ webs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Webs are a kind of planar, directed, edge-labeled graph that encode invariant vectors for quantum representations of $\mathfrak{sl}_n$. The theory of webs developed organically for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$, where they are also known as noncrossing matchings and the Temperley-Lieb algebra, before being formalized by Kuperberg for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ and $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ as the morphisms in a diagrammatic categorification of quantum representations called the spider category. Various models extend webs to $n \geq 4$. Only Cautis-Kamnitzer-Morrison prove a full set of relations for their webs, though Fontaine's webs are better adapted to computations, more graph-theoretically natural, and directly generalize webs for $n=2$ and $n=3$.
  This paper formalizes the theory of Fontaine's webs, proving the existence of a deep and powerful global structure on these webs called strandings. We do three key things: 1) give a state-sum formula to construct ($U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_n)$-invariant) web vectors from the orientation of strandings on Fontaine's webs; 2) list and prove a complete set of relations, connecting strandings to the local data of binary labelings that are well-established in the literature; and 3) provide applications and examples of how strandings facilitate computations.</description>

      <title>Simplicity of tensor products of Kirillov--Reshetikhin modules: nonexceptional affine and G types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10347</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.10347v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show the denominator formulas for the normalized $R$-matrix involving two arbitrary Kirillov--Reshetikhin (KR) modules $W^{(k)}_{m,a}$ and $W^{(l)}_{p,b}$ in all nonexceptional affine types, $D_4^{(3)}$, and $G_2^{(1)}$. To achieve our goal, we prove the existence of homomorphisms, which can be understood as generalization of Dorey rule to KR modules. We also conjecture a uniform denominator formulas for all simply-laced types; in particular, type $E_n^{(1)}$. With the denominator formulas, we determine the simplicity of tensor product of KR modules and degrees of poles of normalized $R$-matrices between two KR modules completely in nonexceptional affine types, $D_4^{(3)}$, and $G_2^{(1)}$. As an application, we prove that the certain sets of KR modules for the untwisted affine types, suggested by Hernandez and Leclerc as clusters, form strongly commuting families, which implies that all cluster monomials in the clusters are real simple modules.</description>

      <title>Parallelisation of partial differential equations via representation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Incorporating symmetries into the numerical solution of differential equations has been a mainstay of research over the last 40 years, however, one aspect is less known and under-utilised: discretisations of partial differential equations that commute with symmetry actions (like rotations, reflections or permutations) can be decoupled into independent systems solvable in parallel by incorporating knowledge from representation theory. We introduce this beautiful subject via a crash course in representation theory focussed on hands-on examples for the symmetry groups of the square and cube, and its utilisation in the construction of so-called symmetry-adapted bases. Schur's lemma, which is not well-known in applied mathematics, plays a powerful role in proving sparsity of resulting discretisations and thereby showing that partial differential equations do indeed decouple. Using Schr\"odinger equations as a motivating example, we demonstrate that a symmetry-adapted basis leads to a significant increase in the number of independent linear systems. Counterintuitively, the effectiveness of this approach is in fact greater for partial differential equations with less symmetries, for example a Schr\"odinger equation where the potential is only invariant under permutations, but not under rotations or reflections. We also explore this phenomenon as the dimension of the partial differential equation becomes large, hinting at the potential for significant savings in high-dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any JdLG-admissible representation $\pi$ of a semigroup $S$ on a Banach space $E$, we show that the reversible part is weakly equivalent to a unitary representation on a Hilbert space that decomposes into a direct sum of finite dimensional representations, and we give an alternative characterization of the almost weakly stable part in terms of the unique invariant mean on the space of weakly almost periodic functions. In the case that $S$ is a bi-amenable measured semigroup, we characterize the almost weakly stable part using invariant means and averages along F\o lner sequences. Moreover, we give a description of the unique projection onto the reversible part whose kernel is the almost weakly stable part in terms of ultrafilters.</description>
