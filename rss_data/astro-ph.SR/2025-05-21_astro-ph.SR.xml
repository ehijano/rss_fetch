      <title>Methods to Test the Source of the Extreme Gas Motions in WS 35</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present theoretical arguments toward the plausibility of a stellar wind}to explain the 16000\,km\,$s^{-1}$ line broadening in the optical spectra of WS 35, the central star in the Pa 30 nebula. The wind model is discussed in the context of super-Eddington flows. We argue that WS 35 potentially occupies a new regime of wind driving theory as the first metal-only wind. While this framework provides a promising avenue for explaining the high speed flow, questions remain about the source's true nature. We further describe how future radio observations can provide an independent test of the spherical wind scenario. A magnetically channeled wind would likely produce a relatively flat and bright radio spectral energy distributions. By contrast a spherical wind should result in a thermal radio spectrum with a canonical continuum slope of $\nu^{0.6}$, and a brightness level consistent with the currently predicted mass-loss rate.</description>

      <title>Mass of Cepheid V350 Sgr Incorporating Interferometry and the Companion Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The system V350 Sgr has a classical Cepheid for the primary. Interferometry is presented for the system and the full orbit is determined. The mass of the companion has been determined from an {\it IUE} spectrum and comparison with the mass-temperature relation from Detached Eclipsing Binaries. Combined with the mass of the companion (2.6 $\pm$ 0.2 M$_\odot$), the mass of the Cepheid is determined to be 4.7 $\pm$ 0.8 M$_\odot$. For systems with less complete information, Cepheid masses can be determined from a single-lined spectroscopic orbit, {\it Gaia} proper motion anomalies, and the mass of the companion from the ultraviolet. Uncertainties resulting from different approaches to mass determination are discussed, and are expected to be reduced after the {\it Gaia} DR4 release. Temperatures for Morgan Keenan (MK) standard stars from the ultraviolet are also provided.</description>

      <title>New insight into the variability of the Be star $\pi$ Aquarii: Determination of stellar and disk parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Be star $\pi$ Aquarii shows peculiar $\gamma$ Cas-type X-ray emission, likely caused by its outer disk interacting with a low-mass companion, probably a white dwarf. We study the long-term variability of its optical spectra to derive stellar and disk parameters during major changes. We identify and analyze Balmer, helium, silicon, and iron emission lines at selected epochs. Stellar parameters were derived using atmosphere models, considering oblate geometry due to fast rotation. Disk properties were constrained through H$\alpha$ line modeling using a viscous decretion disk model. The H$\alpha$ line evolved from shell to double-, triple-peaked, and flat-topped profiles. On Dec 22, 2001, the disk showed a low-intensity shell profile and fast density decay, indicating a small disk. From 2011 to 2014, the disk decayed slowly, then grew significantly until Nov 2022, increasing its H$\alpha$ equivalent width 18-fold and reaching an emitting region of ~65 solar radii. The inclination changed by ~10 degrees over 20 years, suggesting a precessing disk. The FeII 5018 A line traces a larger region than H$\alpha$ and is the only FeII line with a distinct profile. We conclude $\pi$ Aquarii is part of a misaligned binary system, with the white dwarf crossing the disk twice per orbit, capturing material, and enhancing X-ray emission.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Chromosphere Response to Flare Energy Release Using AIA Observations in 1600~\AA\ and 304~\AA\ Passbands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imaging observations of the solar lower atmosphere by the Atmosphere Imaging Assembly (AIA) have been mostly used as the context, and their quantitative information has been much less explored. The chromosphere responds rapidly to energy release by magnetic reconnection during flares. Furthermore, a flare is a collection of multiple energy release events that can be identified in spatially resolved chromosphere observations. In this paper, we conduct a statistical and semi-quantitative study of the relative photometry in the UV 1600~\AA\ and EUV 304~\AA\ passbands for 18 flares observed by AIA. In each flare, we have identified thousands of flare ribbon pixels in the UV 1600~\AA\ images, and measured their brightness (counts per second) and the rise and decay timescales, which are indicative of heating properties in flare loops. The analysis shows that bright flare pixels, characterized by peak brightness larger than ten times the quiescent brightness, exhibit sharp light curves with the half rise time below 2 min, followed by a two-phase decay with a rapid decay on timescales comparable to the rise time and then a more gradual decay. Flare ribbon pixels identified in both UV 1600 ~\AA\ and EUV 304~\AA\ images exhibit similar time profiles during the rise, and their peak brightness appear to be related by a power law. Our analysis shows that AIA observed flare brightness in UV 1600~\AA\ relative to the quiescent brightness is a meaningful measurement of the flare chromosphere photometry, and AIA observations for over a decade thus provide a unique and extensive database for systematic and semi-quantitative study of flaring chromosphere, either in the context of the Sun as a star, or in spatially resolved manner that helps to probe the nature of flare energy release on elementary scales.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory magnetic reconnection at a coronal bright point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal bright points are typical small-scale coronal brightenings that consist of a bundle of miniature coronal loops. Using the ultra-high-resolution coronal images from the Extreme Ultraviolet Image onboard Solar Obiter, we report the first observational evidence of oscillatory magnetic reconnection at a coronal bright point (CBP). The reconnection is characterised by two bursty phases defined by a reconnection reversal. In the first phase, a current sheet (C1) is found to form in front of an expanding loop of the bright point. Interestingly, C1 shorten to a null point during 10 minutes after reaching its maximum length (~2.4Mm). Less than 3 minutes later, a new current sheet (C2) was clearly seen to grow out from the null point, but along an orthogonal direction relative to C1. C2 reached a maximum length of ~4 Mm in ten minutes and then has become short and invisible in the next few minutes as the reconnection has declined. The magnetic reconnection is evidenced by the brightening, plasma flow and temperature increase at the ends of both C1 and C2. No significant magnetic cancellation or emergence but gradual convergence has occurred during a few hours before the reconnection underneath the CBP. The transition from C1 to C2 suggests the occurrence of coronal oscillatory reconnection with once reconnection reversal, whereby the inflow and outflow regions in the first phase become the outflow and inflow regions in the second phase, respectively. It is further found that the oscillatory reconnection could slightly modulate the change in brightness of the coronal bright point.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Formation and Dynamics of Double-decker Filament Through Component Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of double-decker filaments has long been an enigma in the field of solar physics. Using stereoscopic observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, we show that the double-decker filament formed on 2013 August 30 resulted from the splitting of a braided magnetic flux rope. The splitting was driven by component magnetic reconnection between intertwined field lines, triggered by the rotational motion in a part of one filament footpoint. This mechanism, inferred from observed small jets, brightenings, and bidirectional mass flows, differs from the previous conclusion attributing filament splitting to magnetic reconnection between the legs of confining magnetic field lines within or above the filament. The splitting speed might be modulated by the reconnection speed, as evidenced by the correspondence between the filament's slow and fast rising phases and the intermittent and violent brightening stages. Following the splitting, the upper branch of the double-decker filament erupted as a coronal mass ejection (CME), giving rise to a GOES soft X-ray M1.2 flare. In conclusion, our observations present a new formation mechanism for double-decker filaments, and the subsequent partial eruption is likely attributable to the torus instability of the background coronal magnetic field. Moreover, the detection of small jets within the filament provides new insights into the role of component magnetic reconnection in localized coronal heating processes.</description>

      <title>Selected open cluster sample for validating atmospheric parameters: Application to Gaia and other surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable stellar atmospheric parameters are essential for probing stellar structure and evolution, and for stellar population studies. However, various deviations appear in comparisons with different ground-based spectroscopic surveys. We aim to select high-quality open cluster members and employ the atmospheric parameters provided by the theoretical isochrones of open clusters as a benchmark to assess the quality of stellar atmospheric parameters from Gaia DR3 and other ground-based spectroscopic surveys, such as LAMOST DR11, APOGEE DR17, and GALAH DR4. We selected 130 open clusters with well-defined main sequences within 500 pc of the solar neighborhood as a benchmark sample to estimate the reference atmospheric parameters of the members from the best-fit isochrones of those clusters. By comparing the atmospheric parameters provided by different spectroscopic surveys to the theoretical parameters, we found that the atmospheric parameter deviation and the corresponding dispersions exhibit different variations. The atmospheric parameter deviations of F, G, and K-type stars are smaller than those of B, A, and M-type stars for most surveys. For most samples, the dispersion of Teff decreases as temperature decreases, whereas the dispersion of logg shows the opposite trend.</description>

      <title>Coronal Magnetometry with EUV Permitted Lines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major challenge in solar physics is to obtain empirical information on the magnetic field of the million-degree plasma of the solar corona. To this end, we need observables of the solar radiation sensitive to the coronal magnetic field. The most familiar observables are the polarization signals of visible and near-infrared forbidden lines of highly ionized species and some ultraviolet permitted lines, like hydrogen Lyman-{\alpha}. While the coronal radiation in these spectral lines can only be detected for off-limb line of sights, the coronal radiation from permitted extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lines can be observed also on the solar disk. These coronal lines are mainly collisionally excited, but it has been pointed out that some permitted EUV lines can actually be linearly polarized if their lower level carries atomic alignment, and that their linear polarization is sensitive to the orientation of the coronal magnetic field (see Manso Sainz &amp; Trujillo Bueno 2009). Here we theoretically investigate the linear polarization in permitted EUV lines of a variety of ions: Fe X, Fe XI, Fe XIII, Fe XIV, Si IX, and Si X. To this end, we have developed a numerical code, which we have applied to investigate the linear polarization and magnetic sensitivity of many permitted EUV lines in a one-dimensional model of the solar corona, providing a list of the most promising lines to be further investigated for polarimetry with future space telescopes. Our next step will be to extend this work by using state-of-the-art three-dimensional coronal models.</description>

      <title>Application of Deep Learning to the Classification of Stokes Profiles: From the Quiet Sun to Sunspots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The morphology of circular polarisation profiles from solar spectropolarimetric observations encode information about the magnetic field strength, inclination, and line-of-sight velocity gradients. Previous studies used manual methods or unsupervised machine learning (ML) to classify the shapes of circular polarisation profiles. We trained a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) comparing classifications with unsupervised ML. The method was tested on quiet Sun datasets from DKIST, Hinode, and GREGOR, as well as simulations of granulation and a sunspot. We achieve validation metrics typically close to or above $90\%$. We also present the first statistical analysis of quiet Sun DKIST/ViSP data using inversions and our supervised classifier. We demonstrate that classifications with unsupervised ML alone can introduce systemic errors that could compromise statistical comparisons. DKIST and Hinode classifications in the quiet Sun are similar, despite our modelling indicating spatial resolution differences should alter the shapes of circular polarization signals. Asymmetrical (symmetrical) profiles are less (more) common in GREGOR than DKIST or Hinode data, consistent with narrower response functions in the $1564.85$ nm line. Single-lobed profiles are extremely rare in GREGOR data. In the sunspot simulation, the $630.25$ nm line produces ``double' profiles in the penumbra, likely a manifestation of magneto-optical effects in horizontal fields; these are rarer in the $1564.85$ nm line. We find the $1564.85$ nm line detects more reverse polarity magnetic fields in the penumbra in contradiction to observations. We detect mixed-polarity profiles in nearly one fifth of the penumbra. Supervised ML robustly classifies solar spectropolarimetric data, enabling detailed statistical analyses of magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Improving the {\Gamma}-functions Method for Vortex Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vortices have been observed at various heights within the solar atmosphere and are suggested to potentially play great roles in heating the solar upper atmosphere. Multiple automated vortex detection methods have been developed and applied to detect vortices.We aim to improve the $\Gamma$-functions method for vortex identification by optimizing the value of $\Gamma_{1min}$ and the approach to calculate $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ used to determine vortex center and edge. In this way, we can detect vortices more accurately and enable more statistical studies that can improve our knowledge of the generation and evolution of vortices in the solar atmosphere. We apply the automated swirl detection algorithm (ASDA, one representative of $\Gamma$-functions method) with different parameters to various synthetic data, with each containing 1000 Lamb-Oseen vortices, and search for the optimal $\Gamma_{1min}$ and kernel size when calculating $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$. We also compare another detection method using simulation and observational data to validate the results obtained from the synthetic data. The best performance is found with the Optimized ASDA, which combines different kernel sizes (5, 7, 9, and 11) to calculate $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ with a fixed $\Gamma_{1min}$ = 0.63 to detect vortex center. We find that more vortices can be detected by the Optimized ASDA with higher location, radius, and rotation speed accuracies. The above results are further confirmed by comparing vortices detected by the Optimized ASDA and the SWIRL method on CO5BOLD numerical simulation data and SST observational data.</description>

      <title>Five New Sirius-Like White Dwarf + Main Sequence Star Systems with MagAO-X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most known white dwarfs in multiple systems with main sequence stars have been discovered with M-type companions, because the white dwarf causes detectable UV excess and bluer colors than expected from a single M star. Surveys have shown that the number of white dwarfs in Sirius-like systems within 100 pc of the Sun is lower than expected, suggesting that white dwarfs are being missed in the glare of their main sequence companions. In this work we have leveraged the angular resolution and high-contrast capabilities, as well as optimization for visible wavelengths, of the extreme adaptive optics instrument MagAO-X to detect new white dwarf companions to AFGK stars. We present the first results of our survey with the extreme AO instrument MagAO-X, called the Pup Search, of 18 targets with seven new candidate companions, five of which are confirmed to be white dwarfs. We discuss the new detections in the context of previous surveys and other detection metric sensitivities and show that we are sensitive to a region not probed by other surveys. Finally we discuss the future of the Pup Search in light of developing technologies.</description>

      <title>A model of magnetised and rotating convection for stellar and planetary interiors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convection is a fundamental mechanism for energy transport in stars and planets, playing a pivotal role in shaping their structures and evolution. The Mixing-Length Theory, a monomodal approach to convection, is widely adopted and implemented in 1D stellar structure and evolution codes. However, it overlooks the combined effects of rotation and magnetic fields, which are ubiquitous across a wide range of stars and planets. To address this limitation, we extend the Mixing-Length Theory including both rotation and magnetic fields within a Cartesian set-up. Building on the work by Stevenson 1979, we use a heat-flux maximisation principle, which amounts to selecting the convective mode that carries the most heat. Our findings show that both rotation and magnetic fields individually tend to suppress convection. However, when combined, they can enhance convection strength under certain conditions. We derive expressions for the root-mean-square (rms) velocity, characteristic length scale, and degree of superadiabaticity as functions of the rotation rate and magnetic field strength. These results offer new insights for more accurately modeling convection and its impact on stellar and planetary structures in one-dimensional and forthcoming multi-dimensional evolution models.</description>

Abstract: Water is detected in environments representing every stage of star and solar system formation, but its chemical evolution throughout these stages remains poorly constrained. Deuterium ratios offer a means of probing chemical links between water in different cosmic regions because of their sensitivity to physicochemical conditions. Here, we present the first detection of the 4.1 $\mu$m HDO ice feature with JWST toward L1527 IRS, an isolated low-mass protostar that may eventually grow to a sun-like mass. We measure an ice HDO/H$_{2}$O ratio of 4.4$^{+3.7}_{-1.7}$$\times$10$^{-3}$, where the reported error is dominated by uncertainties in continuum definition and ice band strengths. This fraction is similar to the gas HDO/H$_{2}$O ratios measured in the warm ($&gt;$100 K) inner cores of other low-mass protostellar envelopes and protoplanetary disks found in comparably isolated star-forming regions. Such a similarity tentatively supports the assumption that water vapor detected in these regions is not significantly altered by gas-phase reactions following ice sublimation. It also supports the hypothesis that pre- and protostellar water ice is largely inherited in a chemically unaltered state by outer protoplanetary disks. However, the fraction is a factor of $\sim$4-10 times higher than the gas HDO/H$_{2}$O ratios measured toward comets and low-mass protostars in clustered star-forming regions. This difference may be due to either gas-phase water reprocessing in protostellar envelopes and protoplanetary disks, or differences between prestellar conditions of isolated dense cores and the clustered star-forming regions that are more analogous to the environment in which our Sun formed.</description>

      <title>Low metallicity solar model finds the prove in Borexino data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Borexino Collaboration interprets its data within the framework of Bulk Silicate Earth model and the model of the Sun with high metallicity. Other authors have given a different interpretation of the same data within the framework of Hydridic Earth model and low-metallicity Sun model. In order to understand what occasion takes place in Nature, the Borexino single events energy spectrum was numerically simulated using the Monte Carlo method for various assumptions about the processes that could exist in Nature. The existence of large potassium geo-antineutrino flux and its absence were considered. At the same time, the high or low metallicity of the Sun were included in simulations. A comparison of counting rates reconstruction from simulated data with the reconstruction ones from Borexino single events spectrum demonstrates that large potassium geo-antineutrino flux with low metallicity of the Sun is preferable and is realized in Nature.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing the origin of eccentric black-hole mergers with gravitational-wave spin measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It remains an open question whether the binary black hole mergers observed with gravitational-wave detectors originate from the evolution of isolated massive binary stars or were dynamically driven by perturbations from the environment. Recent evidence for non-zero orbital eccentricity in a handful of events is seen as support for a non-negligible fraction of the population experiencing external driving of the merger. However, it is unclear from which formation channel eccentric binary black-hole mergers would originate: dense star clusters, hierarchical field triples, active galactic nuclei, or wide binaries in the Galaxy could all be culprits. Here, we investigate whether the spin properties of eccentric mergers could be used to break this degeneracy. Using the fact that different formation channels are predicted to either produce eccentric mergers with mutually aligned or randomly oriented black-hole spins, we investigate how many confident detections would be needed in order for the two models to be statistically distinguishable. If a few percent of binary black hole mergers retain measurable eccentricity in the bandwidth of ground-based detectors, we report a $\sim40\,\%$ chance that we could confidently distinguish both models after the fifth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector network, $\sim80\,\%$ for LIGO A#, and $\sim98\,\%$ for the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer.</description>

      <title>FAUST XXIV. Large dust grains in the protostellar outflow cavity walls of the Class I binary L1551 IRS5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planet formation around young stars requires the growth of interstellar dust grains from mm-sized particles to km-sized planetesimals. Numerical simulations have shown that large ($\sim$mm-sized) grains found in the inner envelope of young protostars could be lifted from the disc via winds. However we are still lacking unambiguous evidence for large grains in protostellar winds/outflows. We investigate dust continuum emission in the envelope of the Class I binary L1551 IRS5 in the Taurus molecular cloud, aiming to identify observational signatures of grain growth, such as variations in the dust emissivity index ($\beta_{\rm mm}$). In this context, we present new, high-angular resolution (50 au), observations of thermal dust continuum emission at 1.3 mm and 3 mm in the envelope ($\sim$3000 au) of L1551 IRS5 , obtained as part of the ALMA-FAUST Large Program. We analyse dust emission along the cavity walls of the CO outflow, extended up to $\sim$1800 au. We find an H$_2$ volume density $&gt;2\times10^5$ cm$^{-3}$, a dust mass of $\sim$58 M$_\oplus$, and $\beta_{\rm mm}$&lt;1, implying the presence of grains $\sim$10$^3$ times larger than the typical ISM sizes. We provide the first spatially resolved observational evidence of large grains within an outflow cavity wall. Our results suggest that these grains have been transported from the inner disc to the envelope by protostellar winds and may subsequently fall back into the outer disc by gravity and/or via accretion streamers. This cycle provides longer time for grains to grow, playing a crucial role in the formation of planetesimals.</description>

      <title>Large databases of metal-poor stars corrected for three-dimensional and/or non-local thermodynamic equilibrium effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early chemical enrichment processes can be revealed by the careful study of metal-poor stars. In our Local Group, we can obtain spectra of individual stars to measure their precise, but not always accurate, chemical abundances. Unfortunately, stellar abundances are typically estimated under the simplistic assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). This can systematically alter both the abundance patterns of individual stars and global trends of chemical enrichment. The SAGA database compiles the largest catalogue of metal-poor stars in the Milky Way. For the first time, we provide the community with the SAGA catalogue fully corrected for non-LTE (NLTE) effects, using state-of-the-art publicly available grids. In addition, we present an easy-to-use online tool NLiTE that quickly provides NLTE corrections for large stellar samples. For further scientific exploration, NLiTE facilitates the comparison of different NLTE grids to investigate their intrinsic uncertainties. Finally, we compare the NLTE-SAGA catalogue with our cosmological galaxy formation and chemical evolution model, NEFERTITI. By accounting for NLTE effects, we can solve the long-standing discrepancy between models and observations in the abundance ratio of [C/Fe], the best tracer of the first stellar populations. At low [Fe/H]&lt;-3.5, models are unable to reproduce the high measured [C/Fe] in LTE, which are lowered in NLTE, aligning with simulations. Other elements are a mixed bag: some show improved agreement with models (e.g. Na) and others worse (e.g. Co). Few elemental ratios do not change significantly (e.g. [Mg/Fe], [Ca/Fe]). Properly accounting for NLTE effects is fundamental for interpreting the chemical abundances of metal-poor stars. Our NLiTE tool thus enables a meaningful comparison of stellar samples with stellar and chemical evolution models and low-metallicity gaseous environments at higher redshift.</description>

      <title>Can local White Dwarfs constrain Dark Matter interactions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether nearby white dwarfs (WDs) can constrain dark matter (DM) interactions with ordinary matter. As experimental sensitivity improves, driven by the Gaia mission, the sample volume of nearby WDs has been increasing over recent years. We carefully select a sample of ten cold, isolated, non-magnetic WDs within 13~pc of the Sun. We model their carbon-oxygen interior using a finite temperature relativistic equation of state and model atmospheres to infer their core temperatures. This enables us to perform a thorough estimation of the DM capture rate and evaporation mass using actual astrophysical observations. Given the low local DM density, we focus on DM that annihilates into long-lived mediators, which escape the WD and later decay into photons. While \textit{Fermi}-LAT data shows no significant gamma-ray excess, future telescopes, CTA North \&amp; South, LHAASO, SWGO, could probe DM-nucleon cross sections down to $\sim 10^{-41}~\text{cm}^2$ for DM masses above the TeV scale. Our results are competitive with current direct detection bounds (e.g., LZ) in the multi-TeV regime. This work underscores the importance of systematic WD studies in the broader landscape of DM detection and demonstrates the synergy between astrophysical and terrestrial searches in exploring DM interactions.</description>

      <title>Oort Cloud Ecology. III. The Sun left the parent star cluster shortly after the giant planets formed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sun was born in a clustered environment with 10,000 other stars. Being an isolated star today, the Sun must have left the nest. We do not directly know when that happened, how violent the ejection was, or how far the Solar siblings have drifted apart. The mass of the fragile outer Opic-Oort cloud, (between $r_{\rm inner} \sim 30,000$\,au and $200\,000$au from the Sun) and the orbital distribution of planetesimals in the inner Hills-Oort cloud (between $\sim 1000$\,au and $\sim 30\,000$ au) are sensitive to the dynamical processes involving the Sun in the parent cluster. We aim at understanding the extend to which observing the Oort cloud constrains the Sun's birth environment. This is achieved by a combination of theoretical arguments and N-body simulations. We show that the current mass of the Opic-Oort cloud (between 0.2 and $2.0$ Earth masses) is best explained if the Sun left the nest within $\sim 20$\,Myr after the giant planets formed and migrated. As a consequence, the possible dynamical encounter with another star carving the Kuiper belt, the Sun's abduction of Sedna, and other perturbations induced by nearby stars then must have happened shortly after the giant planets in the Solar system formed, but before the Sun left the parent cluster. Signatures of the time spend in the parent cluster must still be visible in the outer parts of the Solar system today. The strongest constraints will be the discovery of a population of relatively low-eccentricity ($e &lt; 0.9$) inner Oort-cloud (but $500 &lt; a &lt; 10^4$\,au) objects.</description>

      <title>Detection of Hydrocarbons in the Disk around an Actively-Accreting Planetary-Mass Object</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the 0.6--12-micron spectrum of Cha\,1107-7626, a 6-10 Jupiter-mass free-floating object in the $\sim$2\,Myr-old Chamaeleon-I star-forming region, from observations with the NIRSpec and MIRI instruments onboard the James Webb Space Telescope. We confirm that Cha\,1107-7626 is one of the lowest-mass objects known to harbor a dusty disk with infrared excess emission at wavelengths beyond 4 microns. Our NIRSpec data, and prior ground-based observations, provide strong evidence for ongoing accretion through Hydrogen recombination lines. In the mid-infrared spectrum, we detect unambiguously emission lines caused by methane (CH$_\mathrm{4}$) and ethylene (C$_\mathrm{2}$H$_\mathrm{4}$) in its circum-substellar disk. Our findings mean that Cha 1107-7626 is by far the lowest-mass object with hydrocarbons observed in its disk. The spectrum of the disk looks remarkably similar to that of ISO-ChaI 147, a very low mass star with a carbon-rich disk that is 10 to 20 times more massive than Cha\,1107-7626. The hydrocarbon lines can be accounted for with a model assuming gas temperatures of a few hundred Kelvin in the inner disk. The obvious similarities between the spectra of a low-mass star and a planetary-mass object indicate that the conditions in the inner disks can be similar across a wide range of central object masses.</description>

      <title>Statistical Properties of Predicted Blended Eclipsing Binary False Positives in PLATO LOPS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the planned launch of the PLAnetary Transit and Oscillation of stars (PLATO) satellite mission in 2026, an understanding of the stellar properties and spatial distribution of astrophysical false positives (FPs) is essential to ensure the limited ground-based spectroscopy resources are used efficiently to target the most likely genuine planetary transit (PT) candidates. In our previous paper, Bray et al. (2023), we presented the expected blended eclipsing binary false positive (BEB) percentage in the proposed Southern PLATO field, which we referred to as SPF0. This was obtained from a detailed statistical analysis of a complete synthetic rendering of SPF0. In this follow-up paper, we present a more detailed analysis of the synthetic binary population creating these BEBs including the apparent radii of the planets mimicked, distances from Earth, orbital periods and binary component masses and evolutionary state.We examine the properties of the BEBs from 400 new independent simulations where random orbital inclinations were assigned to all synthetic binaries in the entire SPF0 region. We consider BEBs created by all eclipses of non-compact remnant binaries. Finally we examine the BEBs most likely to be mistaken for planets in the habitable zone which we define as fully or partially eclipsing binaries with periods between 180 and 1,000 days satisfying our critical inclination angle check.</description>

      <title>Accretion of AGN Stars under Influence of Disk Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive stars can form within or be captured by AGN disks, influencing both the thermal structure and metallicity of the disk environment. In a previous work, we investigated isotropic accretion onto massive stars from a gas-rich, high-entropy background. Here, we consider a more realistic scenario by incorporating the stratified geometry of the background disk in our 3D radiation hydrodynamic simulatons. We find that accretion remains relatively isotropic when the disk is hot enough and the scale height is thicker than the accretion flow's nominal supersonic critical radius $R{crit}$ (sub-thermal). However, when the disk becomes cold, the accretion flow becomes significantly anisotropic (super-thermal). Escaping stellar and accretion luminosity can drive super-Eddington outflows in the polar region, while rapid accretion is sustained along the midplane. Eventually, the effective cross-section is constrained by the Hill radius and the disk scale height rather than the critical radius when the disk is cold enough. For our setup (stellar mass $\sim 50 M\odot$ and background density $\rho\sim 10^{-10}$ g/cm$^3$) the accretion rates is capped below $\sim 0.02M\odot$/year and the effective accretion parameter $\alpha\sim 10^{-1}$ over disk temperature range $3 - 7 \times 10^4$ K. Spiral arms facilitate inward mass flux by driving outward angular momentum transport. Gap-opening effects may further reduce the long-term accretion rate, albeit to confirm which requires global simulations evolved over much longer viscous timescales.</description>

      <title>The JCMT BISTRO-3 Survey: Variation of magnetic field orientations on parsec and sub-parsec scales in the massive star-forming region G28.34+0.06</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields play a significant role in star-forming processes on core to clump scales. We investigate magnetic field orientations and strengths in the massive star-forming clump P2 within the filamentary infrared dark cloud G28.34+0.06 using dust polarization observations made using SCUBA-2/POL-2 on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope as part of the B-field In STar-forming Region Observations (BISTRO) survey. We compare the magnetic field orientations at the clump scale of ~2 parsecs from these JCMT observations with those at the core scale of ~0.2 parsecs from archival ALMA data, finding that the magnetic field orientations on these two different scales are perpendicular to one another. We estimate the distribution of magnetic field strengths, which range from 50 to 430 {\mu}G over the clump. The region forming the core shows the highest magnetic field strength. We also obtain the distribution of mass-to-flux ratios across the clump. In the region surrounding the core, the mass-to-flux ratio is larger than 1, which indicates the magnetic field strength is insufficient to support the region against gravitational collapse. Therefore, the change in the magnetic field orientation from clump to core scales may be the result of gravitational collapse, with the field being pulled inward along with the flow of material under gravity.</description>

      <title>CORALIE radial-velocity search for companions around evolved stars (CASCADES) IV: New planetary systems around HD 87816, HD 94890, and HD 102888 and an update on HD 121056</title>

Abstract: With around 200 detections of exoplanets around giant stars to date, our knowledge of the population of exoplanets orbiting evolved hosts more massive than the Sun remains limited. The CORALIE radial-velocity search for companions around evolved stars (CASCADES) was launched in 2006 with the aim of improving our understanding of the demographics of exoplanets around intermediate-mass stars, by studying them once they have evolved off the main sequence. We intend to refine the current sample of known exoplanets orbiting intermediate-mass (1.5 - 5 M$_\odot$) giant stars of spectral types G and early K. We searched for exoplanets orbiting the four stars HD 87816, HD 94890, HD 102888, and HD 121056. We used data obtained with the CORALIE spectrograph, mounted on the Leonhard Euler Swiss telescope located at La Silla Observatory in Chile. We gathered high-precision radial-velocity measurements over more than ten years for each of the aforementioned targets. We started by performing a search for periodic signals in the radial-velocity time series of the four targets by using periodograms. Following this, we fit for a Keplerian model using the significant peak with the highest power of the periodogram as the starting guess for the period. We then subtracted this model and repeated the procedure iteratively on the residuals until no significant peaks were found. Finally, to explore the posterior distribution of our models, the final solution was determined using a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. We report the discovery of five new massive planets around HD 87816, HD 94890, and HD 102888 as well as the presence of a distant, potentially substellar, companion around HD 102888. We confirm the presence of a previously announced exoplanet orbiting the HD 121056 multi-object system with a period of 89 days and propose an update to the period of the outer companion.</description>

      <title>Classifying metal-poor stars with machine learning using nucleosynthesis calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the capabilities of machine learning (ML) to discern patterns in order to classify metal-poor stars. To do so, we train an ML model on a bank of nucleosynthesis calculations derived from hydrodynamic simulations for events such as neutron star mergers where the rapid ($r$) neutron capture process can take place. Likewise we consider a bank of calculations from simulations of the slow ($s$) neutron capture process and also consider a few calculations for the intermediate ($i$) neutron capture process. We demonstrate that the ML does well overall in recognizing the $s$ process from the $r$ process, and after training on theoretical calculations ML stellar assignments match conventional labels 87% of the time. We highlight that this method then points to stars that could benefit from additional observational measurements. We also demonstrate that the ML assigns some of the presently considered $i$-process stars to instead be of $r$ or $s$ in origin, but likewise, finds stars currently labeled as $s$ to be potentially more aligned with $i$ enrichment. This first application of ML to classify metal-poor star enrichment using theoretical nucleosynthesis calculations thus reveals the promise, and some challenges, associated with this new data-driven path forward.</description>

      <title>Search for activity in the centimeter band of Solar-type dwarfs with Earth-like planets on the RATAN-600 radio telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01791</link>

Abstract: The paper presents the results of multi-wave radio observations of sixteen red dwarfs with Earth-like planets in the habitable zones on RATAN-600. In the passage mode, radiometers of four frequency ranges of 22, 11, 4.7 and 2.3 GHz (1.38, 2.68, 6.38, 13.3 cm) were used with a sampling step of quasi-simultaneous registration of about $\sim 18$ Hz and an exposure duration (the time of passage of the instrument's directivity pattern) of 1.5 -- 15 s. Observations were carried out from 3 to 27 times in April-May 2018, while radio emission was not detected. Upper limits were established for its intensity in flares with a duration of 0.05 -- 10 s at the level of 80 -- 800 mJy (corresponding to a luminosity of $10^{23} - 10^{29}$ erg/s) and in a steady state with a luminosity of $10^{22} - 10^{27}$ erg/s. During the observations, 11 anomalous flux outlier at the level of 100 mJy were registered, which apparently have an atmospheric (thunderstorms, airplanes) origin. Assuming an artificial origin of the sought radio emission (transmission from inhabited planets), the upper limits of the power of hypothetical transmitters were $2\times 10^9 - 10^{15}$ W, interestingly that the lower boundary of this interval close to the power of terrestrial planetary radars.</description>

      <title>Intermingled open and closed magnetic field lines near the radial origin of the heliospheric current sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aims. To investigate the magnetic field geometry and waves in the region near the Sun where the heliospheric current sheet is formed. Methods. One good example of apparent open and closed field lines was found and its fields and plasmas were analyzed. Results. The radial component of the magnetic field (the Z-component) measured on the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) changed sign between 12:00 and 13:00 UT on March 30, 2024, when the spacecraft was at 13 solar radii. This sign change may have occurred because the spacecraft crossed the heliospheric current sheet on long open magnetic field lines or it may have occurred because the spacecraft crossed from one side of the equator to the other on much shorter closed magnetic field lines. During this crossing, two distinct regions having different magnetic field geometries, strahl flows, plasma densities, and electric field spectra were observed and identified as regions with open and closed magnetic field lines, respectively. The two regions intermingled on time scales less than 100 milliseconds to create a complex magnetic field geometry. The waves observed in both regions were electrostatic and composed of wide band signatures (in the open field lines regions) and well-structured frequency harmonics (in both the open and closed field lines regions). These harmonic frequencies correlated with the proton plasma frequency, fpp, with the lowest frequency at ~0.1fpp. This result plus the field aligned electric field perturbations and plasma density fluctuations, require that the observed intense electrostatic mode and associated harmonics were ion acoustic waves. The absence of broadband electrostatic signals in closed field line regions is explained by the lower (than in open field line regions) hot and core electron density and higher ratio of the electron plasma frequency to the electron gyrofrequency, suppressing wave generation.</description>

      <title>3D MHD wave propagation and energy transport in a simulated solar vortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12745v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic flux tubes in the presence of background rotational flows are abundant throughout the solar atmosphere and may act as conduits for MHD waves to transport energy throughout the solar atmosphere. Here we investigate the contribution from MHD waves to the Poynting flux in a 3D numerical simulation of a realistic solar atmosphere, modelling a structure resembling a solar vortex tube, using the PLUTO code in the presence of different plasma flow configurations. These simulations feature a closed magnetic loop system where a rotational flow is imposed at one foot-point in addition to photospheric perturbations acting as a wave driver mimicking those of p-modes. We find that a variety of MHD waves exist within the vortex tube, including sausage, kink and torsional Alfv\'{e}n waves, owing to the photospheric wave driver and the nature of the rotational flow itself. We demonstrate how the visual interpretation of different MHD modes becomes non-trivial when a background rotational flow is present compared to a static flux tube. By conducting a simulation both with and without the rotational plasma flow, we demonstrate how the perturbed Poynting flux increases in the presence of the rotational flow as the waves transport increased magnetic energy. We attribute this increase to the dynamical pressure from the rotational flow increasing the plasma density at the tube boundary, which acts to trap the wave energy more effectively inside the vortex. Moreover, we demonstrate how the Poynting flux is always directed upwards in weakly twisted magnetic flux tubes.</description>

      <title>Discovery of resonating integration modes in triple-mode high-amplitude $\delta$ Scuti stars: A new evolutionary phase indicator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-amplitude $\delta$ Scuti stars (HADS) that pulsate in their first three radial modes are rare in current samples. Here, we analyse five such triple-mode HADS observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and {report that the previously considered second overtone mode ($f_2$) is actually the non-radial component of a resonating integration mode (RI mode, resulting from resonance between a radial p-mode and a non-radial p-g mixed mode), which shows significant amplitude and frequency variations over short timescales (approximately 20 days).} This RI mode appears to be widespread among these stars. Notably, all five stars are in the post-main sequence evolutionary phase, actively crossing the Hertzsprung gap. These stars offer valuable insights into stellar evolution during the Hertzsprung gap, which is one of the most rapid evolutionary stages in a star's life.</description>

      <title>Discovery of the binary nature of the magnetospheric B-type star $\rho$ Oph A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nearby B-type star $\rho$ Oph A was recently identified as a rapidly rotating magnetic B-type star with variable radio and X-ray emission consistent with a magnetospheric origin. We present a high-resolution spectropolarimetric time series obtained with ESPaDOnS, which we use to perform a magnetic analysis using least-squares deconvolution (LSD). We find that $\rho$ Oph A is a spectroscopic binary consisting of two B-type stars with masses of about 8 and 10 $M_\odot$ on a slightly eccentric 88-day orbit, with the magnetic field being associated with the smaller Ab component. This leads to $\rho$ Oph Ab's 4 kG surface magnetic dipole being approximately twice as strong as the previously reported 2 kG. The oblique rotator model derived from the longitudinal magnetic field curve agrees well with the LSD Stokes $V$ profiles, indicating that the magnetic field is likely to be very nearly dipolar. The orbital and rotational axes appear to be aligned. We report for the first time $\rho$ Oph Ab's magnetospheric H$\alpha$ emission, which is consistent with an origin in a centrifugal magnetosphere. We also demonstrate that $\rho$ Oph Ab's light curve can be recovered from the previously reported {\em Kepler-2} light curve of $\rho$ Oph C, and that it demonstrates prominent magnetospheric eclipses similar to those of $\sigma$ Ori E, and which can be reproduced using a dipolar Rigidly Rotating Magnetosphere model. Both H$\alpha$ and the light curve are indicative of a strongly asymmetric magnetosphere. All indications are that $\rho$ Oph Ab's magnetic field is essentially dipolar, meaning that contributions from higher-order multipoles probably cannot explain the strong asymmetry in the magnetosphere. Only two other stars show comparable degrees of asymmetry, both of which are also close binaries, suggesting that binarity can affect the magnetospheric plasma distributions.</description>

      <title>The JWST EXCELS survey: an extremely metal-poor galaxy at $z=8.271$ hosting an unusual population of massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11099v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the rest-frame optical ($\lambda \simeq 3100-5600 \,$\r{A}) spectrum of a $\mathrm{log}_{10}(M_*/\mathrm{M_\odot}) = 8.6$ star-forming galaxy at $z=8.271$ (EXCELS-63107) from JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution observations taken as part of the EXCELS survey. EXCELS-63107 is a compact object consistent with the size of local star-forming cluster complexes ($r_e &lt; 200 \, \rm{pc}$) and has an extremely steep UV continuum measured from JWST/NIRCam photometry ($\beta=-3.3\pm0.3$). The JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectrum of EXCELS-63107 is notable for its strong [OIII]$\lambda4363$ auroral-line emission relative to the [OIII]$\lambda5007$ forbidden line. Via a detailed emission-line and photoionization-modelling analysis, we find that the the observed properties of EXCELS-63107 are consistent with the presence of an ionizing source with an effective temperature of $T_{\rm eff} \gtrsim 80 \, 000\,\rm{K}$ heating ionized gas with a density of $n_e &lt; 10^4 \, \rm{cm}^{-3}$ to a volume-averaged electron temperature of $T_e \simeq 34 \, 000\,\rm{K}$. Crucially, we find that stellar population models assuming a standard IMF are not capable of producing the required heating. We determine an oxygen abundance of ${12+\mathrm{log(O/H)}= 6.89^{+0.26}_{-0.21}}$ which is one of the lowest directly constrained oxygen abundances measured in any galaxy to date, and $\simeq 10 \times$ lower than is typical for $z\simeq8$ galaxies with the same stellar mass. The extremely low metallicity of EXCELS-63107 places it in a regime in which theoretical models expect a transition to a top-heavy IMF, and we speculate that a $\simeq 10-30 \, \times$ excess of $M &gt; 50 \, \rm{M}_{\odot}$ stars is one plausible explanation for its observed properties. However, more exotic scenarios, such as Pop III star formation within a mildly enriched halo, are also consistent with the observations.</description>
