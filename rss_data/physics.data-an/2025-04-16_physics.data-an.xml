      <title>Testing of tempered fractional Brownian motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose here a testing methodology based on the autocovariance, detrended moving average, and time-averaged mean-squared displacement statistics for tempered fractional Brownian motions (TFBMs) which are related to the notions of semi-long range dependence and transient anomalous diffusion. In this framework, we consider three types of TFBMs: two with a tempering factor incorporated into their moving-average representation, and one with a tempering parameter added to the autocorrelation formula. We illustrate their dynamics with the use of quantile lines. Using the proposed methodology, we provide a comprehensive power analysis of the tests. It appears that the tests allow distinguishing between the tempered processes with different Hurst parameters.</description>

      <title>Deep Variational Multivariate Information Bottleneck -- A Framework for Variational Losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03311v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational dimensionality reduction methods are widely used for their accuracy, generative capabilities, and robustness. We introduce a unifying framework that generalizes both such as traditional and state-of-the-art methods. The framework is based on an interpretation of the multivariate information bottleneck, trading off the information preserved in an encoder graph (defining what to compress) against that in a decoder graph (defining a generative model for data). Using this approach, we rederive existing methods, including the deep variational information bottleneck, variational autoencoders, and deep multiview information bottleneck. We naturally extend the deep variational CCA (DVCCA) family to beta-DVCCA and introduce a new method, the deep variational symmetric information bottleneck (DVSIB). DSIB, the deterministic limit of DVSIB, connects to modern contrastive learning approaches such as Barlow Twins, among others. We evaluate these methods on Noisy MNIST and Noisy CIFAR-100, showing that algorithms better matched to the structure of the problem like DVSIB and beta-DVCCA produce better latent spaces as measured by classification accuracy, dimensionality of the latent variables, sample efficiency, and consistently outperform other approaches under comparable conditions. Additionally, we benchmark against state-of-the-art models, achieving superior or competitive accuracy. Our results demonstrate that this framework can seamlessly incorporate diverse multi-view representation learning algorithms, providing a foundation for designing novel, problem-specific loss functions.</description>

      <title>The ecological forecast limit revisited: Potential, actual and relative system predictability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ecological forecasts are model-based statements about currently unknown ecosystem states in time or space. For a model forecast to be useful to inform decision makers, model validation and verification determine adequateness. The measure of forecast goodness that can be translated into a limit up to which a forecast is acceptable is known as the 'forecast limit'. While verification in weather forecasting follows strict criteria with established metrics and forecast limits, assessments of ecological forecasting models still remain experiment-specific, and forecast limits are rarely reported. As such, users of ecological forecasts remain uninformed of how far into the future statements can be trusted. In this work, we synthesise existing approaches to define empirical forecast limits in a unified framework for assessing ecological predictability and offer recipes for their computation. We distinguish the model's potential and absolute forecast limit, and show how a benchmark model can help determine its relative forecast limit. The approaches are demonstrated with three case studies from population, ecosystem, and Earth system research. We found that forecast limits can be computed with three requirements: A verification reference, a scoring function, and a predictive error tolerance. Within our framework, forecast limits are defined for practically any ecological forecast and support research on ecological predictability analysis.</description>

      <title>An effective method for profiling core-periphery structures in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Profiling core-periphery structures in networks has attracted significant attention, leading to the development of various methods. Among these, the rich-core method is distinguished for being entirely parameter-free and scalable to large networks. However, the cores it identifies are not always structurally cohesive, as they may lack high link density. Here, we propose an improved method building upon the rich-core framework. Instead of relying on node degree, our approach incorporates both the node's coreness $k$ and its centrality within the $k$-core. We apply the approach to twelve real-world networks, and find that the cores identified are generally denser compared to those derived from the rich-core method. Additionally, we demonstrate that the proposed method provides a natural way for identifying an exceptionally dense core, i.e., a clique, which often approximates or even matches the maximum clique in many real-world networks. Furthermore, we extend the method to multiplex networks, and show its effectiveness in identifying dense multiplex cores across several well-studied datasets. Our study may offer valuable insights into exploring the meso-scale properties of complex networks.</description>
