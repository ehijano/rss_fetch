      <title>Towards a quantum synapse for quantum sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a step in the architectural design of a quantum processing or sensing system with control and signaling, an attempt is made at putting in parallel functional properties of the random flows between neurons through electrical synapses, and quantum particle flows inside a quantum processing system mimicking biological processes. Based on a simplified dynamic electrical synapse model, a quantum synapse circuit design is proposed. This is extended to the case of bidirectional flows through a synapse, highlighting the possible role of quantum synapse circuits as highly parallel controlled interfaces crucial in sensing and sensor fusion systems. A short status of the quantum simulation is provided.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of Classical and Post-Quantum Cryptographic Algorithms in the Era of Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of quantum computing poses a significant threat to the foundational cryptographic algorithms that secure modern digital communications. Protocols such as HTTPS, digital certificates, and public key infrastructures (PKIs) heavily rely on cryptographic primitives like RSA, ECC, and Diffie-Hellman, which are vulnerable to quantum attacks -- most notably Shor's algorithm. This paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis between classical cryptographic algorithms currently in widespread use and emerging post-quantum cryptographic schemes designed to withstand quantum adversaries. We review the cryptographic mechanisms underpinning modern internet security, outline the mathematical foundations of quantum attacks, and evaluate the security, performance, and implementation feasibility of quantum-resistant alternatives such as Kyber, Dilithium, and Falcon. Additionally, we assess the hybrid approaches currently being explored by institutions and tech companies to enable a smooth transition to post-quantum cryptography. By providing an in-depth comparison, this study aims to guide researchers, developers, and policymakers in understanding the critical implications of quantum computing on cryptographic infrastructures and the necessary steps for securing communications in the quantum era.</description>

      <title>QDockBank: A Dataset for Ligand Docking on Protein Fragments Predicted on Utility-Level Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein structure prediction is a core challenge in computational biology, particularly for fragments within ligand-binding regions, where accurate modeling is still difficult. Quantum computing offers a novel first-principles modeling paradigm, but its application is currently limited by hardware constraints, high computational cost, and the lack of a standardized benchmarking dataset. In this work, we present QDockBank-the first large-scale protein fragment structure dataset generated entirely using utility-level quantum computers, specifically designed for protein-ligand docking tasks. QDockBank comprises 55 protein fragments extracted from ligand-binding pockets. The dataset was generated through tens of hours of execution on superconducting quantum processors, making it the first quantum-based protein structure dataset with a total computational cost exceeding one million USD. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that structures predicted by QDockBank outperform those predicted by AlphaFold2 and AlphaFold3 in terms of both RMSD and docking affinity scores. QDockBank serves as a new benchmark for evaluating quantum-based protein structure prediction.</description>

      <title>Managing Escalation in Off-the-Shelf Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01056v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: U.S. national security customers have begun to utilize large language models, including enterprise versions of ``off-the-shelf'' models (e.g., ChatGPT) familiar to the public. This uptake will likely accelerate. However, recent studies suggest that off-the-shelf large language models frequently suggest escalatory actions when prompted with geopolitical or strategic scenarios. We demonstrate two simple, non-technical interventions to control these tendencies. Introducing these interventions into the experimental wargame design of a recent study, we substantially reduce escalation throughout the game. Calls to restrict the use of large language models in national security applications are thus premature. The U.S. government is already, and will continue, employing large language models for scenario planning and suggesting courses of action. Rather than warning against such applications, this study acknowledges the imminent adoption of large language models, and provides actionable measures to align them with national security goals, including escalation management.</description>

      <title>Conquering High Packet-Loss Erasure: MoE Swin Transformer-Based Video Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication with joint semantic-channel coding robustly transmits diverse data modalities but faces challenges in mitigating semantic information loss due to packet drops in packet-based systems. Under current protocols, packets with errors are discarded, preventing the receiver from utilizing erroneous semantic data for robust decoding. To address this issue, a packet-loss-resistant MoE Swin Transformer-based Video Semantic Communication (MSTVSC) system is proposed in this paper. Semantic vectors are encoded by MSTVSC and transmitted through upper-layer protocol packetization. To investigate the impact of the packetization, a theoretical analysis of the packetization strategy is provided. To mitigate the semantic loss caused by packet loss, a 3D CNN at the receiver recovers missing information using un-lost semantic data and an packet-loss mask matrix. Semantic-level interleaving is employed to reduce concentrated semantic loss from packet drops. To improve compression, a common-individual decomposition approach is adopted, with downsampling applied to individual information to minimize redundancy. The model is lightweighted for practical deployment. Extensive simulations and comparisons demonstrate strong performance, achieving an MS-SSIM greater than 0.6 and a PSNR exceeding 20 dB at a 90% packet loss rate.</description>

      <title>Introduction to QUDO, Tensor QUDO and HOBO formulations: Qudits, Equivalences, Knapsack Problem, Traveling Salesman Problem and Combinatorial Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a brief review and introduction to Quadratic Unconstrained D-ary Optimization (QUDO), Tensor Quadratic Unconstrained D-ary Optimization (T-QUDO) and Higher-Order Unconstrained Binary Optimization (HOBO) formulations for combinatorial optimization problems. We also show their equivalences. To help their understanding, we make some examples for the knapsack problem, traveling salesman problem and different combinatorial games. The games chosen to exemplify are: Hashiwokakero, N-Queens, Kakuro, Inshi no heya, and Peg Solitaire. Although some of these games have already been formulated in a QUBO formulation, we are going to approach them with more general formulations, allowing their execution in new quantum or quantum-inspired optimization algorithms. This can be an easier way to introduce these more complicated formulations for harder problems.</description>

      <title>Thermal Implications of Non-Uniform Power in BSPDN-Enabled 2.5D/3D Chiplet-based Systems-in-Package using Nanosheet Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in nanosheet technologies have significantly increased power densities, exacerbating thermal management challenges in 2.5D/3D chiplet-based Systems-in-Package (SiP). While traditional thermal analyses often employ uniform power maps to simplify computational complexity, this practice neglects localized heating effects, leading to inaccuracies in thermal estimations, especially when comparing power delivery networks (PDN) in 3D integration. This work examines the thermal impact of non-uniform power distributions on SiPs utilizing frontside (FSPDN) and backside (BSPDN) power delivery approaches. Using high-resolution thermal simulations with non-uniform power maps at resolutions down to 5 micrometers, we demonstrate that uniform power assumptions substantially underestimate peak temperatures and fail to reveal critical thermal differences between BSPDN and FSPDN configurations in 3D scenarios. Our results highlight that BSPDN configurations in 3D, although beneficial in simplified uniform scenarios, exhibit pronounced thermal penalties under realistic, localized workloads due to limited lateral heat spreading. These findings emphasize the necessity of adopting fine-grained, workload-aware power maps in early-stage thermal modeling to enable accurate PDN assessment and informed thermal-aware design decisions in advanced nanosheet-based 3D SiP.</description>

      <title>Exploring Agentic Artificial Intelligence Systems: Towards a Typological Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are evolving beyond passive tools into autonomous agents capable of reasoning, adapting, and acting with minimal human intervention. Despite their growing presence, a structured framework is lacking to classify and compare these systems. This paper develops a typology of agentic AI systems, introducing eight dimensions that define their cognitive and environmental agency in an ordinal structure. Using a multi-phase methodological approach, we construct and refine this typology, which is then evaluated through a human-AI hybrid approach and further distilled into constructed types. The framework enables researchers and practitioners to analyze varying levels of agency in AI systems. By offering a structured perspective on the progression of AI capabilities, the typology provides a foundation for assessing current systems and anticipating future developments in agentic AI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The article explores an encoding and structural information processing approach using sparse bit vectors and fixed-length linear vectors. The following are presented: a discrete method of speculative stochastic dimensionality reduction of multidimensional code and linear spaces with linear asymptotic complexity; a geometric method for obtaining discrete embeddings of an organised code space that reflect the internal structure of a given modality. The structure and properties of a code space are investigated using three modalities as examples: morphology of Russian and English languages, and immunohistochemical markers. Parallels are drawn between the resulting map of the code space layout and so-called pinwheels appearing on the mammalian neocortex. A cautious assumption is made about similarities between neocortex organisation and processes happening in our models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the role of gamification in enhancing academic library services in India by surveying library leaders across various institutions. Using game-like elements in non-game contexts, gamification can boost user engagement and improve services such as information literacy and research consultations. Findings reveal moderate awareness and generally positive perceptions of gamification's effectiveness. However, challenges like insufficient staff expertise, infrastructure, and limited funding hinder implementation. The study emphasises the need for additional resources, including staff training and technological upgrades, to unlock the full potential of gamification in academic libraries.</description>

      <title>BioDisco: Multi-agent hypothesis generation with dual-mode evidence, iterative feedback and temporal evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying novel hypotheses is essential to scientific research, yet this process risks being overwhelmed by the sheer volume and complexity of available information. Existing automated methods often struggle to generate novel and evidence-grounded hypotheses, lack robust iterative refinement and rarely undergo rigorous temporal evaluation for future discovery potential. To address this, we propose BioDisco, a multi-agent framework that draws upon language model-based reasoning and a dual-mode evidence system (biomedical knowledge graphs and automated literature retrieval) for grounded novelty, integrates an internal scoring and feedback loop for iterative refinement, and validates performance through pioneering temporal and human evaluations and a Bradley-Terry paired comparison model to provide statistically-grounded assessment. Our evaluations demonstrate superior novelty and significance over ablated configurations representative of existing agentic architectures. Designed for flexibility and modularity, BioDisco allows seamless integration of custom language models or knowledge graphs, and can be run with just a few lines of code. We anticipate researchers using this practical tool as a catalyst for the discovery of new hypotheses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the feasibility of using LLMs for Automated Exploit Generation (AEG) against vulnerable smart contracts. We present \textsc{ReX}, a framework integrating LLM-based exploit synthesis with the Foundry testing suite, enabling the automated generation and validation of proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits. We evaluate five state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude Opus 4, DeepSeek, and Qwen3 Plus) on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world smart contracts affected by known high-impact exploits. Our results show that modern LLMs can reliably generate functional PoC exploits for diverse vulnerability types, with success rates reaching up to 92\%. Notably, Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-4.1 consistently outperform others in both synthetic and real-world scenarios. We further analyze factors influencing AEG effectiveness, including model capabilities, contract structure, and vulnerability types. We also collect the first curated dataset of real-world PoC exploits to support future research.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models for Future Networks and Communications: A Comprehensive Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of Generative AI (GenAI) in recent years has catalyzed transformative advances in wireless communications and networks. Among the members of the GenAI family, Diffusion Models (DMs) have risen to prominence as a powerful option, capable of handling complex, high-dimensional data distribution, as well as consistent, noise-robust performance. In this survey, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundations and practical applications of DMs across future communication systems. We first provide an extensive tutorial of DMs and demonstrate how they can be applied to enhance optimizers, reinforcement learning and incentive mechanisms, which are popular approaches for problems in wireless networks. Then, we review and discuss the DM-based methods proposed for emerging issues in future networks and communications, including channel modeling and estimation, signal detection and data reconstruction, integrated sensing and communication, resource management in edge computing networks, semantic communications and other notable issues. We conclude the survey with highlighting technical limitations of DMs and their applications, as well as discussing future research directions.</description>

      <title>Energy-Predictive Planning for Optimizing Drone Service Delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel Energy-Predictive Drone Service (EPDS) framework for efficient package delivery within a skyway network. The EPDS framework incorporates a formal modeling of an EPDS and an adaptive bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) machine learning model. This model predicts the energy status and stochastic arrival times of other drones operating in the same skyway network. Leveraging these predictions, we develop a heuristic optimization approach for composite drone services. This approach identifies the most time-efficient and energy-efficient skyway path and recharging schedule for each drone in the network. We conduct extensive experiments using a real-world drone flight dataset to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>HeadZoom: Hands-Free Zooming and Panning for 2D Image Navigation Using Head Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce \textit{HeadZoom}, a hands-free interaction technique for navigating two-dimensional visual content using head movements. The system enables fluid zooming and panning by only using real-time head tracking. It supports natural control in applications such as map exploration, radiograph inspection, and image browsing, particularly where physical interaction is limited. We evaluated HeadZoom in a within-subjects user study comparing three interaction techniques-Static, Tilt Zoom, and Parallel Zoom-across spatial, error, and subjective metrics. Results show that Parallel Zoom significantly reduced total head movement compared to Static and Tilt modes. Users reported significantly lower perceived exertion for Parallel Zoom, confirming its suitability for prolonged or precision-based tasks. By minimising movement demands while maintaining task effectiveness, HeadZoom advances the design of head-based 2D interaction in VR, creating new opportunities for immersive, accessible, and hands-free systems for image exploration.</description>

      <title>RouteMark: A Fingerprint for Intellectual Property Attribution in Routing-based Model Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model merging via Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a scalable solution for consolidating multiple task-specific models into a unified sparse architecture, where each expert is derived from a model fine-tuned on a distinct task. While effective for multi-task integration, this paradigm introduces a critical yet underexplored challenge: how to attribute and protect the intellectual property (IP) of individual experts after merging. We propose RouteMark, a framework for IP protection in merged MoE models through the design of expert routing fingerprints. Our key insight is that task-specific experts exhibit stable and distinctive routing behaviors under probing inputs. To capture these patterns, we construct expert-level fingerprints using two complementary statistics: the Routing Score Fingerprint (RSF), quantifying the intensity of expert activation, and the Routing Preference Fingerprint (RPF), characterizing the input distribution that preferentially activates each expert. These fingerprints are reproducible, task-discriminative, and lightweight to construct. For attribution and tampering detection, we introduce a similarity-based matching algorithm that compares expert fingerprints between a suspect and a reference (victim) model. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks and CLIP-based MoE architectures show that RouteMark consistently yields high similarity for reused experts and clear separation from unrelated ones. Moreover, it remains robust against both structural tampering (expert replacement, addition, deletion) and parametric tampering (fine-tuning, pruning, permutation), outperforming weight- and activation-based baseliness. Our work lays the foundation for RouteMark as a practical and broadly applicable framework for IP verification in MoE-based model merging.</description>

      <title>BVQC: A Backdoor-style Watermarking Scheme for Variational Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) have emerged as a powerful quantum computing paradigm, demonstrating a scaling advantage for problems intractable for classical computation. As VQCs require substantial resources and specialized expertise for their design, they represent significant intellectual properties (IPs). However, existing quantum circuit watermarking techniques suffer from two primary drawbacks: (1) watermarks can be removed during re-compilation of the circuits, and (2) these methods significantly increase task loss due to the extensive length of the inserted watermarks across multiple compilation stages. To address these challenges, we propose BVQC, a backdoor-based watermarking technique for VQCs that preserves the original loss in typical execution settings, while deliberately increasing the loss to a predefined level during watermark extraction. Additionally, BVQC employs a grouping algorithm to minimize the watermark task's interference with the base task, ensuring optimal accuracy for the base task. BVQC retains the original compilation workflow, ensuring robustness against re-compilation. Our evaluations show that BVQC greatly reduces Probabilistic Proof of Authorship (PPA) changes by 9.89e-3 and ground truth distance (GTD) by 0.089 compared to prior watermarking technologies.</description>

      <title>EgoTrigger: Toward Audio-Driven Image Capture for Human Memory Enhancement in All-Day Energy-Efficient Smart Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All-day smart glasses are likely to emerge as platforms capable of continuous contextual sensing, uniquely positioning them for unprecedented assistance in our daily lives. Integrating the multi-modal AI agents required for human memory enhancement while performing continuous sensing, however, presents a major energy efficiency challenge for all-day usage. Achieving this balance requires intelligent, context-aware sensor management. Our approach, EgoTrigger, leverages audio cues from the microphone to selectively activate power-intensive cameras, enabling efficient sensing while preserving substantial utility for human memory enhancement. EgoTrigger uses a lightweight audio model (YAMNet) and a custom classification head to trigger image capture from hand-object interaction (HOI) audio cues, such as the sound of a drawer opening or a medication bottle being opened. In addition to evaluating on the QA-Ego4D dataset, we introduce and evaluate on the Human Memory Enhancement Question-Answer (HME-QA) dataset. Our dataset contains 340 human-annotated first-person QA pairs from full-length Ego4D videos that were curated to ensure that they contained audio, focusing on HOI moments critical for contextual understanding and memory. Our results show EgoTrigger can use 54% fewer frames on average, significantly saving energy in both power-hungry sensing components (e.g., cameras) and downstream operations (e.g., wireless transmission), while achieving comparable performance on datasets for an episodic memory task. We believe this context-aware triggering strategy represents a promising direction for enabling energy-efficient, functional smart glasses capable of all-day use -- supporting applications like helping users recall where they placed their keys or information about their routine activities (e.g., taking medications).</description>

      <title>DIRF: A Framework for Digital Identity Protection and Clone Governance in Agentic AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement and widespread adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI) pose significant threats to the integrity of personal identity, including digital cloning, sophisticated impersonation, and the unauthorized monetization of identity-related data. Mitigating these risks necessitates the development of robust AI-generated content detection systems, enhanced legal frameworks, and ethical guidelines. This paper introduces the Digital Identity Rights Framework (DIRF), a structured security and governance model designed to protect behavioral, biometric, and personality-based digital likeness attributes to address this critical need. Structured across nine domains and 63 controls, DIRF integrates legal, technical, and hybrid enforcement mechanisms to secure digital identity consent, traceability, and monetization. We present the architectural foundations, enforcement strategies, and key use cases supporting the need for a unified framework. This work aims to inform platform builders, legal entities, and regulators about the essential controls needed to enforce identity rights in AI-driven systems.</description>

      <title>Solving Sudoku Using Oscillatory Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of Oscillatory Neural Networks (ONNs) to solving Sudoku puzzles, presenting a biologically inspired approach based on phase synchronization. Each cell is represented by an oscillator whose phase encodes a digit, and the synchronization is governed by the Kuramoto model. The system dynamically evolves towards a valid solution by having the puzzle constraints encoded into the weight matrix of the network, and through a proposed novel phase mapping of the Sudoku digits. Experimental results show that ONNs achieve high performance for puzzles with moderate difficulty and outperform Hopfield Neural Networks, particularly in cases with up to 20 initially unknown values. Although the performance decreases with increased ambiguity, ONNs still produce correct solutions in some of the iterations, cases in which the baseline Hopfield Neural Network algorithm fails. The findings support ONNs as a viable alternative for solving constraint optimization problems and reinforce their relevance within emerging non-von Neumann computing paradigms.</description>

      <title>ASDR: Exploiting Adaptive Sampling and Data Reuse for CIM-based Instant Neural Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) offer significant promise for generating photorealistic images and videos. However, existing mainstream neural rendering models often fall short in meeting the demands for immediacy and power efficiency in practical applications. Specifically, these models frequently exhibit irregular access patterns and substantial computational overhead, leading to undesirable inference latency and high power consumption. Computing-in-memory (CIM), an emerging computational paradigm, has the potential to address these access bottlenecks and reduce the power consumption associated with model execution.
  To bridge the gap between model performance and real-world scene requirements, we propose an algorithm-architecture co-design approach, abbreviated as ASDR, a CIM-based accelerator supporting efficient neural rendering. At the algorithmic level, we propose two rendering optimization schemes: (1) Dynamic sampling by online sensing of the rendering difficulty of different pixels, thus reducing access memory and computational overhead. (2) Reducing MLP overhead by decoupling and approximating the volume rendering of color and density. At the architecture level, we design an efficient ReRAM-based CIM architecture with efficient data mapping and reuse microarchitecture. Experiments demonstrate that our design can achieve up to $9.55\times$ and $69.75\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art NeRF accelerators and Xavier NX GPU in graphics rendering tasks with only $0.1$ PSNR loss.</description>

      <title>RACE-IT: A Reconfigurable Analog CAM-Crossbar Engine for In-Memory Transformer Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer models represent the cutting edge of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and excel in a wide range of machine learning tasks. However, processing these models demands significant computational resources and results in a substantial memory footprint. While In-memory Computing (IMC)offers promise for accelerating Vector-Matrix Multiplications(VMMs) with high computational parallelism and minimal data movement, employing it for other crucial DNN operators remains a formidable task. This challenge is exacerbated by the extensive use of complex activation functions, Softmax, and data-dependent matrix multiplications (DMMuls) within Transformer models. To address this challenge, we introduce a Reconfigurable Analog Computing Engine (RACE) by enhancing Analog Content Addressable Memories (ACAMs) to support broader operations. Based on the RACE, we propose the RACE-IT accelerator (meaning RACE for In-memory Transformers) to enable efficient analog-domain execution of all core operations of Transformer models. Given the flexibility of our proposed RACE in supporting arbitrary computations, RACE-IT is well-suited for adapting to emerging and non-traditional DNN architectures without requiring hardware modifications. We compare RACE-IT with various accelerators. Results show that RACE-IT increases performance by 453x and 15x, and reduces energy by 354x and 122x over the state-of-the-art GPUs and existing Transformer-specific IMC accelerators, respectively.</description>

Abstract: Accurate and reliable diagnosis of diseases is crucial in enabling timely medical treatment and enhancing patient survival rates. In recent years, Machine Learning has revolutionized diagnostic practices by creating classification models capable of identifying diseases. However, these classification problems often suffer from significant class imbalances, which can inhibit the effectiveness of traditional models. Therefore, the interest in Quantum models has arisen, driven by the captivating promise of overcoming the limitations of the classical counterpart thanks to their ability to express complex patterns by mapping data in a higher-dimensional computational space.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Audio-Visual Speech Enhancement Using Pre-trained Visual Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech enhancement in audio-only settings remains challenging, particularly in the presence of interfering speakers. This paper presents a simple yet effective real-time audio-visual speech enhancement (AVSE) system, RAVEN, which isolates and enhances the on-screen target speaker while suppressing interfering speakers and background noise. We investigate how visual embeddings learned from audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) and active speaker detection (ASD) contribute to AVSE across different SNR conditions and numbers of interfering speakers. Our results show concatenating embeddings from AVSR and ASD models provides the greatest improvement in low-SNR, multi-speaker environments, while AVSR embeddings alone perform best in noise-only scenarios. In addition, we develop a real-time streaming system that operates on a computer CPU and we provide a video demonstration and code repository. To our knowledge, this is the first open-source implementation of a real-time AVSE system.</description>
