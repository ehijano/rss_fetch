      <title>Singlet polaron theory of low-energy optical excitations in NiPS$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-matter interactions can be used as a tool to realize novel many-body states of matter and to study the interplay between electronic and magnetic degrees of freedom. In particular, tightly bound many-body states that behave as coherent quasi-particles are rare, and may lead to unconventional technological applications beyond the semi-conductor paradigm, particularly if these excitations are bosonic and can condense. Two-dimensional magnetic systems present a pristine platform to realize and study such states. We construct a theory that explains the low-energy optical excitations at 1.476 eV and 1.498 eV observed by photoluminiscence, optical absorption, and RIXS in the van der Waals antiferromagnet NiPS$_3$. Using \textit{ab initio} methods, we construct a two-band Hubbard model for two \textit{effective} Ni orbitals of the original lattice. The dominant effective hopping corresponds to third-nearest neighbours. This model exhibits two triplet-singlet excitations of energy near two times the Hund exchange. From perturbation theory, we obtain an effective model for the movement of the singlets in an antiferromagnetic background, that we solve using a generalized self-consistent Born approximation. These singlet excitations, dressed by a cloud of magnons, move coherently as polaronic-like quasi-particles, "singlet polarons". Our theory explains the main features of the observed spectra.</description>

      <title>Fingerprints of Mott and Slater gaps in the core-level photoemission spectra of antiferromagnetic iridates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Ir $4f$ core-level hard-x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES) experiments conducted across antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering transition in Ruddlesden-Popper iridates Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ and Sr$_3$Ir$_2$O$_7$. The Ir $4f$ spectra exhibit distinct changes between the AFM and paramagnetic (PM) phases, with the spectral difference $I_\text{PM}-I_\text{AFM}$ showing a contrasting behavior in the two compounds. By employing computational simulations using the local-density approximation combined with the dynamical mean-field theory method, we elucidate that $I_\text{PM}-I_\text{AFM}$ primary reflects the Slater or Mott-Hubbard character of the AFM insulating state rather than material specific details. This sensitivity to fine low-energy electronic structure arises from the dependence of charge-transfer responses to the sudden creation of a localized core hole on both metal-insulator transitions and long-range AFM ordering. Our result broadens the applications of core-level HAXPES as a tool for characterization of electronic structure.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering in Ca3Ru2O7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the electronic structure of the transition metal oxide Ca3Ru2O7 within density functional theory using the generalized gradient approximation while considering strong Coulomb correlations in the framework of the fully relativistic spin-polarized Dirac linear muffin-tin orbital band-structure method. Ca3Ru2O7 can be classified as a Mott insulator since it was expected to be metallic from band structure calculations. We have investigated the resonant inelastic x-ray scattering spectra at the Ru and Ca K, L3, and M3 edges as well as at the O K edge. The experimentally measured resonance inelastic x-ray spectrum of Ca3Ru2O7 at the Ru L3 edge possesses a sharp feature below 2 electron-volts corresponding to transitions within the Ru t_2g levels. The excitation located from 2 to 4 electron-volts is due to t2g -&gt; e_g transitions. The third wide structure situated at 4.5-11 electron-volts appears due to transitions between the Ru 4dO states derived from the tails of oxygen 2p states and t_2g and e_g states. The measured resonance inelastic x-ray spectra at the Ru L3 and M3 edges are very similar. However, the corresponding measured resonance inelastic x-ray spectra at the Ca site quite differ from each other due to the significant difference in the widths of core-levels.</description>

      <title>Kitaev-Heisenberg cobaltates: Coulomb exchange as leading nearest-neighbor interaction mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A range of honeycomb Co oxide compounds has been proposed and investigated in the search for a topological Kitaev spin liquid. Analyzing the quantum chemistry of interacting magnetic moments in Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$, a representative $LS$-coupled $t_{2g}^5e_g^2$ magnet, we find that the Kitaev and off-diagonal $\Gamma$ interactions are sizable and antiferromagnetic but still weaker than the Heisenberg contribution. Except $\Gamma$', all nearest-neighbor couplings are mainly determined by Coulomb exchange, different from current representations of anisotropic interaction terms. This highlights the limitations of existing anisotropic models and the need for systematic wave-function quantum chemical studies to clarify exchange mechanisms in Kitaev-Heisenberg systems.</description>

      <title>Collective entanglement in quantum materials with competing orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate entanglement detection in quantum materials through criteria based on the simultaneous suppression of collective matter excitations. Unlike other detection schemes, these criteria can be applied to continuous and unbounded variables. By considering a system of interacting dipoles on a lattice, we show the detection of collective entanglement arising from two different physical mechanisms, namely, the ferroelectric ordering and the dressing of matter degrees of freedom by light. In the latter case, the detection shows the formation of a collective entangled phase not directly related to spontaneous symmetry breaking. These results open a new perspective for the entanglement characterization of competing orders in quantum materials, and have direct application to quantum paraelectrics with large polariton splittings.</description>

      <title>Modelling the magnetic properties of 1D arrays of FePc molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic properties of Fe Phthalocyanines (FePc) that are experimentally arranged in quasi one-dimensional chains when they are grown in thin films or powders. By means of DFT calculations we reproduce the structural parameters found in experiments, and then we build a generalized Heisenberg magnetic model with single ion anisotropy, and calculate its parameters. The results show a anisotropic exchange interaction $J$ between FePc molecules, and an easy plane single ion anisotropy $D$. By means of Monte Carlo simulations, with this model, we found an explanation to the non-saturation of the magnetization found at high fields, which we interpret is due to the anisotropic exchange interaction $J$. Finally, we also investigate the presence of magnetic solitons versus temperature and magnetic field. This results provide additional evidence that FePc is a soliton bearing molecular compound, with solitons easily excited mainly in the molecular $xy$ plane.</description>

      <title>Scalable spin squeezing from critical slowing down in short-range interacting systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-range spin-spin interactions are known to generate non-equilibrium dynamics which can squeeze the collective spin of a quantum spin ensemble in a scalable manner, leading to states whose metrologically useful entanglement grows with system size. Here we show theoretically that scalable squeezing can be produced in 2d U(1)-symmetric systems even by short-range interactions, i.e. interactions that at equilibrium do not lead to long-range order at finite temperatures, but rather to an extended, Berezhinski-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) critical phase. If the initial state is a coherent spin state in the easy plane of interactions, whose energy corresponds to a thermal state in the critical BKT phase, the non-equilibrium dynamics exhibits critical slowing down, corresponding to a power-law decay of the collective magnetization in time. This slow decay protects scalable squeezing, whose scaling reveals in turn the decay exponent of the magnetization. Our results open the path to realizing massive entangled states of potential metrological interest in many relevant platforms of quantum simulation and information processing -- such as Mott insulators of ultracold atoms, or superconducting circuits -- characterized by short-range interactions in planar geometries.</description>

      <title>Topological magnon in exchange frustration driven incommensurate spin spiral of a kagome lattice YMn$_6$Sn$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: YMn$_6$Sn$_6$ consists of two types of Mn-based kagome planes stacked along $c$-axis having a complex magnetic interactions. We report a spin reconstruction in YMn$_6$Sn$_6$ from ferromagnet (FM) into a combination of two incommensurate spin spirals (SSs) originating from two different type of Mn kagome planes driven by frustrated magnetic exchanges along the $c$-axis with inclusion of Hubbard U. The pitch angle and wave vector of the incommensurate SSs are $\sim$89.3$^{\circ}$ and $\sim$ (0 0 0.248) respectively which are in excellent agreement with experiment. We employed an effective model Hamiltonian constructed out of exchange interactions to capture experimentally observed non-equivalent nature of the two incommensurate SSs which also explain FM-SS crossover due to antiferromagntic spin exchange with correlation. We further report the existence of topological magnon with spin-orbit coupling in incommensurate SS phase of YMn$_6$Sn$_6$ by calculating the topological invariants and Berry curvature profile. The location of Dirac magnon in energy landscape at 73 meV matches with another experimental report. We demonstrate the accuracy of our results by highlighting experimental features in YMn$_6$Sn$_6$.</description>

      <title>Vortexability: A Unifying Criterion for Ideal Fractional Chern Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.15023v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fractional Chern insulators realize the remarkable physics of the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) in crystalline systems with Chern bands. The lowest Landau level (LLL) is known to host the FQHE, but not all Chern bands are suitable for realizing fractional Chern insulators (FCI). Previous approaches to stabilizing FCIs focused on mimicking the LLL through momentum space criteria. Here instead we take a real-space perspective by introducing the notion of vortexability. Vortexable Chern bands admit a fixed operator that introduces vortices into any band wavefunction while keeping the state entirely within the same band. Vortexable bands admit trial wavefunctions for FCI states, akin to Laughlin states. In the absence of dispersion and for sufficiently short ranged interactions, these FCI states are the ground state -- independent of the distribution of Berry curvature. Vortexable bands are much more general than the LLL, and we showcase a recipe for constructing them. We exhibit diverse examples in graphene-based systems with or without magnetic field, and with any Chern number. A special class of vortexable bands is shown to be equivalent to the momentum space "trace condition" or "ideal band condition". In addition, we also identify a more general form of vortexability that goes beyond this criterion. We introduce a modified measure that quantifies deviations from general vortexability which can be applied to generic Chern bands to identify promising FCI platforms.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating Kondo behavior by temperature-dependent scanning tunneling spectroscopy</title>

Abstract: The Kondo effect describes the scattering of conduction electrons by magnetic impurities, manifesting as an electronic resonance at the Fermi energy with a distinctive temperature evolution. In this letter, we present a critical evaluation of the current methodology employed to demonstrate Kondo behavior in transport measurements, underscoring the limitations of established theoretical frameworks and the influence of extrinsic broadening. We introduce a novel approach for analyzing spectroscopic indicators of the Kondo effect, employing the Hurwitz-Fano lineshape as a model for the Kondo resonance in the presence of extrinsic broadening. Through precise scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements on an exemplary spin-1/2 Kondo system, phenalenyl on Au(111), we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed protocol in extracting accurate intrinsic Kondo linewidths from finite-temperature measurements. The extracted linewidths exhibit a robust fit with a recently derived expression for the temperature-dependent intrinsic Kondo linewidth, providing compelling evidence for the validity of the underlying theory.</description>

      <title>On the Thermal Transport Puzzles in $\alpha\mbox{-}\mathrm{RuCl}_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermal transport has been used to probe the nature of $\alpha\mbox{-}\mathrm{RuCl}_3$, an important candidate of Kitaev material. Two remarkable observations were made under applied magnetic fields at low temperatures, and have stimulated extensive discussions. One is a sizable thermal Hall effect, and the other is an apparent "oscillation" of the longitudinal thermal conductivity with the magnetic field. It has been proposed that the former is due to a bosonic Chern band. Meanwhile, the origin of the latter has largely remained obscure. This work aims to resolve this "oscillation" puzzle. By examining the thermal transport data as well as other measured properties of $\alpha\mbox{-}\mathrm{RuCl}_3$, we argue that the most plausible scenario is that of phonons scattering with spin degrees of freedom across multiple phases. We substantiate this picture into a phenomenological theory, which reproduces the "oscillation" behavior in a simple manner and makes predictions that can be examined by future experiments. Moreover, our phenomenological theory and the aforementioned proposal for the thermal Hall effect support each other. We hope this work can thus help settle the physical mechanism behind the thermal transport puzzles in $\alpha\mbox{-}\mathrm{RuCl}_3$.</description>

      <title>Hole doping and electronic correlations in Cr-substituted BaFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The absence of superconductivity (SC) in Cr-substituted BaFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ (CrBFA) is a well-established but poorly understood topic. It is also established that the suppression of the spin density wave transition temperature ($T_{\text{SDW}}$) in CrBFA and Mn-substituted BaFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ (MnBFA) almost coincides as a function of the Cr/Mn concentrations, irrespective of the putative distinct electronic effects of these substitutions. In this work, we employ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and combined density functional theory plus dynamical mean field theory calculations (DFT+DMFT) to address the evolution of the Fermi surface (FS) and electronic correlations in CrBFA. Our findings reveal that incorporating Cr leads to an effective hole doping of the states near the FS in a way that can be well described within the virtual crystal approximation (VCA). Moreover, our results show orbital-specific correlation effects that support the Hund localization scenario for the CrBFA phase diagram. We found a fractional scaling of the imaginary part of self-energy as a function of the binding energy, which is a signature property of Hund's metals. We conclude that CrBFA is a correlated electron system for which the changes in the FS as a function of Cr are not related to the suppression of $T_{\text{SDW}}$. Rather, this suppression and the absence of SC are primarily due to the competition between Cr local moments and the Fe-derived itinerant spin fluctuations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Fourier-Matsubara series expansion is derived for imaginary-time correlation functions that constitutes the imaginary-time generalization of the infinite Matsubara series for equal-time correlation functions. The expansion is consistent with all known exact properties of imaginary-time correlation functions and opens up new avenues for the utilization of quantum Monte Carlo simulation data. Moreover, the expansion drastically simplifies the computation of imaginary-time density-density correlation functions with the finite temperature version of the self-consistent dielectric formalism. Its existence underscores the utility of imaginary-time as a complementary domain for many-body physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.11955v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose helical topological superconductivity away from the Fermi surface in three-dimensional time-reversal-symmetric odd-parity multiband superconductors. In these systems, pairing between electrons originating from different bands is responsible for the corresponding topological phase transition. Consequently, a pair of helical topological Dirac surface states emerges at finite excitation energies. These helical Dirac surface states are tunable in energy by chemical potential and strength of band-splitting. They are protected by time-reversal symmetry combined with crystalline two-fold rotation symmetry. We suggest concrete materials in which this phenomenon could be observed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a mathematical description, based on d-wave Eliashberg theory, of the strong correlation between the experimentally observed softening of Raman modes associated with in-plane oxygen motions and the corresponding superconducting critical temperature $T_c$, as a function of oxygen doping $x$, in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_x$. The theoretical model provides a direct link between physical trends of soft optical $A_g$ (in-plane) oxygen modes, the level of oxygen doping $x$, and the superconducting $T_c$. Different regimes observed in the trend of $T_c$ vs doping can be related to corresponding regimes of optical phonon softening in the Raman spectra. These results provide further evidence related to the physical origin of high-temperature superconductivity in rare-earth cuprate oxides and to the significant role of electron-phonon coupling therein.</description>

Abstract: Uniaxial pressure provides an efficient approach to control the competition between charge density waves (CDWs) and superconductivity in underdoped YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{\rm{y}}$. It can enhance the correlation volume of ubiquitous short-range 2D CDW correlations, and induces a long-range 3D CDW otherwise only accessible at large magnetic fields. Here, we use x-ray diffraction to study the strain and doping evolution of these CDWs. No signatures of discommensurations nor pair density waves are observed in the investigated strain-temperature parameter space, but direct evidence for a form of competition between 2D and 3D CDWs is uncovered. We show that the interplay between the 3D CDW, the 2D CDWs and superconductivity is qualitatively well described by including strain effects in simulations of a nonlinear sigma model of competing superconducting and CDW orders. From a broader perspective, our results underscore the potential of strain tuning as a powerful tool for probing and manipulating competing orders in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Axionic Instability of Periodic Weyl-Semimetal Superstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10345v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weyl-semimetal superstructures with a spiraling position of a pair of Weyl nodes of opposite chirality can host a chiral-symmetry preserving Fermi-arc metal state, where the chirality is carried by cylindrical Fermi surfaces, electron- and hole-like depending on the chirality. The Fermi surfaces nest at vanishing momentum separation (zero nesting vector) at the electron-hole-compensation energy because the nesting is topologically protected by vanishing spatial overlap of any pair of equal-momentum opposite-chirality states. In this work we show that the nesting and Coulomb interaction drive a spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in such a Fermi arc metal, which leads to a dynamical axion insulator state but without breaking translational symmetry (no charge-density-wave order) as in a conventional Weyl semimetal. As for material realization, we discuss magnetically doped Bi$_2$Se$_3$, for which the Weyl-node positions depend on the order of the magnetic dopands. In this case, the axionic condensation can itself stabilize a spiral order of the magnetization, and hence the spiraling node positions, even if the magnetic interaction is intrinsically ferromagnetic.</description>
