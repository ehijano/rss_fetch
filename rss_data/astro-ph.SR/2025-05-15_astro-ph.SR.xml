      <title>Light Echoes of Time-resolved Flares and Application to Kepler Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light echoes of stellar flares provide an intriguing option for exploring protoplanetary disks in young stellar systems. Previous work on light echoes of circumstellar disks made use of delta-function flares for modeling. We present a new model that incorporates echoes produced by extended, time-resolved flares. We then test this model on known disk-bearing stars with Kepler K2 data by estimating disk parameters from possible echo signals. We focus on two stars; the first appears to be a good candidate for use of this echo model, which predicts disk parameters that are consistent with known values. The second star turns out to be more problematic as a result of high brightness variability in its post-peak lightcurve. These two cases show both the promise and limitations of light echoes as a tool for exploring protoplanetary disks in the time domain</description>

      <title>The VELOCE modulation zoo III. Detecting additional pulsation modes in optical spectra of classical Cepheids using semi-partial distance correlation periodograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Known for their large amplitude radial pulsations, classical Cepheids are critical standard candles in astrophysics. However, they also exhibit various pulsational irregularities and additional signals that provide deeper insights into their structure and evolution. These signals appear in spectroscopic observations as shape deformations of the spectral lines. Using semi-partial distance correlation periodograms, we analyse high-precision spectroscopic data from the VELOCE project for four stars: $\delta$ Cep, BG Cru, X Sgr, and Polaris. For $\delta$ Cep, our control star, only the main radial mode is detected, confirming its stability and suitability as a benchmark for the method. In BG Cru, a strong additional signal at $\sim 3.01$ d is identified, likely linked to line splitting. X Sgr exhibits dominant additional signals, notably one at $\sim 12.31$ d, also associated with significant line splitting. Polaris reveals multiple low-frequency signals, with the most prominent candidate at $\sim 59.86$ d, which might be linked to the star's rotation period. We explore the semi-partial distance correlation periodograms by incorporating CCFs and their variants, such as the median-subtracted CCFs, which improves the sensitivity to variations in line shape. In particular, the latter enables the faithful detection of primary and additional signals present in the 1D spectra of fainter stars and low-amplitude pulsators. The semi-partial distance correlation periodograms demonstrate their utility for isolating signals associated with line shape variations; although, the analyses are complicated by the presence of artefact subharmonics and a visible low-frequency power increase for Polaris and BG Cru. This study underscores the method's potential for finding new and unexpected signals as well as detailed analyses of Cepheid pulsations and opens new pathways for asteroseismic investigations.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of B-type stars in four young Galactic open clusters. I. Stellar content and binary properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiplicity among massive stars represents a major uncertainty in stellar evolution theory, because the extra physical processes that it introduces significantly impacts each star's structure. While multiplicity of O-type stars is fairly well constrained, for B-type stars it is not. B-type stars are more common and have longer lifetimes, thus providing an opportunity to characterize multiplicity at different ages. Moreover, young open clusters are advantageous for studying coeval and chemically homogeneous environments. Using a multi-epoch spectroscopic campaign with the HERMES spectrograph we determine multiplicity properties and rotation rates of 74 B-type stars in four Galactic open clusters: $h$ and $\chi$ Persei, NGC 457, NGC 581, and NGC 1960. We measure radial velocities with a cross-correlation method and determine tentative orbital solutions for 26 of the 28 identified binaries. We detect several Be stars, five of them being members of binary systems. We correct the observed binary fractions for observational biases and determine an average intrinsic binary fraction of 79$_{-16}^{+19}\%$. The consistency in binary fraction among the four clusters, which are between 15 and 30 Myr, suggests a reasonably homogenous binary fraction across this age range. We used TLUSTY atmosphere models to determine the projected rotational velocities, with an average value of 240 km s$^{-1}$ for both single and binary systems. Whereas, the Be stars show higher velocities between 200 and 360 km s$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Optical And X-ray Variability Of {\gamma} Cas Stars: Sao 49725</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper is devoted to studying the variability of the $\gamma$ Cas type star SAO 49725. Both the optical and X-ray spectra of the star are analyzed. Variability of line profiles in the spectra of SAO 49725 was discovered on short (70-223 minutes) scales. Based on the TESS photometric light curves of SAO 49725 the regular variations of light curves are detected with a period of 1.1989 days identified as the rotation period of the star. The pattern of photometric variability in SAO 49725, as observed by TESS, varies significantly across different epochs. The TESS components of the SAO 49725 light curves with periods of $\sim3-21\,$days may be instrumental.</description>

      <title>Investigation of possible precursors of solar flares in the active region 12230 On December 9, 2014</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The question of the nature of precursors of solar flares, as well as their relationship with subsequent flares, still has no unambiguous answer. This is due, in particular, to the lack of systematic statistical work, the relative incompleteness (in isolation from the context of the development of the entire active region) of studies of individual events and the ambiguity of the term 'precursor' itself. In this paper, we consider the dynamics of the NOAA 12230 active region (AR), in which a series of homologous flares (C5-C9) occurred on December 9, 2014 within 12 hours, with an average frequency of about 2 hours. This AR was characterized by a rapid increase in flare activity followed by a rapid decay, which can be considered as a good example for studying potential precursors of flare series. We investigated the evolution of AR 12230 over a relatively long period (several days) and its transition from the 'no-flare' state to the flare-active regime. For this purpose, we study the magnetic field dynamics using SDO/HMI vector magnetograms, UV-EUV images based on SDO/AIA data, and X-ray observations from GOES/XRS and RHESSI data. We conclude that the significant increase in the chromospheric radiation variations against the background of a small flux of soft X-ray and UV emission from the corona observed on December 8, 2014, together with the magnetic flux emergence, can be considered as a precursor to a series of flares. The results show the importance and prospects of applying new methods of synoptic observations of the Sun in the context of collecting statistics ("history") of the AR energy release in different ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum.</description>

      <title>Observational study of the formation of homologous confined circular-ribbon flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When several solar flares with comparable classes occur successively at the same location and exhibit similar morphological features, they are called homologous flares. During 2012 May 8-10, five M-class homologous circular-ribbon flares associated with no coronal mass ejection occurred in active region (AR) 11476. The formation process of these homologous confined flares, particularly the homologous aspect, is unclear and inconclusive. This paper is dedicated to studying how the energy for this series of flares was accumulated and whether there existed null points responsible for the flare energy release. Before and during the five flares, the sunspots with opposite polarities sheared against each other and also rotated individually. Before each flare, the magnetic fields at the polarity inversion line were highly sheared and there existed a magnetic flux rope overlain by arch-shaped loops. For the first four flares, we find magnetic null points in the fan-spine topology, situated at about 3.8 Mm, 5.7 Mm, 3.4 Mm, and 2.6 Mm above the photosphere, respectively. For the fifth flare, no null point is detected. However, in the (extreme-)ultraviolet images, the evolution behaviors of all the flares were almost identical. Therefore, we speculate that a null point responsible for the occurrence of the fifth flare may have existed. These results reveal that, for these homologous flares in AR 11476, the sunspot rotation and shearing motion play important roles in energy accumulation, the null point of the fan-spine topology is crucial for energy release through magnetic reconnection therein, and large-scale magnetic loops prevent the erupting material from escaping the Sun, thus forming the observed homologous confined major circular-ribbon flares. This study provides clear evidence for the drivers of successive, homologous flares as well as the nature of confined events.</description>

      <title>VAST-MeMeS: Characterising non-thermal radio emission from magnetic massive stars using the Australian SKA Pathfinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic massive stars are stars of spectral types O, B and A that harbour $\sim$ kG strength (mostly dipolar) surface magnetic fields. Their non-thermal radio emission has been demonstrated to be an important magnetospheric probe, provided the emission is fully characterised. A necessary step for that is to build a statistically significant sample of radio-bright magnetic massive stars. In this paper, we present the `VAST project to study Magnetic Massive Stars' or VAST-MeMeS that aims to achieve that by taking advantage of survey data acquired with the Australian SKA Pathfinder telescope. VAST-MeMeS is defined under the `VAriable and Slow Transient' (VAST) survey, although it also uses data from other ASKAP surveys. We found radio detections from 48 magnetic massive stars, out of which, 14 do not have any prior radio detections. We also identified 9 `Main-sequence Radio Pulse Emitter' candidates based on variability and circular polarisation of flux densities. The expanded sample suggests a lower efficiency in the radio production than that reported in earlier work. In addition to significantly expanding the sample of radio-bright magnetic massive stars, the addition of flux density measurements at $\lesssim 1$ GHz revealed that the spectra of incoherent radio emission can extend to much lower frequencies than that assumed in the past. In the future, radio observations spanning wide frequency and rotational phase ranges should be conducted so as to reduce the uncertainties in the incoherent radio luminosities. The results from these campaigns, supplemented with precise estimations of stellar parameters, will allow us to fully understand particle acceleration and non-thermal radio production in large-scale stellar magnetospheres.</description>

      <title>The high-energy protons of the ground level enhancement (GLE74) event on 11 May 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High energy solar protons were observed by particle detectors aboard spacecraft in near-Earth orbit on May 11, 2024 and produced the 74th ground level enhancement (GLE74) event registered by ground-based neutron monitors. This study involves a detailed reconstruction of the neutron monitor response, along with the identification of the solar eruption responsible for the emission of the primary particles, utilizing both in situ and remote-sensing. Observations spanning proton energies from a few MeV to around 1.64 GeV, collected from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES), the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO-A), and neutron monitors, were integrated with records of the associated solar soft X-ray flare, coronal mass ejection, and radio bursts, to identify the solar origin of the GLE74. Additionally, a time-shift analysis was conducted to link the detected particles to their solar sources. Finally, a comparison of GLE74 to previous ones is carried out. GLE74 reached a maximum particle rigidity of at least 2.4 GV and was associated with a series of type III, type II, and type IV radio bursts. The release time of the primary solar energetic particles (SEPs) with an energy of 500 MeV was estimated to be around 01:21 UT. A significant SEP flux was observed from the anti-Sun direction with a relatively broad angular distribution, rather than a narrow, beam-like pattern, particularly during the main phase at the particle peak flux. Comparisons with previous GLEs suggest that GLE74 was a typical event in terms of solar eruption dynamics.</description>

      <title>Formation and Early Evolution of Protoplanetary Disks under Nonuniform Cosmic-Ray Ionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Angular momentum transport by magnetic fields is important for formation and evolution of protoplanetary disks. The effects of magnetic fields are suppressed due to non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects such as ambipolar diffusion and Ohmic dissipation, which depend on the degree of ionization. Cosmic rays (CRs) are the primary source of ionization in star-forming clouds, and their distribution is nonuniform as it is affected by gas density and magnetic fields. Therefore, CRs, magnetic fields, and gas interact with each other. In this work, we develop a new fully implicit cosmic ray transport module in Athena++ and perform three-dimensional simulations of disk formation from collapse of molecular cloud cores. Since CRs are strongly attenuated in the dense gas at the disk scale, distribution of magnetic fields is considerably altered compared to conventional models assuming a uniform ionization rate. While the total magnetic fluxes accreted onto the disks remain similar as the gas outside the disks remain sufficiently ionized and well coupled, the magnetic fields in the disks are less twisted due to the stronger non-ideal MHD effects. As a consequence, magnetic angular momentum transport is strongly suppressed at the disk scale, resulting in more gravitationally unstable disks with more prominent spiral arms. Our simulations demonstrate influence of non-uniform ionization resulting from CR transport and attenuation on the disk formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>Discerning internal conditions of pulsating hot subdwarf B stars. Modelling multiple trapped modes in KIC 10001893</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The frequencies of gravity mode oscillations are determined by the chemical, thermal, and structural properties of stellar interiors, facilitating the study of internal mixing mechanisms in stars. We investigate the impact of discontinuities in the chemical composition induced by the formation of an adiabatic semiconvection region during the core helium (He)-burning phase of evolution of hot subdwarf B-type (sdB) stars. We scrutinize the asteroseismic attributes of the evolutionary stages and assess the core He-burning phase by evaluating the parameter linked to the average interval between the deep trapped modes in both sdB evolutionary models and the observations of KIC 10001893. We perform evolutionary and asteroseismic analyses of sdB stars using MESA and GYRE to examine the properties of the semiconvection region. We address the challenges of relying solely on average interval between oscillation mode periods with consecutive radial orders to identify the core He-burning stage. To enhance identification, we propose a new parameter representing the average interval between deep trapped modes during some of the stages of sdB evolutionary models. Additionally, our results show that integrating convective penetration with convective premixing improves our models and yields comparable outcomes without the need for additional model parameters. Our results can advance the development of detailed evolutionary models for sdB stars by refining internal mixing schemes, enhancing the accuracy of pulsation predictions, and improving alignment with observational data.</description>

      <title>Observational signs of limited flare area variation and peak flare temperatures estimations in main-sequence flaring stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the study of stellar flares, traditional method of calculating total energy emitted in the continuum assumes the emission originating from a narrow chromospheric condensation region with a constant temperature of 10000 K and variable flare area. However, based on multicolor data from 7 new flares observed in Bia{\l}k\'ow and Shumen observatory and 8 flares from (Howard et al., 2020) observed on 10 main-sequence stars (spectral types M5.5V to K5V) we show that flare areas had a relative change in the range of 10% - 61% (for more than half of the flares this value did not exceed 30%) throughout the events except for the impulsive phase, and had values starting from 50 +/- 30 ppm to 300 +/- 150 ppm for our new flares and from 380 +/- 200 ppm to 7600 +/- 3000 ppm from (Howard et al., 2020) data, while their temperature increased on average by the factor 2.5. The peak flare temperatures for our seven observed flares ranged from 5700 +/- 450 K to 17500 +/- 10050 K. Five of these flares had their temperatures estimated using the Johnson-Kron-Cousins B filter alongside TESS data, one flare was analyzed using the SLOAN g' and r' bandpasses, and another was evaluated using both the SLOAN g' and r' bandpasses and TESS data. Using flare temperature and area from our data and data from Howard et al., 2020, along with the physical parameters of stars where the flares occurred, we developed a semi-empirical grid that correlates a star's effective temperature and flare amplitude in TESS data with the flare's peak temperature. This allows interpolation of a flare's peak temperature based on the star's effective temperature (ranging from 2700 K to 4600 K) and flare amplitude from TESS observations. Applying this grid to 42257 flares from TESS survey, we estimated peak flare temperatures between 5700 K and 38300 K, with most flares showing peak black-body temperatures around 11100 +/- 2400 K.</description>

      <title>The asymmetry of white dwarf double detonations and the observed scatter around the Phillips relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) simulations featuring a double detonation scenario have managed to reproduce the overall trend of the Phillips relation reasonably well. However, most, if not all, multidimensional simulations struggle to reproduce the scatter of observed SNe around this relation, exceeding it substantially. In this study, we investigate whether the excessive scatter around the Phillips relation can be caused by an off-center ignition of the carbon-oxygen (CO) core in the double detonation scenario and if this can help constrain possible SN Ia explosion channels. We simulated the detonation of three different initial CO white dwarfs of $0.9$, $1.0$, and $1.1\,M_\odot$, artificially ignited at systematically offset locations using the Arepo code. After nucleosynthetic postprocessing, we generated synthetic observables using the Artis code and compared these results against observational data and models of other works. We find that our simulations produce synthetic observables well within the range of the observed data in terms of viewing angle scatter. The majority of the viewing angle variability seems to be caused by line blanketing in the blue wavelengths of intermediate-mass elements and lighter iron-group elements, which are asymmetrically distributed in the outer layers of the ashes. Our results suggest that although the off-center ignition of the CO introduces substantial line of sight effects, it is not responsible for the excessive viewing angle scatter observed in other models. Instead, this effect seems to be caused by the detonation ashes from the rather massive helium (He) shells in current state-of-the-art models. Further reducing the He-shell masses of double detonation progenitors may be able to alleviate this issue and yield observables that reproduce the Phillips relation.</description>

      <title>A 70 pc-Diameter Nova Super-remnant Surrounding the Recurrent Nova RS Ophiuchi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recurrent novae undergo thermonuclear-powered eruptions separated by less than 100 years, enabled by subgiant or red giant donors transferring hydrogen-rich matter at very high rates onto their massive white dwarf companions. The most-rapidly moving parts of envelopes ejected in successive recurrent nova events are predicted to overtake and collide with the slowest ejecta of the previous eruption, leading to the buildup of vast (~ 10 - 100 parsec) super-remnants surrounding all recurrent novae; but only three examples are currently known. We report deep narrowband imaging and spectroscopy which has revealed a ~ 70-parsec-diameter shell surrounding the frequently recurring nova RS Ophiuchi. We estimate the super-remnant mass to be ~ 20 - 200 solar masses, expanding at a few tens of km/s, with an age of order 50-100 kyr. Its extremely low surface brightness and large angular size help explain the hitherto surprising absence of nova super-remnants. Our results support the prediction that ALL recurrent novae are surrounded by similar extended structures.</description>

      <title>A Possible Problem with the Sunspot Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sunspots are areas of strong magnetic fields driven by a convective dynamo. Rudolf Wolf devised his Sunspot Number (SN) series to describe its variation with time. Most other solar phenomena vary in concert with SN, in particular the microwave radiation. During the interval 2014-Jul to 2015-Dec, the variation of the SN with the microwave flux (e.g. F10.7) was anomalous, although microwave flux did not exhibit any anomaly with respect to the solar magnetic field measured by the HMI instrument on the SDO spacecraft. This points to a possible problem with the derivation of the SN using the 148,714 reports of sunspot observations received by the World Data Center Solar Influences (SIDC/SILSO at ROB) since 2011 (when the last public raw data was released). The unavailability of the raw data since then, contrary to avowed open data policy of ROB, prevents independent assessment and possible correction of the anomaly. We urge ROB to make the raw data available.</description>

      <title>Expanding Ejecta Method: II. Framework for Cosmological Distance Measurements via Intensity Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the potential of the expanding ejecta method (EEM) as a cosmological probe, leveraging its ability to measure angular diameter distances to supernovae (SNe) with intensity interferometry. We propose three distinct applications of the EEM: (1) using Type IIP SNe as moderate-distance geometric anchors to calibrate Cepheids, replacing other local distance indicators; (2) directly calibrating Type Ia SNe, bypassing conventional calibration methods; (3) constructing a fully independent Hubble diagram with Type IIP (Type Ia) SNe, entirely decoupled from the traditional distance ladder. Incorporating realistic SN populations, we forecast a Hubble constant precision with next-generation intensity interferometers of $1.6\%$, $1.1\%$, and $9.3\% \,(3.6\%)$, respectively, for the three different proposed applications. Future intensity interferometry could yield improvements to $1.2\%$, $0.6\%$, and $1.5\%\,(0.4\%)$. The EEM thus offers a powerful geometric alternative for cosmic distance determination.</description>

      <title>Evidence of polar and ultralow supernova kicks from the orbits of Be X-ray binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supernovae, the explosive deaths of massive stars, create heavy elements and form black holes and neutron stars. These compact objects often receive a velocity at formation, a "kick" whose physical origin remains debated. We investigate kicks in Be X-ray binaries, containing a neutron star and a rapidly spinning companion. We identify two distinct populations: one with kicks below $10\,\rm{km}\,\rm{s}^{-1}$, much lower than theoretical predictions, and another with kicks around $100\,\rm{km}\,\rm{s}^{-1}$, that shows evidence for being aligned within 5 degrees of the progenitor's rotation axis. The distribution of progenitor masses for the two populations have medians around $2.3\,\rm{M}_\odot$ and $4.9\,\rm{M}_\odot$, corresponding to stars with birth masses of about $10\,\rm{M}_\odot$ and $15\,\rm{M}_\odot$. The second component matches the low-velocity mode observed in isolated pulsars. Combined with the known high-velocity component, which dominates isolated pulsars, this suggests three distinct kick modes. These results reveal previously unrecognized diversity in neutron-star formation.</description>

      <title>A fundamental limit to how close binary systems can get via stable mass transfer shapes the properties of binary black hole mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mass transfer in binary systems is the key process in the formation of various classes of objects, including merging binary black holes (BBHs) and neutron stars. Orbital evolution during mass transfer depends on how much mass is accreted and how much angular momentum is lost $-$ two of the main uncertainties in binary evolution. Here, we demonstrate that there is a fundamental limit to how close binary systems can get via stable mass transfer (SMT), that is robust against uncertainties in orbital evolution. Based on detailed evolutionary models of interacting systems with a BH accretor and a massive star companion, we show that the post-interaction orbit is always wider than $\sim10R_{\odot}$, even when extreme shrinkage due to L2 outflows is assumed. Systems evolving towards tighter orbits become dynamically unstable and result in stellar mergers. This separation limit has direct implications for the properties of BBH mergers: long delay times ($\gtrsim1 \rm Gyr$), and no high BH spins from the tidal spin-up of helium stars. At high metallicity, the SMT channel may be severely quenched due to Wolf-Rayet winds. The reason for the separation limit lies in the stellar structure, not in binary physics. If the orbit gets too narrow during mass transfer, a dynamical instability is triggered by a rapid expansion of the remaining donor envelope due to its near-flat entropy profile. The closest separations can be achieved from core-He burning ($\sim8-15R_{\odot}$) and Main Sequence donors ($\sim15-30R_{\odot}$), while Hertzsprung Gap donors lead to wider orbits ($\gtrsim30-50R_{\odot}$) and non-merging BBHs. These outcomes and mass transfer stability are determined by the entropy structures, which are governed by internal composition profiles. The formation of compact binaries is thus sensitive to chemical mixing in stars and may relate to the blue-supergiant problem.</description>

      <title>Suppression of Shock X-ray Emission in Novae from Turbulent Mixing with Cool Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shock interaction in classical novae occurs when a fast outflow from the white dwarf &gt; 1000 km s/s collides with a slower, cooler shell of gas released earlier in the outburst. The shocks radiate across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio synchrotron to GeV gamma-rays. The hot shocked gas also emits &gt;~ keV thermal X-rays, typically peaking weeks after the eruption, once the ejecta becomes transparent to photoelectric absorption. However, the observed hard X-ray luminosities are typically &gt;4 orders of magnitude smaller than would be naively expected given the powerful shocks implied by the gamma-rays. We argue that a key missing piece to this puzzle is turbulence behind the shock, driven, e.g., by thin-shell and/or thermal instabilities. Turbulence efficiently mixes the hot X-ray emitting gas with cooler gas, sapping the hot gas of energy faster than it can directly radiate. Using analytic arguments motivated by numerical simulations, we show that energy losses due to turbulent mixing can easily balance shock heating, greatly reducing the volume of the hot gas and suppressing the X-ray luminosity. Equating the characteristic thickness of the X-ray emitting region to the minimum outer length scale of the turbulence capable of cooling the hot gas through mixing, we obtain X-ray luminosities consistent with nova observations if only ~1% of the shock's kinetic power goes into turbulent motions. A similar process may act to suppress thermal X-rays from other shock powered transients, such as interacting supernovae.</description>

      <title>Role of ion acoustic instability in magnetic reconnection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a first-principles numerical study of magnetic reconnection in plasmas with different initial ion-to-electron temperature ratios. In cases where this ratio is significantly below unity, we observe intense wave activity in the diffusion region, driven by the ion-acoustic instability. Our analysis shows that the dominant macroscopic effect of this instability is to drive substantial ion heating. In contrast to earlier studies reporting significant anomalous resistivity, we find that anomalous contributions due to the ion-acoustic instability are minimal. These results shed light on the dynamical impact of this instability on reconnection processes, offering new insights into the fundamental physics governing collisionless reconnection.</description>

      <title>The Mirya-m1 Cosmic Ray Detector: Features and First Year Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Mirya-m1 Cosmic Ray Detector, the largest and only cosmic ray detector in Turkiye designed for space weather research. Mirya-m1, modeled and built after the Muon Impact Tracer and Observer (MITO) (Ayuso et al. 2021), is located at the Eastern Anatolia Observatory (DAG) site of the Turkiye National Observatories in Erzurum, Turkiye, at an altitude of 3099 meters. This elevation positions Mirya-m1 among the highest-altitude cosmic ray detectors globally. The detector consists of two stacked scintillator counters, each measuring 1x1 meters, separated by a vertical distance of 1.36 meters. Each scintillator is monitored by four H1411 Hamamatsu photomultiplier tubes, enabling precise detection and measurement of light by incident cosmic rays. In this study, we present the data collected throughout 2024, which includes the detection of two Forbush decrease events in March and May 2024. These significant detections demonstrate the capability of Mirya-m1 to contribute valuable data for space weather research, establishing its potential as a critical instrument for cosmic ray studies in the region.</description>

      <title>Architecture of Tianyu Software: Relative Photometry as a Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09107v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tianyu telescope, an one-meter robotic optical survey instrument to be constructed in Lenghu, Qinghai, China, is designed for detecting transiting exoplanets, variable stars and transients. It requires a highly automated, optimally distributed, easily extendable, and highly flexible software to enable the data processing for the raw data at rates exceeding 500MB/s. In this work, we introduce the architecture of the Tianyu pipeline and use relative photometry as a case to demonstrate its high scalability and efficiency. This pipeline is tested on the data collected from Muguang observatory and Xinglong observatory. The pipeline demonstrates high scalability, with most processing stages increasing in throughput as the number of consumers grows. Compared to a single consumer, the median throughput of image calibration, alignment, and flux extraction increases by 41%, 257%, and 107% respectively when using 5 consumers, while image stacking exhibits limited scalability due to I/O constraints. In our tests, the pipeline was able to detect two transiting sources. Besides, the pipeline captures variability in the light curves of nine known and two previously unknown variable sources in the testing data. Meanwhile, the differential photometric precision of the light curves is near the theoretical limitation. These results indicate that this pipeline is suitable for detecting transiting exoplanets and variable stars. This work builds the fundation for further development of Tianyu software. Code of this work is available at https://github.com/ruiyicheng/Tianyu_pipeline.</description>

      <title>TASSIE: a TASmanian Search for Inclined Exoplanets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first results of a pilot 'TASmanian Search for Inclined Exoplanets' (TASSIE) program. This includes observations and analysis of five short-period exoplanet candidates using data from TESS and the Harlingten 50 cm telescope at the Greenhill Observatory. We describe the instrumentation, data reduction process and target selection strategy for the program. We utilise archival multi-band photometry and new mid-resolution spectra to determine stellar parameters for five TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs). We then perform a statistical validation to rule out false positives, before moving on to a joint transit analysis of the remaining systems. We find that TOI3070, TOI3124 and TOI4266 are likely non-planetary signals, which we attribute to either short-period binary stars on grazing orbits or stellar spots. For TOI3097, we find a hot sub-Jovian to Jovian size planet ($R_{3097Ab}$ = 0.89 $\pm$ 0.04 $R_{J}$, $P_{3097Ab}$ = 1.368386 $\pm$ 0.000006 days) orbiting the primary K dwarf star in a wide binary system. This system shows indications of low metallicity ([Fe/H] $\approx$ -1), making it an unlikely host for a giant planet. For TOI3163, we find a Jovian-size companion on a circular orbit around a late F dwarf star, with $R_{3163b}$ = 1.42 $\pm$ 0.05 $R_{J}$ and $P_{3163b}$ = 3.074966 $\pm$ 0.000022 days. In future, we aim to validate further southern giant planet candidates with a particular focus on those residing in the sub-Jovian desert/savanna.</description>

      <title>ARCANE -- Early Detection of Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) are major drivers of space weather disturbances, posing risks to both technological infrastructure and human activities. Automatic detection of ICMEs in solar wind in situ data is essential for early warning systems. While several methods have been proposed to identify these structures in time series data, robust real-time detection remains a significant challenge. In this work, we present ARCANE - the first framework explicitly designed for early ICME detection in streaming solar wind data under realistic operational constraints, enabling event identification without requiring observation of the full structure. Our approach evaluates the strengths and limitations of detection models by comparing a machine learning-based method to a threshold-based baseline. The ResUNet++ model, previously validated on science data, significantly outperforms the baseline, particularly in detecting high-impact events, while retaining solid performance on lower-impact cases. Notably, we find that using real-time solar wind (RTSW) data instead of high-resolution science data leads to only minimal performance degradation. Despite the challenges of operational settings, our detection pipeline achieves an F1 score of 0.53, with an average detection delay of 21.5% of the event's duration while only seeing a minimal amount of data. As more data becomes available, the performance increases significantly. These results mark a substantial step forward in automated space weather monitoring and lay the groundwork for enhanced real-time forecasting capabilities.</description>

      <title>Simulating jet launching in binary neutron star mergers with no artificial atmosphere limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers, exploring the conditions to launch relativistic outflows compatible with gamma-ray burst (GRB) jets. Employing an unprecedentedly low numerical density floor decreasing as the sixth power of radial distance, we obtain for the first time an evolution where such a floor has no effect on any outflow produced during and after merger. In models forming an accreting black hole (BH) 25 ms after merger, incipient jets are launched with terminal Lorentz factors and Poynting-flux luminosities compatible with GRBs. The rather high jet velocities reached in a few tens of ms, when compared to previous simulations adopting a much higher and uniform density floor, show the importance of removing any influence of the latter as the jet evolves toward increasingly large time and spatial scales. In absence of collapse, we find the emergence of much heavier and slower polar outflows, incapable of producing a GRB. We thus favor a BH origin for GRB jets.</description>

Abstract: Several models have been proposed to explain missing red giants (RGs) near the Galactic centre. Recently, a scenario has been suggested that predicts, among other processes, a long-term ablation of the surface layers of RGs during their repetitive passages through the Galactic jet (Zaja\v{c}ek et al., 2020). In this study, we perform detailed three-dimensional numerical modelling of this phenomenon. We calculate the ablation rate of the surface layers of a RG orbiting the supermassive black hole (SMBH) as it passes through the nuclear jet. In particular, we model the jet-star interaction for approximately 10 passages for the closer orbital distance of $10^{-3}\,\text{pc}$ and 2 passages for $10^{-2}\,\text{pc}$. We find that the mass loss due to ablation by the jet behaves with time as $\Delta M_{\star}\propto \sqrt{t}$ and the total ablated mass during a single active galactic nucleus (AGN) phase ($10^5$ years) is $\sim 10^{-4}\,M_{\odot}$. We arrive at similar rates of the stellar ablation for the relatively smaller jet luminosity $10^{42}\,\text{erg}\,\text{s}^{-1}$ as in the previous analytical calculations. For larger jet luminosities of $10^{44}$ and $10^{48}\,\text{erg}\,\text{s}^{-1}$, the ablation rates inferred from $\sim 10$ interactions as well as extrapolated power-law fits are significantly lower than analytical values. Overall, the mass ablation rate per interaction and the extrapolated cumulative mass loss during the jet activity are comparable to the stellar-wind mass loss. For the smallest orbital distance of $10^{-3}\,\text{pc}$, we also track the thermal behaviour of the stellar surface layer, whose temperature appears to grow rapidly during the first 10 passages from $\sim 3600\,{\rm K}$ (spectral type M) to $\sim 8500\,{\rm K}$ (spectral type A). RG-jet interactions can thus lead to observable changes in the nuclear stellar population during the jet existence.</description>

      <title>Circumplanetary Disks are Rare around Planets at Large Orbital Radii: A Parameter Survey of Flow Morphology around Giant Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the formation and structure of circumplanetary disks (CPDs) varies with planet mass and protoplanetary disk aspect ratio. Using static mesh refinement and a near-isothermal equation of state, we perform a small parameter survey of hydrodynamic simulations with parameters appropriate for disk-embedded protoplanets at moderate to large orbital radii. We find that CPD formation occurs along a continuum, with ``diskiness'' increasing smoothly with planetary mass and decreasing disk aspect ratio. As expected from disk hydrostatic equilibrium arguments, the transition from envelope-dominated to disk-dominated structures is determined to first order by the ratio of the planetary Hill sphere radius to the disk scale height, but planets need to be significantly super-thermal to host classical rotationally supported CPDs. The circularization radius of inflowing gas (as a fraction of the Hill sphere radius) shows an approximately quadratic power-law scaling with the ratio of planetary mass to the thermal mass. Compared to more physically complete radiation hydrodynamic simulations, our runs almost maximize the possibility for classical CPD formation, and hence define a plausible necessary condition for CPDs. The low abundance of detected CPDs in disks where planetary companions are inferred from substructure data may be due to a combination of the large scale height of the protoplanetary disk, and a low frequency of sufficiently massive protoplanets. Unless their CPDs cool below the local protoplanetary disk temperature, most of the wide-orbit giant planet population will be embedded in quasi-spherical envelopes that are hard to detect. Disks, and satellite systems, are more likely to form around smaller orbital separation planets.</description>

      <title>Role of injection parameters in jet propagation through realistic binary neutron star merger environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: After the first multi-messenger observation of a binary neutron star (BNS) merger powering a short-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB), GW170817-GRB 170817A, remarkable effort is ongoing to unravel the evolution of the collimated, relativistic outflow (or jet) that was launched during the merger and fed the GRB event, imprinting its angular structure onto the follow-up afterglow signal. Current theoretical models, based on relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (RMHD) simulations, offer detailed insights into the launch and propagation processes that govern jet evolution. Notably, these simulations point out that jet injection parameters, such as luminosity, magnetization, power decay time scale, and launch time relative to merger, play a crucial role. However, the impact of these parameters is typically investigated within simplified jet propagation environments, lacking a direct connection with a realistic BNS merger aftermath. In this work, we present the first suite of 3D RMHD simulations exploring the influence of such parameters on the propagation of magnetized incipient GRB jets injected into magnetized environments directly imported from the outcome of a general-relativistic MHD BNS merger simulation. Our results demonstrate that, alongside the injection parameters, the BNS merger environment has a central role in shaping the overall jet evolution. Specifically, under identical jet parameters, the fate of an incipient jet (whether it successfully breaks out or becomes choked) depends strongly on the properties of such an environment. Further quantitative comparison between realistic and simplified environments reveals major differences, emphasizing the importance of incorporating the former for accurate modeling.</description>

      <title>Theory of the kinetic helicity effect on turbulent diffusion of magnetic and scalar fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13807v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kinetic helicity is a fundamental characteristics of astrophysical turbulent flows. It is not only responsible for the generation of large-scale magnetic fields in the Sun, stars, and spiral galaxies, but it also affects turbulent diffusion resulting in the dissipation of large-scale magnetic fields. Using the path integral approach for random helical velocity fields with a finite correlation time and large Reynolds numbers, we show that turbulent magnetic diffusion is reduced by the kinetic helicity, while the turbulent diffusivity of a passive scalar is enhanced by the helicity. The latter can explain the results of recent numerical simulations for forced helical turbulence. One of the crucial reasons for the difference between the kinetic helicity effect on magnetic and scalar fields is related to the helicity dependence of the correlation time of a turbulent velocity field.</description>

      <title>Cluster-lensed supernova yields from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Through gravitational lensing, galaxy clusters can magnify supernovae (SNe) and create multiple images of the same SN. This enables measurements of cosmological parameters, which will be increasingly important in light of upcoming telescopic surveys. We study the prospects of detecting strongly lensed SNe in cluster fields with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman)'s High Latitude Time Domain Survey (HLTDS) and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). We employed two approaches: one focusing on known multiply imaged galaxies behind clusters, along with the SN rates specific to those galaxies, and another based on the expected number of lensed SNe exploding in a given volume behind a galaxy cluster. We collected all the clusters in the literature that feature a well-constrained lens model and multiply imaged galaxies behind clusters with high-quality data for the lensed galaxies. This allowed us to determine the SN rate for each galaxy. We provide predictions for 46 clusters visible to the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, as well as for 9 observable by Roman's HLTDS, depending on whether the clusters fall within the survey's observing field. We predict that the number of multiply imaged SNe discovered by LSST in its first three years is $3.95 \pm 0.89$ from the first approach or $4.94 \pm 1.02$ from the second. For the HLTDS, the expected number of multiply imaged SNe ranges from $0.38 \pm 0.15$ to $5.2 \pm 2.2$, depending on the specific cluster observed, however, the fields to be targeted remain a matter of discussion. We conclude that LSST offers great prospects for detecting multiply imaged SNe. Our predictions are effectively lower limits, as we only considered the most massive and well-studied clusters. We provide a recommendation for HLTDS observing field selection, namely: either MACS J0553.4-3342 or Abell 1758a should be observed by the survey.</description>

      <title>Screening Mechanisms on White Dwarfs: Symmetron &amp; Dilaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work provides the first comparison of the symmetron and dilaton fields in white dwarfs. We show how these screening mechanisms behave inside {such stars} and their impact on stellar properties. Employing a custom-developed shooting method, we solve the scalar-tensor equilibrium equations in the Newtonian approximation. We consider a Chandrasekhar equation of state and examine a range of potential mass scales and coupling strengths for both fields. Both fields enhance the pressure drop in low-density white dwarfs, leading to smaller stellar masses, radii, and luminosities. Unlike chameleon models, their effects are suppressed in more massive stars, with symmetron fields fully decoupling and dilaton fields weakening but not vanishing. Consequently, no mass-radius curve for screened white dwarfs exceeds the Newtonian prediction in any of these three mechanisms. The mass-radius deviations are generally more pronounced at lower densities, depending on model parameters. Due to their common runaway potential, we confirm that dilaton and chameleon fields display similar field and gradient profiles. In contrast, due to their environment-dependent coupling, the dilaton and symmetron mechanisms exhibit stronger density-dependent screening effects. These findings highlight both phenomenological differences and theoretical similarities among these mechanisms, motivating asteroseismology studies to constrain the symmetron and dilaton parameter spaces.</description>
