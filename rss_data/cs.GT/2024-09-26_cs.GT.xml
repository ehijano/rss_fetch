      <title>Friend- and Enemy-oriented Hedonic Games With Strangers Full Version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce friend- and enemy-oriented hedonic games with strangers (FOHGS and EOHGS respectively), two classes of hedonic games wherein agents are classified as friends, enemies, or strangers under the assumption that strangers will become either friends or enemies ex post facto. For several notions of stability in FOHGS and EOHGS, we characterize the hardness of verification for possible and necessary stability. We characterize the hardness of deciding whether possibly and necessarily X stable partitions exist for a given stability notion X. We prove that necessarily internally stable partitions always exist and provide sufficient conditions for necessary contractual individual stability.</description>

      <title>Couples can be tractable: New algorithms and hardness results for the Hospitals / Residents problem with Couples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00405v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Hospitals / Residents problem with Couples (HRC), where a solution is a stable matching or a report that none exists. We present a novel polynomial-time algorithm that can find a near-feasible stable matching (adjusting the hospitals' capacities by at most 1) in an HRC instance where the couples' preferences are sub-responsive (i.e., if one member switches to a better hospital, then the couple also improves) and sub-complete (i.e., each pair of hospitals that are individually acceptable to both members are jointly acceptable for the couple) by reducing it to an instance of the Stable Fixtures problem. We also present a polynomial-time algorithm for HRC in a sub-responsive, sub-complete instance that is a Dual Market, or where all couples are one of several possible types. We show that our algorithm also implies the polynomial-time solvability of a stable b-matching problem, where the underlying graph is a multigraph with loops.
  We complement our algorithms with several hardness results. We show that HRC with sub-responsive and sub-complete couples is NP-hard, even with other strong restrictions. We also show that HRC with a Dual Market is NP-hard under several simultaneous restrictions. Finally, we show that the problem of finding a matching with the minimum number of blocking pairs in HRC is not approximable within $m^{1-\varepsilon}$, for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, where $m$ is the total length of the hospitals' preference lists, unless P=NP, even if each couple applies to only one pair of hospitals.
  Our polynomial-time solvability results greatly expand the class of known tractable instances of HRC and provide a useful tool for designing better and more efficient mechanisms in the future.</description>

      <title>Opponent Shaping for Antibody Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10588v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anti-viral therapies are typically designed to target the current strains of a virus. Game theoretically, this corresponds to a short-sighted, or myopic, response. However, therapy-induced selective pressures act on viral antigens to drive the emergence of mutated strains, against which initial therapies have reduced efficacy. Building on a computational model of binding between antibodies and viral antigens (the Absolut! framework), we design and implement a genetic simulation of such viral evolutionary escape. Crucially, this allows our antibody optimisation algorithm to consider and influence the entire escape curve of the virus, i.e. to guide (or ''shape'') the viral evolution. This is inspired by opponent shaping which, in general-sum learning, accounts for the adaptation of the co-player rather than playing a myopic best response. Hence we call the optimised antibodies shapers. Within our simulations, we demonstrate that our shapers target both current and simulated future viral variants, outperforming the antibodies chosen in a myopic way. Furthermore, we show that shapers exert specific evolutionary pressure on the virus compared to myopic antibodies. Altogether, shapers modify the evolutionary trajectories of viral strains and minimise the viral escape compared to their myopic counterparts. While this is a simplified model, we hope that our proposed paradigm will enable the discovery of better long-lived vaccines and antibody therapies in the future, enabled by rapid advancements in the capabilities of simulation tools.

      <title>Position-building in competition with real-world constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper extends the optimal-trading framework developed in arXiv:2409.03586v1 to compute optimal strategies with real-world constraints. The aim of the current paper, as with the previous, is to study trading in the context of multi-player non-cooperative games. While the former paper relies on methods from the calculus of variations and optimal strategies arise as the solution of partial differential equations, the current paper demonstrates that the entire framework may be re-framed as a quadratic programming problem and cast in this light constraints are readily incorporated into the calculation of optimal strategies. An added benefit is that two-trader equilibria may be calculated as the end-points of a dynamic process of traders forming repeated adjustments to each other's strategy.</description>

      <title>Extending Stable and Popular Matching Algorithms from Bipartite to Arbitrary Instances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider stable and popular matching problems in arbitrary graphs, which are referred to as stable roommates instances. We extend the 3/2-approximation algorithm for the maximum size weakly stable matching problem to the roommates case, which solves a more than 20 year old open question of Irving and Manlove about the approximability of maximum size weakly stable matchings in roommates instances with ties [Irving and Manlove 2002] and has nice applications for the problem of matching residents to hospitals in the presence of couples. We also extend the algorithm that finds a maximum size popular matching in bipartite graphs in the case of strict preferences and the algorithm to find a popular matching among maximum weight matchings. While previous attempts to extend the idea of promoting the agents or duplicating the edges from bipartite instances to arbitrary ones failed, these results show that with the help of a simple observation, we can indeed bridge the gap and extend these algorithms</description>
