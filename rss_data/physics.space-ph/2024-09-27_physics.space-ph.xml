      <title>Impact of solar wind turbulence on a planetary bow shock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decades, near-Earth spacecraft observations have provided insights into the physics of the bow shock, suggesting that solar wind intrinsic turbulence influences the bow shock dynamics. On the other hand, theoretical studies, based on global numerical simulations, have not yet investigated the global 3D interaction between a turbulent solar wind and a planetary magnetosphere. This paper addresses this gap for the first time by investigating the global dynamics of this interaction, providing new perspectives on the underlying physical processes. We examine how the turbulent nature of the solar wind influences the 3D structure and dynamics of magnetized planetary environments or magnetized Earth-like exoplanets, using the newly developed numerical code Menura. We use the hybrid PIC model Menura to conduct 3D simulations of the turbulent solar wind and its interaction with an Earth-like magnetized planet through global numerical simulations of the magnetosphere and its surroundings. We show that solar wind turbulence globally influences the shape and dynamics of the bow shock, the magnetosheath structures, and the ion foreshock dynamics. We show that a turbulent solar wind disrupts the coherence of foreshock fluctuations, induces large fluctuations on the quasi-perpendicular surface of the bow shock, facilitates the formation of bubble-like structures near the bow shock's nose, and modifies the properties of the magnetosheath region. None of these phenomena occur when comparing with the case in which the solar wind is laminar. The turbulent nature of the solar wind impacts the 3D shape and dynamics of the bow shock, magnetosheath, and ion foreshock region. This influence should be considered when studying solar wind-planet interactions in observations and simulations. We discuss the relevance of our findings for current and future missions launched into the heliosphere.</description>

      <title>Temporal Correlation between Positive-Charged Cosmic Ray Flux and Solar Magnetic Field Variation: Insights from Delayed Modulation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the time-dependent modulation of galactic cosmic rays near Earth, with a focus on the cosmic proton flux and solar magnetic field strength. Using data from the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) and the Wilcox Solar Observatory, we identify a significant time-lagged relationship between the observation of two missions. Our model incorporates a weighted magnetic field parameter to address the hemispheric asymmetry in solar magnetic fields and captures the temporal evolution of cosmic-ray proton spectra in relation to solar activity. We find a time lag of approximately 10 months, varying with cosmic ray rigidity. At 1 GV, the time lag is 360 days, while it is 300 days above 3 GV. This offers predictive insights into cosmic ray modulation within the heliosphere. These results enhance the accuracy of space weather forecasting models, with significant implications for the safety of space missions and aviation.</description>
