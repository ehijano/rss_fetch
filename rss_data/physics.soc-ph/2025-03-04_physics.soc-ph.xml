      <title>Common indicators hurt armed conflict prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Are big conflicts different from small or medium size conflicts? To answer this question, we leverage fine-grained conflict data, which we map to climate, geography, infrastructure, economics, raw demographics, and demographic composition in Africa. With an unsupervised learning model, we find three overarching conflict types representing ``major unrest,'' ``local conflict,'' and ``sporadic and spillover events.'' Major unrest predominantly propagates around densely populated areas with well-developed infrastructure and flat, riparian geography. Local conflicts are in regions of median population density, are diverse socio-economically and geographically, and are often confined within country borders. Finally, sporadic and spillover conflicts remain small, often in low population density areas, with little infrastructure and poor economic conditions. The three types stratify into a hierarchy of factors that highlights population, infrastructure, economics, and geography, respectively, as the most discriminative indicators. Specifying conflict type negatively impacts the predictability of conflict intensity such as fatalities, conflict duration, and other measures of conflict size. The competitive effect is a general consequence of weak statistical dependence. Hence, we develop an empirical and bottom-up methodology to identify conflict types, knowledge of which can hurt predictability and cautions us about the limited utility of commonly available indicators.</description>

      <title>Validating Urban Scaling Laws through Mobile Phone Data: A Continental-Scale Analysis of Brazil's Largest Cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \abstract{Urban scaling theories posit that larger cities exhibit disproportionately higher levels of socioeconomic activity and human interactions. Yet, evidence from developing contexts (especially those marked by stark socioeconomic disparities) remains limited. To address this gap, we analyse a month-long dataset of 3.1~billion voice-call records from Brazil's 100 most populous cities, providing a continental-scale test of urban scaling laws. We measure interactions using two complementary proxies: the number of phone-based contacts (voice-call degrees) and the number of trips inferred from consecutive calls in distinct locations. Our findings reveal clear superlinear relationships in both metrics, indicating that larger urban centres exhibit intensified remote communication and physical mobility. We further observe that gross domestic product (GDP) also scales superlinearly with population, consistent with broader claims that economic output grows faster than city size. Conversely, the number of antennas required per user scales sublinearly, suggesting economies of scale in telecommunications infrastructure. Although the dataset covers a single provider, its widespread coverage in major cities supports the robustness of the results. We nonetheless discuss potential biases, including city-specific marketing campaigns and predominantly prepaid users, as well as the open question of whether higher interaction drives wealth or vice versa. Overall, this study enriches our understanding of urban scaling, emphasising how communication and mobility jointly shape the socioeconomic landscapes of rapidly growing cities.</description>

      <title>Understanding Urban-Rural Disparities in Mobility Inefficiency for Colombia, Mexico, and India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rural and urban areas exhibit distinct mobility patterns, yet a systematic understanding of how these trends differ across regions and contexts remains underexplored. By using origin-destination matrices from Location-Based Services data in Colombia, India, and Mexico, we delineate urban and rural boundaries through network percolation, reducing reliance on conventional urbanisation metrics tied to the built environment. We gauge mobility dynamics across regions developing a measure for routing inefficiency, which measures how much longer empirical trips are than their optimal shortest path. Our findings reveal that rural areas experience greater inefficiencies, particularly for longer trips made later in the day. At the urban level, we determine the misalignment between urban mobility efficiency and public transit accessibility, by measuring the difference between their respective vector fields. We observe that most cities experience misalignment during regular commuting hours, with Colombian cities exhibiting particularly high alignment. Meanwhile, mobility inefficiency in rural areas are associated with their orientation around their most proximate city. City-level analyses uncover disparities in the functions of rural and urban areas, with significant variations between weekdays and weekends, reflecting distinct roles in commuting and access to services. These findings highlight the importance of tailored, context-sensitive approaches to improving connectivity and reducing disparities. This study offers new insights into the spatial and temporal dynamics of mobility inefficiency, contributing to equitable regional planning and sustainable mobility solutions.</description>

      <title>Multivariable Behavioral Change Modeling of Epidemics in the Presence of Undetected Infections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epidemic models are invaluable tools to understand and implement strategies to control the spread of infectious diseases, as well as to inform public health policies and resource allocation. However, current modeling approaches have limitations that reduce their practical utility, such as the exclusion of human behavioral change in response to the epidemic or ignoring the presence of undetected infectious individuals in the population. These limitations became particularly evident during the COVID-19 pandemic, underscoring the need for more accurate and informative models. Motivated by these challenges, we develop a novel Bayesian epidemic modeling framework to better capture the complexities of disease spread by incorporating behavioral responses and undetected infections. In particular, our framework makes three contributions: 1) leveraging additional data on hospitalizations and deaths in modeling the disease dynamics, 2) accounting data uncertainty arising from the large presence of asymptomatic and undetected infections, and 3) allowing the population behavioral change to be dynamically influenced by multiple data sources (cases and deaths). We thoroughly investigate the properties of the proposed model via simulation, and illustrate its utility on COVID-19 data from Montreal and Miami.</description>

      <title>Technological Understanding: On the cognitive skill involved in the design and use of technological artefacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although several accounts of scientific understanding exist, the concept of understanding in relation to technology remains underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a philosophical account of technological understanding - the type of understanding that is required for and reflected by successfully designing and using technological artefacts. We develop this notion by building on the concept of scientific understanding. Drawing on parallels between science and technology, and specifically between scientific theories and technological artefacts, we extend the idea of scientific understanding into the realm of technology. We argue that, just as scientific understanding involves the ability to explain a phenomenon using a theory, technological understanding involves the ability to use a technological artefact to realise a practical aim. Technological understanding can thus be considered a specific application of knowledge: it encompasses the cognitive skill of recognising how a practical aim can be achieved by using a technological artefact. In a context of design, this general notion of technological understanding is specified as the ability to design an artefact that, by producing a phenomenon through its physical structure, achieves the intended aim. We illustrate our concept of technological understanding through two running examples: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and superconducting quantum computers. Our account highlights the epistemic dimension of engaging with technology and, by allowing for context-dependent specifications, provides guidance for testing and improving technological understanding in specific contexts.</description>

      <title>Expertise diversity of teams predicts originality and long-term impact in science and technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.04422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the growing importance of teams in producing innovative and high-impact science and technology, it remains unclear how expertise diversity among team members relates to the originality and impact of the work they produce. Here, we develop a new method to quantify the expertise distance of researchers based on their prior career histories and apply it to 23 million scientific publications and 4 million patents. We find that across science and technology, expertise-diverse teams tend to produce work with greater originality. Teams with more diverse expertise have no significant impact advantage in the short- (2 years) or mid-term (5 years). Instead, they exhibit substantially higher long-term impact (10 years), increasingly attracting larger cross-disciplinary influence. This impact premium of expertise diversity among team members becomes especially pronounced when other dimensions of team diversity are missing, as teams within the same institution or country appear to disproportionately reap the benefits of expertise diversity. While gender-diverse teams have relatively higher impact on average, teams with varied levels of gender diversity all seem to benefit from increased expertise diversity. Given the growing knowledge demands on individual researchers, implementation of incentives for original research, and the tradeoffs between short-term and long-term impacts, these results may have implications for funding, assembling, and retaining teams with originality and long-lasting impacts.</description>

      <title>Destabilizing a Social Network Model via Intrinsic Feedback Vulnerabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10868v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social influence plays a significant role in shaping individual sentiments and actions, particularly in a world of ubiquitous digital interconnection. The rapid development of generative AI has engendered well-founded concerns regarding the potential scalable implementation of radicalization techniques in social media. Motivated by these developments, we present a case study investigating the effects of small but intentional perturbations on a simple social network. We employ Taylor's classic model of social influence and tools from robust control theory (most notably the Dynamical Structure Function (DSF)), to identify perturbations that qualitatively alter the system's behavior while remaining as unobtrusive as possible. We examine two such scenarios: perturbations to an existing link and perturbations that introduce a new link to the network. In each case, we identify destabilizing perturbations of minimal norm and simulate their effects. Remarkably, we find that small but targeted alterations to network structure may lead to the radicalization of all agents, exhibiting the potential for large-scale shifts in collective behavior to be triggered by comparatively minuscule adjustments in social influence. Given that this method of identifying perturbations that are innocuous yet destabilizing applies to any suitable dynamical system, our findings emphasize a need for similar analyses to be carried out on real systems (e.g., real social networks), to identify the places where such dynamics may already exist.</description>

      <title>From Staging to Insight: An Educational Path to Understanding Bell's Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Physics is a cornerstone of modern science and technology, yet a comprehensive approach to integrating it into school curricula and communicating its foundations to policymakers, industrial stakeholders, and the general public has yet to be established. In this paper, we discuss the rationale for introducing entanglement and Bell's inequalities to a non-expert audience, and how these topics have been presented in the exhibit "Dire l'indicibile" ("Speaking the Unspeakable"), as a part of the Italian Quantum Weeks project. This initiative aims to make quantum mechanics accessible to all, bridging the gap between complex scientific principles and public understanding. Our approach meets the challenge of simplifying quantum concepts without sacrificing their core meaning, specifically avoiding the risks of oversimplification and inaccuracy. Through interactive activities, including a card game demonstration and the staging of CHSH experiments, participants explore the fundamental differences between classical and quantum probabilistic predictions. They gain insights into the significance of Bell inequality verification experiments and the implications of the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics. Preliminary results from both informal and formal assessment sessions are encouraging, suggesting the effectiveness of this approach.</description>
