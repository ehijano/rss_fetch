      <title>Modal analysis of the triadic interactions in the dynamics of a transitional shock wave boundary layer interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is a numerical study of a transitional shock wave boundary layer interaction (SWBLI). The main goal is to improve our understanding of the well known low-frequency SWBLI unsteadiness and especially the suspected role of triadic interactions in the underlying physical mechanism. To this end, a Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) is performed using high-order finite volume scheme equipped with a suitable shock capture procedure. The resulting database is then extensively post-processed in order to extract the main dynamical features of the interaction zone (involved characteristic frequencies, characteristics of the vortical structures, etc.). The dynamical organisation and space-time evolution of the flow at dominant frequencies are then further characterised by mean of a Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (SPOD) analysis. In order to study the role of triadic interactions occurring in the interaction region, a BiSpectral Mode Decomposition (BSMD) analysis is applied to the data base. It allows us to extract the significant triadic interactions, their location and the resulting physical spatial modes. Strong triadic interactions are detected in the downstream part of the separation bubble whose role on the low-frequency unsteadiness is characterised. All the results of the various analyses are then discussed and integrated to formulate a possible mechanism fuelling low-frequency SWBLI unsteadiness.</description>

      <title>Following marginal stability manifolds in quasilinear dynamical reductions of multiscale flows in two space dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A two-dimensional extension of a recently developed formalism for slow-fast quasilinear (QL) systems subject to fast instabilities is derived. Prior work has demonstrated that the emergent dynamics of these systems is characterized by a slow evolution of mean fields coupled to marginally stable, fast fluctuation fields. By exploiting this emergent behavior, an efficient fast-eigenvalue/slow-initial-value solution algorithm can be developed in which the amplitude of the fast fluctuations is slaved to the slowly evolving mean fields to ensure marginal stability (and temporal scale separation) is maintained. For 2D systems that are spatially-extended in one direction, the fluctuation eigenfunctions are labeled by their wavenumbers characterizing spatial variability in that direction, and the marginal mode(s) also must coincide with the fastest-growing mode(s) over all admissible wavenumbers. Here, we introduce two equivalent procedures for deriving an ordinary differential equation governing the slow evolution of the wavenumber of the fastest-growing fluctuation mode that simultaneously must be slaved to the mean dynamics to ensure the mode has zero growth rate. We illustrate the procedure in the context of a 2D model partial differential equation that shares certain attributes with the equations governing strongly stratified shear flows. The slaved evolution follows one or more marginal stability manifolds, which constitute select state-space structures that are not invariant under the full flow dynamics yet capture quasi-coherent states in physical space in a manner analogous to invariant solutions identified in, e.g., transitionally-turbulent shear flows. Accordingly, we propose that marginal stability manifolds are central organizing structures in a dynamical systems description of certain classes of multiscale flows where scale separation justifies a QL approximation of the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Conductive and Radiative Heat Transfer Mechanisms Inform Nusselt Number Dependence on Solid Volume Fraction for Granular Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Granular flows with solid particles play an important role in energy and catalysis applications. To predict thermal performance, this study develops a comprehensive discrete particle tracking flow model fully coupled with conductive and radiative heat transfer. Leveraging LIGGGHTS, our model uniquely integrates particle-particle and particle-wall thermal radiation for grey radiative surfaces up to nearly 10 times of particle size. Models include: (a) plug flows of particles with a near-constant streamwise velocity and (b) gravity-driven, dense, moving beds of particles to determine wall-to-particle heat-transfer coefficients with isothermal channel walls. The plug flow model is used to interrogate the interdependent effects of flow-regime-dependent solid volume fractions (0.02 -- 0.48), particle size (0.4 -- 1 mm), operating wall temperatures (700 -- 1300 K), and thermophysical particles properties including emissivity (0.1 -- 1) and thermal conductivity (0.16, 33 W/m/K). The overall and conductive heat-transfer coefficients increase with solid volume fraction, while radiation contribution decreases. For a fixed solid volume fraction, heat-transfer coefficients exhibit linear dependence on particle emissivity and cubic dependence on wall temperature, driven by enhanced thermal radiation. For a fixed mass flow rate, the dependence of radiative heat-transfer coefficient on particle size changes with solid volume fraction. To generalize the applicability of our results, heat-transfer coefficients are transformed into a dimensionless Nusselt number, and establish its dependence on solid volume fraction. These results reveal the high sensitivity of the overall Nusselt number to even small changes in solid volume fraction in the dense flow regime, particularly for the high-conductivity alumina particles. In contrast, the radiative Nusselt number asymptotes for large solid volume fractions.</description>

      <title>Triboelectrically mediated self-assembly and manipulation of drops at an interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fluid-fluid interface is a complex environment for a floating object where the statics and dynamics may be governed by capillarity, gravity, inertia, and other external body forces. Yet, the alignment of these forces in intricate ways might result in beautiful pattern formation and self-assembly of these objects, as in the case of bubble rafts or colloidal particles. While interfacial self-assembly has been explored widely, controlled manipulation of floating objects, e.g. drops, at the fluid-fluid interface still remains a challenge largely unexplored. In this work, we reveal the self-assembly and manipulation of water drops floating at an oil-air interface. We show that the assembly occurs due to electrostatic interactions between the drops and their environment. We highlight the role of the boundary surrounding the system by showing that even drops with a net zero electric charge can self-assemble under certain conditions. Using experiments and theory, we show that the depth of the oil bath plays an important role in setting the distance between the self-assembled drops. Furthermore, we demonstrate ways to manipulate the drops actively and passively at the interface.</description>

      <title>Thrust Generation by Shark Denticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DNS is performed for flow separation over a bump in a turbulent channel. Comparisons are made between a smooth bump configuration and one where the lee side is covered with replicas of complete shark denticles. As flow over the bump is under an adverse pressure gradient (APG), a reversed pore flow (RPF) is formed in the porous cavities underneath the crowns of the denticle array. Remarkable thrust is generated by the RPF as denticle necks accelerate the fluid passing between them in the upstream streamwise direction. Several geometrical features of shark denticle, including some that had not previously been considered hydrodynamically functional, are identified to form an anisotropic permeable porous media that enables and sustains the RPF and thrust generation. The RPF is activated by the APG before massive flow reversal. The results indicate a proactive, on-demand drag reduction mechanism that leverages and transforms the APG into a favorable outcome.</description>

      <title>Accuracy Assessment of Discontinuous Galerkin Spectral Element Method in Simulating Supersonic Free Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study performs large-eddy simulations of supersonic free jet flows using the Discontinuous Galerkin Spectral Element Method (DGSEM). The main objective of the present work is to assess the resolution requirements for adequate simulation of such flows with the DGSEM approach. The study looked at the influence of the mesh and the spatial discretization accuracy on the simulation results. The present analysis involves four simulations, incorporating three different numerical meshes and two different orders of spatial discretization accuracy. The numerical meshes are generated with distinct mesh topologies and refinement levels. Detailed descriptions of the grid generation and refinement procedures are presented. The study compares flow property profiles and power spectral densities of velocity components with experimental data. The results show a consistent improvement in the computed data as the simulation resolution increases. This investigation revealed a trade-off between mesh and polynomial refinement, striking a balance between computational cost and the accuracy of large-eddy simulation results for turbulent flow analyses.</description>

      <title>Application of deep learning and inline holography to estimate the droplet size distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine five machine learning-based architectures to estimate the droplet size distributions obtained using digital inline holography. The architectures, namely, U-Net, R2 U-Net, Attention U-Net, V-Net, and Residual U-Net are trained using synthetic holographic images. Our assessment focuses on evaluating the training, validation, and prediction performance of these architectures. We found that U-Net and R2 U-Net to be the most proficient, displaying consistent performance trends and achieving the highest Intersection Over Union (IOU) scores compared to the other three architectures. We employ additional training using experimental holographic images for the two top-performing architectures to validate their efficacy further. Subsequently, they are employed to segment an experimental dataset illustrating the bag breakup phenomenon, facilitating the extraction of size distribution. The extracted size distribution from U-Net and R2 U-Net segmentation is then compared with the analytical model proposed by \cite{jackiw2022prediction} by employing the gamma and log-normal distributions. Our findings indicate that the gamma distribution provides a more accurate prediction of the multi-modal size distribution than the log-normal distribution owing to its long exponential tail. The present study offers valuable insights into the effectiveness of machine learning architectures in estimating particle/droplet sizes, highlighting their practical application in real-world experimental scenarios.</description>

      <title>New bounds for heat transport in internally heated convection at infinite Prandtl number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove new bounds on the heat flux out of the bottom boundary, $\mathcal{F}_B$, for a fluid at infinite Prandtl number, heated internally between isothermal parallel plates under two kinematic boundary conditions. In uniform internally heated convection, the supply of heat equally leaves the domain by conduction when there is no flow. When the heating, quantified by the Rayleigh number, $R$, is sufficiently large, turbulent convection ensues and decreases the heat leaving the domain through the bottom boundary. In the case of no-slip boundary conditions, with the background field method, we prove that $\mathcal{F}_B \gtrsim R^{-2/3} - R^{-1/2}\log{(1-R^{-2/3})}$ up to a positive constant independent of the Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers. Whereas between stress-free boundaries we prove, $\mathcal{F}_B \gtrsim R^{-40/29} - R^{-35/29}\log{(1-R^{-40/29})}$. We perform a numerical study of the system in two dimensions up to a Rayleigh number of $5\times10^9$ with the spectral solver Dedalus. The numerical investigations indicate that $\mathcal{F}_B \sim R^{-0.092} $ and $\mathcal{F}_B \sim R^{-0.12}$ for the two kinematic boundary conditions respectively. The gap between the bounds and simulations, and our constructions in the proofs highlight that there still exists room for optimisation of bounds for $\mathcal{F}_B$.</description>

      <title>Modeling of high-pressure transient gas-liquid flow in M-shaped jumpers of subsea gas production systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-phase flow with low liquid loads is common in high-pressure natural gas offshore gathering and transmission pipelines. During gas production slowdowns or shutdowns, an accumulation of liquid in the lower sections of subsea pipelines may occur. This phenomenon is observed in jumpers that connect different units in deep-water subsea gas production facilities. The displacement of the accumulated liquid during production ramp-up induces temporal variations in pressure drop across the jumper and forces on its elbows, resulting in flow-induced vibrations (FIV) that pose potential risks to the structural integrity of the jumper. To bridge the gap between laboratory experiments and field conditions, transient 3D numerical simulations were conducted using the OpenFOAM software. These simulations facilitated the development of a mechanistic model to elucidate the factors contributing to increased pressure and forces during the liquid purging process. The study examined the influence of gas pressure level, pipe diameter, initially accumulated liquid amount, liquid properties, and gas mass flow rate on the transient pressure drop and the forces acting on the jumper's elbows. The critical gas production rate required for complete liquid removal of the accumulated liquid was determined, and scaling rules were proposed to predict the effects of gas pressure and pipe diameter on this critical value. The dominant frequencies of pressure and force fluctuations were identified, with low-pressure systems exhibiting frequencies associated with two-phase flow phenomena and high-pressure systems showing frequencies attributed to acoustic waves.</description>

      <title>Spatio-Temporal Fluid Dynamics Modeling via Physical-Awareness and Parameter Diffusion Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a two-stage framework named ST-PAD for spatio-temporal fluid dynamics modeling in the field of earth sciences, aiming to achieve high-precision simulation and prediction of fluid dynamics through spatio-temporal physics awareness and parameter diffusion guidance. In the upstream stage, we design a vector quantization reconstruction module with temporal evolution characteristics, ensuring balanced and resilient parameter distribution by introducing general physical constraints. In the downstream stage, a diffusion probability network involving parameters is utilized to generate high-quality future states of fluids, while enhancing the model's generalization ability by perceiving parameters in various physical setups. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets have verified the effectiveness and robustness of the ST-PAD framework, which showcase that ST-PAD outperforms current mainstream models in fluid dynamics modeling and prediction, especially in effectively capturing local representations and maintaining significant advantages in OOD generations.</description>

      <title>Complex Dynamics of an Acoustically Levitated Fluid Droplet Captured by a Low-Order Immersed Boundary Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel immersed boundary method that implements acoustic perturbation theory to model an acoustically levitated droplet. Instead of resolving sound waves numerically, our hybrid method solves acoustic scattering semi-analytically and models the corresponding time-averaged acoustic forces on the droplet. This framework allows the droplet to be simulated on inertial timescales of interest, and thereby admit a much larger time resolution than traditional compressible flow solvers. To benchmark this technique and demonstrate its utility, we implement the hybrid IBM for a single droplet in a standing wave. Simulated droplet shape deformations and streaming profile agree with theoretical predictions. Our simulations also yield new insights on the streaming profiles for elliptical droplets, for which a comprehensive analytic solution does not exist.</description>

      <title>What is isotropic turbulence and why is it important?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article begins with an overview, then gives the precise definition of isotropic turbulence, and follows that with the basic conservation equations, in both real space and wavenumber space. These provide the foundations of all theoretical approaches, both fundamental and phenomenological. After that, my intention is to try to highlight the main unresolved issues and give some indication of what progress there has been over decades (in all cases), and what still needs to be done. I should emphasise that I am not trying to provide either a conventional review or even a pedagogical treatment. Instead I am giving concise summaries, supplemented (where I can) by my own observations, which make substantial points that I believe are original, and which have not been made in the literature. To take just one example, it is known by some people that Kolmogorov's 1962 theory is not correctly described as a 'refinement' of his 1941 theory. This was pointed out by Kraichnan in 1974. However, what does not appear to have been recognized is that the 1962 theory is physically invalid, and also that a plausible implementation of it destroys the Kolmogorov (1941) scaling of energy spectra which has been widely observed over many years. This is discussed in Section 4 below. Lastly, I have tried to give an informal treatment in order to make everything easily accessible, to reach the widest possible audience. In particular, the section on renormalization methods is written without giving the equations of the various theories, merely stating in words what has been done, what are the different methods and also what still needs to be done.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wave energy conversion is emerging as a promising technology for generating energy from renewable sources. Large-scale implementation of this technology requires the installation of parks of devices. We study the problem of optimizing the park layout and control for wave energy converters of the oscillating water column type. As a test case, we consider a device with a semi-submerged chamber and a Wells turbine working in the liquid phase. First, a novel model based on a nonlinear ordinary differential equation is derived to describe the behavior of the water column and used to estimate the power matrix of an isolated device. Then, its linearization is derived in order to enable the fast simulation of large parks with a high number of devices. The choice of the hydrodynamic model allows obtaining the gradient of the power with respect to the positions through an adjoint approach, making it especially convenient for optimization. We consider in particular the case of interaction with the piles of a floating wind energy plant. The results from the developed computational framework allow us to draw interesting conclusions that are useful when designing the layout of a park. In particular, we observe that interaction effects can be significant even in parks made up of devices of small size, which would exhibit negligible diffraction and radiation properties in isolated conditions, if the number of devices is large enough. Moreover, results show that wave reflection from the piles of an offshore platform can have positive effects on energy production.</description>

      <title>Unified Framework for Laser-induced Transient Bubble Dynamics within Microchannels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Oscillatory flow in confined spaces is central to understanding physiological flows and rational design of synthetic periodic-actuation based micromachines. Using theory and experiments on oscillating flows generated through a laser-induced cavitation bubble, we associate the dynamic bubble size (fluid velocity) and bubble lifetime to the laser energy supplied - a control parameter in experiments. Employing different channel cross-section shapes, sizes and lengths, we demonstrate the characteristic scales for velocity, time and energy to depend solely on the channel geometry. Contrary to the generally assumed absence of instability in low Reynolds number flows (&lt;1000), we report a momentary flow distortion that originates due to the boundary layer separation near channel walls during flow deceleration. The emergence of distorted laminar states is characterized using two stages. First the conditions for the onset of instabilities is analyzed using the Reynolds number and Womersley number for oscillating flows. Second the growth and the ability of an instability to prevail is analyzed using the convective time scale of the flow. Our findings inform rational design of microsystems leveraging pulsatile flows via cavitation-powered microactuation.</description>

Abstract: Conceptualizing a porous media as a network of conductors sets a compromise between the oversimplifying conceptualization of the media as a bundle of capillary tubes and the computationally expensive and unobtainable detailed description of the media's geometry needed for direct numerical simulations. These models are abundantly being used to evaluate single and multiphase flow characteristics. The different flow characteristics are valuable in evaluating phenomena that may or may not be relevant for different applications. Here, we evaluate how different information about the pore space affects the ability of the network model to evaluate different flow characteristics.</description>
