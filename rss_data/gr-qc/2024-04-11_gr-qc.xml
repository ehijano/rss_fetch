      <title>Interacting tachyon with varying mass dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an investigation of cosmological dynamics of tachyon fluid coupled to varyingmass dark matter particles in the background of spatially flat FLRW universe. The mechanism of varying mass particles scenario assumes the mass of the dark matter depends on time t through the scalar field ${\phi}$ in the sense that the decaying of dark matter reproduces the scalar field. First, we analyze the model from dynamical systems perspective by converting the cosmological evolution equations into an autonomous system of ordinary differential equations with a suitable transformation of variables. We choose the mass of dark matter as exponential function of scalar field and the exponential potential of the tachyon field is undertaken in such a way that the autonomous system is reduced in three dimensional form. The critical points obtained from the system are non-hyperbolic in nature. The center manifold theory is employed to discuss the nature of the critical points. Numerical investigation also carried out for some critical points. From this analysis, we obtain dust dominated decelerated transient phase of the universe followed by dark energy dominated scaling attractor alleviating the coincidence problem. Next, we perform the statefinder diagnostic approach to compare our model to ${\Lambda}$CDM and finally we study the evolution of the Hubble parameter and the distance modulus and compare this with observational data.</description>

      <title>Smearing of primordial gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mechanism for smearing of the primordial gravitational waves during the radiation-dominated phase of the evolution of the Universe is considered. It is shown that the primordial gravitational waves can possess hyperbolicity features due to their propagation through the matter inhomogeneities. This mechanism of smearing can lead to the flattening of the original gravitational wave spectrum and hence has to be taken into account at the interpretation of the properties of primordial gravitational background on the detection of which are oriented ongoing and forthcoming experimental facilities.</description>

      <title>Radial stability of spherical bosonic stars and critical points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study radial perturbations of spherically symmetric spin-$0$ and spin-$1$ bosonic stars, computing numerically the squared frequency of the fundamental mode. We find that not all critical points $-$ where the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner mass attains an extremum $-$ correspond to zero modes. Thus, radial stability does not $\textit{always}$ change at such critical points. The results are in agreement with the so-called critical point method.</description>

      <title>Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy Products for NUT class of Black Holes in AdS Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the entropy product rule for Taub-NUT~(Newman-Unti-Tamburino)-de~Sitter black hole~(BH) and Taub-NUT--Anti-de~Sitter BH. We show that the entropy products in terms of both the physical horizons are \emph{mass-independent}. Both \emph{perturbative} approximation and \emph{direct} method have been considered. By introducing the cosmological horizon we show that for Taub-NUT-de~Sitter BH, there exists a mass-independent entropy functional relation in terms of three horizons namely event horizon~(EH), Cauchy horizon~(CH) and cosmological horizon~(CHH) which depends on cosmological parameter~($\Lambda$) and the NUT parameter~($N$). For Taub-NUT-anti-de~Sitter BHs, we determine the mass-independent entropy functional relations in terms of two physical horizons~(namely EH and CH) which depends on only NUT parameter. Some-times some complicated functions of EH entropy and CH entropy are also strictly mass-independent. This is plausible only due to the new formalism developed in~\cite{wu}~[Phys. Rev. D 100, 101501(R)~(2019)] for NUT class of BHs. The formalism states that a generic four-dimensional Taub-NUT spacetime should be described completely in terms of three or four different types of thermodynamic hairs. They could be defined as the Komar mass~($M=m$), the angular momentum~($J_{n}=mn$), the gravitomagnetic charge ($N=n$), the dual~(magnetic) mass $(\tilde{M}=n)$. Finally, we could say that this universality is mainly due to the presence of \emph{new conserved charges $J_{N}=MN$} which is closely analogue to the Kerr-like angular momentum $J=aM$.</description>

      <title>On the nature of inner light-rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-singular horizonless ultracompact objects provide a simple resolution to the black holes singularity problem. It has been shown that, if these objects are compact enough to exhibit the presence of the light-ring required to mimic the phenomenology of general relativity black holes, they must have at least one additional light-ring. The stability of the inner light ring has been proven under the assumption of Einstein equations and the validity of the null energy condition. Since this can have important repercussions on the instability of a horizonless ultracompact object and the existence of the latter requires some modified gravitational dynamics and/or exotic matter, it is desirable to obtain a model-independent proof of the stability of the additional light-ring. In this paper, we prove the stability of the inner light-ring without any assumption on the dynamics of the theory, while assuming that the outer light-ring has the same properties as the Kerr light-ring. Given the stringent observational constraints on the geometry at the outer light-ring scale, our result now rests solely on geometric considerations and applies to any theory of gravity with any matter content that cannot be ruled out by observations.</description>

      <title>Geometric deformation and redshift structure caused by plane gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The curved spacetime induced by gravitational waves can give rise to visual effects such as geometric distortions and redshift structures in the observed image. By establishing a mapping from the object's surface coordinates to the observer's screen coordinates, we study these effects in the context of plane gravitational waves. The simulation reveals that the image of an object doesn't merely seem compressed or stretched, but rather appears twisted and wobbled. Furthermore, the redshift structure on the object's surface appears to rotate as a whole. This outcome offers an intuitive depiction of the lensing effect in plane gravitational wave spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Photon Counting Interferometry to Detect Geontropic Space-Time Fluctuations with GQuEST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The GQuEST (Gravity from the Quantum Entanglement of Space-Time) experiment uses tabletop-scale Michelson laser interferometers to probe for fluctuations in space-time. We present an interferometer design featuring a novel photon counting readout method that provides unprecedented sensitivity, as it is not subject to the interferometric standard quantum limit. We evaluate the potential of this design to measure space-time fluctuations motivated by recent `geontropic' quantum gravity models. The accelerated accrual of statistical power offered by the photon counting readout enables GQuEST to detect the predicted quantum gravity phenomena within measurement times at least 100 times shorter than equivalent conventional interferometers. The GQuEST design thus enables a fast and sensitive search for signatures of quantum gravity in a laboratory-scale experiment.</description>

      <title>See the lightning, hear the thunder: quasinormal modes-shadow correspondence for rotating regular black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eikonal quasinormal modes (QNMs) of black holes (BHs) and parameters of null geodesics, ultimately tied to the appearance of BHs to external observers, are known to be related, and the eikonal QNM-BH shadow radii correspondence has been extensively studied for spherically symmetric BHs. The extension to rotating BHs is non-trivial, and has been worked out only for equatorial ($m=\pm\ell$) QNMs, or for general modes but limited to the Kerr metric. We extend the QNM-shadow radius correspondence to more general rotating space-times, and argue that the requirements for it to hold amount to conditions on the separability of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for null geodesics and the Klein-Gordon equation. Metrics obtained by the Newman-Janis algorithm enjoy these conditions, provided certain mathematical requirements are imposed on the line element. We explicitly verify the correspondence for the rotating Bardeen and Hayward regular BHs, both of which satisfy the separability requirements. Our findings show that the QNM-shadow radius correspondence holds for a wide range of axisymmetric space-times beyond Kerr. This paves the way to potential strong-field multi-messenger tests of fundamental physics by hearing (via gravitational wave spectroscopy - the ``thunder'') and seeing (via VLBI imaging - the ``lightning'') BHs, although substantial improvements relative to the current observational sensitivity are required to make this possible.</description>

Abstract: We review recent mathematical results concerning the high-frequency solutions to the Einstein vacuum equations and the limits of these solutions. In particular, we focus on two conjectures of Burnett, which attempt to give an exact characterization of high-frequency limits of vacuum spacetimes as solutions to the Einstein-massless Vlasov system. Some open problems and future directions are discussed.</description>

      <title>The classical-quantum hybrid canonical dynamics and its difficulties with special and general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the Hamiltonian hybrid coupling between a classical and a quantum subsystem. If applicable to classical gravity coupled to quantized matter, this hybrid theory might realize a captivating `postquantum' alternative to full quantum-gravity. We summarize the nonrelativistic hybrid dynamics in improved formalism adequate to Hamiltonian systems. The mandatory decoherence and diffusion terms become divergent in special and general relativistic extensions. It is not yet known if any renormalization method might reconcile Markovian decoherence and diffusion with relativity. Postquantum gravity could previously only be realized in the Newtonian approximation. We argue that pending problems of the recently proposed general relativistic postquantum theory will not be solved if Markovian diffusion/decoherence are truly incompatible with relativity.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave lensing in Einstein-aether theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Einstein-aether theory provides a model to test the validity of local Lorentz invariance in gravitational interactions. The speed of gravitational waves as measured from the binary neutron star event GW170817 sets stringent limits on Einstein-aether theory, but only on a combination of the theory's free parameters. For this reason, a significant part of the theory's parameter space remains unconstrained by observations. Motivated by this, we explore the propagation of gravitational waves in Einstein-aether theory over an inhomogeneous background (i.e., gravitational wave lensing) as a potential mechanism to break the degeneracies between the theory's free parameters, and hence enable new constraints on the theory to be obtained. By bringing the field equations into the form of the so-called kinetic matrix and applying a formalism known as the propagation eigenstate framework, we find that the speed of gravitational waves is modified by inhomogeneities in the aether field. However, the modification is common to both gravitational polarizations and vanishes in the limit in which gravitational waves propagate with luminal speed. This lens-dependent gravitational wave speed contrasts with the lens-induced birefringence observed in other theories beyond general relativity, like Horndeski's theory. While the potential to improve tests based on gravitational-wave speed is limited, our formalism sets the basis to fully describe signal propagation over inhomogeneous spacetimes in Einstein-aether theory and other extensions of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Slowly rotating charges from Weyl double copy for Kerr black hole with Chern-Simons correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Weyl double copy builds the relation between gauge theory and gravity theory, especially the correspondence between gauge solutions and gravity solutions. In this paper, we obtain the slowly rotating charge solutions from Weyl double copy for the Kerr black hole with small Chern-Simons correction. Based on the Weyl double copy relation, for the Petrov type D solution, we find the additional correction to the electromagnetic field strength tensor of rotating charge. For the Petrov type I solution, we find that the additional electromagnetic field strength tensors have the exogenous properties, while the total sources vanish at the leading order.</description>

      <title>Searching for Cosmological Collider in the Planck CMB Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the first comprehensive CMB data analysis of cosmological collider physics. New heavy particles during inflation can leave imprints in the primordial correlators which are observable in today's cosmological surveys. This remarkable detection channel provides an unsurpassed opportunity to probe new physics at extremely high energies. Here we initiate the search for these relic signals in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from the Planck legacy release. On the theory side, guided by recent progress from the cosmological bootstrap, we first propose a family of analytic bispectrum templates that incorporate the distinctive signatures of cosmological collider physics. Our consideration includes the oscillatory signals in the squeezed limit, the angular dependence from spinning fields, and several new shapes from nontrivial sound speed effects. On the observational side, we apply the recently developed pipeline, CMB Bispectrum Estimator (CMB-BEST), to efficiently analyze the three-point statistics and search directly for these new templates in the Planck 2018 temperature and polarization data. We report stringent CMB constraints on these new templates. Furthermore, we perform parameter scans to search for the best-fit values with maximum significance. For a benchmark example of collider templates, we find $f_{NL}=-91\pm40$ at the $68\%$ confidence level. After accounting for the look-elsewhere effect, the biggest adjusted significance we get is $1.8\sigma$. In general, we find no significant evidence of cosmological collider signals in the Planck data. However, this innovative analysis demonstrates the potential for discovering new heavy particles during inflation in forthcoming cosmological surveys.</description>

      <title>Liouville gravity at the end of the world: Deformed defects in AdS/BCFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study shape deformations of two-dimensional end-of-the-world (ETW) branes, such as those in bottom-up models of two-dimensional holographic boundary conformal field theories (BCFT), and derive an action for the theory of brane deformations in any bulk three-dimensional maximally symmetric spacetime. In the case of a bulk anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime, at leading order in the ultraviolet cutoff, the induced theory on the brane controlling its shape is Liouville gravity coupled to quantum matter. We show in certain limits the theory reduces to semi-classical AdS, dS or flat Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity, thus providing the first doubly-holographic derivation of two-dimensional models of dilaton gravity minimally coupled to a large number of conformal fields. Specializing to the AdS JT gravity limit, we discuss the dual BCFT interpretation and provide evidence that changing the boundary conditions of JT gravity on the brane is equivalent to a deformation of the dual BCFT with the displacement operator. This establishes a doubly-holographic triality between (i) brane deformations in the bulk, (ii) JT gravity in the brane description, and (iii) irrelevant deformations of the CFT boundary. Lastly, in the presence of a non-trivial dilaton profile, we prove that the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for holographic BCFTs receives a contact term whenever the minimal surface ends on the brane.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature renormalization of Standard Model coupled with gravity, and its implications for cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finite-temperature one-loop renormalization of the Standard Model, coupled with dynamic metrics, is conducted in this study. The entire analysis is coherently carried out by using the refined background field method, applied in the spirit of the Coleman-Weinberg technique. The general form of the propagator, introduced in our previous work to facilitate Feynman diagram computation in a general curved background, proves useful in the presence of time-dependent temperature. Its utilization allows for the analysis of a FLRW background to essentially reduce to that of a constant finite-T flat spacetime. Notably, this method also provides an effective tool for addressing one of the longstanding problems in QCD, the Linde problem. The implications of our findings for cosmology, particularly the cosmological constant problem and Hubble tension, are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we embark on the thermodynamic investigation concerning a family of primary charged black holes within the context of shift and parity symmetric Beyond Horndeski gravity. Employing the Euclidean approach, we derive the functional expression for the free energy and derive the first thermodynamic law, offering a methodology to address the challenge of extracting the thermal quantities in shift-symmetric scalar tensor theories characterized by linear time dependence in the scalar field. Following the formal analysis, we provide some illustrative examples focusing on the thermal evaporation of these fascinating objects.</description>

      <title>Tensor models and group field theories: combinatorics, large $N$ and renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a brief overview of tensor models and group field theories, focusing on their main common features. Both frameworks arose in the context of quantum gravity research, and can be understood as higher-dimensional generalizations of matrix models. We describe the common combinatorial structure underlying such models and review some of the key mathematical results that have been obtained in this area. Of central importance is the discovery of a new family of large $N$ expansions for random tensors. It has driven applications of tensor models to random geometry and non-perturbative local quantum field theory, and has also enabled the development of rigorous renormalization methods for group field theories and other non-local quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>Approaches to photon absorption in a Lorentz invariance violation scenario</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the Universe's transparency to gamma rays within a Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) framework, focusing on photon subluminal quadratic corrections driven by a high-energy scale. Based on an explicit calculation, we provide a new expression for the cross section that overcomes the limitations of previous approaches and refines existing constraints for the LIV scale, while we introduce a new approximation that may be useful in LIV scenarios beyond effective field theory. These improvements appear essential for setting constraints on LIV effects with future observations at ultra-high energies, where previous approximations may fall short.</description>

      <title>The expected kinematic matter dipole is robust against source evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent measurements using catalogues of quasars and radio galaxies have shown that the dipole anisotropy in the large-scale distribution of matter is about twice as large as is expected in the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, indeed in any cosmology based on the Friedman-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric. This expectation is based on the kinematic interpretation of the dipole anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background, i.e. as arising due to our local peculiar velocity. The effect of aberration and Doppler boosting on the projected number counts on the sky of cosmologically distant objects in a flux-limited catalogue can then be calculated and confronted with observations. This fundamental consistency test of FLRW models proposed by Ellis &amp; Baldwin (1984) was revisited by Dalang &amp; Bonvin (2022) [arXiv:2111.03616] who argued that redshift evolution of the sources can significantly affect the expected matter dipole. In this note we demonstrate that the Ellis &amp; Baldwin test is in fact robust to such effects, hence the &gt; 5$\sigma$ dipole anomaly uncovered by Secrest et al. (2021, 2022) [arXiv:2009.14826, arXiv:2206.05624] remains an outstanding challenge to the $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Astrophysics and Nuclear Physics Informed Interactions in Dense Matter: Insights from PSR J0437-4715</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how vector and isovector interactions can be determined within the density regime of neutron stars, while fulfilling nuclear and astrophysics constrains. We make use of the Chiral Mean Field (CMF) model, a SU(3) nonlinear realization of the sigma model within the mean-field approximation, for the first time within a Bayesian analysis framework. We show that neutron-matter $\chi$EFT constraints at low density are only satisfied if the vector-isovector mixed interaction term is included, e.g., a $\omega^2\rho^2$ term. We also show the behavior of the model with respect to the conformal limit. We demonstrate that the CMF model is able to predict a value for the parameter $d_c$ related to the trace anomaly and its derivative takes values below 0.2 above four times saturation density within a hadronic model that does not include a phase transition to deconfined matter. We compare these effects with results from other (non-chiral) Relativistic Mean Field models to assess how different approaches to incorporating the same physical constraints affect predictions of neutron-star properties and dense matter equations of state. We also include data from the gravitation wave event GW230529 detected by the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra collaboration and the most recent radius measurement of PSR J0437-4715 from the NASA NICER mission. Our analysis reveals that this new NICER measurement leads to an average reduction of approximately $\sim 0.15$ km radius in the posterior of the neutron-star mass-radius relationship.</description>

Abstract: We study circular orbits of charged particles in spherically symmetric AdS black holes in Gauss-Bonnet gravity in arbitrary dimensions, and their limiting ISCOs (innermost stable circular orbits). The dual interpretation is in terms of certain conformal field theory (CFT) operators, whose anomalous dimensions can be extracted from the binding energy of charged probes in the bulk, in a large radius limit. The charge to mass ratio of particles in the black hole background is found to increase with the Gauss-Bonnet coupling parameter $\widetilde{\alpha}$, consistent with the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) bound known for self-repulsive particles. The radius of the ISCOs decreases with $\widetilde{\alpha}$, existing until the limit set by the WGC bound.</description>

      <title>Local Limit of Nonlocal Gravity: A Teleparallel Extension of General Relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.05536v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a general constitutive framework for a teleparallel extension of the general theory of relativity. This approach goes beyond the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (TEGR) by broadening the analogy with the electrodynamics of media. In particular, the main purpose of this paper is to investigate in detail a local constitutive extension of TEGR that is the local limit of nonlocal gravity (NLG). Within this framework, we study the modified FLRW cosmological models. Of these, the most cogent turns out to be the modified Cartesian flat model which is shown to be inconsistent with the existence of a positive cosmological constant. Moreover, dynamic dark energy and other components of the modified Cartesian flat model evolve differently with the expansion of the universe as compared to the standard flat cosmological model. The observational consequences of the modified Cartesian flat model are briefly explored and it is shown that the model is capable of resolving the H_0 tension.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of matter-type modified gravity theories to general relativity with nonminimal matter interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we first establish that gravity models incorporating matter-related terms, such as $f(\mathcal{L}_{\rm m})$, $f(g_{\mu\nu} T^{\mu\nu})$, and $f(T_{\mu\nu} T^{\mu\nu})$, into the usual matter Lagrangian density $\mathcal{L}_{\rm m}$, are equivalent to general relativity with nonminimal matter interactions. Through the redefinition $\mathcal{L}_{\rm m}+f \rightarrow \mathcal{L}_{\rm m}^{\rm tot}$, these models are exactly GR, yet the usual material field $T_{\mu\nu}$ and its accompanying partner, the modification field $T_{\mu\nu}^{\rm mod}$, engage in nonminimal interactions. Specifically, $\nabla^{\mu}T_{\mu\nu}=-Q_{\nu}=-\nabla^{\mu}T_{\mu\nu}^{\rm mod}$, where $Q_{\nu}$ is the interaction kernel that governs the rate of energy transfer. Our focus narrows on the specific model of $f(T_{\mu\nu} T^{\mu\nu})$, known as Energy-Momentum Squared Gravity, where the usual material field $T_{\mu\nu}$ is accompanied by an \textit{energy-momentum squared field} (EMSF), $T_{\mu\nu}^{\rm emsf}$, along with a sui generis nonminimal interaction between them. We demonstrate that a particular $T_{\mu\nu}^{\rm emsf}$ can be introduced by \textit{removing} $\frac{\partial^2 \mathcal{L}_{\rm m}}{\partial g^{\mu\nu} \partial g^{\sigma\epsilon}}$ (the new term emerging in models that incorporate scalars formed from $T_{\mu\nu}$), thanks to the freedom in determining the interaction kernel, but this approach compromises the Lagrangian formulation of EMSG. Additionally, we address the ambiguities regarding the perfect fluid stemming from this new term. We show the proper way of calculating this term for a perfect fluid, revealing that it is indeed non-zero, contrary to common assumption in the literature. Finally, we re-examine cosmological models within the realm of EMSG, offering new insights into the applicability and interpretation of our findings in EMSG and similar theoretical frameworks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalar-tensor theories with screening mechanisms come with non-linearities that make it difficult to study setups of complex geometry without resorting to numerical simulations. In this article, we use the $\textit{femtoscope}$ code that we introduced in a previous work in order to compute the fifth force arising in the chameleon model in the Earth orbit. We go beyond published works by introducing a departure from spherical symmetry $\unicode{x2014}$ embodied by a mountain on an otherwise spherical Earth $\unicode{x2014}$ as well as by implementing several atmospheric models, and quantify their combined effect on the chameleon field. Building on the numerical results thus obtained, we address the question of the detectability of a putative chameleon fifth force by means of space geodesy techniques and, for the first time, quantitatively assess the back-reaction created by the screening of a satellite itself. We find that although the fifth force has a supposedly measurable effect on the dynamics of an orbiting spacecraft, the imprecise knowledge of the mass distribution inside the Earth greatly curtails the constraining power of such space missions. Finally, we show how this degeneracy can be lifted when several measurements are performed at different altitudes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06780v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a new action formulation of hyperfluids, fluids with intrinsic hypermomentum. Brown's Lagrangian for a relativistic perfect fluid is generalised by incorporating the degrees of freedom encoded in the hypermomentum tensor, namely by including connection-matter couplings. Quite interestingly, generic hyperfluids are imperfect, since hypermomentum induces such effects as bulk and shear viscosities as well as heat fluxes. The various coefficients that appear in the first order expansion of hydrodynamics can now be deduced from a Lagrangian formulation, given a geometrical interpretation and a suggested microscopic description in terms of hypermomentum. This connection between hypermomentum and dissipative fluids could shed new light on the physics of relativistic hydrodynamics. The applicability of the new formalism is demonstrated by exact cosmological solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New physics beyond General Relativity can modify image features of black holes and horizonless spacetimes and increase the separation between photon rings. This motivates us to explore synthetic images consisting of two thin rings. Our synthetic images are parameterized by the separation as well as the relative flux density of the two rings. We perform fits to the visibility amplitude and analyze closure quantities. The current Event Horizon Telescope array cannot detect the presence of a second ring in the region of parameters motivated by particular new-physics cases. We show that this can be improved in three ways: first, if the array is upgraded with Earth-based telescopes with sufficiently high sensitivity, second, if the array is upgraded with a space-based station and third, if super-resolution techniques are used for the data obtained by the array.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Rajagapol et al presented an asymptotically AdS black hole metric whose thermodynamics qualitatively mimics the behavior of the Van der Waals fluid by treating the cosmological constant as a thermodynamic pressure. In some studies in the literature, authors have discussed the effects of deformed algebras such as generalized and extended uncertainty principles on the thermal quantities of these black holes. In this manuscript, we considered another deformation, the rainbow gravity formalism, and we investigated its impact on the Van der Waal black hole thermodynamics. To this end, we first generated the modified lapse and mass functions, and then we derived the modified thermal quantities such as thermodynamic volume, Hawking temperature, entropy, and specific heat functions. Finally, we explored the thermodynamics of a black hole, which mimics the thermodynamics of an ideal gas, under the influence of the rainbow gravity formalism.</description>

      <title>Nontensorial gravitational wave polarizations from the tensorial degrees of freedom: I. Linearized Lorentz-violating theory of gravity with s tensor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03474v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: General relativity predicts the existence of only two tensorial gravitational wave polarizations, while a generic metric theories of gravity can possess up to four additional polarizations, including two vector and two scalar ones. These vector/scalar polarizations are in general generated by the intrinsic new vector/scalar degrees of freedom of the specific theories of gravity. In this paper, we show that, with the violation of the Lorentz symmetry in the framework of the standard model extension, the additional nontensorial polarizations can be directly excited by the two tensorial degrees of freedom. We consider the diffeomorphism invariant standard model extension in the gravity sector with the Lorentz-violating coefficients $\hat{\boldsymbol s}^{(d)\mu\rho\nu\sigma}$ of the even mass dimension $d\ge4$. In addition to the extra polarizations induced by the tensor modes, the gravitational wave in this theory travels at a speed depending on the propagation direction, experiences dispersion if and only if $d\ge6$, and possesses neither velocity nor amplitude birefringence. The excitement of the extra polarizations is also chiral. The antenna pattern functions of interferometers due to such kind of gravitational waves are generally linear combinations of those for all polarizations. Detected by pulsar timing arrays and the Gaia satellite, the stochastic gravitational wave background in this model could induce couplings among cross correlations, of the redshifts of photons and the astrometric deflections of the positions of pulsars, for different polarizations. These characteristics enable the use of interferometers, pulsar timing arrays and Gaia mission to constrain this model.</description>

Abstract: We propose a correspondence between the Morris--Thorne wormhole metric and a warp drive metric, which generalizes an earlier result by H. Ellis regarding the Schwarzschild black hole metric and makes it possible to embed a warp drive in a wormhole background. We demonstrate that in order to do that, one needs to also generalize the Natario--Alcubierre definition of warp drive and introduce nonzero intrinsic curvature. However, we also find out that in order to be traversable by a warp drive, the wormhole should have a horizon: in other words, humanly traversable wormholes cannot be traversed by a warp drive, and vice versa. We also discuss possible loopholes in this "no-go" theorem</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Influence of Geometrical Deformation on Photon Sphere and Shadow Radius: A New Analytical Approach -- Part I: Spherically Symmetric Spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach to investigate the behavior of the photon sphere and shadow radius. Our method leverages extended gravitational decoupling and unveils two key analytic results. First, the additional matter field alters the photon sphere radius: it increases if $g'(r_{ph}^{(0)})&gt;0$ and decreases if $g'(r_{ph}^{(0)})&lt;0$ (where $g'$ represents the derivative of a specific metric function evaluated at the original photon sphere radius). Second, the presence of the matter field can modify the black hole shadow size. If $g\left(r_{ph}^{(0)}\right)&gt;0$, the shadow shrinks, while it grows for $g\left(r_{ph}^{(0)}\right)&lt;0$. These findings offer a deeper understanding of how matter distribution affects the characteristics of black holes and their observable features. By providing a systematic framework supported by diverse illustrative examples, our investigation not only sheds light on these fundamental aspects but also quantifiably advances the theoretical framework in black hole astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole formation during the QCD phase transition: threshold, mass distribution and abundance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black hole (PBH) formation during cosmic phase transitions and annihilation periods, such as the QCD transition or the $e^+e^-$-annihilation, is thought to be particularly efficient due to a softening of the equation of state. We present a detailed numerical study of PBH formation during the QCD epoch in order to derive an accurate PBH mass function. We also briefly consider PBH formation during the $e^+e^-$-annihilation epoch. Our investigation confirms that, for nearly scale-invariant spectra, PBH abundances on the QCD scale are enhanced by a factor $\sim 10^3$ compared to a purely radiation dominated Universe. For a power spectrum producing an (almost) scale-invariant PBH mass function outside of the transition, we find a peak mass of $M_{\rm pbh}\approx 1.9 M_{\odot}$ with a fraction $f\approx 1.5\times 10^{-2}$ of the PBHs having a mass of $M_{\rm pbh} &gt; 10 M_{\odot}$, possibly contributing to the LIGO-Virgo black hole merger detections. We point out that the physics of PBH formation during the $e^+e^-$-annihilation epoch is more complex as it is very close to the epoch of neutrino decoupling. We argue that neutrinos free-streaming out of overdense regions may actually hinder PBH formation.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Domain Distribution of Astrophysical Gravitational-Wave Backgrounds</title>

Abstract: The superposition of many astrophysical gravitational wave (GW) signals below typical detection thresholds baths detectors in a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). In this work, we present a Fourier space approach to compute the frequency-domain distribution of stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds produced by discrete sources. Expressions for the moment-generating function and the distribution of observed (discrete) Fourier modes are provided. The results are first applied to the signal originating from all the mergers of compact stellar remnants (black holes and neutron stars) in the Universe, which is found to exhibit a $-4$ power-law tail. This tail is verified in the signal-to-noise ratio distribution of GWTC events. The extent to which the subtraction of bright (loud) mergers gaussianizes the resulting confusion noise of unresolved sources is then illustrated. The power-law asymptotic tail for the unsubtracted signal, and an exponentially decaying tail in the case of the SGWB, are also derived analytically. Our results generalize to any background of gravitational waves emanating from discrete, individually coherent, sources.</description>

      <title>Photonic entanglement with accelerated light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01764v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accelerated light has been demonstrated with laser light and diffraction. Within the diffracting field it is possible to identify a portion that carries most of the beam energy, which propagates in a curved trajectory as it would have been accelerated by a gravitational field for instance. Here, we analyze the effects of this kind of acceleration over the entanglement between twin beams produced in spontaneous parametric down-conversion. Our results show that acceleration does not affect entanglement significantly, under ideal conditions. The optical scheme introduced can be useful in the understanding of processes in the boundary between gravitation and quantum physics.</description>

      <title>Regularized Weyl double copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06048v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a regularization procedure in the sourced Weyl double copy, a spinorial version of the classical double copy, such that it matches much more general results in the Kerr-Schild version. In the regularized Weyl double copy, the anti-de Sitter (AdS) and the Lifshitz black holes, which form the basis of the study of strongly coupled gauge theories at finite temperature through the AdS/CFT correspondence and its non-relativistic generalization, become treatable. We believe that this might pave the way for finding out a relation between the classical double copy and holography.</description>

      <title>The metallicity dependence and evolutionary times of merging binary black holes: Combined constraints from individual gravitational-wave detections and the stochastic background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of gravitational-wave astronomy is now allowing for the study of compact binary merger demographics throughout the Universe. This information can be leveraged as tools for understanding massive stars, their environments, and their evolution. One active question is the nature of compact binary formation: the environmental and chemical conditions required for black hole birth and the time delays experienced by binaries before they merge. Gravitational-wave events detected today, however, primarily occur at low or moderate redshifts due to current interferometer sensitivity, therefore limiting our ability to probe the high redshift behavior of these quantities. In this work, we circumvent this limitation by using an additional source of information: observational limits on the gravitational-wave background from unresolved binaries in the distant Universe. Using current gravitational-wave data from the first three observing runs of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA, we combine catalogs of directly detected binaries and limits on the stochastic background to constrain the time-delay distribution and metallicity dependence of binary black hole evolution. Looking to the future, we also explore how these constraints will be improved at the Advanced LIGO A+ sensitivity. We conclude that, although binary black hole formation cannot be strongly constrained with today's data, the future detection (or a non-detection) of the gravitational-wave background with Advanced LIGO A+ will carry strong implications for the evolution of binary black holes.</description>

      <title>On the tension between the Radial Acceleration Relation and Solar System quadrupole in modified gravity MOND</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), postulating a breakdown of Newtonian mechanics at low accelerations, has considerable success at explaining galaxy kinematics. However, the quadrupole of the gravitational field of the Solar System (SS) provides a strong constraint on the way in which Newtonian gravity can be modified. In this paper we assess the extent to which the AQUAL and QUMOND modified gravity formulations of MOND are capable of accounting simultaneously for the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR), the Cassini measurement of the SS quadrupole and the kinematics of wide binaries in the Solar neighbourhood. We achieve this by inferring the location and sharpness of the MOND transition from the SPARC RAR under broad assumptions for the behaviour of the interpolating function and external field effect. We constrain the same quantities from the SS quadrupole, finding that this requires a significantly sharper transition between the deep-MOND and Newtonian regimes than is allowed by the RAR (an 8.7$\sigma$ tension under fiducial model assumptions). This may be relieved somewhat by allowing additional freedom in galaxies' mass-to-light ratios -- which also improves the RAR fit -- and more significantly (to 1.9$\sigma$) by removing galaxies with bulges. For the first time, we also apply to the SPARC RAR fit an AQUAL correction for flattened systems, obtaining similar results. Finally we show that the SS quadrupole constraint implies, to high precision, no deviation from Newtonian gravity in nearby wide binaries, and speculate on possible resolutions of this tension between SS and galaxy data within the MOND paradigm.</description>

      <title>Inference of multi-channel r-process element enrichment in the Milky Way using binary neutron star merger observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations of GW170817 strongly suggest that binary neutron star (BNS) mergers can produce rapid neutron-capture nucleosynthesis (r-process) elements. However, it remains an open question whether BNS mergers can account for all the r-process element enrichment in the Milky Way's history. Here we demonstrate that a BNS population model informed by multimessenger neutron star observations predicts a merger rate and per-event r-process element yield consistent with geophysical and astrophysical abundance constraints. If BNS mergers are to explain the r-process enrichment of stars in the Galaxy, we further show using a one-zone Galactic chemical evolution model that they have to merge shortly after the formation of their progenitors, with a delay time distribution of power-law index $\alpha\leq -2.0$ and minimum delay time $t_{\rm min}\leq 40$ Myr at 90% confidence.Such short delay times are in tension with those predicted by standard BNS formation models and those observationally inferred from samples of short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs). However, we find that a two-channel enrichment scenario, where the second channel follows the star formation history, can account for both Galactic stellar and sGRB observations. Our results suggest that 45-90% of the r-process abundance in the Milky Way today was produced by a star-formation-tracking channel, rather than BNS mergers with significant delay times.</description>

      <title>Criticality and thermodynamic geometry of quantum BTZ black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of extended black hole thermodynamics, where the cosmological constant acts as the thermodynamic pressure and its conjugate as the thermodynamic volume, we analyze the phase structure and thermodynamic geometry of the three-dimensional quantum-corrected BTZ (qBTZ) black hole. Our results uncover two-phase transitions in the $T-S$ plane across all pressures except at a critical value. Numerical analysis reveals continuous critical phenomena along the coexistence curve, with critical exponents of 2 and 3 for the heat capacity at constant pressure and the NTG curvature, respectively. Importantly, these values notably deviate from the well-known critical exponents observed in mean-field Van der Waals (VdW) fluids, where the NTG curvature and heat capacity demonstrate discontinuous criticality. To our knowledge, our investigation is the first exploration of critical behavior in black holes incorporating consistent semiclassical backreaction.</description>

      <title>Analyticity and the Unruh effect: a study of local modular flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Unruh effect can be formulated as the statement that the Minkowski vacuum in a Rindler wedge has a boost as its modular flow. In recent years, other examples of states with geometrically local modular flow have played important roles in understanding energy and entropy in quantum field theory and quantum gravity. Here I initiate a general study of the settings in which geometric modular flow can arise, showing (i) that any geometric modular flow must be a conformal symmetry of the background spacetime, and (ii) that in a well behaved class of "weakly analytic" states, geometric modular flow must be future-directed. I further argue that if a geometric transformation is conformal but not isometric, then it can only be realized as modular flow in a conformal field theory. Finally, I discuss a few settings in which converse results can be shown -- i.e., settings in which a state can be constructed whose modular flow reproduces a given vector field.</description>
