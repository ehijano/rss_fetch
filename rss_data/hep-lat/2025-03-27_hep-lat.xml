      <title>Quantum simulation of QC2D on a 2-dimensional small lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Hamiltonian formulation of SU(2) Yang-Mills theory with staggered fermions in a (2+1)-dimensional small lattice system. We construct a gauge-invariant and finite-dimensional Hilbert space for the theory by applying the loop-string-hadron formulation and specifically map the model to a spin system. We classically emulate digital quantum simulation and observe the real-time evolution of the single-site entanglement entropy, the fermion entanglement entropy, and the fermion pair production.</description>

      <title>Fourier Accelerated HMC in the SU(N) X SU(N) Principal Chiral Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the results of Fourier-accelerated HMC simulations of 2D SU(N) X SU(N) principal chiral models for N = 2, 3, 4, 6, 9. These models share several key properties with 4D QCD, such as asymptotic freedom and dynamical mass generation. Even for modest correlation lengths, we find integrated autocorrelation times are decreased by an order of magnitude relative to standard HMC, with relatively little computational overhead. Our results also suggest that the relative advantage of Fourier Acceleration over traditional HMC decreases as N increases, possibly due to the enlarged group space associated with larger N. Our Monte Carlo results agree with the mass spectra and continuum scaling behaviour predicted by the exact solution obtained using the Bethe ansatz.</description>

      <title>On learning higher-order cumulants in diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To analyse how diffusion models learn correlations beyond Gaussian ones, we study the behaviour of higher-order cumulants, or connected n-point functions, under both the forward and backward process. We derive explicit expressions for the moment- and cumulant-generating functionals, in terms of the distribution of the initial data and properties of forward process. It is shown analytically that during the forward process higher-order cumulants are conserved in models without a drift, such as the variance-expanding scheme, and that therefore the endpoint of the forward process maintains nontrivial correlations. We demonstrate that since these correlations are encoded in the score function, higher-order cumulants are learnt in the backward process, also when starting from a normal prior. We confirm our analytical results in an exactly solvable toy model with nonzero cumulants and in scalar lattice field theory.</description>

      <title>Parallel Tempered Metadynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When approaching the continuum limit in lattice QCD or other theories in a setup with topological sectors, conventional update algorithms experience a particularly severe form of critical slowing down that is caused by high action barriers between the sectors. The qualitative scaling behavior of this critical slowing down appears to be universal across different update algorithms and (gauge) actions. We demonstrate that a combination of Metadynamics with parallel tempering, along with other modifications, can significantly reduce autocorrelation times while avoiding the need for reweighting. We also discuss strategies to extend the methods to QCD simulations with dynamical fermions, and present first results for $N_f = 2$ simulations at unphysical pion masses.</description>

      <title>The Energy Spectrum of Kaon from Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents the analysis of data related to the two-point function of kaon generated from lattice QCD simulations. Using gauge configurations of twisted-mass fermions, we obtain the correlation functions for 6 values of momentum for the kaon between 0 and 2GeV (both inclusive), we use statistical techniques such as jackknife resampling to derive the energy of the particle. The lattice results are compared to the continuum dispersion relation for the particle, to assess systematic uncertainties in the lattice data. We establish consistency with theory by comparing our results with the theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Pole trajectories of the $\Lambda(1405)$ helps establish its dynamical nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07686v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $\Lambda(1405)$ has been one of the most controversial exotic baryons. If the $\Lambda(1405)$ possesses a two-pole molecular structure, these poles are expected to evolve differently towards the SU(3) limit.
  From an analysis of a recent LQCD simulation on the $\pi\Sigma-\bar{K}N$ scattering for $I=0$ and the study of the quark mass dependence of the octet baryon masses, we determine for the first time the trajectories of these poles towards the symmetric point over the $\mathrm{Tr}[M]=C$ trajectory accurately. At $m_\pi\simeq 200$ MeV, our results are consistent with the lattice simulations, and the extrapolations to the physical point, based on the NLO chiral Lagrangians, agree well with existing experimental analyses. We predict qualitatively similar trajectories at LO and up to NLO, consistent with the LO interaction's dominance. At the SU(3) symmetric point of this trajectory, both poles are on the physical sheet, and the lower pole is located at $E^{(1)}=1573(6)(6)$ MeV, becoming a SU(3) singlet, while the higher pole at $E^{(8a)}=1589(7)(5)$ MeV couples to the octet representation. Moreover, we make predictions in $I=1$ for the $\Sigma^*$ resonance. We find a resonance pole that evolves into a bound state around $m_\pi=415$~MeV in this sector. The results presented here are crucial to shed light on the molecular nature of exotic strange baryon resonances and can be tested in future LQCD simulations.</description>
