      <title>Empirical rovibrational energy levels for carbon disulfide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analysis of the measured rovibrational transitions is carried out for the 12C32S2 isotopologue of carbon disulfide. Data from 21 sources is extracted and validated using a consistent set of standard linear molecule quantum numbers. A corrected list of 8714 CS2 transitions forms the input to a Measured Active Rotational-Vibrational Energy Levels (MARVEL) procedure, generating 4279 empirical rovibrational energy levels across 138 bands of 12C32S2. Results are compared to the recent NASA Ames line list. While the agreement is generally good, issues are identified with the energy levels of some states, notably those with high values of the v2 bending quantum number.</description>

      <title>Applications of the Quantum Phase Difference Estimation Algorithm to the Excitation Energies in Spin Systems on a NISQ Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Quantum Phase Difference Estimation (QPDE) algorithm, as an extension of the Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE), is a quantum algorithm designed to compute the differences of two eigenvalues of a unitary operator by exploiting the quantum superposition of two eigenstates. Unlike QPE, QPDE is free of controlled-unitary operations, and is suitable for calculations on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. We present the implementation and verification of a novel early fault-tolerant QPDE algorithm for determining energy gaps across diverse spin system configurations using NISQ devices. The algorithm is applied to the systems described by two and three-spin Heisenberg Hamiltonians with different geometric arrangements and coupling strengths, including symmetric, asymmetric, spin-frustrated, and non-frustrated configurations. By leveraging the match gate-like structure of the time evolution operator of Heisenberg Hamiltonian, we achieve constant-depth quantum circuits suitable for NISQ hardware implementation. Our results on IBM quantum processors show remarkable accuracy ranging from 85\% to 93\%, demonstrating excellent agreement with classical calculations even in the presence of hardware noise. The methodology incorporates sophisticated quantum noise suppression techniques, including Pauli Twirling and Dynamical Decoupling, and employs an adaptive framework. Our findings demonstrate the practical viability of the QPDE algorithm for quantum many-body simulations on current NISQ hardware, establishing a robust framework for future applications.</description>

      <title>A cavity QED system with defect-free single-atom array strongly coupled to an optical cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally realize a new cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) platform with defect-free single-atom array strongly coupled to an optical cavity. The defect-free single-atom array is obtained by rearranging a probabilistically loaded one-dimensional (1D) optical tweezer array with dimensions of $1 \times 40$. The atom array is enclosed with two cavity mirrors, which compose a miniature optical Fabry-P{\'e}rot cavity with cavity length of 1.15 mm. By precisely controlling the position of the atom array, we demonstrate uniform and strong coupling of all atoms in the array with the optical cavity. The average coupling strength between the single atom and the cavity is 2.62 MHz. The vacuum Rabi splitting spectra for single-atom arrays with atom number $N$ changing from 3 to 26 are measured. Thus, the collective enhancement of the coupling strength with ${\sqrt N}$-dependence for multiple atoms is validated at the single atom level. Our system holds significant potential for establishing the foundation of distributed quantum computing and advancing fundamental research in many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Influence of the laser pulse duration in high-order harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-order harmonic generation (HHG) in gases is inherently inefficient, prompting ongoing efforts to enhance the output of coherent table-top XUV sources. In this study, we investigate the influence of the laser pulse duration on HHG using a compact post-compression method featuring a bulk multi-pass cell. This setup enables tunable Fourier-limited pulse durations as short as 42 fs. We examine the HHG yield as a function of the laser intensity for pulse durations ranging from 42 fs to 180 fs while maintaining identical focusing conditions and generating medium. Our findings reveal that, for a given intensity, there exists an optimum pulse duration -- not necessarily the shortest -- that maximizes conversion efficiency. This optimum pulse duration increases as the intensity decreases. The experimental results are corroborated by numerical simulations, which show the dependence of HHG yield on the duration and peak intensity of the driving laser and underscore the importance of the interplay between light-matter interaction and phase-matching in the nonlinear medium. Our conclusion allows us to understand why HHG could be demonstrated in 1988 with pulses as long as 40 ps pulses and intensities of only a few $10^{13}$ W/cm${^2}$.</description>

      <title>PT -symmetry breaking and universal spectral statistics in quantum kicked rotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spontaneous parity-time (PT )-symmetry breaking and spectral properties of a PT symmetric quantum kicked rotor under resonance conditions. At resonance, the QKR reduces to a finite-dimensional system. In the localized regime, we find that increasing the non-Hermitian parameter always induces a transition from a phase where the states exhibit PT symmetry to one where PT symmetry is spontaneously broken. In contrast, in the delocalized regime, the existence of such a transition depends on whether the reduced system is PT symmetric. If the reduced system is not PT symmetric, PT symmetry remains in the broken phase regardless of the non-Hermitian parameter. We further analyze the spectral statistics of the system in the delocalized regime. For real energy spectra, the level-spacing distribution transitions from Wigner-Dyson statistics, associated with the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble, to Poisson statistics as the non-Hermitian parameter increases, with the intermediate regime well described by the Brody distribution. For complex spectra, the level-spacing ratios and distributions are governed by time-reversal symmetry. The spectral statistics align with predictions for non-Hermitian random matrix ensembles in classes AI{\dag} and A, depending on the presence or absence of time-reversal symmetry. Our results provide insights into the spectral characteristics of non-Hermitian quantum chaotic systems and their connection to PT symmetry.</description>

      <title>Microwave-coupled optical bistability in driven and interacting Rydberg gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium dynamics are closely related to various fields of research, in which vastly different phases emerge when parameters are changed. However, it is difficult to construct nonequilibrium systems that have sufficiently tunable controllable parameters. Using microwave field coupling induced optical bistability, Rydberg gases exhibit a range of significantly different optical responses. In conjunction with electromagnetically induced transparency, the microwave coupling can create versatile nonequilibrium dynamics. In particular, the microwave coupling of two Rydberg states provides an additional handle for controlling the dynamics. And the microwave-controlled nonequilibrium phase transition has the potential to be applied in microwave field measurement. This study opens a new avenue to exploring bistable dynamics using microwave-coupled Rydberg gases, and developing quantum technological applications.</description>

      <title>Multi-axis inertial sensing with 2D matter-wave arrays</title>

Abstract: Atom interferometery is an exquisite measurement technique sensitive to inertial forces. However, it is commonly limited to a single sensitive axis, allowing high-precision multi-dimensional sensing only through subsequent or post-corrected measurements. We report on a novel method for multi-axis inertial sensing based on the correlation of simultaneous light-pulse atom interferometers in 2D array arrangements of Bose-Einstein Condensates (BEC). Deploying a scalable 3 x 3 BEC array spanning 1.6 mm^2 created using time-averaged optical potentials, we perform measurements of linear acceleration induced by gravity and simultaneously demonstrate sensitivity to angular velocity and acceleration of a rotating reference mirror, as well as gravity gradients and higher-order derivatives. Our work enables simple, high-precision multi-axis inertial sensing compatible with high rotation rates, e.g., for inertial navigation in dynamic environments. We finally envision further applications of our method, e.g., 3D in-situ measurements and reconstruction of laser beam intensities and wave fronts.</description>

      <title>Accurate vector optically pumped magnetometer with microwave-driven Rabi frequency measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robust calibration of vector optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) is a nontrivial task, but increasingly important for applications requiring high-accuracy such as magnetic navigation, geophysics research, and space exploration. Here, we showcase a vector OPM that utilizes Rabi oscillations driven between the hyperfine manifolds of $^{87}$Rb to measure the direction of a DC magnetic field against the polarization ellipse structure of a microwave field. By relying solely on atomic measurements -- free-induction decay (FID) signals and Rabi measurements across multiple atomic transitions -- this sensor can detect drift in the microwave vector reference and compensate for systematic shifts caused by off-resonant driving, nonlinear Zeeman (NLZ) effects, and buffer gas collisions. To facilitate dead-zone-free operation, we also introduce a novel Rabi measurement that utilizes dressed-state resonances that appear during simultaneous Larmor precession and Rabi driving (SPaR). These measurements, performed within a microfabricated vapor cell platform, achieve an average vector accuracy of 0.46 mrad and vector sensitivities down to 11 $\mu$rad$/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ for geomagnetic field strengths near 50 $\mu$T. This performance surpasses the challenging 1-degree (17 mrad) accuracy threshold of several contemporary OPM methods utilizing atomic vapors with an electromagnetic vector reference.</description>

      <title>eTraj.jl: Trajectory-Based Simulation for Strong-Field Ionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of light-matter interactions in the realm of strong-field ionization has been a focal point and has attracted widespread interest. We present the eTraj.jl program package, designed to implement established classical/semiclassical trajectory-based methods to determine the photoelectron momentum distribution resulting from strong-field ionization of both atoms and molecules. The program operates within a unified theoretical framework that separates the trajectory-based computation into two stages: initial-condition preparation and trajectory evolution. For initial-condition preparation, we provide several methods, including the Strong-Field Approximation with Saddle-Point Approximation (SFA-SPA), SFA-SPA with Non-adiabatic Expansion (SFA-SPANE), and the Ammosov-Delone-Krainov theory (ADK), with atomic and molecular variants, as well as the Weak-Field Asymptotic Theory (WFAT) for molecules. For trajectory evolution, available options are Classical Trajectory Monte-Carlo (CTMC), which employs purely classical electron trajectories, and the Quantum Trajectory Monte-Carlo (QTMC) and Semi-Classical Two-Step model (SCTS), which include the quantum phase during trajectory evolution. The program is a versatile, efficient, flexible, and out-of-the-box solution for trajectory-based simulations for strong-field ionization. It is designed with user-friendliness in mind and is expected to serve as a valuable and powerful tool for the community of strong-field physics.</description>

      <title>Optical clock based on two-photon spectroscopy of the nuclear transition in ion $^{229}$Th in a monochromatic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15669v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the isotope $^{229}$Th we investigate the possibility of two-photon laser spectroscopy of the nuclear clock transition (148.38 nm) using intense monochromatic laser field at twice the wavelength (296.76 nm). Our estimates show that due to the electron bridge process in the doubly ionized ion $^{229}$Th$^{2+}$ the sufficient intensity of a continuous laser field is about 10-100 kW/cm$^2$, which is within the reach of modern laser systems. This unique possibility is an result of the presence in the electronic spectrum of the ion $^{229}$Th$^{2+}$ of an exceptionally close intermediate (for the two-photon transition) energy level, forming a strong dipole ($E1$) transition with the ground state at the wavelength of 297.86 nm, which differs from the probe field wavelength (296.76 nm) by only 1.1 nm. The obtained results can be used for the practical creation of ultra-precise nuclear optical clocks based on thorium-229 ions. In addition, we develop an alternative approach to the description of the electron bridge phenomenon in an isolated ion (atom) using the hyperfine interaction operator, that is important for the general quantum theory of an atom. In particular, this approach shows that the contribution to the electron bridge from the nuclear quadrupole moment can be comparable to the contribution from the nuclear magnetic moment.</description>

      <title>Extending the coherence time limit of a single-alkali-atom qubit by suppressing phonon-jumping-induced decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11196v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the fields of quantum metrology and quantum information processing with the system of optically trapped single neutral atoms, the coherence time of qubit encoded in the electronic states is regarded as one of the most important parameters. Longer coherence time is always pursued for higher precision of measurement and quantum manipulation. The coherence time is usually assumed to be merely determined by relative stability of the energy between the electronic states, and the analysis of the decoherence was conducted by treating the atom motion classically. We proposed a complete description of the decoherence of a qubit encoded in two ground electronic states of an optically trapped alkali atom by adopting a full description of the atomic wavefunction. The motional state, i.e., the phonon state, is taken into account. In addition to decoherence due to the variance of differential light shift (DLS), a new decoherence mechanism, phonon-jumping-induced decoherence (PJID), was discovered and verified experimentally. The coherence time of a single-cesium-atom qubit can be extended to $T_2\approx 20$ s by suppressing both the variances of DLS and PJID by trapping the atom in a blue-detuned bottle beam trap (BBT) and preparing the atom in its three-dimensional motional ground states. The coherence time is the longest for a qubit encoded in an optically trapped single alkali atom. Our work provides a deep understanding of the decoherence mechanism for single atom qubits and thus provides a new way to extend the coherence time limit. The method can be applied for other atoms and molecules, opening up new prospects for high-precision control the quantum states of optically trapped atoms or molecules.</description>

      <title>Critical evaluation of reference charge radii and applications in mirror nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08193v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I present a critical review of absolute root-mean-square charge radii of stable nuclei from $Z=3$ to $Z=32$, which includes a previously overlooked uncertainty in the combined analysis of muonic x-ray and electron scattering experiments. From these \textit{reference radii} and isotope shift measurements, I obtain those of 12 mirror pairs with a traceable and realistic uncertainty budget. The difference in radii between mirror nuclei is found to be proportional to the isospin asymmetry, confirming recent calculations by Novario \emph{et al}~[PRL~130, 032501]. Assuming that this linear relation holds across the nuclear chart, the fitted proportionality constant, combined with the revised known radii, predicts the radii of 73 previously unknown mirror partners. These are useful e.g., for benchmarking atomic and nuclear theory, calibrating entire chains, and as an input to nuclear beta-decay calculations. The radii of $(T=1,T_z=0)$ nuclei are interpolated assuming negligible isospin symmetry breaking. This completes a model-independent, high-precision extraction of the charge and weak radii of all nuclei involved in the testing of the unitarity of the CKM matrix.</description>
