      <title>Optimal Bilinear Equalizer for Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems over Correlated Rician Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the low-complexity optimal bilinear equalizer (OBE) combining scheme design for cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output networks with spatially correlated Rician fading channels. We provide a spectral efficiency (SE) performance analysis framework for both the centralized and distributed processing schemes with bilinear equalizer (BE)-structure combining schemes applied. The BE-structured combining is a set of schemes that are constructed by the multiplications of channel statistics-based BE matrices and instantaneous channel estimates. Notably, we derive closed-form achievable SE expressions for centralized and distributed BE-structured combining schemes. We propose one centralized and two distributed OBE schemes: Centralized OBE (C-OBE), Distributed OBE based on Global channel statistics (DG-OBE), and Distributed OBE based on Local channel statistics (DL-OBE), which maximize their respective SE expressions. OBE matrices in these schemes are tailored based on varying levels of channel statistics. Notably, we obtain new and insightful closed-form results for the C-OBE, DG-OBE, and DL-OBE combining schemes. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed OBE schemes can achieve excellent SE, even in scenarios with severe pilot contamination.</description>

      <title>CardioLab: Laboratory Values Estimation from Electrocardiogram Features -- An Exploratory Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduction: Laboratory value represents a cornerstone of medical diagnostics, but suffers from slow turnaround times, and high costs and only provides information about a single point in time. The continuous estimation of laboratory values from non-invasive data such as electrocardiogram (ECG) would therefore mark a significant frontier in healthcare monitoring. Despite its transformative potential, this domain remains relatively underexplored within the medical community.
  Methods: In this preliminary study, we used a publicly available dataset (MIMIC-IV-ECG) to investigate the feasibility of inferring laboratory values from ECG features and patient demographics using tree-based models (XGBoost). We define the prediction task as a binary prediction problem of predicting whether the lab value falls into low or high abnormalities. The model performance can then be assessed using AUROC.
  Results: Our findings demonstrate promising results in the estimation of laboratory values related to different organ systems based on a small yet comprehensive set of features. While further research and validation are warranted to fully assess the clinical utility and generalizability of ECG-based estimation in healthcare monitoring, our findings lay the groundwork for future investigations into approaches to laboratory value estimation using ECG data. Such advancements hold promise for revolutionizing predictive healthcare applications, offering faster, non-invasive, and more affordable means of patient monitoring.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for Movable-Antenna MIMO Systems Via Tensor Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate the channel estimation problem for MIMO wireless communication systems with movable antennas (MAs) at both the transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx). To achieve high channel estimation accuracy with low pilot training overhead, we propose a tensor decomposition-based method for estimating the parameters of multi-path channel components, including their azimuth and elevation angles, as well as complex gain coefficients, thereby reconstructing the wireless channel between any pair of Tx and Rx MA positions in the Tx and Rx regions. First, we introduce a two-stage Tx-Rx successive antenna movement pattern for pilot training, such that the received pilot signals in both stages can be expressed as a third-order tensor. Then, we obtain the factor matrices of the tensor via the canonical polyadic decomposition, and thereby estimate the angle/gain parameters for enabling the channel reconstruction between arbitrary Tx/Rx MA positions. In addition, we analyze the uniqueness condition of the tensor decomposition, which ensures the complete channel reconstruction between the whole Tx and Rx regions based on the channel measurements at only a finite number of Tx/Rx MA positions. Finally, simulation results are presented to evaluate the proposed tensor decomposition-based method as compared to existing methods, in terms of channel estimation accuracy and pilot overhead.</description>

      <title>Multi-Channel Factor Analysis: Identifiability and Asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work by Ram\'irez et al. [2] has introduced Multi-Channel Factor Analysis (MFA) as an extension of factor analysis to multi-channel data that allows for latent factors common to all channels as well as factors specific to each channel. This paper validates the MFA covariance model and analyzes the statistical properties of the MFA estimators. In particular, a thorough investigation of model identifiability under varying latent factor structures is conducted, and sufficient conditions for generic global identifiability of MFA are obtained. The development of these identifiability conditions enables asymptotic analysis of estimators obtained by maximizing a Gaussian likelihood, which are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal even under misspecification of the latent factor distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) communication is expected to be a key technology for future sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. Furthermore, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have been proposed to modify the wireless propagation environment and enhance system performance. Given the sensitivity to blockages and limited coverage range, RIS is particularly promising for THz communications. Active RIS can overcome the multiplicative fading effect in RIS-aided communications. In this paper, we explore active RIS-assisted THz communications. We formulate the ergodic rate, considering factors associated with active RIS, including active noise and signal amplification, and THz signals, including molecular absorption and beam misalignment</description>

      <title>Mini-Batch Gradient-Based MCMC for Decentralized Massive MIMO Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology has significantly enhanced spectral and power efficiency in cellular communications and is expected to further evolve towards extra-large-scale MIMO. However, centralized processing for massive MIMO faces practical obstacles, including excessive computational complexity and a substantial volume of baseband data to be exchanged. To address these challenges, decentralized baseband processing has emerged as a promising solution. This approach involves partitioning the antenna array into clusters with dedicated computing hardware for parallel processing. In this paper, we investigate the gradient-based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method -- an advanced MIMO detection technique known for its near-optimal performance in centralized implementation -- within the context of a decentralized baseband processing architecture. This decentralized design mitigates the computation burden at a single processing unit by utilizing computational resources in a distributed and parallel manner. Additionally, we integrate the mini-batch stochastic gradient descent method into the proposed decentralized detector, achieving remarkable performance with high efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate substantial performance gains of the proposed method over existing decentralized detectors across various scenarios. Moreover, complexity analysis reveals the advantages of the proposed decentralized strategy in terms of computation delay and interconnection bandwidth when compared to conventional centralized detectors.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Energy Efficient Multi-Hop STAR-RIS-Assisted Transmissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) provides a promising way to expand coverage in wireless communications. However, limitation of single STAR-RIS inspire us to integrate the concept of multi-hop transmissions, as focused on RIS in existing research. Therefore, we propose the novel architecture of multi-hop STAR-RISs to achieve a wider range of full-plane service coverage. In this paper, we intend to solve active beamforming of the base station and passive beamforming of STAR-RISs, aiming for maximizing the energy efficiency constrained by hardware limitation of STAR-RISs. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of the on-off state of STAR-RIS elements on energy efficiency. To tackle the complex problem, a Multi-Agent Global and locAl deep Reinforcement learning (MAGAR) algorithm is designed. The global agent elevates the collaboration among local agents, which focus on individual learning. In numerical results, we observe the significant improvement of MAGAR compared to the other benchmarks, including Q-learning, multi-agent deep Q network (DQN) with golbal reward, and multi-agent DQN with local rewards. Moreover, the proposed architecture of multi-hop STAR-RISs achieves the highest energy efficiency compared to mode switching based STAR-RISs, conventional RISs and deployment without RISs or STAR-RISs.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Informed Neural Network-Based Approach for the Spatial Upsampling of Spherical Microphone Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spherical microphone arrays are convenient tools for capturing the spatial characteristics of a sound field. However, achieving superior spatial resolution requires arrays with numerous capsules, consequently leading to expensive devices. To address this issue, we present a method for spatially upsampling spherical microphone arrays with a limited number of capsules. Our approach exploits a physics-informed neural network with Rowdy activation functions, leveraging physical constraints to provide high-order microphone array signals, starting from low-order devices. Results show that, within its domain of application, our approach outperforms a state of the art method based on signal processing for spherical microphone arrays upsampling.</description>

      <title>Secrecy Performance Analysis of Integrated RF-UWOC IoT Networks Enabled by UAV and Underwater-RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the sixth-generation (6G) Internet of Things (IoT) networks, the use of UAV-mounted base stations and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) has been considered to enhance coverage, flexibility, and security in non-terrestrial networks (NTNs). In addition to aerial networks enabled by NTN technologies, the integration of underwater networks with 6G IoT can be considered one of the most innovative challenges in future IoT. Along with such trends in IoT, this study investigates the secrecy performance of IoT networks that integrate radio frequency (RF) UAV-based NTNs and underwater optical wireless communication (UOWC) links with an RIS. Considering three potential eavesdropping scenarios (RF signal, UOWC signal, and both), we derive closed-form expressions for secrecy performance metrics, including average secrecy capacity, secrecy outage probability, probability of strictly positive secrecy capacity, and effective secrecy throughput. Extensive numerical analyses and Monte Carlo simulations elucidate the impact of system parameters such as fading severity, the number of RIS reflecting elements, underwater turbulence, pointing errors, and detection techniques on system security. The findings offer comprehensive design guidelines for developing such a network aiming to enhance secrecy performance and ensure secure communication in diverse and challenging environments.</description>

      <title>Joint Slot and Power Optimization for Grant Free Random Access with Unknown and Heterogeneous Device Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grant Free Random Access (GFRA) is a popular protocol in the Internet of Things (IoT) to reduce the control signaling. GFRA is a framed protocol where each frame is split into two parts: device identification; and data transmission part which can be viewed as a form of Frame Slotted ALOHA (FSA). A common assumption in FSA is device homogeneity; that is the probability that a device seeks to transmit data in a particular frame is common for all devices and independent of the other devices. Recent work has investigated the possibility of tuning the FSA protocol to the statistics of the network by changing the probability for a particular device to access a particular slot. However, power control with a successive interference cancellation (SIC) receiver has not yet been considered to further increase the performance of the tuned FSA protocols. In this paper, we propose algorithms to jointly optimize both the slot selection and the transmit power of the devices to minimize the outage of the devices in the network. We show via a simulation study that our algorithms can outperform baselines (including slotted ALOHA) in terms of expected number of devices transmitting without outage and in term of transmit power.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Kalman Filtering over Finite and Infinite Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the distributionally robust filtering of signals generated by state-space models driven by exogenous disturbances with noisy observations in finite and infinite horizon scenarios. The exact joint probability distribution of the disturbances and noise is unknown but assumed to reside within a Wasserstein-2 ambiguity ball centered around a given nominal distribution. We aim to derive a causal estimator that minimizes the worst-case mean squared estimation error among all possible distributions within this ambiguity set. We remove the iid restriction in prior works by permitting arbitrarily time-correlated disturbances and noises. In the finite horizon setting, we reduce this problem to a semi-definite program (SDP), with computational complexity scaling with the time horizon. For infinite horizon settings, we characterize the optimal estimator using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. Although the optimal estimator lacks a rational form, i.e., a finite-dimensional state-space realization, it can be fully described by a finite-dimensional parameter. {Leveraging this parametrization, we propose efficient algorithms that compute the optimal estimator with arbitrary fidelity in the frequency domain.} Moreover, given any finite degree, we provide an efficient convex optimization algorithm that finds the finite-dimensional state-space estimator that best approximates the optimal non-rational filter in ${\cal H}_\infty$ norm. This facilitates the practical implementation of the infinite horizon filter without having to grapple with the ill-scaled SDP from finite time. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Downlink CCM Estimation via Representation Learning with Graph Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an algorithm for downlink (DL) channel covariance matrix (CCM) estimation for frequency division duplexing (FDD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems with base station (BS) possessing a uniform linear array (ULA) antenna structure. We make use of the inherent similarity between the uplink (UL) CCM and the DL CCM due to angular reciprocity. We consider a setting where the UL CCM is mapped to DL CCM by a mapping function. We first present a theoretical error analysis of learning a nonlinear embedding by constructing a mapping function, which points to the importance of the Lipschitz regularity of the mapping function for achieving high estimation performance. Then, based on the theoretical ground, we propose a representation learning algorithm as a solution for the estimation problem, where Gaussian RBF kernel interpolators are chosen to map UL CCMs to their DL counterparts. The proposed algorithm is based on the optimization of an objective function that fits a regression model between the DL CCM and UL CCM samples in the training dataset and preserves the local geometric structure of the data in the UL CCM space, while explicitly regulating the Lipschitz continuity of the mapping function in light of our theoretical findings. The proposed algorithm surpasses benchmark methods in terms of three error metrics as shown by simulations.</description>

      <title>3GPP-Like GBSM THz Channel Characterization, Modeling, and Simulation Based on Experimental Observations</title>

Abstract: Terahertz (THz) communication is envisioned as one of the possible technologies for the sixth-generation (6G) communication system due to its rich spectrum. To evaluate the performance of THz communication, it is essential to propose THz channel models within the common framework of the geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM) in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). This paper focuses on THz channel modeling and simulation by a 3GPP-like GBSM, based on channel measurements. We first present channel measurements at 100 GHz in an indoor office scenario and 132 GHz in an urban microcellular scenario. Subsequently, channel characteristics such as path loss, delay spread, angle spread, K-factor, cluster characteristic, cross-correlations, and correlation distances are obtained and analyzed based on channel measurement. Additionally, the channel characteristics are modeled by the statistical distribution of 3GPP channel models, which can be used to reconstruct the channel impulse response (CIR). Furthermore, these obtained distributions are studied referring to the default models in the 3GPP, revealing the channel sparsity in the THz channel. For instance, in the case of line-of-sight links in the indoor office, the mean of the measured cluster number is 4 while the default value is 15. Finally, we propose the THz channel model and its simulation framework to reconstruct CIRs based on the obtained models, which aim at characterizing the sparser THz channels. The obvious channel sparsity is characterized in both scenarios, as the Gini factors obtained by the proposed model only have the maximum deviation of 0.04 for those of the measurement. Overall, these findings are helpful in understanding and modeling the THz channel, facilitating the application of THz communication techniques for 6G.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Wireless Scheduling in Distributed Networked Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.12562v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a joint uplink and downlink scheduling problem of a fully distributed wireless networked control system (WNCS) with a limited number of frequency channels. Using elements of stochastic systems theory, we derive a sufficient stability condition of the WNCS, which is stated in terms of both the control and communication system parameters. Once the condition is satisfied, there exists a stationary and deterministic scheduling policy that can stabilize all plants of the WNCS. By analyzing and representing the per-step cost function of the WNCS in terms of a finite-length countable vector state, we formulate the optimal transmission scheduling problem into a Markov decision process and develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based framework for solving it. To tackle the challenges of a large action space in DRL, we propose novel action space reduction and action embedding methods for the DRL framework that can be applied to various algorithms, including Deep Q-Network (DQN), Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3). Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms benchmark policies.</description>

Abstract: To obviate the control of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and related overhead, recent works envisioned the concept of autonomous RISs: Intelligent devices capable of autonomously deciding their reflection states. This paradigm is enabled by hybrid RIS (HRIS), a hardware solution that integrates sensing and channel estimation (CHEST) capabilities, enabling autonomous operation. Autonomous RISs operate independently alongside other network entities, promoting open communication system models for RISs. However, this autonomy introduces a significant challenge: How to schedule the operation of the autonomous RIS over time and frequency to minimize its impact on the network? This paper introduces a physical layer (PHY) orchestration framework within a massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) network to address this challenge. Our framework highlights an engineering trade-off termed the "autonomous RIS trade-off," which examines the performance implications of autonomy. Through mathematical analysis and numerical results, we describe the HRIS feasibility region, illustrating the conditions under which autonomous RISs are viable when properly deployed.</description>

      <title>Near-field Integrated Sensing and Communication: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01342v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the extremely large-scale array XL-array deployed in future wireless systems, wireless communication and sensing are expected to operate in the radiative near-field region, which needs to be characterized by the spherical rather than planar wavefronts. Unlike most existing works that considered far-field integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), we study in this article the new near-field ISAC, which integrates both functions of sensing and communication in the near-field region. To this end, we first discuss the appealing advantages of near-field communication and sensing over their far-field counterparts, respectively. Then, we introduce three approaches for near-field ISAC, including joint near-field communication and sensing, sensing-assisted near-field communication, and communication-assisted near-field sensing. We discuss their individual research opportunities, new design issues, as well as propose promising solutions. Finally, several important directions in near-field ISAC are also highlighted to motivate future work.</description>

      <title>User Clustering for Coexistence between Near-field and Far-field Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter investigates the coexistence between near-field (NF) and far-field (FF) communications, where multiple FF users are clustered to be served on the beams of legacy NF users, via non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). Three different successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding strategies are proposed and a sum rate maximization problem is formulated to optimize the beam assignment and decoding order. The beam assignment problem is further reformulated as an overlapping coalitional game, which facilitates the design of the proposed clustering algorithm. The optimal decoding order in each cluster is also derived, which can be integrated into the proposed clustering. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed clustering algorithm is able to significantly improve the sum rate of the considered system, and the developed strategies achieve different trade-offs between sum rate and fairness.</description>

      <title>Robust Transmission Design for RIS-Assisted Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a critical technology for next-generation communication networks, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) aims to achieve the harmonious coexistence of communication and sensing. The degrees-of-freedom (DoF) of ISAC is limited due to multiple performance metrics used for communication and sensing. Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) composed of metamaterials can enhance the DoF in the spatial domain of ISAC systems. However, the availability of perfect Channel State Information (CSI) is a prerequisite for the gain brought by RIS, which is not realistic in practical environments. Therefore, under the imperfect CSI condition, we propose a decomposition-based large deviation inequality approach to eliminate the impact of CSI error on communication rate and sensing Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB). Then, an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm based on semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and gradient extrapolated majorization-maximization (GEMM) is proposed to solve the transmit beamforming and discrete RIS beamforming problems. We also analyze the complexity and convergence of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms can effectively eliminate the influence of CSI error and have good convergence performance. Notably, when CSI error exists, the gain brought by RIS will decrease with the increase of the number of RIS elements. Finally, we summarize and outline future research directions.</description>

      <title>Virtual VNA: Minimal-Ambiguity Scattering Matrix Estimation with Load-Tunable Ports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the following generic wave problem: is the estimation of the $N \times N$ scattering matrix characterizing an arbitrarily complex linear system with $N$ monomodal ports possible if waves can be input and output only via $N_\mathrm{A}&lt;N$ ports while the remaining $N_\mathrm{S}=N-N_\mathrm{A}$ ports are terminated with tunable loads? We show that if $N_\mathrm{A}\geq 2$ and at least three distinct and known tunable loads are available, the problem can be solved (in closed form or via gradient descent) except for sign ambiguities on the off-diagonal scattering coefficients involving the $N_\mathrm{S}$ not-directly-accessible (NDA) ports. Moreover, we demonstrate that a limitation to phase-insensitive measurements only results in a mild additional blockwise phase ambiguity. If the transmission from at least one accessible port to the NDA ports can be measured, all ambiguities can be lifted. We corroborate our results with microwave experiments on an 8-port chaotic cavity with $N_\mathrm{A}=N_\mathrm{S}=4$. The demonstrated suite of techniques (coined "virtual VNA") enables the characterization of an arbitrary linear $N$-port system with an $N_\mathrm{A}$-port measurement device, where $N_\mathrm{A} \ll N$. Potential applications include the contactless characterization of miniaturized, embedded, receive-only and/or multi-element antenna systems and programmable integrated photonic circuits, as well as wireless bioelectronic sensing in complex media.</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted Physical Layer Security in Emerging RF and Optical Wireless Communication Systems: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical layer security (PLS) has received a growing interest from the research community for its ability to safeguard data confidentiality without relying on key distribution or encryption/decryption. However, the evolution towards the 5G technology and beyond poses new security challenges that must be addressed in order to fulfill the unprecedented performance requirements of future wireless networks. Among the potential enabling technologies, RIS has attracted extensive attention due to its ability to proactively and intelligently reconfigure the wireless propagation environment to combat dynamic wireless channel impairments. Consequently, the RIS technology can be adopted to improve the information-theoretic security of both RF and OWC systems. This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of the information-theoretic security of RIS-based RF and optical systems. The article first discusses the fundamental concepts of PLS and RIS technologies, followed by their combination in both RF and OWC systems. Subsequently, some optimization techniques are presented in the context of the underlying system model, followed by an assessment of the impact of RIS-assisted PLS through a comprehensive performance analysis. Given that the computational complexity of future communication systems that adopt RIS-assisted PLS is likely to increase rapidly as the number of interactions between the users and infrastructure grows, ML is seen as a promising approach to address this complexity issue while sustaining or improving the network performance. A discussion of recent research studies on RIS-assisted PLS-based systems embedded with ML is presented. Furthermore, some important open research challenges are proposed and discussed to provide insightful future research directions, with the aim of moving a step closer towards the development and implementation of the forthcoming 6G wireless technology.</description>

      <title>Refined-Deep Reinforcement Learning for MIMO Bistatic Backscatter Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bistatic backscatter communication facilitates ubiquitous, massive connectivity of passive tags for future Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks. The tags communicate with readers by reflecting carrier emitter (CE) signals. This work addresses the joint design of the transmit/receive beamformers at the CE/reader and the reflection coefficient of the tag. A throughput maximization problem is formulated to satisfy the tag requirements. A joint design is developed through a series of trial-and-error interactions within the environment, driven by a predefined reward system in a continuous state and action context. By leveraging recent advances in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), the underlying optimization problem is addressed. Capitalizing on deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and soft actor-critic (SAC), we proposed two new algorithms, namely refined-DDPG for MIMO BiBC (RDMB) and refined-SAC for MIMO BiBC (RSMB). Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms can effectively learn from the environment and progressively improve their performance. They achieve results comparable to two leading benchmarks: alternating optimization (AO) and several DRL methods, including deep Q-network (DQN), double deep Q-network (DDQN), and dueling DQN (DuelDQN). For a system with twelve antennas, RSMB leads with a %26.76 gain over DQN, followed by AO and RSMB at 23.02% and 19.16%, respectively.</description>

      <title>MDS-ED: Multimodal Decision Support in the Emergency Department -- a Benchmark Dataset for Diagnoses and Deterioration Prediction in Emergency Medicine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Benchmarking medical decision support algorithms often struggles due to limited access to datasets, narrow prediction tasks, and restricted input modalities. These limitations affect their clinical relevance and performance in high-stakes areas like emergency care, complicating replication, validation, and improvement of benchmarks.
  Methods: We introduce a dataset based on MIMIC-IV, benchmarking protocol, and initial results for evaluating multimodal decision support in the emergency department (ED). We use diverse data modalities from the first 1.5 hours of patient arrival, including demographics, biometrics, vital signs, lab values, and electrocardiogram waveforms. We analyze 1443 clinical labels across two contexts: predicting diagnoses with ICD-10 codes and forecasting patient deterioration.
  Results: Our multimodal diagnostic model achieves an AUROC score over 0.8 in a statistically significant manner for 357 out of 1428 conditions, including cardiac issues like myocardial infarction and non-cardiac conditions such as renal disease and diabetes. The deterioration model scores above 0.8 in a statistically significant manner for 13 out of 15 targets, including critical events like cardiac arrest and mechanical ventilation, ICU admission as well as short- and long-term mortality. Incorporating raw waveform data significantly improves model performance, which represents one of the first robust demonstrations of this effect.
  Conclusions: This study highlights the uniqueness of our dataset, which encompasses a wide range of clinical tasks and utilizes a comprehensive set of features collected early during the emergency after arriving at the ED. The strong performance, as evidenced by high AUROC scores across diagnostic and deterioration targets, underscores the potential of our approach to revolutionize decision-making in acute and emergency medicine.</description>
