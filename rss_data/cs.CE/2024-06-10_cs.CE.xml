      <title>Projecting Molecules into Synthesizable Chemical Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovering new drug molecules is a pivotal yet challenging process due to the near-infinitely large chemical space and notorious demands on time and resources. Numerous generative models have recently been introduced to accelerate the drug discovery process, but their progression to experimental validation remains limited, largely due to a lack of consideration for synthetic accessibility in practical settings. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that is capable of generating new chemical structures while ensuring synthetic accessibility. Specifically, we introduce a postfix notation of synthetic pathways to represent molecules in chemical space. Then, we design a transformer-based model to translate molecular graphs into postfix notations of synthesis. We highlight the model's ability to: (a) perform bottom-up synthesis planning more accurately, (b) generate structurally similar, synthesizable analogs for unsynthesizable molecules proposed by generative models with their properties preserved, and (c) explore the local synthesizable chemical space around hit molecules.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Dynamics and Patterns: A Comprehensive Analysis of Spreading Patterns and Similarities in Low-Labelled Ransomware Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ransomware has become one of the most widespread threats, primarily due to its easy deployment and the accessibility to services that enable attackers to raise and obfuscate funds. This latter aspect has been significantly enhanced with the advent of cryptocurrencies, which, by fostering decentralisation and anonymity, have transformed this threat into a large-scale outbreak. However, recent reports indicate that a small group of individuals dominate the ransomware ecosystem and try to obfuscate their activity using multiple strains characterised by a short time to live. This scenario suggests that different strains could share mechanisms in ransom collection, fund movement, and money laundering operations. For this reason, this study aims to analyse the address-transaction graphs generated in the Bitcoin network by low-labelled ransomware families. Our goals are to identify payment spreading patterns for evaluating the evolution of ransomware families and to detect similarities among different strains that potentially can be controlled by the same attacker. Specifically, this latter task assigns an address behaviour to each node in the address-transaction graphs according to its dynamics. The distribution of the behaviours in each strain is finally used to evaluate the closeness among different ransomware families. Our findings show that although ransomware families can quickly establish connections with millions of addresses, numerous families require multiple-step analysis. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the introduced behaviours can effectively be used to highlight similarities among different ransomware strains. The outcome shows that families are similar primarily due to behaviours usually associated with ransom collection and money laundering operations.+</description>

      <title>Automated Market Maker on the XRP Ledger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has emerged as a transformative force in the financial sector, with Automated Market Makers (AMMs) playing a crucial role in facilitating asset exchange and liquidity provision. However, most AMMs operate on the Ethereum blockchain and face challenges such as high transaction fees and price synchronization issues mainly due to Ethereum scalability issues.
  This paper addresses these limitations by investigating the performance of an Automated Market Maker (AMM) integrated at the protocol level of the XRP Ledger. Using game-theoretic simulations, we compared the XRPL-AMM to a Generic CPMM-based AMM (G-AMM) on Ethereum, akin to established players like Uniswap's V2 AMM implementation. The results demonstrate that the XRPL-AMM outperforms in terms of price synchronization with external markets, lower slippage, reduced impermanent loss, and improved returns for liquidity providers, particularly under volatile market conditions. The unique Continuous Auction Mechanism (CAM) of the XRPL-AMM further enhances its efficiency by incentivizing beneficial arbitrage. These findings highlight the potential of protocol-level AMM integration.
  To the best of our knowledge, the XRPL-AMM is one of the first AMMs built directly at the protocol level of a blockchain. Therefore, this inaugural study ventures into the unexplored domain of evaluating AMMs with protocol-level integration compared to traditional smart contracts implementations.</description>

      <title>ChemReasoner: Heuristic Search over a Large Language Model's Knowledge Space using Quantum-Chemical Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10980v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of new catalysts is essential for the design of new and more efficient chemical processes in order to transition to a sustainable future. We introduce an AI-guided computational screening framework unifying linguistic reasoning with quantum-chemistry based feedback from 3D atomistic representations. Our approach formulates catalyst discovery as an uncertain environment where an agent actively searches for highly effective catalysts via the iterative combination of large language model (LLM)-derived hypotheses and atomistic graph neural network (GNN)-derived feedback. Identified catalysts in intermediate search steps undergo structural evaluation based on spatial orientation, reaction pathways, and stability. Scoring functions based on adsorption energies and reaction energy barriers steer the exploration in the LLM's knowledge space toward energetically favorable, high-efficiency catalysts. We introduce planning methods that automatically guide the exploration without human input, providing competitive performance against expert-enumerated chemical descriptor-based implementations. By integrating language-guided reasoning with computational chemistry feedback, our work pioneers AI-accelerated, trustworthy catalyst discovery.</description>
