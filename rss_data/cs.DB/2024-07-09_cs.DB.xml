      <title>Path-based Algebraic Foundations of Graph Query Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph databases are gaining momentum thanks to the flexibility and expressiveness of their data model and query languages. A standardization activity driven by the ISO/IEC standardization body is also ongoing and has already conducted to the specification of the first versions of two standard graph query languages, namely SQL/PGQ and GQL, respectively in 2023 and 2024. Apart from the standards, there exists a panoply of concrete graph query languages in commercial and open-source graph databases, each of which exhibits different features and modes. In this paper, we tackle the heterogeneity problem of graph query languages by laying the foundations of a unifying path-oriented algebraic framework. Such a theoretical framework is currently missing in the graph databases landscape, thus impeding a lingua franca in which different graph query language implementations can be expressed and cross-compared. Our framework gives a blueprint for correct implementation of graph queries of different expressiveness. It allows to overcome the boundaries of current versions of standard query languages, thus paving the way to future extensions including query composability. It also allows, when the path-based semantics is stripped off, to express classical Codd's relational algebra enhanced with a recursive operator, thus proving its utility for a wide range of queries in database management systems.</description>

      <title>Database Technology Evolution III: Knowledge Graphs and Linked Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reviews the changes for database technology represented by the current development of the draft international standard ISO 39075 (Database Languages - GQL), which seeks a unified specification for property graphs and knowledge graphs. This paper examines these current developments as part of our review of the evolution of database technology, and their relation to the longer-term goal of supporting the Semantic Web using relational technology.</description>

      <title>H-STAR: LLM-driven Hybrid SQL-Text Adaptive Reasoning on Tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tabular reasoning involves interpreting unstructured queries against structured tables, requiring a synthesis of textual understanding and symbolic reasoning. Existing methods rely on either of the approaches and are constrained by their respective limitations. Textual reasoning excels in semantic interpretation unlike symbolic reasoning (SQL logic), but falls short in mathematical reasoning where SQL excels. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm H-STAR, comprising table extraction and adaptive reasoning, integrating both symbolic and semantic (text-based) approaches. To enhance evidence extraction, H-STAR employs a multi-view approach, incorporating step-by-step row and column retrieval. It also adapts reasoning strategies based on question types, utilizing symbolic reasoning for quantitative and logical tasks, and semantic reasoning for direct lookup and complex lexical queries. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that H-STAR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across three tabular question-answering (QA) and fact-verification datasets, underscoring its effectiveness and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Test Data Generation Using Recurrent Neural Networks: A Position Paper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Testing in production-like test environments is an essential part of quality assurance processes in many industries. Provisioning of such test environments, for information-intensive services, involves setting up databases that are rich-enough to enable simulating a wide variety of user scenarios. While production data is perhaps the gold-standard here, many organizations, particularly within the public sectors, are not allowed to use production data for testing purposes due to privacy concerns. The alternatives are to use anonymized data, or synthetically generated data. In this paper, we elaborate on these alternatives and compare them in an industrial context. Further we focus on synthetic data generation and investigate the use of recurrent neural networks for this purpose. In our preliminary experiments, we were able to generate representative and highly accurate data using a recurrent neural network. These results open new research questions that we discuss here, and plan to investigate in our future research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06377v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CurvPy is an open-source Python library for automated curve fitting and regression analysis, aiming to make advanced statistical and machine learning techniques more accessible. This paper explores the mathematical foundations and implementation of key CurvPy components for optimization, smoothing, imputation, summarization, visualization, regression, evaluation, and tuning. The methodology leverages well-established statistical and computational algorithms adapted through both simplification and exposure of advanced options to balance usability and customizability. Mathematical techniques utilized include least squares estimation, Savitzky-Golay filtering, matrix completion, gradient descent optimization, regularization, basis function regression, and standard model evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Learned Indexes for External-Memory Joins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of utilizing CDF-based learned indexes in indexed-nested loop joins for both sorted and unsorted data in external memory. Our experimental study seeks to determine whether the advantages of learned indexes observed in in-memory joins by Sabek and Kraska (VLDB 2023) extend to the external memory context. First, we introduce two optimizations for integrating learned indexes into external-memory joins. Subsequently, we conduct an extensive evaluation, employing hash join, sort join, and indexed-nested loop join with real-world and simulated datasets. Furthermore, we independently assess the learned index-based join across various dimensions, including storage device types, key types, data sorting, parallelism, constrained memory settings, and increasing model error. Our experiments indicate that B-trees and learned indexes exhibit largely similar performance in external-memory joins. Learned indexes offer advantages in terms of smaller index size and faster lookup performance. However, their construction time is approximately $1000\times$ higher. While learned indexes can be significantly smaller ($2\times$-$4\times$) than the internal nodes of a B-tree index, these internal nodes constitute only 0.4 to 1% of the data size and typically fit in main memory in most practical scenarios. Additionally, unlike in the in-memory setting, learned indexes can prioritize faster construction over accuracy (larger error window) without significantly affecting query performance.</description>

      <title>Universal Harmonic Sketching over Turnstile Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we take a new approach to constructing a universal sketch that focuses on a class of \emph{basis functions} $\{f_s(x)=1-\cos(sx)\mid s&gt;0\}$, so that any $f$-moment can be estimated if $f$ can be expressed as a linear combination of basis functions. We construct and analyze the $\mathsf{SymmetricPoissonTower}$ sketch, which occupies $O(\epsilon^{-2}\log^2(nM\epsilon^{-1}))$ bits and is $\mathcal{F}$-universal for the function class $$\mathcal{F}= \left\{f(x)=cx^2+\int_0^\infty (1-\cos (xs))\,\nu(ds) \mid c\geq 0, \text{$\nu$ is a positive measure}\right\},$$ i.e., given any $f\in \mathcal{F}$, the new sketch $(1\pm\epsilon)$-estimates the $f$-moment with probability 2/3. The family $\mathcal{F}$ includes all the classic frequency moments ($f(z)=|z|^p$, $p\in [0,2]$) as well as a large family of nearly-periodic functions that cannot be estimated with $L_2$-heavy hitter machinery. This new approach to universality requires significantly less space in comparison to previous universal schemes and sheds new light on the full characterization of the class $\mathcal{T}$ of tractable functions.</description>

      <title>ExioML: Eco-economic dataset for Machine Learning in Global Sectoral Sustainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Environmental Extended Multi-Regional Input-Output analysis is the predominant framework in Ecological Economics for assessing the environmental impact of economic activities. This paper introduces ExioML, the first Machine Learning benchmark dataset designed for sustainability analysis, aimed at lowering barriers and fostering collaboration between Machine Learning and Ecological Economics research. A crucial greenhouse gas emission regression task was conducted to evaluate sectoral sustainability and demonstrate the usability of the dataset. We compared the performance of traditional shallow models with deep learning models, utilizing a diverse Factor Accounting table and incorporating various categorical and numerical features. Our findings reveal that ExioML, with its high usability, enables deep and ensemble models to achieve low mean square errors, establishing a baseline for future Machine Learning research. Through ExioML, we aim to build a foundational dataset supporting various Machine Learning applications and promote climate actions and sustainable investment decisions.</description>
