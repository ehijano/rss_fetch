      <title>Tunneling magnetoresistance in MgO tunnel junctions with Fe-based leads in empirically corrected density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The minority-spin Fe/MgO interface states are at the Fermi level in density functional theory (DFT), but experimental evidence and GW calculations place them slightly higher in energy. This small shift can strongly influence tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) in junctions with a thin MgO barrier and its dependence on the concentration of Co in the electrodes. Here, an empirical potential correction to DFT is introduced to shift the interface states up to match the tunnel spectroscopy data. With this shift, TMR in Fe/MgO/Fe junctions exceeds 800% and 3000% at 3 and 4 monolayers (ML) of MgO, respectively. We further consider the effect of alloying of the Fe electrodes with up to 30% Co or 10% V, treating them in the coherent potential approximation (CPA). Alloying with Co broadens the interface states and brings a large incoherent minority-spin spectral weight to the Fermi level. Alloying with V brings the minority-spin resonant states close to the Fermi level. However, in both cases the minority-spin spectral weight at the Fermi level resides primarily at the periphery of the Brillouin zone, which is favorable for spin filtering. Using convolutions of $\mathbf{k}_\parallel$-resolved barrier densities of states calculated in CPA, it is found that TMR is strongly reduced by alloying with Co or V but still remains above 500% at 4 ML of MgO up to 30% of Co or 5% V. At 5 ML, the TMR increases above 1000% in all systems considered. On the other hand, while TMR declines sharply with increasing bias up to 0.2 eV in the MTJ with pure Fe leads, it remains almost constant up to 0.5 eV if leads are alloyed with Co.</description>

      <title>Realistic Fr\"ohlich Scattering and Mobility of 2D Semiconductors in van der Waals Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors have demonstrated great potential for next-generation electronics and optoelectronics. Their atomic thinness facilitates the material design for desirable electronic properties when combined with other 2D materials in van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure. Although the carrier mobility has been well studied for suspended 2D semiconductors via first-principles calculation recently, it is not clear how they are affected by surrounding materials. In this work, we propose a model to consider the Fr\"ohlich scattering, an important scattering in polar materials from polar-optical (PO) phonons, in vdW heterostructures. Exemplified by InSe surrounded by h-BN, we found the InSe Fr\"ohlich mobility can be enhanced about 2.5 times by environmental dielectric screening and coupled PO phonons in vdW heterostructures. More interestingly, the strong remote PO phonons can enhance the InSe mobility instead of deteriorating it once considering the PO phonons coupling. Then several quantities of surrounding dielectrics are proposed to optimize the InSe Fr\"ohlich mobility, and then used for filtering potential 2D dielectric materials. Our work provides efficient calculation tools as well as physical insights for carrier transport of 2D semiconductors in realistic vdW heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Semiconductor Computational Carrier Mobility Genome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) crystalline semiconductors hold promise for next-generation electronic devices due to its atomical thickness and consequent properties. Despite years of search, literature-reported 2D semiconductors commonly suffered from low room-temperature charge mobility (&lt; 200 cm2V-1s-1), due to the dimensionality-increased 'density of scattering', undesirable defects during fabrication and/or strong electron-phonon scattering. Therefore, understanding charge scatterings in 2D semiconductors via computational tools and discovering new 2D semiconductors with high mobility (&gt; 1000 cm2V-1s-1) are both desirable. Here we review the accurate ab initio approaches for electron-phonon/defect/boundary scattering developed these years, and the efforts made in high-mobility 2D semiconductor high throughput screening. Starting from these studies, the common genome of high-mobility 2D semiconductor are summarized and discussed, which would contribute to further discovering of high mobility in 2D semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Ligand Equilibrium Influences Photoluminescence Blinking in CsPbBr3: A Change Point Analysis of Widefield Imaging Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoluminescence intermittency remains one of the biggest challenges to realizing perovskite quantum dots (QDs) as scalable single photon emitters. We compare CsPbBr3 QDs capped with different ligands, lecithin, and a combination of oleic acid and oleylamine, to elucidate the role of surface chemistry on photoluminescence intermittency. We employ widefield photoluminescence microscopy, sampling the blinking behavior of hundreds of QDs. Using change point analysis, we achieve the robust classification of blinking trajectories, and we analyze representative distributions from large numbers of QDs (Nlecithin = 1308, Noleic acid/oleylamine =1317). We find that lecithin suppresses blinking in CsPbBr3 QDs compared to oleic acid/oleylamine. Under common experimental conditions, lecithin-capped QDs are 7.5 times more likely to be non-blinking and spend 2.5 times longer in their most emissive state, despite both QDs having nearly identical solution photoluminescence quantum yields. We measure photoluminescence as a function of dilution and show that the differences between lecithin and oleic acid/oleylamine capping emerge at low concentrations during preparation for single particle experiments. From experiment and first principles calculations, we attribute the differences in lecithin and oleic acid/oleylamine performance to differences in their ligand binding equilibria. Consistent with our experimental data, density functional theory calculations suggest a stronger binding affinity of lecithin to the QD surface compared to oleic acid/oleylamine, implying a reduced likelihood of ligand desorption during dilution. These results suggest that using more tightly binding ligands is a necessity for surface passivation and consequently, blinking reduction in perovskite QDs used for single particle and quantum light experiments.</description>

      <title>Unusual photoinduced crystal structure dynamics in TaTe$_2$ with double zigzag chain superstructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides with superperiodic lattice distortions have been widely investigated as the platform of ultrafast structural phase manipulations. Here we performed ultrafast electron diffraction on room-temperature TaTe$_2$, which exhibits peculiar double zigzag chain pattern of Ta atoms. From the time-dependent electron diffraction pattern, we revealed a photoinduced change in the crystal structure occurring within &lt;0.5 ps, though there is no corresponding high-temperature equilibrium phase. We further clarified the slower response (~1.5 ps) reflecting the lattice thermalization. Our result suggests the unusual ultrafast crystal structure dynamics specific to the non-equilibrium transient process in TaTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Vibrational heating and photodissociation of admolecules induced by plasmonic hot carriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hot carriers generated by plasmon damping hold significant potential for photoelectric conversion and photocatalysis. Despite numerous experiments and theoretical analyses, the precise role of plasmonic hot carriers in such dynamical processes has not been well understood. Here we present a theory of plasmonic photocatalysis based on the microscopic model of electron-vibrational coupling and the vibrational heating mechanism. The nonthermal hot carrier distribution was derived and treated on equal footing with the thermal Fermi-Dirac distribution. The inelastic rates of vibrational excitations were calculated including the effect of multiple electronic transitions. As an example of application, the O$_2$ dissociation on silver nanoparticles was explored with focus on the temperature- and light-intensity dependences. The dissociation rate evolves from a linear regime into a superlinear regime due to the onset of vibrational heating induced by hot carriers. In the nonlinear regime, nonthermal hot carriers greatly promote molecular dissociation. Our findings provide insight into plasmonic photocatalysis, and paves the way for harnessing light energies in the nonthermal regime.</description>

      <title>Solid-State Electrochemical Thermal Transistors with Large Thermal Conductivity Switching Widths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal transistors that switch the thermal conductivity (\k{appa}) of the active layers are attracting increasing attention as thermal management devices. For electrochemical thermal transistors, several transition metal oxides (TMOs) have been proposed as active layers. After electrochemical redox treatment, the crystal structure of the TMO is modulated, which results in the \k{appa} switching. However, the \k{appa} switching width is still small (&lt; 4 W/mK). In this study, we demonstrate that LaNiOx-based solid-state electrochemical thermal transistors have a \k{appa} switching width of 4.3 W/mK. Fully oxidised LaNiO3 (on state) has a \k{appa} of 6.0 W/mK due to the large contribution of electron thermal conductivity (\k{appa}ele, 3.1 W/mK). In contrast, reduced LaNiO2.72 (off state) has a \k{appa} of 1.7 W/mK because the phonons are scattered by the oxygen vacancies. The LaNiOx-based electrochemical thermal transistor exhibits excellent cyclability of \k{appa} and the crystalline lattice of LaNiOx. This electrochemical thermal transistor may be a promising platform for next-generation devices such as thermal displays.</description>

      <title>Selective-Area Epitaxy of Bulk-Insulating (Bi$_x$Sb$_{1-x}$)$_2$Te$_3$ Films and Nanowires by Molecular Beam Epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The selective-area epitaxy (SAE) is a useful technique to grow epitaxial films with a desired shape on a pre-patterned substrate. Although SAE of patterned topological-insulator (TI) thin films has been performed in the past, there has been no report of SAE-grown TI structures that are bulk-insulating. Here we report the successful growth of Hall-bars and nanowires of bulk-insulating TIs using the SAE technique. Their transport properties show that the quality of the selectively-grown structures is comparable to that of bulk-insulating TI films grown on pristine substrates. In SAE-grown TI nanowires, we were able to observe Aharonov-Bohm-like magnetoresistance oscillations that are characteristic of the quantum-confined topological surface states. The availability of bulk-insulating TI nanostructures via the SAE technique opens the possibility to fabricate intricate topological devices in a scalable manner.</description>

      <title>Growth of two-inch free-standing heteroepitaxial diamond on Ir/YSZ/Si (001) substrates via laser-patterned templates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, 2-inch free-standing diamonds were prepared by using heteroepitaxy on composite Ir/YSZ/Si (001) substrates. To release stress, patterned templates were fabricated using laser etching after the initial growth of 50-nm-diamond. Then, the subsequent growth was completed on a patterned template. The full width at half maximum of the diamond (400) and (311) X-ray rocking curves were 313.5 and 359.3 arcsecs, respectively. Strong band-edge emission in the cathodoluminescence spectrum of the resulting diamond revealed excellent crystalline quality. Furthermore, the 2D mapping of Raman spectra was conducted on a $2 mm \times 2 mm$ area located at the center of the 2-inch sample with a thickness of $400 {\mu}m$. The result showed an average peak width of $2.85 \pm 0.36 cm^{-1}$ and residual stress of $-0.03 \pm 0.37 GPa$. The dislocation density, determined by counting etching pits generated from $ H_2/O_2$ plasma etching, was estimated to be around $2.2 \times 10^7 cm^{-2}$. These results evidence that the laser-patterned method can effectively release stress during the growth of large-size diamonds, offering a simpler and more cost-effective alternative to the traditional photolithography-patterned scheme.</description>

      <title>Path differences between quasistatic and fatigue cracks in anisotropic media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The propagation path of quasistatic cracks under monotonic loading is known to be strongly influenced by the anisotropy of the fracture energy in crystalline solids or engineered materials with a regular microstructure. Such cracks generally follow directions close to minima of the fracture energy. Here we demonstrate both experimentally and computationally that fatigue cracks under cyclic loading follow dramatically different paths that are predominantly dictated by the symmetry of the loading with the microstructure playing a negligible or subdominant role.</description>

      <title>Inverted band gap trend through octahedral ordering in Cs$_2$Au$_2$X$_6$ (X=Cl, Br, I)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double perovskites Cs$_2$Au$_2$X$_6$ (X=Cl, Br, I) are prototypical materials that exhibit charge disproportionation of gold into 1+ and 3+ states. It is known that the disproportionation is resolved under high pressures, and this has stimulated many studies into the pressurization of these materials. At present, the phase changes in these materials are still strongly contested. Here, we use density functional theory to study the pressure-dependent behavior of Cs$_2$Au$_2$X$_6$. We find that a tetragonal--cubic transition occurs directly from the ground state $I4/mmm$ structure. Even so, we also found an intermediate tetragonal $P4/mmm$ structure to be very close in energy, suggesting it to be observable. We also find several other competing metastable phases, which explains some of the controversies in the literature. Focusing on one of the metastable phases, we suggest that Cs$_2$Au$_2$X$_6$ can be prepared in a $P4_2/mnm$ structure, analogous to that of KCuF$_3$. The band gap in the $P4_2/mnm$ structure widened as atomic number of the halide was increased, which is the inverse trend compared to the ground state structure. We explain this by the different octahedral distortion ordering in the two structural phases. Furthermore, we show that the conduction band in $P4_2/mnm$ is three dimensionally connected, which is favorable for opto-electronic applications. We submit that this work demonstrates that octahedral distortion ordering is a promising avenue for developing new double perovskites and suggests it to be particular effective in tuning the electronic structure properties.</description>

      <title>Cavity engineered phonon-mediated superconductivity in MgB$_2$ from first principles quantum electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong laser pulses can control superconductivity, inducing non-equilibrium transient pairing by leveraging strong-light matter interaction. Here we demonstrate theoretically that equilibrium ground-state phonon-mediated superconductive pairing can be affected through the vacuum fluctuating electromagnetic field in a cavity. Using the recently developed $\textit{ab initio}$ quantum electrodynamical density-functional theory approximation, we specifically investigate the phonon-mediated superconductive behavior of MgB$_2$ under different cavity setups and find that in the strong-light matter coupling regime its superconducting transition temperature can be enhanced by $\approx 73\%$ ($\approx 40\%$) in an in-plane (out-of-plane) polarized cavity. The results highlight that strong-light matter coupling in extended systems can profoundly alter material properties in a non-perturbative way by modifying their electronic structure and phononic dispersion at the same time. Our findings indicate a pathway to the experimental realization of light-controlled superconductivity in solid-state materials at equilibrium via cavity-material engineering.</description>

      <title>Deuteration removes quantum dipolar defects from KDP crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structural, dielectric, and thermodynamic properties of the hydrogen-bonded ferroelectric crystal potassium dihydrogen phosphate ($\mathbf{KH_2PO_4}$), KDP for short, differ significantly from those of DKDP ($\mathbf{KD_2PO_4}$). It is well established that deuteration affects the interplay of hydrogen-bond switches and heavy ion displacements that underlie the emergence of macroscopic polarization, but a detailed microscopic model is missing. Here we show that all-atom path integral molecular dynamics simulations can predict the isotope effects, revealing the microscopic mechanism that differentiates KDP and DKDP. Proton tunneling in the hydrogen bonds generates phosphate configurations that do not contribute to the polarization. These dipolar defects are always present in KDP, but disappear at low temperatures in DKDP, which behaves more classically. Quantum disorder confers residual entropy to ferroelectric KDP, explaining its lower spontaneous polarization and transition entropy relative to DKDP. Tunneling should also contribute to the anomalous heat capacity observed in KDP near absolute zero. The prominent role of quantum fluctuations in KDP is related to the unusual strength of the hydrogen bonds in this system and should be equally important in the other crystals of the KDP family, which exhibit similar isotope effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polar topologies, such as vortex and skyrmion, have attracted significant interest due to their unique physical properties and promising applications in high-density memory devices. Currently, most polar vortices are observed in heterostructures containing ferroelectric materials and constrained by substrates. In this study, we unravel arrays of polar vortices formed in twisted freestanding bilayers composed of SrTiO3, a quantum-paraelectric material. Depth-resolved structures of the bilayers are measured with deep-sub-angstrom resolution and one picometer accuracy using multislice ptychography, enabling identification of the three-dimensional variations of polarization topology. Our findings reveal the evolution of the polar vortices in the twisted overlapping layers, demonstrating the reverse of rotation manner in the depth direction. Twisted freestanding bilayers provide a unique platform for exploration and modulation of novel polar topologies.</description>

Abstract: Low-dimensional quantum magnets are a versatile materials platform for studying the emergent many-body physics and collective excitations that can arise even in systems with only short-range interactions. Understanding their low-temperature structure and spin Hamiltonian is key to explaining their magnetic properties, including unconventional quantum phases, phase transitions, and excited states. We study the metal-organic coordination compound (C$_5$H$_9$NH$_3$)$_2$CuBr$_4$ and its deuterated counterpart, which upon its discovery was identified as a candidate two-leg quantum ($S = 1/2$) spin ladder in the strong-leg coupling regime. By growing large single crystals and probing them with both bulk and microscopic techniques, we deduce that two previously unknown structural phase transitions take place between 136 K and 113 K. The low-temperature structure has a monoclinic unit cell giving rise to two inequivalent spin ladders. We further confirm the absence of long-range magnetic order down to 30 mK and discuss the implications of this two-ladder structure for the magnetic properties of (C$_5$H$_9$NH$_3$)$_2$CuBr$_4$.</description>

      <title>Lowering the Exponential Wall: Accelerating High-Entropy Alloy Catalysts Screening using Local Surface Energy Descriptors from Neural Network Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational screening is indispensable for the efficient design of high-entropy alloys (HEAs), which hold great potential for catalytic applications. However, the chemical space of HEAs is exponentially vast with respect to the number of constituent elements, and even screening calculations using machine learning potentials can be enormously time-consuming. To address this challenge, we propose a method to rapidly construct models that predict the properties of HEAs from data on monometallic systems (or few-component alloys). The core of our approach is a newly-introduced descriptor called local surface energy ($LSE$), which reflects the local reactivity of solid surfaces at atomic resolution. We successfully created a model using linear regression to screen the adsorption energies of molecules on HEAs based on LSEs from monometallic systems. Furthermore, we made high-precision model development by employing both classical machine learning and quantum machine learning. Using our method, we were able to complete the adsorption energy calculations of CO molecules on 1000 patterns of quinary nanoparticles consisting of 201 atoms within a few hours. These calculations would have taken hundreds of years and hundreds of days using density functional theory and a neural network potential, respectively. Our approach allows accelerated exploration of the vast chemical space of HEAs facilitating the design of novel catalysts.</description>

      <title>Projected Augmented Waves (PAW) inspired mixed basis sets for small molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The success behind many pseudopotential methods such as Projected Augmented Waves (PAW) and Phillips-Kleinman pseudopotential methods is that these methods are all electron methods in disguise. For the Phillips Kleinman and PAW methods we show that there is an all electron formulation. In the all electron formulation there are regular low wavevector wavefunctions and several, specially chosen, high wavevector wavefunctions that are specialized to the atomic environment. Using this as inspiration here we propose a new, PAW pseudopotential inspired, basis set method for small molecules, where we use the recently introduced LO basis set is paired with a Gaussian basis for a hybrid basis for small molecules.</description>

      <title>On the average spin Chern number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose the average spin Chern number (ASCN) as an indicator of the topological significance of the spin degree of freedom within insulating materials. Whenever this number is a non-zero even integer, it distinguishes the material as a spin Chern insulator and the number is a topological invariant. If this number is not zero, it indicates that the material has non-trivial spin transport properties, and it lies close to the value of the spin Hall conductivity (SHC) within the bandgap. For materials where spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is small, the ASCN matches the SHC. When the SOC cannot be neglected, both values are non-zero simultaneously. The ASCN is therefore a good complement for the intrinsic contribution of the SHC, and permits to detect topological information of the material which is not possible alone from the value of the SHC.</description>

      <title>Enumeration and representation theory of spin space groups</title>

Abstract: Those fundamental physical properties, such as phase transitions, Weyl fermions, and spin excitation, in all magnetic ordered materials, were ultimately believed to rely on the symmetry theory of magnetic space groups. Recently, it has come to light that a more comprehensive group, known as the spin space group (SSG), which combines separate spin and spatial operations, is necessary to fully characterize the geometry and underlying properties of magnetic ordered materials. However, the basic theory of SSG has seldom been developed. In this work, we present a systematic study of the enumeration and the representation theory of SSG. Starting from the 230 crystallographic space groups and finite translation groups with a maximum order of 8, we establish an extensive collection of over 100000 SSGs under a four-index nomenclature as well as the International notation. We then identify inequivalent SSGs specifically applicable to collinear, coplanar, and noncoplanar magnetic configurations. To facilitate the identification of SSG, we develop an online program (findspingroup.com) that can determine the SSG symmetries of any magnetic ordered crystals. Moreover, we derive the irreducible co-representations of the little group in momentum space within the SSG framework. Finally, we illustrate the SSG symmetries and physical effects beyond the framework of magnetic space groups through several representative material examples, including a well-known altermagnet RuO2, spiral spin polarization in the coplanar antiferromagnet CeAuAl3, and geometric Hall effect in the noncoplanar antiferromagnet CoNb3S6. Our work advances the field of group theory in describing magnetic ordered materials, opening up avenues for deeper comprehension and further exploration of emergent phenomena in magnetic materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Defects are a universal feature of crystalline solids, dictating the key properties and performance of many functional materials. Given their crucial importance yet inherent difficulty in measuring experimentally, computational methods (such as DFT and ML/classical force-fields) are widely used to predict defect behaviour at the atomic level and the resultant impact on macroscopic properties. Here we report doped, a Python package for the generation, pre-/post-processing, and analysis of defect supercell calculations. doped has been built to implement the defect simulation workflow in an efficient and user-friendly -- yet powerful and fully-flexible -- manner, with the goal of providing a robust general-purpose platform for conducting reproducible calculations of solid-state defect properties.</description>

      <title>BAMBOO: a predictive and transferable machine learning force field framework for liquid electrolyte development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07181v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the widespread applications of machine learning force field (MLFF) on solids and small molecules, there is a notable gap in applying MLFF to complex liquid electrolytes. In this work, we introduce BAMBOO (ByteDance AI Molecular Simulation Booster), a novel framework for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, with a demonstration of its capabilities in the context of liquid electrolytes for lithium batteries. We design a physics-inspired graph equivariant transformer architecture as the backbone of BAMBOO to learn from quantum mechanical simulations. Additionally, we pioneer an ensemble knowledge distillation approach and apply it on MLFFs to improve the stability of MD simulations. Finally, we propose the density alignment algorithm to align BAMBOO with experimental measurements. BAMBOO demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy in predicting key electrolyte properties such as density, viscosity, and ionic conductivity across various solvents and salt combinations. Our current model, trained on more than 15 chemical species, achieves the average density error of 0.01 g/cm$^3$ on various compositions compared with experimental data. Moreover, our model demonstrates transferability to molecules not included in the quantum mechanical dataset. We envision this work as paving the way to a "universal MLFF" capable of simulating properties of common organic liquids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.12873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atomic-scale control of light-matter interactions represent the ultimate frontier for many applications in photonics and quantum technology. Two-dimensional semiconductors, including transition metal dichalcogenides, are a promising platform to achieve such control due to the combination of an atomically thin geometry and convenient photophysical properties. Here, we demonstrate that a variety of durable polymorphic structures can be combined to generate additional optical resonances beyond the standard excitons. We theoretically predict and experimentally show that atomic-sized patches of 1T phase within the 1H matrix form unique electronic bands that give rise to new and robust optical resonances with strong absorption, circularly polarized emission and long radiative lifetime. The atomic manipulation of two-dimensional semiconductors opens unexplored scenarios for light harvesting devices and exciton-based photonics.</description>

      <title>Rotation of gap nodes in the topological superconductor Cu$_x$(PbSe)$_5$(Bi$_2$Se$_3$)$_6$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16732v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among the family of odd-parity topological superconductors derived from $\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{3}$, $\mathrm{Cu}_{x}(\mathrm{PbSe})_{5}(\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\mathrm{Se}_{3})_{6}$ (CPSBS) has been elucidated to have gap nodes. Although the nodal gap structure has been established by specific-heat and thermal-conductivity measurements, there has been no direct observation of the superconducting gap of CPSBS using scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS). Here we report the first STS experiments on CPSBS down to 0.35 K, which found that the vortices generated by out-of-plane magnetic fields have an elliptical shape, reflecting the anisotropic gap structure. The orientation of the gap minima is found to be aligned with the bulk direction when the surface lattice image shows twofold symmetry, but, surprisingly, it is rotated by 30$^{\circ}$ when twofold symmetry is absent. In addition, the superconducting gap spectra in zero magnetic field suggest that the gap nodes are most likely lifted. We argue that only an emergent symmetry at the surface, allowing for a linear superposition of gap functions with different symmetries in the bulk, can lead to the rotation of the gap nodes. The absence of inversion symmetry at the surface additionally lifts the nodes. This result establishes the subtle but crucial role of crystalline symmetry in topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Platinum-based Catalysts for Oxygen Reduction Reaction simulated with a Quantum Computer</title>

Abstract: Hydrogen has emerged as a promising energy source, holding the key to achieve low-carbon and sustainable mobility. However, its applications are still limited by modest conversion efficiency in the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) within fuel cells. Consequently, the development of novel catalysts and a profound understanding of the underlying reactions have become of paramount importance. The complex nature of the ORR potential energy landscape and the presence of strong electronic correlations present challenges to atomistic modelling using classical computers. This scenario opens new avenues for the implementation of novel quantum computing workflows to address these molecular systems. Here, we present a pioneering study that combines classical and quantum computational approaches to investigate the ORR on pure platinum and platinum/cobalt surfaces. Our research demonstrates, for the first time, the feasibility of implementing this workflow on the H1-series trapped-ion quantum computer and identify the challenges of the quantum chemistry modelling of this reaction. The results highlight the involvement of strongly correlated species in the cobalt-containing catalyst, suggesting their potential as ideal candidates for showcasing quantum advantage in future applications.</description>

      <title>Nonvolatile spin field effect transistor based on VSi2N4/Sc2CO2 multiferroic heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present first-principles calculations that introduce a novel nonvolatile spin field-effect transistor (Spin-FET) utilizing a van der Waals multiferroic heterostructure, specifically VSi2N4/Sc2CO2. We demonstrate that inverting the ferroelectric polarization in a Sc2CO2 monolayer can effectively modulate the electronic states of a VSi2N4 monolayer, enabling a transition from half-metal to half-semiconductor. This transition significantly alters the electronic transport properties. Furthermore, we construct a Spin-FET device based on this multiferroic heterostructure and observe that the VSi2N4/Sc2CO2-based Spin-FET exhibits exceptional all-electric-controlled performance. Notably, the inversion of the Sc2CO2 ferroelectric polarization yields a substantial on-off current ratio, approximately 650\%, under a minimal bias voltage of 0.02 V. Additionally, we identify a unique spatially-separated spin-polarized transport phenomenon, wherein pure spin-up electrons transport exclusively through VSi2N4, and spin-down electrons through Sc$_2$CO$_2$. Our findings suggest a promising pathway for developing low-energy-dissipation and nonvolatile FET devices.</description>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is transforming computational materials science, improving the prediction of material properties, and accelerating the discovery of novel materials. Recently, publicly available material data repositories have grown rapidly. This growth encompasses not only more materials, but also a greater variety and quantity of their associated properties. Existing machine learning efforts in materials science focus primarily on single-modality tasks, i.e., relationships between materials and a single physical property, thus not taking advantage of the rich and multimodal set of material properties. Here, we introduce Multimodal Learning for Materials (MultiMat), which enables self-supervised multi-modality training of foundation models for materials. We demonstrate our framework's potential using data from the Materials Project database on multiple axes: (i) MultiMat achieves state-of-the-art performance for challenging material property prediction tasks; (ii) MultiMat enables novel and accurate material discovery via latent space similarity, enabling screening for stable materials with desired properties; and (iii) MultiMat encodes interpretable emergent features that may provide novel scientific insights.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Impact of Initial Choices and In-Loop Interventions on Learning Dynamics in Autonomous Scanning Probe Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The current focus in Autonomous Experimentation (AE) is on developing robust workflows to conduct the AE effectively. This entails the need for well-defined approaches to guide the AE process, including strategies for hyperparameter tuning and high-level human interventions within the workflow loop. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the influence of initial experimental conditions and in-loop interventions on the learning dynamics of Deep Kernel Learning (DKL) within the realm of AE in Scanning Probe Microscopy. We explore the concept of 'seed effect', where the initial experiment setup has a substantial impact on the subsequent learning trajectory. Additionally, we introduce an approach of the seed point interventions in AE allowing the operator to influence the exploration process. Using a dataset from Piezoresponse Force Microscopy (PFM) on PbTiO3 thin films, we illustrate the impact of the 'seed effect' and in-loop seed interventions on the effectiveness of DKL in predicting material properties. The study highlights the importance of initial choices and adaptive interventions in optimizing learning rates and enhancing the efficiency of automated material characterization. This work offers valuable insights into designing more robust and effective AE workflows in microscopy with potential applications across various characterization techniques. The analysis code that supports the funding is publicly available at https://github.com/Slautin/2024_Seed_effect_DKL_BO.</description>

      <title>Multi-radius Soler-Williams Augmented Plane Waves (SAPWMR), Multi-Radius Soler-Williams Linearized Augmented Plane Waves (SLAPWMR) and extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we present a new basis set for electronic structures (Density Functional Theory (DFT)) calculations. This basis set extends Soler Williams Linearized Augmented Plane Wave (SLAPW) basis sets by allowing variable Muffin Tin (MT) sphere radii for the different angular momentum channels and for different magnitude wave vectors of the augmented plane waves. With the correct choice of MT radius, this allows us to match additional derivatives of the wave function at the MT radius without having to resort to additional higher derivative terms as part of the wave function expansion inside the MT sphere. This should lead to low wave vector basis set and low linearization energy errors, arguably as good as APW basis set size and LAPW basis linearization errors. We call these basis sets SAPWMR and SLAPWMR depending on the number of derivative like wave functions kept inside the MT radii. Similarly local orbital (LO and lo basis wave functions depending on the number of derivative terms in the MT radius) are suggested with a variable radius. that reduces the number of derivative like terms needed to make them continuous or continuously differentiable. As such semi-core states can also be well handled by our methods. Furthermore in the appendix Full Potential Hamiltonian calculations (FLAPW) are extended to FSLAPWMR full potential calculations for Hamiltonian matrix elements. In the Appendix we introduce some further ideas to improve the speed of DFT calculations which are relevant to the basis sets presented here and to other basis sets such as the LAPW basis set.</description>
