      <title>Fractal Flow: Hierarchical and Interpretable Normalizing Flow via Topic Modeling and Recursive Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Normalizing Flows provide a principled framework for high-dimensional density estimation and generative modeling by constructing invertible transformations with tractable Jacobian determinants. We propose Fractal Flow, a novel normalizing flow architecture that enhances both expressiveness and interpretability through two key innovations. First, we integrate Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks and incorporate Latent Dirichlet Allocation into normalizing flows to construct a structured, interpretable latent space and model hierarchical semantic clusters. Second, inspired by Fractal Generative Models, we introduce a recursive modular design into normalizing flows to improve transformation interpretability and estimation accuracy. Experiments on MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, and geophysical data demonstrate that the Fractal Flow achieves latent clustering, controllable generation, and superior estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Conditional Normalizing Flow Surrogate for Monte Carlo Prediction of Radiative Properties in Nanoparticle-Embedded Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a probabilistic, data-driven surrogate model for predicting the radiative properties of nanoparticle embedded scattering media. The model uses conditional normalizing flows, which learn the conditional distribution of optical outputs, including reflectance, absorbance, and transmittance, given input parameters such as the absorption coefficient, scattering coefficient, anisotropy factor, and particle size distribution. We generate training data using Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations, with optical properties derived from Mie theory. Unlike conventional neural networks, the conditional normalizing flow model yields full posterior predictive distributions, enabling both accurate forecasts and principled uncertainty quantification. Our results demonstrate that this model achieves high predictive accuracy and reliable uncertainty estimates, establishing it as a powerful and efficient surrogate for radiative transfer simulations.</description>

      <title>The Information Dynamics of Generative Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of models in machine learning, yet a unified theoretical understanding of their operation is still developing. This perspective paper provides an integrated perspective on generative diffusion by connecting their dynamic, information-theoretic, and thermodynamic properties under a unified mathematical framework. We demonstrate that the rate of conditional entropy production during generation (i.e. the generative bandwidth) is directly governed by the expected divergence of the score function's vector field. This divergence, in turn, is linked to the branching of trajectories and generative bifurcations, which we characterize as symmetry-breaking phase transitions in the energy landscape. This synthesis offers a powerful insight: the process of generation is fundamentally driven by the controlled, noise-induced breaking of (approximate) symmetries, where peaks in information transfer correspond to critical transitions between possible outcomes. The score function acts as a dynamic non-linear filter that regulates the bandwidth of the noise by suppressing fluctuations that are incompatible with the data.</description>

      <title>Track Component Failure Detection Using Data Analytics over existing STDS Track Circuit data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Track Circuits (TC) are the main signalling devices used to detect the presence of a train on a rail track. It has been used since the 19th century and nowadays there are many types depending on the technology. As a general classification, Track Circuits can be divided into 2 main groups, DC (Direct Current) and AC (Alternating Current) circuits. This work is focused on a particular AC track circuit, called "Smart Train Detection System" (STDS), designed with both high and low-frequency bands. This approach uses STDS current data applied to an SVM (support vector machine) classifier as a type of failure identifier. The main purpose of this work consists on determine automatically which is the component of the track that is failing to improve the maintenance action. Model was trained to classify 15 different failures that belong to 3 more general categories. The method was tested with field data from 10 different track circuits and validated by the STDS track circuit expert and maintainers. All use cases were correctly classified by the method.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Regression: Parameter Estimation in Parameter-Linear Nonlinear Dynamic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new efficient hybrid parameter estimation method based on the idea, that if nonlinear dynamic models are stated in terms of a system of equations that is linear in terms of the parameters, then regularized ordinary least squares can be used to estimate these parameters from time series data. We introduce the term "Physics-Informed Regression" (PIR) to describe the proposed data-driven hybrid technique as a way to bridge theory and data by use of ordinary least squares to efficiently perform parameter estimation of the model coefficients of different parameter-linear models; providing examples of models based on nonlinear ordinary equations (ODE) and partial differential equations (PDE). The focus is on parameter estimation on a selection of ODE and PDE models, each illustrating performance in different model characteristics. For two relevant epidemic models of different complexity and number of parameters, PIR is tested and compared against the related technique, physics-informed neural networks (PINN), both on synthetic data generated from known target parameters and on real public Danish time series data collected during the COVID-19 pandemic in Denmark. Both methods were able to estimate the target parameters, while PIR showed to perform noticeably better, especially on a compartment model with higher complexity. Given the difference in computational speed, it is concluded that the PIR method is superior to PINN for the models considered. It is also demonstrated how PIR can be applied to estimate the time-varying parameters of a compartment model that is fitted using real Danish data from the COVID-19 pandemic obtained during a period from 2020 to 2021. The study shows how data-driven and physics-informed techniques may support reliable and fast -- possibly real-time -- parameter estimation in parameter-linear nonlinear dynamic models.</description>

      <title>Data-Augmented Few-Shot Neural Stencil Emulation for System Identification of Computer Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin the modeling of many natural and engineered systems. It can be convenient to express such models as neural PDEs rather than using traditional numerical PDE solvers by replacing part or all of the PDE's governing equations with a neural network representation. Neural PDEs are often easier to differentiate, linearize, reduce, or use for uncertainty quantification than the original numerical solver. They are usually trained on solution trajectories obtained by long time integration of the PDE solver. Here we propose a more sample-efficient data-augmentation strategy for generating neural PDE training data from a computer model by space-filling sampling of local "stencil" states. This approach removes a large degree of spatiotemporal redundancy present in trajectory data and oversamples states that may be rarely visited but help the neural PDE generalize across the state space. We demonstrate that accurate neural PDE stencil operators can be learned from synthetic training data generated by the computational equivalent of 10 timesteps' worth of numerical simulation. Accuracy is further improved if we assume access to a single full-trajectory simulation from the computer model, which is typically available in practice. Across several PDE systems, we show that our data-augmented synthetic stencil data yield better trained neural stencil operators, with clear performance gains compared with naively sampled stencil data from simulation trajectories.</description>

      <title>On Surjectivity of Neural Networks: Can you elicit any behavior from your model?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a trained neural network, can any specified output be generated by some input? Equivalently, does the network correspond to a function that is surjective? In generative models, surjectivity implies that any output, including harmful or undesirable content, can in principle be generated by the networks, raising concerns about model safety and jailbreak vulnerabilities. In this paper, we prove that many fundamental building blocks of modern neural architectures, such as networks with pre-layer normalization and linear-attention modules, are almost always surjective. As corollaries, widely used generative frameworks, including GPT-style transformers and diffusion models with deterministic ODE solvers, admit inverse mappings for arbitrary outputs. By studying surjectivity of these modern and commonly used neural architectures, we contribute a formalism that sheds light on their unavoidable vulnerability to a broad class of adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>Reduced-Order Modeling of Cyclo-Stationary Time Series Using Score-Based Generative Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many natural systems exhibit cyclo-stationary behavior characterized by periodic forcing such as annual and diurnal cycles. We present a data-driven method leveraging recent advances in score-based generative modeling to construct reduced-order models for such cyclo-stationary time series. Our approach accurately reproduces the statistical properties and temporal correlations of the original data, enabling efficient generation of synthetic trajectories. We demonstrate the performance of the method through application to the Planet Simulator (PlaSim) climate model, constructing a reduced-order model for the 20 leading principal components of surface temperature driven by the annual cycle. The resulting surrogate model accurately reproduces the marginal and joint probability distributions, autocorrelation functions, and spatial coherence of the original climate system across multiple validation metrics. The approach offers substantial computational advantages, enabling generation of centuries of synthetic climate data in minutes compared to weeks required for equivalent full model simulations. This work opens new possibilities for efficient modeling of periodically forced systems across diverse scientific domains, providing a principled framework for balancing computational efficiency with physical fidelity in reduced-order modeling applications.</description>

      <title>The Sample Complexity of Membership Inference and Privacy Auditing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A membership-inference attack gets the output of a learning algorithm, and a target individual, and tries to determine whether this individual is a member of the training data or an independent sample from the same distribution. A successful membership-inference attack typically requires the attacker to have some knowledge about the distribution that the training data was sampled from, and this knowledge is often captured through a set of independent reference samples from that distribution. In this work we study how much information the attacker needs for membership inference by investigating the sample complexity-the minimum number of reference samples required-for a successful attack. We study this question in the fundamental setting of Gaussian mean estimation where the learning algorithm is given $n$ samples from a Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{N}(\mu,\Sigma)$ in $d$ dimensions, and tries to estimate $\hat\mu$ up to some error $\mathbb{E}[\|\hat \mu - \mu\|^2_{\Sigma}]\leq \rho^2 d$. Our result shows that for membership inference in this setting, $\Omega(n + n^2 \rho^2)$ samples can be necessary to carry out any attack that competes with a fully informed attacker. Our result is the first to show that the attacker sometimes needs many more samples than the training algorithm uses to train the model. This result has significant implications for practice, as all attacks used in practice have a restricted form that uses $O(n)$ samples and cannot benefit from $\omega(n)$ samples. Thus, these attacks may be underestimating the possibility of membership inference, and better attacks may be possible when information about the distribution is easy to obtain.</description>

      <title>Weighted Levenberg-Marquardt methods for fitting multichannel nuclear cross section data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an extension of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for fitting multichannel nuclear cross section data. Our approach offers a practical and robust alternative to conventional trust-region methods for analyzing experimental data. The CoH$_3$ code, based on the Hauser-Feshbach statistical model, involves a large number of interdependent parameters, making optimization challenging due to the presence of "sloppy" directions in parameter space. To address the uneven distribution of experimental data across reaction channels, we construct a weighted Fisher Information Metric by integrating prior distributions over dataset weights. This framework enables a more balanced treatment of heterogeneous data, improving both parameter estimation and convergence robustness. We show that the resulting weighted Levenberg-Marquardt method yields more physically consistent fits for both raw and smoothed datasets, using experimental data for ${}^{148}$Sm as a representative example. Additionally, we introduce a geometric scaling strategy to accelerate convergence -- a method based on the local geometry of the manifold.</description>

      <title>Just Because You Can, Doesn't Mean You Should: LLMs for Data Fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being applied in a wide array of settings, well beyond the typical language-oriented use cases. In particular, LLMs are increasingly used as a plug-and-play method for fitting data and generating predictions. Prior work has shown that LLMs, via in-context learning or supervised fine-tuning, can perform competitively with many tabular supervised learning techniques in terms of predictive performance. However, we identify a critical vulnerability of using LLMs for data fitting -- making changes to data representation that are completely irrelevant to the underlying learning task can drastically alter LLMs' predictions on the same data. For example, simply changing variable names can sway the size of prediction error by as much as 82% in certain settings. Such prediction sensitivity with respect to task-irrelevant variations manifests under both in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning, for both close-weight and open-weight general-purpose LLMs. Moreover, by examining the attention scores of an open-weight LLM, we discover a non-uniform attention pattern: training examples and variable names/values which happen to occupy certain positions in the prompt receive more attention when output tokens are generated, even though different positions are expected to receive roughly the same attention. This partially explains the sensitivity in the presence of task-irrelevant variations. We also consider a state-of-the-art tabular foundation model (TabPFN) trained specifically for data fitting. Despite being explicitly designed to achieve prediction robustness, TabPFN is still not immune to task-irrelevant variations. Overall, despite LLMs' impressive predictive capabilities, currently they lack even the basic level of robustness to be used as a principled data-fitting tool.</description>

      <title>Interestingness First Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most machine learning models are designed to maximize predictive accuracy. In this work, we explore a different goal: building classifiers that are interesting. An ``interesting classifier'' is one that uses unusual or unexpected features, even if its accuracy is lower than the best possible model. For example, predicting room congestion from CO2 levels achieves near-perfect accuracy but is unsurprising. In contrast, predicting room congestion from humidity is less accurate yet more nuanced and intriguing. We introduce EUREKA, a simple framework that selects features according to their perceived interestingness. Our method leverages large language models to rank features by their interestingness and then builds interpretable classifiers using only the selected interesting features. Across several benchmark datasets, EUREKA consistently identifies features that are non-obvious yet still predictive. For example, in the Occupancy Detection dataset, our method favors humidity over CO2 levels and light intensity, producing classifiers that achieve meaningful accuracy while offering insights. In the Twin Papers dataset, our method discovers the rule that papers with a colon in the title are more likely to be cited in the future. We argue that such models can support new ways of knowledge discovery and communication, especially in settings where moderate accuracy is sufficient but novelty and interpretability are valued.</description>

      <title>The Next Layer: Augmenting Foundation Models with Structure-Preserving and Attention-Guided Learning for Local Patches to Global Context Awareness in Computational Pathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models have recently emerged as powerful feature extractors in computational pathology, yet they typically omit mechanisms for leveraging the global spatial structure of tissues and the local contextual relationships among diagnostically relevant regions - key elements for understanding the tumor microenvironment. Multiple instance learning (MIL) remains an essential next step following foundation model, designing a framework to aggregate patch-level features into slide-level predictions. We present EAGLE-Net, a structure-preserving, attention-guided MIL architecture designed to augment prediction and interpretability. EAGLE-Net integrates multi-scale absolute spatial encoding to capture global tissue architecture, a top-K neighborhood-aware loss to focus attention on local microenvironments, and background suppression loss to minimize false positives. We benchmarked EAGLE-Net on large pan-cancer datasets, including three cancer types for classification (10,260 slides) and seven cancer types for survival prediction (4,172 slides), using three distinct histology foundation backbones (REMEDIES, Uni-V1, Uni2-h). Across tasks, EAGLE-Net achieved up to 3% higher classification accuracy and the top concordance indices in 6 of 7 cancer types, producing smooth, biologically coherent attention maps that aligned with expert annotations and highlighted invasive fronts, necrosis, and immune infiltration. These results position EAGLE-Net as a generalizable, interpretable framework that complements foundation models, enabling improved biomarker discovery, prognostic modeling, and clinical decision support</description>

Namely, if $X\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$ is an i.i.d random matrix, $W\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times p}$ is an i.i.d $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ matrix and $D\in\mathbb{R}^{p\times p}$ is a diagonal matrix with i.i.d bounded entries, we consider the matrix
  \[
  \mathrm{NTK}
  =
  \frac{1}{d}XX^\top
  \odot
  \frac{1}{p}
  \sigma'\left(
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{d}}XW
  \right)D^2
  \sigma'\left(
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{d}}XW
  \right)^\top
  \]
  where $\sigma'$ is a pseudo-Lipschitz function applied entrywise and under the scaling $\frac{n}{dp}\to \gamma_1$ and $\frac{p}{d}\to \gamma_2$. We describe the asymptotic distribution as the free multiplicative convolution of the Marchenko--Pastur distribution with a deterministic distribution depending on $\sigma$ and $D$.</description>

      <title>Neural Conditional Simulation for Complex Spatial Processes</title>

Abstract: A key objective in spatial statistics is to simulate from the distribution of a spatial process at a selection of unobserved locations conditional on observations (i.e., a predictive distribution) to enable spatial prediction and uncertainty quantification. However, exact conditional simulation from this predictive distribution is intractable or inefficient for many spatial process models. In this paper, we propose neural conditional simulation (NCS), a general method for spatial conditional simulation that is based on neural diffusion models. Specifically, using spatial masks, we implement a conditional score-based diffusion model that evolves Gaussian noise into samples from a predictive distribution when given a partially observed spatial field and spatial process parameters as inputs. The diffusion model relies on a neural network that only requires unconditional samples from the spatial process for training. Once trained, the diffusion model is amortized with respect to the observations in the partially observed field, the number and locations of those observations, and the spatial process parameters, and can therefore be used to conditionally simulate from a broad class of predictive distributions without retraining the neural network. We assess the NCS-generated simulations against simulations from the true conditional distribution of a Gaussian process model, and against Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations from a Brown--Resnick process model for spatial extremes. In the latter case, we show that it is more efficient and accurate to conditionally simulate using NCS than classical MCMC techniques implemented in standard software. We conclude that NCS enables efficient and accurate conditional simulation from spatial predictive distributions that are challenging to sample from using traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning of Semi-Competing Risk Data via a New Neural Expectation-Maximization Algorithm</title>

Abstract: Prognostication for lung cancer, a leading cause of mortality, remains a complex task, as it needs to quantify the associations of risk factors and health events spanning a patient's entire life. One challenge is that an individual's disease course involves non-terminal (e.g., disease progression) and terminal (e.g., death) events, which form semi-competing relationships. Our motivation comes from the Boston Lung Cancer Study, a large lung cancer survival cohort, which investigates how risk factors influence a patient's disease trajectory. Following developments in the prediction of time-to-event outcomes with neural networks, deep learning has become a focal area for the development of risk prediction methods in survival analysis. However, limited work has been done to predict multi-state or semi-competing risk outcomes, where a patient may experience adverse events such as disease progression prior to death. We propose a novel neural expectation-maximization algorithm to bridge the gap between classical statistical approaches and machine learning. Our algorithm enables estimation of the non-parametric baseline hazards of each state transition, risk functions of predictors, and the degree of dependence among different transitions, via a multi-task deep neural network with transition-specific sub-architectures. We apply our method to the Boston Lung Cancer Study and investigate the impact of clinical and genetic predictors on disease progression and mortality.</description>

      <title>Bayes-Optimal Fair Classification with Linear Disparity Constraints via Pre-, In-, and Post-processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02817v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning algorithms may have disparate impacts on protected groups. To address this, we develop methods for Bayes-optimal fair classification, aiming to minimize classification error subject to given group fairness constraints. We introduce the notion of \emph{linear disparity measures}, which are linear functions of a probabilistic classifier; and \emph{bilinear disparity measures}, which are also linear in the group-wise regression functions. We show that several popular disparity measures -- the deviations from demographic parity, equality of opportunity, and predictive equality -- are bilinear.
  We find the form of Bayes-optimal fair classifiers under a single linear disparity measure, by uncovering a connection with the Neyman-Pearson lemma. For bilinear disparity measures, we are able to find the explicit form of Bayes-optimal fair classifiers as group-wise thresholding rules with explicitly characterized thresholds. We develop similar algorithms for when protected attribute cannot be used at the prediction phase. Moreover, we obtain analogous theoretical characterizations of optimal classifiers for a multi-class protected attribute and for equalized odds.
  Leveraging our theoretical results, we design methods that learn fair Bayes-optimal classifiers under bilinear disparity constraints. Our methods cover three popular approaches to fairness-aware classification, via pre-processing (Fair Up- and Down-Sampling), in-processing (Fair cost-sensitive Classification) and post-processing (a Fair Plug-In Rule). Our methods control disparity directly while achieving near-optimal fairness-accuracy tradeoffs. We show empirically that our methods have state-of-the-art performance compared to existing algorithms. In particular, our pre-processing method can a reach higher accuracy than prior pre-processing methods at low disparity levels.</description>

      <title>Predicting Forced Responses of Probability Distributions via the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem and Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel and flexible data-driven framework for estimating the response of higher-order moments of nonlinear stochastic systems to small external perturbations. The classical Generalized Fluctuation--Dissipation Theorem (GFDT) links the unperturbed steady-state distribution to the system's linear response. While standard implementations relying on Gaussian approximations can predict the mean response, they often fail to capture changes in higher-order moments. To overcome this, we combine GFDT with score-based generative modeling to estimate the system's score function directly from data. We demonstrate the framework's versatility by employing two complementary score estimation techniques tailored to the system's characteristics: (i) a clustering-based algorithm (KGMM) for systems with low-dimensional effective dynamics, and (ii) a denoising score matching method implemented with a U-Net architecture for high-dimensional, spatially-extended systems where reduced-order modeling is not feasible. Our method is validated on several stochastic models relevant to climate dynamics: three reduced-order models of increasing complexity and a 2D Navier--Stokes model representing a turbulent flow with a localized perturbation. In all cases, the approach accurately captures strongly nonlinear and non-Gaussian features of the system's response, significantly outperforming traditional Gaussian approximations.</description>

Abstract: Neural simulation-based inference (SBI) is a popular set of methods for Bayesian inference when models are only available in the form of a simulator. These methods are widely used in the sciences and engineering, where writing down a likelihood can be significantly more challenging than constructing a simulator. However, the performance of neural SBI can suffer when simulators are computationally expensive, thereby limiting the number of simulations that can be performed. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to neural SBI which leverages multilevel Monte Carlo techniques for settings where several simulators of varying cost and fidelity are available. We demonstrate through both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments that our method can significantly enhance the accuracy of SBI methods given a fixed computational budget.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current experimental scientists have been increasingly relying on simulation-based inference (SBI) to invert complex non-linear models with intractable likelihoods. However, posterior approximations obtained with SBI are often miscalibrated, causing credible regions to undercover true parameters. We develop $\texttt{CP4SBI}$, a model-agnostic conformal calibration framework that constructs credible sets with local Bayesian coverage. Our two proposed variants, namely local calibration via regression trees and CDF-based calibration, enable finite-sample local coverage guarantees for any scoring function, including HPD, symmetric, and quantile-based regions. Experiments on widely used SBI benchmarks demonstrate that our approach improves the quality of uncertainty quantification for neural posterior estimators using both normalizing flows and score-diffusion modeling.</description>

      <title>Scalable Bayesian Structure Learning for Gaussian Graphical Models Using Marginal Pseudo-likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00127v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian methods for learning Gaussian graphical models offer a principled framework for quantifying model uncertainty and incorporating prior knowledge. However, their scalability is constrained by the computational cost of jointly exploring graph structures and precision matrices. To address this challenge, we perform inference directly on the graph by integrating out the precision matrix. We adopt a marginal pseudo-likelihood approach, eliminating the need to compute intractable normalizing constants and perform computationally intensive precision matrix sampling. Building on this framework, we develop continuous-time (birth-death) and discrete-time (reversible jump) Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms that efficiently explore the posterior over graph space. We establish theoretical guarantees for posterior contraction, convergence, and graph selection consistency. The algorithms scale to large graph spaces, enabling parallel exploration for graphs with over 1,000 nodes, while providing uncertainty quantification and supporting flexible prior specification over the graph space. Extensive simulations show substantial computational gains over state-of-the-art Bayesian approaches without sacrificing graph recovery accuracy. Applications to human and mouse gene expression datasets demonstrate the ability of our approach to recover biologically meaningful structures and quantify uncertainty in complex networks. An implementation is available in the R package BDgraph.</description>

      <title>The Bayesian Context Trees State Space Model for time series modelling and forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00913v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A hierarchical Bayesian framework is introduced for developing tree-based mixture models for time series, partly motivated by applications in finance and forecasting. At the top level, meaningful discrete states are identified as appropriately quantised values of some of the most recent samples. At the bottom level, a different, arbitrary base model is associated with each state. This defines a very general framework that can be used in conjunction with any existing model class to build flexible and interpretable mixture models. We call this the Bayesian Context Trees State Space Model, or the BCT-X framework. Appropriate algorithmic tools are described, which allow for effective and efficient Bayesian inference and learning; these algorithms can be updated sequentially, facilitating online forecasting. The utility of the general framework is illustrated in the particular instances when AR or ARCH models are used as base models. The latter results in a mixture model that offers a powerful way of modelling the well-known volatility asymmetries in financial data, revealing a novel, important feature of stock market index data, in the form of an enhanced leverage effect. In forecasting, the BCT-X methods are found to outperform several state-of-the-art techniques, both in terms of accuracy and computational requirements.</description>

      <title>Variational Bayes image restoration with compressive autoencoders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17744v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Regularization of inverse problems is of paramount importance in computational imaging. The ability of neural networks to learn efficient image representations has been recently exploited to design powerful data-driven regularizers. While state-of-the-art plug-and-play (PnP) methods rely on an implicit regularization provided by neural denoisers, alternative Bayesian approaches consider Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation in the latent space of a generative model, thus with an explicit regularization. However, state-of-the-art deep generative models require a huge amount of training data compared to denoisers. Besides, their complexity hampers the optimization involved in latent MAP derivation. In this work, we first propose to use compressive autoencoders instead. These networks, which can be seen as variational autoencoders with a flexible latent prior, are smaller and easier to train than state-of-the-art generative models. As a second contribution, we introduce the Variational Bayes Latent Estimation (VBLE) algorithm, which performs latent estimation within the framework of variational inference. Thanks to a simple yet efficient parameterization of the variational posterior, VBLE allows for fast and easy (approximate) posterior sampling. Experimental results on image datasets BSD and FFHQ demonstrate that VBLE reaches similar performance as state-of-the-art PnP methods, while being able to quantify uncertainties significantly faster than other existing posterior sampling techniques. The code associated to this paper is available in https://github.com/MaudBqrd/VBLE.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Framework of Watermarks for Large Language Models: Pivot, Detection Efficiency and Optimal Rules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01245v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since ChatGPT was introduced in November 2022, embedding (nearly) unnoticeable statistical signals into text generated by large language models (LLMs), also known as watermarking, has been used as a principled approach to provable detection of LLM-generated text from its human-written counterpart. In this paper, we introduce a general and flexible framework for reasoning about the statistical efficiency of watermarks and designing powerful detection rules. Inspired by the hypothesis testing formulation of watermark detection, our framework starts by selecting a pivotal statistic of the text and a secret key -- provided by the LLM to the verifier -- to enable controlling the false positive rate (the error of mistakenly detecting human-written text as LLM-generated). Next, this framework allows one to evaluate the power of watermark detection rules by obtaining a closed-form expression of the asymptotic false negative rate (the error of incorrectly classifying LLM-generated text as human-written). Our framework further reduces the problem of determining the optimal detection rule to solving a minimax optimization program. We apply this framework to two representative watermarks -- one of which has been internally implemented at OpenAI -- and obtain several findings that can be instrumental in guiding the practice of implementing watermarks. In particular, we derive optimal detection rules for these watermarks under our framework. These theoretically derived detection rules are demonstrated to be competitive and sometimes enjoy a higher power than existing detection approaches through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Which Spaces can be Embedded in $L_p$-type Reproducing Kernel Banach Space? A Characterization via Metric Entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11116v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a novel connection between the metric entropy growth and the embeddability of function spaces into reproducing kernel Hilbert/Banach spaces. Metric entropy characterizes the information complexity of function spaces and has implications for their approximability and learnability. Classical results show that embedding a function space into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) implies a bound on its metric entropy growth. Surprisingly, we prove a \textbf{converse}: a bound on the metric entropy growth of a function space allows its embedding to a $L_p-$type Reproducing Kernel Banach Space (RKBS). This shows that the ${L}_p-$type RKBS provides a broad modeling framework for learnable function classes with controlled metric entropies. Our results shed new light on the power and limitations of kernel methods for learning complex function spaces.</description>

      <title>Robust Detection of Watermarks for Large Language Models Under Human Edits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13868v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Watermarking has offered an effective approach to distinguishing text generated by large language models (LLMs) from human-written text. However, the pervasive presence of human edits on LLM-generated text dilutes watermark signals, thereby significantly degrading detection performance of existing methods. In this paper, by modeling human edits through mixture model detection, we introduce a new method in the form of a truncated goodness-of-fit test for detecting watermarked text under human edits, which we refer to as Tr-GoF. We prove that the Tr-GoF test achieves optimality in robust detection of the Gumbel-max watermark in a certain asymptotic regime of substantial text modifications and vanishing watermark signals. Importantly, Tr-GoF achieves this optimality \textit{adaptively} as it does not require precise knowledge of human edit levels or probabilistic specifications of the LLMs, in contrast to the optimal but impractical (Neyman--Pearson) likelihood ratio test. Moreover, we establish that the Tr-GoF test attains the highest detection efficiency rate in a certain regime of moderate text modifications. In stark contrast, we show that sum-based detection rules, as employed by existing methods, fail to achieve optimal robustness in both regimes because the additive nature of their statistics is less resilient to edit-induced noise. Finally, we demonstrate the competitive and sometimes superior empirical performance of the Tr-GoF test on both synthetic data and open-source LLMs in the OPT and LLaMA families.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study learning and knowledge acquisition (LKA) of an agent about a proposition that is either true or false. We use a Bayesian approach, where the agent receives data to update his beliefs about the proposition according to a posterior distribution. The LKA is formulated in terms of active information, with data representing external or exogenous information that modifies the agent's beliefs. It is assumed that data provide details about a number of features that are relevant to the proposition. We show that this leads to a Gibbs distribution posterior, which is in maximum entropy relative to the prior, conditioned on the side constraints that the data provide in terms of the features. We demonstrate that full learning is sometimes not possible and full knowledge acquisition is never possible when the number of extracted features is too small. We also distinguish between primary learning (receiving data about features of relevance for the proposition) and secondary learning (receiving data about the learning of another agent). We argue that this type of secondary learning does not represent true knowledge acquisition. Our results have implications for statistical learning algorithms, and we claim that such algorithms do not always generate true knowledge. The theory is illustrated with several examples.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Diffusion Annealing-Based Bayesian Inverse Problem Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the ascendance of diffusion modeling as a state-of-the-art generative modeling approach has spurred significant interest in their use as priors in Bayesian inverse problems. However, it is unclear how to optimally integrate a diffusion model trained on the prior distribution with a given likelihood function to obtain posterior samples. While algorithms developed for this purpose can produce high-quality, diverse point estimates of the unknown parameters of interest, they are often tested on problems where the prior distribution is analytically unknown, making it difficult to assess their performance in providing rigorous uncertainty quantification. Motivated by this challenge, this work introduces three benchmark problems for evaluating the performance of diffusion model based samplers. The benchmark problems, which are inspired by problems in image inpainting, x-ray tomography, and phase retrieval, have a posterior density that is analytically known. In this setting, approximate ground-truth posterior samples can be obtained, enabling principled evaluation of the performance of posterior sampling algorithms. This work also introduces a general framework for diffusion model based posterior sampling, Bayesian Inverse Problem Solvers through Diffusion Annealing (BIPSDA). This framework unifies several recently proposed diffusion-model-based posterior sampling algorithms and contains novel algorithms that can be realized through flexible combinations of design choices. We tested the performance of a set of BIPSDA algorithms, including previously proposed state-of-the-art approaches, on the proposed benchmark problems. The results provide insight into the strengths and limitations of existing diffusion-model based posterior samplers, while the benchmark problems provide a testing ground for future algorithmic developments.</description>

      <title>Graphical Transformation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17845v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphical Transformation Models (GTMs) are introduced as a novel approach to effectively model multivariate data with intricate marginals and complex dependency structures semiparametrically, while maintaining interpretability through the identification of varying conditional independencies. GTMs extend multivariate transformation models by replacing the Gaussian copula with a custom-designed multivariate transformation, offering two major advantages. Firstly, GTMs can capture more complex interdependencies using penalized splines, which also provide an efficient regularization scheme. Secondly, we demonstrate how to approximately regularize GTMs towards pairwise conditional independencies using a lasso penalty, akin to Gaussian graphical models. The model's robustness and effectiveness are validated through simulations, showcasing its ability to accurately learn complex dependencies and identify conditional independencies. Additionally, the model is applied to a benchmark astrophysics dataset, where the GTM demonstrates favorable performance compared to non-parametric vine copulas in learning complex multivariate distributions.</description>

      <title>BinConv: A Neural Architecture for Ordinal Encoding in Time-Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24595v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work in time series forecasting has explored reformulating regression as a classification task. By discretizing the continuous target space into bins and predicting over a fixed set of classes, these approaches benefit from more stable training, improved uncertainty modeling, and compatibility with modern deep learning architectures. However, most existing methods rely on one-hot encoding, which ignores the inherent ordinal structure of the target values. As a result, they fail to convey information about the relative distance between predicted and true values during training. In this paper, we address this limitation by applying \textbf{Cumulative Binary Encoding} (CBE), a monotonic binary representation that transforms both model inputs and outputs. CBE implicitly preserves ordinal and magnitude information, allowing models to learn distance aware representations while operating within a classification framework. To leverage CBE effectively, we propose \textbf{BinConv}, a fully convolutional neural network architecture designed for probabilistic forecasting. We demonstrate that standard fully connected layers are not only less computationally efficient than convolutional layers when used with CBE, but also degrade forecasting performance. Our experiments on standard benchmark datasets show that BinConv achieves superior performance compared to widely used baselines in both point and probabilistic forecasting, while requiring fewer parameters and enabling faster training.</description>

      <title>General agents contain world models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01622v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Are world models a necessary ingredient for flexible, goal-directed behaviour, or is model-free learning sufficient? We provide a formal answer to this question, showing that any agent capable of generalizing to multi-step goal-directed tasks must have learned a predictive model of its environment. We show that this model can be extracted from the agent's policy, and that increasing the agents performance or the complexity of the goals it can achieve requires learning increasingly accurate world models. This has a number of consequences: from developing safe and general agents, to bounding agent capabilities in complex environments, and providing new algorithms for eliciting world models from agents.</description>

      <title>Vocoder-Projected Feature Discriminator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In text-to-speech (TTS) and voice conversion (VC), acoustic features, such as mel spectrograms, are typically used as synthesis or conversion targets owing to their compactness and ease of learning. However, because the ultimate goal is to generate high-quality waveforms, employing a vocoder to convert these features into waveforms and applying adversarial training in the time domain is reasonable. Nevertheless, upsampling the waveform introduces significant time and memory overheads. To address this issue, we propose a vocoder-projected feature discriminator (VPFD), which uses vocoder features for adversarial training. Experiments on diffusion-based VC distillation demonstrated that a pretrained and frozen vocoder feature extractor with a single upsampling step is necessary and sufficient to achieve a VC performance comparable to that of waveform discriminators while reducing the training time and memory consumption by 9.6 and 11.4 times, respectively.</description>
