      <title>OpenRANet: Neuralized Spectrum Access by Joint Subcarrier and Power Allocation with Optimization-based Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next-generation radio access network (RAN), known as Open RAN, is poised to feature an AI-native interface for wireless cellular networks, including emerging satellite-terrestrial systems, making deep learning integral to its operation. In this paper, we address the nonconvex optimization challenge of joint subcarrier and power allocation in Open RAN, with the objective of minimizing the total power consumption while ensuring users meet their transmission data rate requirements. We propose OpenRANet, an optimization-based deep learning model that integrates machine-learning techniques with iterative optimization algorithms. We start by transforming the original nonconvex problem into convex subproblems through decoupling, variable transformation, and relaxation techniques. These subproblems are then efficiently solved using iterative methods within the standard interference function framework, enabling the derivation of primal-dual solutions. These solutions integrate seamlessly as a convex optimization layer within OpenRANet, enhancing constraint adherence, solution accuracy, and computational efficiency by combining machine learning with convex analysis, as shown in numerical experiments. OpenRANet also serves as a foundation for designing resource-constrained AI-native wireless optimization strategies for broader scenarios like multi-cell systems, satellite-terrestrial networks, and future Open RAN deployments with complex power consumption requirements.</description>

      <title>The Asymptotic Behaviour of Information Leakage Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information theoretic leakage metrics quantify the amount of information about a private random variable $X$ that is leaked through a correlated revealed variable $Y$. They can be used to evaluate the privacy of a system in which an adversary, from whom we want to keep $X$ private, is given access to $Y$. Global information theoretic leakage metrics quantify the overall amount of information leaked upon observing $Y$, whilst their pointwise counterparts define leakage as a function of the particular realisation $y$ that the adversary sees, and thus can be viewed as random variables. We consider an adversary who observes a large number of independent identically distributed realisations of $Y$. We formalise the essential asymptotic behaviour of an information theoretic leakage metric, considering in turn what this means for pointwise and global metrics. With the resulting requirements in mind, we take an axiomatic approach to defining a set of pointwise leakage metrics, as well as a set of global leakage metrics that are constructed from them. The global set encompasses many known measures including mutual information, Sibson mutual information, Arimoto mutual information, maximal leakage, min entropy leakage, $f$-divergence metrics, and g-leakage. We prove that both sets follow the desired asymptotic behaviour. Finally, we derive composition theorems which quantify the rate of privacy degradation as an adversary is given access to a large number of independent observations of $Y$. It is found that, for both pointwise and global metrics, privacy degrades exponentially with increasing observations for the adversary, at a rate governed by the minimum Chernoff information between distinct conditional channel distributions. This extends the work of Wu et al. (2024), who have previously found this to be true for certain known metrics, including some that fall into our more general set.</description>

      <title>Generative Learning Powered Probing Beam Optimization for Cell-Free Hybrid Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probing beam measurement (PBM)-based hybrid beamforming provides a feasible solution for cell-free MIMO. In this letter, we propose a novel probing beam optimization framework where three collaborative modules respectively realize PBM augmentation, sum-rate prediction and probing beam optimization. Specifically, the PBM augmentation model integrates the conditional variational auto-encoder (CVAE) and mixture density networks and adopts correlated PBM distribution with full-covariance, for which a Cholesky-decomposition based training is introduced to address the issues of covariance legality and numerical stability. Simulations verify the better performance of the proposed augmentation model compared to the traditional CVAE and the efficiency of proposed optimization framework.</description>

      <title>Reduction of Sufficient Number of Code Tables of $k$-Bit Delay Decodable Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $k$-bit delay decodable code-tuple is a lossless source code that can achieve a smaller average codeword length than Huffman codes by using a finite number of code tables and allowing at most $k$-bit delay for decoding. It is known that there exists a $k$-bit delay decodable code-tuple with at most $2^{(2^k)}$ code tables that attains the optimal average codeword length among all the $k$-bit delay decodable code-tuples for any given i.i.d. source distribution. Namely, it suffices to consider only the code-tuples with at most $2^{(2^k)}$ code tables to accomplish optimality. In this paper, we propose a method to dramatically reduce the number of code tables to be considered in the theoretical analysis, code construction, and coding process.</description>

      <title>Knowledge-Based Ultra-Low-Latency Semantic Communications for Robotic Edge Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 6G mobile networks will feature the widespread deployment of AI algorithms at the network edge, which provides a platform for supporting robotic edge intelligence systems. In such a system, a large-scale knowledge graph (KG) is operated at an edge server as a "remote brain" to guide remote robots on environmental exploration or task execution. In this paper, we present a new air-interface framework targeting the said systems, called knowledge-based robotic semantic communications (SemCom), which consists of a protocol and relevant transmission techniques. First, the proposed robotic SemCom protocol defines a sequence of system operations for executing a given robotic task. They include identification of all task-relevant knowledge paths (KPs) on the KG, semantic matching between KG and object classifier, and uploading of robot's observations for objects recognition and feasible KP identification. Next, to support ultra-low-latency feature transmission (ULL-FT), we propose a novel transmission approach that exploits classifier's robustness, which is measured by classification margin, to compensate for a high bit error probability (BEP) resulting from ultra-low-latency transmission (e.g., short packet and/or no coding). By utilizing the tractable Gaussian mixture model, we derive the relation between BEP and classification margin, which sheds light on system requirements to support ULL-FT. Furthermore, for the case where the classification margin is insufficient for coping with channel distortion, we enhance the ULL-FT approach by studying retransmission and multi-view classification for enlarging the margin and further quantifying corresponding requirements. Finally, experiments using DNNs as classifier models and real datasets are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of ULL-FT in communication latency reduction while providing a guarantee on accurate feasible KP identification.</description>

      <title>Unsourced Sparse Multiple Access foUnsourced Sparse Multiple Access for 6G Massive Communicationr 6G Massive Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive communication is one of key scenarios of 6G where two magnitude higher connection density would be required to serve diverse services. As a promising direction, unsourced multiple access has been proved to outperform significantly over orthogonal multiple access (OMA) or slotted-ALOHA in massive connections. In this paper we describe a design framework of unsourced sparse multiple access (USMA) that consists of two key modules: compressed sensing for preamble generation, and sparse interleaver division multiple access (SIDMA) for main packet transmission. Simulation results of general design of USMA show that the theoretical bound can be approached within 1~1.5 dB by using simple channel codes like convolutional. To illustrate the scalability of USMA, a customized design for ambient Internet of Things (A-IoT) is proposed, so that much less memory and computation are required. Simulations results of Rayleigh fading and realistic channel estimation show that USMA based A-IoT solution can deliver nearly 4 times capacity and 6 times efficiency for random access over traditional radio frequency identification (RFID) technology.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) System Level Simulations for Industry Standards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is an emerging technology for wireless communications. In this paper, extensive system level simulations are conducted for analyzing the performance of multi-RIS and multi-base stations (BS) scenarios, by considering typical settings for industry standards. Pathloss and large-scale fading are taken into account when modeling the RIS cascaded link and direct link. The performance metrics are the downlink reference signal received power (RSRP) and the signal to interference noise ratio (SINR). The evaluation methodology is compatible with that utilized for technology studies in industry standards development organizations, by considering the uniqueness of RIS. The simulations are comprehensive, and they take into account different layouts of RIS panels and mobiles in a cell, and different densities and sizes of RIS panels. Several practical aspects are considered, including the interference between RIS panels, the phase quantization of RIS elements, and the failure of RIS elements. The near field effect of the RIS-mobile links is also analyzed as well. Simulation results demonstrate the potential of RIS-aided deployments in improving the system capacity and cell coverage in 6G mobile systems.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Deep Learning-Based CSI Feedback in Massive MIMO via ID-Photo-Inspired Preprocessing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL)-based channel state information (CSI) feedback has shown great potential in improving spectrum efficiency in massive MIMO systems. However, DL models optimized for specific environments often experience performance degradation in others due to model mismatch. To overcome this barrier in the practical deployment, we propose UniversalNet, an ID-photo-inspired universal CSI feedback framework that enhances model generalizability by standardizing the input format across diverse data distributions. Specifically, UniversalNet employs a standardized input format to mitigate the influence of environmental variability, coupled with a lightweight sparsity-aligning operation in the transformed sparse domain and marginal control bits for original format recovery. This enables seamless integration with existing CSI feedback models, requiring minimal modifications in preprocessing and postprocessing without updating neural network weights. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective eigenvector joint phase optimization technique to enhance the sparsity of the precoding matrix by reducing phase randomness, thus improving the implicit CSI compression efficiency. Test results demonstrate that UniversalNet effectively improves generalization and ensures precise CSI feedback, even in scenarios with limited training diversity and previously unseen CSI environments.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov-guided Deep Reinforcement Learning for Semantic-aware AoI Minimization in UAV-assisted Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted semantic network where the ground users (GUs) periodically capture and upload the sensing information to a base station (BS) via UAVs' relaying. Both the GUs and the UAVs can extract semantic information from large-size raw data and transmit it to the BS for recovery. Smaller-size semantic information reduces latency and improves information freshness, while larger-size semantic information enables more accurate data reconstruction at the BS, preserving the value of original information. We introduce a novel semantic-aware age-of-information (SAoI) metric to capture both information freshness and semantic importance, and then formulate a time-averaged SAoI minimization problem by jointly optimizing the UAV-GU association, the semantic extraction, and the UAVs' trajectories. We decouple the original problem into a series of subproblems via the Lyapunov framework and then use hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to solve each subproblem. Specifically, the UAV-GU association is determined by DRL, followed by the optimization module updating the semantic extraction strategy and UAVs' deployment. Simulation results show that the hierarchical structure improves learning efficiency. Moreover, it achieves low AoI through semantic extraction while ensuring minimal loss of original information, outperforming the existing baselines.</description>

      <title>CorBin-FL: A Differentially Private Federated Learning Mechanism using Common Randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising framework for distributed machine learning. It enables collaborative learning among multiple clients, utilizing distributed data and computing resources. However, FL faces challenges in balancing privacy guarantees, communication efficiency, and overall model accuracy. In this work, we introduce CorBin-FL, a privacy mechanism that uses correlated binary stochastic quantization to achieve differential privacy while maintaining overall model accuracy. The approach uses secure multi-party computation techniques to enable clients to perform correlated quantization of their local model updates without compromising individual privacy. We provide theoretical analysis showing that CorBin-FL achieves parameter-level local differential privacy (PLDP), and that it asymptotically optimizes the privacy-utility trade-off between the mean square error utility measure and the PLDP privacy measure. We further propose AugCorBin-FL, an extension that, in addition to PLDP, achieves user-level and sample-level central differential privacy guarantees. For both mechanisms, we derive bounds on privacy parameters and mean squared error performance measures. Extensive experiments on MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets demonstrate that our mechanisms outperform existing differentially private FL mechanisms, including Gaussian and Laplacian mechanisms, in terms of model accuracy under equal PLDP privacy budgets.</description>

      <title>MIMO Precoding Exploiting Extra Degrees of Freedom (DoF) in the Wavenumber Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an emerging wavenumber-domain precoding scheme to break the limitations of rank-1 channels that merely supports single-stream transmission, enabling simultaneous transmission of multiple data streams. The proposed wavenumber-domain precoding scheme also breaks the Rayleigh distance demarcation, regardless of the far-field and near-field contexts. Specifically, by characterizing the channel response as the superposition of a series of Fourier harmonics specified by different wavenumbers, the degree of freedom (DoF) is dependent on the cardinality of the wavenumber support, based on which the extra DoF is presented. This representation is applicable for both far-field and near-field. Different wavenumber atoms, determined within this support, constitute the codebook for MIMO precoding, in which each atom allows for the transmission of a data stream. Then, to maximize the capacity, it is required to select the wavenumbers associated with the optimal transmission direction, and optimize its power allocation. Finally, our simulation results demonstrate the significant superiority in comparison to the conventional spatial division schemes, with the potential of approaching the theoretical performance upper bound achieved by singular value decomposition (SVD).</description>

      <title>Error-Minimizing Measurements in Postselected One-Shot Symmetric Quantum State Discrimination and Acceptance as a Performance Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In hypothesis testing with quantum states, given a black box containing one of the two possible states, measurement is performed to detect in favor of one of the hypotheses. In postselected hypothesis testing, a third outcome is added, corresponding to not selecting any of the hypotheses. In postselected scenario, minimum error one-shot symmetric hypothesis testing is characterized in literature conditioned on the fact that one of the selected outcomes occur. We proceed further in this direction to give the set of all possible measurements that lead to the minimum error. We have given an arbitrary error-minimizing measurement in a parametric form. Note that not selecting any of the hypotheses decimates the quality of testing. We further give an example to show that these measurements vary in quality. There is a need to discuss the quality of postselected hypothesis testing. We then characterize the quality of postselected hypothesis testing by defining a new metric acceptance and give expression of acceptance for an arbitrary error-minimizing measurement in terms of some parameters of the measurement. On the set of measurements that achieve minimum error, we have maximized the acceptance, and given an example which achieves that, thus giving an example of the best possible measurement in terms of acceptance.</description>

      <title>On binomial Weil sums and a application</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime and $N$ be a positive integer not divisible by $p$. Denote by ${\rm ord}_N(p)$ the multiplicative order of $p$ modulo $N$. Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ be the finite field of order $q$ with $q=p^{{\rm ord}_N(p)}$. For $a, b\in\mathbb{F}_q$, define a binomial exponential sum by $$S_N(a,b):=\sum_{x\in\mathbb{F}_q\setminus\{0\}}\chi(ax^{\frac{q-1}{N}}+bx),$$ where $\chi$ is the canonical additive character of $\mathbb{F}_q$. In 2009, Moisio provided an explicit evaluation of $S_{\wp^m}(a,b)$ for $p=2$ in [Finite fields Appl. \textbf{15} (2009), 644-651] if ${\rm ord}_{\wp^m}(2)=\phi(\wp^m)$, where $\wp$ is an odd prime, $m$ is a positive integer and $\phi$ denotes the Euler phi function. In 2019, under certain conditions, a result in [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory \textbf{65} (2019), 3304-3314] extended the evaluation result of Moisio to odd characteristics. In this paper, the binomial exponential sum $S_N(a,b)$ is explicitly evaluated for any odd prime $p$ and any positive integer $N$ whenever ${\rm ord}_{N}(p)=\phi(N)$. The results are not based on any conditions and our method is elementary and straightforward. As an application, a class of ternary linear codes is constructed and its weight distribution is settled. Furthermore, it is proved that the dual codes are optimal with respect to the sphere packing bound. This extends the results in [IEEE Commun. Lett. \textbf{19} (2015), 1097-1100] of even characteristics to that of odd characteristics.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the barycenter problem in optimal transportation theory, Kolesnikov--Werner recently extended the notion of the Legendre duality relation for two functions to the case for multiple functions. We further generalize the duality relation and then establish the centered Gaussian saturation property for a Blaschke--Santal\'{o} type inequality associated with it. Our approach to the understanding such a generalized Legendre duality relation is based on our earlier observation that directly links Legendre duality with the inverse Brascamp--Lieb inequality. More precisely, for a large family of degenerate Brascamp--Lieb data, we prove that the centered Gaussian saturation property for the inverse Brascamp--Lieb inequality holds true when inputs are restricted to even and log-concave functions.
  As an application to convex geometry, our result particularly confirms a special case of a conjecture of Kolesnikov and Werner about the Blaschke--Santal\'{o} inequality for multiple even functions as well as multiple symmetric convex bodies. Furthermore, in the direction of information theory and optimal transportation theory, this establishes a Talagrand type inequality for multiple even probability measures that involves the Wasserstein barycenter and generalizes the symmetric Talagrand transportation-cost inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.05776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the rough topology and the core to numerical data by classifying objects in terms of the attribute values. A new approach to finding the core for numerical data is discussed. Then a measurement to find whether an attribute is in the core or not is given. This new method for finding the core is used for attribute reduction. It is tested and compared by using eight different machine-learning algorithms. Also, it is discussed how this material is used to rank the importance of attributes in data classification. Finally, the algorithms and codes to convert data to pertinent data and to find the core is also provided.</description>

      <title>Linear complementary pairs of skew constacyclic codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear complementary pairs (LCPs) of codes have been studied since they were introduced in the context of discussing mitigation measures against possible hardware attacks to integrated circuits. Since the security parameters for LCPs of codes are defined from the (Hamming) distance and the dual distance of the codes in the pair, and the additional algebraic structure of skew constacyclic codes provides tools for studying the dual and the distance of a code, we study the properties of LCPs of skew constacyclic codes. As a result, we give a characterization for those pairs, as well as multiple results that lead to constructing pairs with designed security parameters. We extend skew BCH codes to a constacyclic context and show that an LCP of codes can be immediately constructed from a skew BCH constacyclic code. Additionally, we describe a Hamming weight-preserving automorphism group in the set of skew constacyclic codes, which can be used for constructing LCPs of codes.</description>

      <title>Spatially Non-Stationary XL-MIMO Channel Estimation: A Three-Layer Generalized Approximate Message Passing Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, channel estimation problem for extremely large-scale multi-input multi-output (XL-MIMO) systems is investigated with the considerations of the spherical wavefront effect and the spatially non-stationary (SnS) property. Due to the diversities of SnS characteristics among different propagation paths, the concurrent channel estimation of multiple paths becomes intractable. To address this challenge, we propose a two-phase channel estimation scheme. In the first phase, the angles of departure (AoDs) on the user side are estimated, and a carefully designed pilot transmission scheme enables the decomposition of the received signal from different paths. In the second phase, the subchannel estimation corresponding to different paths is formulated as a three-layer Bayesian inference problem. Specifically, the first layer captures block sparsity in the angular domain, the second layer promotes SnS property in the antenna domain, and the third layer decouples the subchannels from the observed signals. To efficiently facilitate Bayesian inference, we propose a novel three-layer generalized approximate message passing (TL-GAMP) algorithm based on structured variational massage passing and belief propagation rules. Simulation results validate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, showcasing its robustness to different channel scenarios.</description>

      <title>Molecular Arithmetic Coding (MoAC) and Optimized Molecular Prefix Coding (MoPC$^{*}$) for Diffusion-Based Molecular Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04672v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular communication (MC) enables information transfer through molecules at the nano-scale. This paper presents new and optimized source coding (data compression) methods for MC. In a recent paper, prefix source coding was introduced into the field, through an MC-adapted version of the Huffman coding. We first show that while MC-adapted Huffman coding improves symbol error rate (SER), it does not always produce an optimal prefix codebook in terms of coding length and power. To address this, we propose optimal molecular prefix coding (MoPC$^*$). The major finding of this paper is the Molecular Arithmetic Coding (MoAC), which differs significantly from classical arithmetic coding (AC) and is designed to mitigate inter-symbol-interference, a major issue in MC. However, MoAC's unique decodability is limited by bit precision. Accordingly, a uniquely-decodable new coding scheme named Molecular Arithmetic with Prefix Coding (MoAPC) is introduced. On two nucleotide alphabets, we show that MoAPC has a better compression performance than MoPC$^*$. Simulation results show that MoAPC achieves superior word error rate (WER) and SER compared to AC and SAC (our trivial adaptation of AC for MC). On the first alphabet, MoAPC outperforms all compared methods in WER and asymptotically in SER, while MoPC$^*$ outperforms all in both SER and WER on the second alphabet.</description>

      <title>Integrated Communication, Navigation, and Remote Sensing in LEO Networks with Vehicular Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditionally, communication, navigation, and remote sensing (CNR) satellites are separately performed, leading to resource waste, information isolation, and independent optimization for each functionality. Taking future automated driving as an example, it faces great challenges in providing high-reliable and low-latency lane-level positioning, decimeter-level transportation observation, and huge traffic sensing information downloading. To this end, this article proposes an integrated CNR (ICNR) framework based on low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite mega-constellations. After introducing the main working principles of the CNR functionalities to serve as the technological basis, we characterize the potentials of the integration gain in vehicular use cases. Then, we investigate the ICNR framework in different integration levels, which sheds strong light on qualitative performance improvement by sophisticatedly sharing orbit constellation, wireless resource, and data information towards meeting the requirements of vehicular applications. We also instantiate a fundamental numerical case study to demonstrate the integration gain and highlight possible future research directions in managing the ICNR networks.</description>

      <title>Identification over Permutation Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09309v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study message identification over a q-ary uniform permutation channel, where the transmitted vector is permuted by a permutation chosen uniformly at random. For discrete memoryless channels(DMCs), the number of identifiable messages grows doubly exponentially. Identification capacity, the maximum second-order exponent, is known to be the same as the Shannon capacity of the DMC. Permutation channels support reliable communication of only polynomially many messages. A simple achievability result shows that message sizes growing as 2^{\epsilon_nn^{q-1}} are identifiable for any \epsilon_n\rightarrow0. We prove two converse results. A ``soft'' converse shows that for any R&gt;0, there is no sequence of identification codes with message size growing as 2^{Rn^{q-1}} with a power-law decay (n^{-\mu}) of the error probability. We also prove a ``strong" converse showing that for any sequence of identification codes with message size 2^{R_n n^{q-1}}, where R_n\rightarrow\infty, the sum of type I and type II error probabilities approaches at least 1 as n\rightarrow\infty. To prove the soft converse, we use a sequence of steps to construct a new identification code with a simpler structure which relates to a set system, and then use a lower bound on the normalized maximum pairwise intersection of a set system. To prove the strong converse, we use results on approximation of distributions. The achievability and converse results are generalized to the case of coding over multiple blocks. We finally study message identification over a q-ary uniform permutation channel in the presence of causal block-wise feedback from the receiver, where the encoder receives an entire n-length received block after the transmission of the block is complete. We show that in the presence of feedback, the maximum number of identifiable messages grows doubly exponentially, and we present a two-phase achievability scheme.</description>

      <title>High Perceptual Quality Wireless Image Delivery with Denoising Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the image transmission problem over a noisy wireless channel via deep learning-based joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) along with a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) at the receiver. Specifically, we are interested in the perception-distortion trade-off in the practical finite block length regime, in which separate source and channel coding can be highly suboptimal. We introduce a novel scheme, where the conventional DeepJSCC encoder targets transmitting a lower resolution version of the image, which later can be refined thanks to the generative model available at the receiver. In particular, we utilize the range-null space decomposition of the target image; DeepJSCC transmits the range-space of the image, while DDPM progressively refines its null space contents. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate significant improvements in distortion and perceptual quality of reconstructed images compared to standard DeepJSCC and the state-of-the-art generative learning-based method.</description>

      <title>An Extended ADMM for 3-Block Nonconvex Nonseparable Problems with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02193v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a 3-block Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) for solving nonconvex nonseparable problems with a linear constraint. Inspired by \cite[Sun, Toh and Yang, \textit{SIAM Journal on Optimization}, 25 (2015), pp.882-915]{wtwice}, the proposed ADMM follows the Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) cycle order $1\to 3\to 2\to 3$. We analyze its convergence based on the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz property. We also discuss two useful extensions of the proposed ADMM with $2\to 3\to 1\to 3$ Gauss-Seidel BCD cycle order, and with adding a proximal term for more general nonseparable problems, respectively. Moreover, we make numerical experiments on two nonconvex problems: robust principal component analysis and nonnegative matrix completion. Results show the efficiency and outperformance of the proposed ADMM.</description>
