      <title>White Dwarf Merger Remnants with Cooling Delays on the Q Branch Lack Strong Magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A population of anomalous ultra-massive white dwarfs discovered with Gaia, often referred to as the Q branch, show high (multi-Gyr) cooling delays produced by exotic physical mechanisms. They are believed to be the products of stellar mergers, but the exact origin and formation channel remain unclear. We obtained a spectroscopically complete, volume-limited sample of the Q branch region within 100 pc, and found significant differences in atmospheric composition and rotation rates as a function of tangential velocity. In particular, we discover that stellar remnants with the longest cooling delays do not show strong magnetism nor detectable short-period rotational variability, as opposed to what is generally believed for double-degenerate mergers. This indicates that either these white dwarfs arise from a formation channel with no strong magnetism induced, or that the magnetism produced from the merger dissipates over the cooling delay timescales. Our follow-up photometry has also discovered pulsations in the second and third hydrogen-dominated DAQ white dwarfs, one hotter than 15,500 K, possibly extending the boundaries of the DAV instability strip for white dwarfs with thin hydrogen layers.</description>

      <title>Time Lag between Accretion and Wind Events in the T Tauri Star RY Tau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The results of spectroscopic and photometric monitoring of the classical T Tauri star RY Tau are presented. The observation series span 220 nights from 2013 to 2024. During the observation period, the star's brightness varied within the range of V=9-11 mag. The rotation axis of the "star + accretion disk" system is tilted at a large angle, so the line of sight intersects the wind region and accreting flows in the star's magnetosphere. Variability in the short-wavelength wing of the Halpha emission line and the profile of the D NaI resonance doublet are analyzed. It is shown that the wind and accretion flows vary on a time scale of approximately 20 days. When the predominant flow direction changes, a time lag is observed: initially, accretion increases, and after two days, absorption in the line-of-sight wind decreases. It is concluded that the spectral line profiles are formed in the magnetospheric accretion flows and the conical wind originating from the boundary of the star's magnetosphere. The time lag is determined by the tilt of the magnetic dipole and the opening angle of the conical wind. It is assumed that RY Tau operates in an unstable propeller mode, and fluctuations in the accretion and wind flows are caused by density waves in the accretion disk.</description>

      <title>Ca ii 854.2 nm in an enhanced network region simulated with MURaM-ChE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ca ii 854.2 nm line is widely used to study the chromosphere of the Sun. In the quiet Sun, the spatially averaged line profile shows a red asymmetry and a redshift of the line center. It is known that the effect of isotopic splitting must be taken into account in the forward modeling to reproduce the observed asymmetry. So far, no numerical model could match an average observed line profile in terms of the line width and asymmetry. Our goal is to investigate how well a simulation computed with the chromospheric extension of the MURaM code (MURaM-ChE) reproduces the spatially averaged Ca ii 854.2 nm line profile. We aim to determine the contributions from the isotopic splitting versus the dynamics in the atmosphere to the resulting line width and asymmetry. We solve the radiative transfer problem three times, once considering only the most abundant isotope of calcium in the atmosphere, once taking six calcium isotopes into account, and finally using a single composite atom model. We find the forward modeled spatially and temporally averaged spectra to be in good agreement with an average observation of the quiet Sun. In order to match the observed line width, the simulated atmosphere must be sufficiently dynamic. The typical red asymmetry can only be reproduced by taking the isotopic splitting effect into account, as suggested in the literature.</description>

      <title>Validating the Angular Sizes of Red Clump Stars with Intensity Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surface-brightness-color (SBC) relationship for Red Clump stars provides a critical foundation for precision distance ladder measurements, including the 1\% distance determination to the Large Magellanic Cloud. Current SBC calibrations rely on angular diameter measurements of nearby Red Clump stars obtained through long-baseline optical interferometry using the Very Large Telescope Interferometer. We explore the application of intensity interferometry to measure limb-darkened angular diameters of Red Clump stars, offering a complementary approach to traditional amplitude interferometry. We describe the framework for extracting angular diameters from squared visibility measurements in intensity interferometry, accounting for limb darkening through the stellar atmosphere models. For the Red Clump star HD~17652, we show that intensity interferometry in the $H$ band at baselines matching PIONIER ($\sim$100~m) could achieve $&lt;1$\% angular size uncertainties in 2-hour exposures by measuring the primary peak of the visibility function, enabling direct comparison with existing measurements. Critically, observations at shorter wavelengths probe the secondary visibility maximum, providing independent checks of both measurement and systematic errors that are largely insensitive to limb-darkening assumptions. Exploiting the multiplex advantage of simultaneous multi-bandpass observations and the large number of baselines available with telescope arrays such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory can reduce observing times to practical levels, making intensity interferometry a viable tool for validating the angular sizes for a subset of the Red Clump star calibration sample.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Tachocline using Inversion of Rotational Splitting Derived from Fitting Very Long and Long Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use rotation splittings derived from very long and long time series, namely 25.2, 12.6 and 6.3 year long, computed by Korzennik (2023) independent methodology to characterize the solar tachocline and its variation with latitude and time. We use two different inversion methodologies and a model of the tachocline to derive its position, width and the amplitude of the radial shear. To validate our methodology we present results from simulated rotational splittings, whether including or not random noise commensurable with the current observational precision. We also describe how we leverage the fact that one of our methodologies uses an initial guess that can be chosen to include a priori information. In order to try to resolve the tachocline, we increased the radial density of the inversion grid and showed how it affect the inferences. We also show how the trade off between smoothing and noise magnification affects these, as well as the effectiveness of using an informed initial guess. Results derived from high-precision rotational splittings show clearly that the location of the tachocline at low latitudes is different for its position at high latitudes. The latitudinal variation of its width is not significantly constrained, but our results agree with estimates based on forward modeling. When using splittings derived from somewhat shorter time series, we find temporal variations that are neither definitive nor significant, since we see systematic differences when using different methodologies.</description>

      <title>FORGE'd in the Early Universe: The Effect of Protostellar Outflows on Pop III Accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a cosmological zoom-in radiation magneto-hydrodynamic (RMHD) simulation, using FORGE'd in FIRE, that follows the formation, growth, and evolution of a single metal-free Pop. III (proto)star at redshift $z \sim 14$. The simulation captures a rotationally supported circumstellar disk and protostellar jets, both resolved down to $&lt;100$ au scales. We find the star grows to $\sim 27$ M$_{\odot}$ over $31,000$ years, with its final mass regulated by accretion and protostellar jets. Protostellar jets form because the magnetic mass-to-flux ratio lies within the regime that allows jet launching, and they are further enabled by a rotating circumstellar disk with sufficient gas-magnetic-field coupling, both present in this simulation. These jets regulate accretion onto the (proto)star and drive outflows that collide with infalling gas, slowing inflow at large radii due to the substantial momentum they carry. A circumstellar disk forms, extending out to $\sim 0.01$ pc, which remains gravitationally stable (Q $\gg 1$). The stability of the disk is maintained through both thermal support and turbulence. In this paper we focus on how jets play a critical role not only in shaping the final masses of Pop. III stars but also in directly influencing their surroundings by regulating accretion. These results will provide important insights into the initial mass function and feedback processes in the earliest star-forming regions of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Periodic 6.7 GHz $\mathrm{CH_3OH}$ maser emission in G353.273+0.641: First candidate for a pulsating high-mass protostar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the periodic flux variations in the 6.7 GHz $\mathrm{CH_3OH}$ maser associated with the high-mass protostar G353.273+0.641, based on 13 yr of monitoring mainly by the Hitachi 32 m telescope. We identified a periodicity of 309 days based on a nearly complete light curve, with 833 epochs every few days. A strong correlation is found between the maser and the mid-infrared fluxes at 3.4 and 4.6 $\mu$m observed by NEOWISE during these periods, suggesting that the maser emission responds to variations in the protostellar luminosity. The average profile of the maser light curve is asymmetric and shows a steep drop in intensity just before the brightening, resembling that of some pulsating variable stars. Assuming a protostellar pulsation as the origin of maser periodicity, the observed period implies a cool and highly bloated, red supergiant-like structure. Such a bloated structure is consistent with a theoretical model of protostellar evolution under high accretion rates. The inferred protostellar parameters are broadly consistent with the theoretical model of pulsational instability during the early phase of high-mass star formation. However, a periodic accretion scenario caused by an unresolved compact protobinary cannot be completely ruled out. Several irregular peaks that deviate from the periodicity may result from episodic accretion phenomena or jet-launching events independent of the protostellar pulsation. Extremely high-resolution imaging with next-generation interferometers such as the ngVLA will provide a conclusive test for both the protostellar pulsation and the binary accretion scenarios.</description>

      <title>A surprisingly large asymmetric ejection from Mira A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars with masses between roughly 1 and 8~$M_\odot$ end their lives on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), when intense mass loss takes place. The outflows are generally accepted to be driven by radiation pressure acting on dust grains that form in the dense extended atmospheres created by the action of convection and stellar pulsations. The complex physics underlying convection, stellar pulsations, and dust nucleation precludes predicting AGB mass loss from first principles. We investigated the evolution of two lobes observed to be expanding away from the AGB star Mira~A using images of polarized light obtained at six epochs using SPHERE on the VLT and of molecular emission at two epochs obtained with ALMA. While dust seems confined to the edges of the lobes, gas fills the lobes and displays higher densities than expected at the observed radii based on the large-scale mass-loss rate of Mira~A, with a total gas mass in the lobes of $\sim 2 \times 10^{-5}~M_\odot$. We find the expansion of the lobes to be consistent with both a constant velocity (ejection time in 2010 or 2011) or a decelerating expansion (ejection time in 2012). If ejection events with a similar magnitude happen periodically, we derive periods between 50 and 200~years to account for the mass-loss rate of Mira~A. This periodicity is uncertain because the average mass-loss rate of Mira A on larger scales is uncertain. We find abundances in the lobes of $\sim 1.5 \times 10^{-6}$ and $\sim 2.5 \times 10^{-6}$ for SO and SO$_2$, respectively, and of $2\times10^{-10}$, $6.5\times10^{-10}$, and $4\times10^{-7}$ for AlO, AlF, and PO. The strong variation in brightness of the different features identified in the polarized-light images is puzzling. We suggest that an asymmetric stellar radiation field preferentially illuminates specific regions of the circumstellar envelope at a given time, producing a lighthouse-like effect.</description>

      <title>Similarities and differences between solar and stellar flare pulsation processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) are oscillatory signatures commonly detected in the light curves of solar and stellar flares, offering valuable diagnostics of the underlying magnetic and plasma processes. This review compares the observational characteristics, detection methods, and physical interpretations of QPPs in both solar and stellar contexts. Solar flare QPPs, extensively studied in X-rays and EUV bands using instruments such as GOES, STIX, and Fermi, display typical periods of tens of seconds and show correlations with flare duration and magnetic loop length. Stellar QPPs, observed in X-rays and white light by missions such as Kepler, TESS, and XMM-Newton, exhibit much longer periods - ranging from minutes to hours - consistent with larger-scale magnetic structures in more active stars. Despite differences in scale and observing band, statistical and comparative studies reveal common scaling relations and damping behaviors, suggesting that both solar and stellar QPPs are manifestations of the same fundamental mechanisms, likely magnetohydrodynamic oscillations or oscillatory reconnection within flare loops. The comparison underscores a continuity between solar and stellar magnetic activity, linking the solar detailed physical processes to stellar-scale phenomena and providing constraints for future models and surveys.</description>

      <title>Post-impulsive millimeter emission of the 2022-05-04 solar flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work aims at analyzing the nature of millimeter (mm) emission observed during the post-impulsive phase of the solar flare SOL2022-05-04T08:45 (M5.7), detected by the RT-7.5 radio telescope of the Bauman Moscow State Technical University at 93 GHz. We investigate the relationship of mm and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission with variations in the temperature and coronal plasma emission measure obtained from SDO/AIA and GOES data. The results show that the enhanced mm emission at the post-impulsive phase of the flare coincides with the increase of EUV emission, indicating a connection with moderately hot (~1 MK) plasma. Based on the calculation of the differential emission measure, we determine the parameters of the post-impulsive flare plasma and conclude that the optically thin coronal plasma may contribute of about 20% to the mm emission.</description>

      <title>Light-Curve and Spectral Properties of Type II Supernovae from the ATLAS survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type II supernovae (SNe II) are the most common terminal stellar explosions in the Universe. With SNe now being detected within days after explosion, there is growing evidence that the majority of Type II SNe show signs of interaction with a confined, dense cirumstellar material (CSM) in the first few days post explosion. In this work we aim to bridge the gap between single SN studies showing early-time interaction in their spectra, and the statistical studies of early-time SN light curves, which imply the existence of CSM. We present a sample of 68 Type II SNe with both early photometric data, obtained with the ATLAS survey, and spectroscopic data, obtained with the ePESSTO+ collaboration. A subset of the sample is classified based on the presence or absence of narrow spectral features with electron-scattered broadened wings in the early spectra, indicative of interaction with CSM. We characterise the photometric and spectroscopic properties of the sample by measuring rise times to maximum light, peak magnitudes, decline rates and line velocities. Additionally, we measure the ratio of absorption to emission (a/e) of the H alpha P-Cygni profile. Our analysis reveals that SNe II showing early spectroscopic signs of interaction with CSM decline faster and are brighter than those without. However no difference is found in rise times between the two groups. A clear separation is observed in the a/e ratio: SNe with signs of interaction exhibit lower a/e ratios at all epochs compared to those without. Our results highlight that understanding SN II ejecta-CSM interaction requires large, uniform samples of photometric and spectroscopic data, such as the one presented in this work.</description>

      <title>The Tarantula Massive Binary Monitoring VII. On the nature of the eccentric O+BH binary candidate VFTS 812</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive O-type stars ($M\gtrsim15\,M_\odot$) with an X-ray quiet black hole (BH) companion represent a crucial stage in massive binary evolution leading to binary BH mergers. The population of such binaries remains elusive, with $\lesssim5$ candidate or confirmed systems. The Tarantula nebula harbors thousands of massive stars, 2-3 % of which are expected to have BH companions. It is therefore an ideal place to hunt for such systems. Here we analyse 30 epochs of VLT/FLAMES IFU high-resolution observations of the H$\delta$ region, as well as archival FLAMES spectroscopy, of VFTS 812, a 17-day single-lined spectroscopic binary with an O4V primary and a minimum secondary mass of $5.1\,M_\odot$. Following careful removal of the nebular contamination, spectral disentangling on the new data did not reveal any signature of the hidden companion. We derive $T_\mathrm{eff}=49^{+3}_{-4}$ kK, $\log L/L_\odot=5.7\pm0.1$ and $v_\mathrm{rot,max}{\rm \,sin\,}i=110^{+25}_{-35}$ km/s for the O4V component, yielding a (single star) evolutionary mass of $53^{+6}_{-5}$ $M_\odot$ and an age in the range of 0-1.6 Myr. Using injection tests of various luminous artificial companions in our data, we exhaustively rule out the presence of any luminous signature from a main sequence star more massive than $6\,M_\odot$. We discuss the possible nature of the companion, suggesting that the rejuvenated O star + BH companion is the most suitable scenario to consistently explain the location, (rejuvenated) young age, eccentricity and lack of companion signature. While this establishes VFTS 812 as a strong candidate O+BH system, follow-up observations are deemed necessary for robust confirmation and to search for accretion signatures on the O4V star.</description>

      <title>Temporal variations of solar inertial mode parameters from GONG (2002--2024) and HMI (2010--2024): Rossby modes ($3 \leq m \leq 16 $) and $m=1$ high-latitude mode</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the temporal evolution of solar inertial modes over the solar cycle using observations from GONG and SDO/HMI. We focus on the high-latitude mode with azimuthal wavenumber $m=1$ and the equatorial Rossby modes with $3 \le m \le 16$. We use maps of horizontal flows near the solar surface from the GONG and HMI ring-diagram pipelines at a cadence of approximately one day, covering the period 2002--2024. The data are divided into overlapping four-year windows, with central times separated by six months. Within each time window and for each inertial mode, we measure the frequency and the power of the mode from the GONG and HMI data. We find good agreement between the GONG and HMI measurements throughout their overlapping period from 2010 to 2024. In general, the magnitude of the frequency variations increases with increasing $m$, while relative changes in mode power typically exceed 100\%. For the $m=1$ high-latitude mode, the measured power is anti-correlated with the sunspot number, while its frequency shows no significant temporal variation. For the equatorial Rossby modes, the frequencies are generally anti-correlated with the sunspot number, whereas the mode powers tend to correlate positively with the sunspot number. An exception is the $m=3$ equatorial Rossby mode, whose mode power is strongly anti-correlated with the sunspot number, in contrast to the other equatorial Rossby modes, highlighting its distinct behavior. We find that the frequencies and power of the Sun's inertial modes exhibit significant variability on solar-cycle timescales over the past 23 years. The mode parameters are however not uniformly synchronized with the sunspot number; clear differences are observed both from mode to mode and from one solar cycle to the next. The sensitivity of inertial modes to solar-cycle changes indicates their potential as a diagnostic of solar interior dynamics and magnetism.</description>

      <title>Structure and Evolution of Multi-Cluster within Galactic Disc: Gaia DR3 Insights into Eight Open Clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of the structural, astrophysical, and dynamical properties of eight open clusters: NGC 559, NGC 1817, NGC 2141, NGC 7245, Ruprecht 15, Ruprecht 137, Ruprecht 142, and Ruprecht 169, using precise astrometric and photometric data from Gaia Data Release 3. By fitting the King model to the radial density profiles, we determined the structural parameters of the clusters, including core and limiting radii, which were found to range from 3.07 to 16.21 arcmin and from 9.97 to 25.97 arcmin, respectively. Fundamental astrophysical parameters were derived by fitting PARSEC isochrones to the colour-magnitude diagrams. The results show that the clusters have logarithmic ages between 7.95 and 9.34, metallicities in the range 0.007 to 0.015, and heliocentric distances between 1640 and 5203 pc. The total stellar masses of the clusters were estimated to lie between 257 and 1916 solar masses. For most of the clusters, the mass function slopes are consistent with the Salpeter initial mass function. Our dynamical analysis indicates that all clusters, except Ruprecht 15, are dynamically relaxed. In addition, the spatial distribution and the bimodal structure observed in the radial density profile of NGC 7245 provide strong evidence that this object is a binary cluster candidate. Finally, kinematic analysis and orbit integrations demonstrate that all clusters exhibit dynamical properties fully consistent with membership in the Galactic thin disc.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Brown Dwarf Desert: Four New Discoveries and a Unifying, Period-Coded Picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present four newly validated transiting brown dwarfs identified through TESS photometry and confirmed with high-precision radial velocity measurements obtained from the FEROS and PLATOSpec spectrographs. Notably, three of these companions exhibit orbital periods exceeding 100 days, thereby expanding the sample of long-period transiting brown dwarfs from two to five systems. The host stars of long-period brown dwarfs show mild subsolar metallicity. These discoveries highlight the expansion of the metal-poor, long-period distribution and help us better understand the brown dwarf desert. In our comparative analysis of eccentricity and metallicity demographics, we utilize catalogues of long-period giant planets, brown dwarfs, and low-mass stellar companions. After accounting for tidal influences, the eccentricity distribution aligns with that of low-mass stellar binaries, presenting a different profile than that observed within the giant planet population. Additionally, the metallicity of the host stars reveals a noteworthy trend: short-period transiting brown dwarfs are predominantly associated with metal-rich stars, whereas long-period brown dwarfs are more often found around metal-poor stars, demonstrating statistical similarities to low-mass stellar hosts. This trend has also been previously observed in studies of hot and cold Jupiters and points to a period-coded mixture of channels. A natural explanation is that most brown dwarfs originate from fragmentation at wider separations, with long-period systems retaining this stellar-like imprint, while only those embedded in massive, long-lived, metal-rich protoplanetary discs are efficiently delivered and stabilised to short orbits.</description>

      <title>Direct power spectral density estimation from structure functions without Fourier transforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Second-order structure functions and power spectral densities are popular tools in the study of statistical properties across scales, particularly for the analysis of turbulent flows. Although intimately related, analyses primarily use one or the other. We introduce a framework for estimating the power spectrum using the second-order structure function without applying Fourier transforms -- enabling one to take advantage of the real-space structure function calculations. We validate and showcase this method, comparing it to classical Fourier power spectrum estimates determined from analytical calculations, fractional Brownian motion, turbulence simulations, and space-physics and astrophysical observations of turbulence. We show that this method is able to robustly obtain the expected power law behaviour where we use turbulence ranges as test-cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine Gaia Data Release 3 and artificial intelligence to enhance the current statistics of substellar companions, particularly within regions of the orbital period vs. mass parameter space that remain poorly constrained by the radial velocity and transit detection methods. Using supervised learning, we train a deep neural network to recognise the characteristic distribution of the fit quality statistics corresponding to a Gaia DR3 astrometric solution for a non single star. We generate a deep learning model, ExoDNN, which predicts the probability of a DR3 source to host unresolved companions based on those fit quality statistics. Applying the predictive capability of ExoDNN to a volume limited sample of F,G,K and M stars from Gaia DR3, we have produced a list of 7414 candidate stars hosting companions. The stellar properties of these candidates, such as their mass and metallicity, are similar to those of the Gaia DR3 non single star sample. We also identify synergies with future observatories, such as PLATO, and we propose a follow up strategy with the intention of investigating the most promising candidates among those samples.</description>

      <title>The asymmetric structure of the inner disc around HD 142527 A with VLTI/MATISSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Circumstellar discs, and especially their inner regions, covering ranges from &lt;1 au to a few astronomical units, are the birthplaces of terrestrial planets. The inner regions are thought to be similarly diverse in structure as the well-observed outer regions probed by ALMA. Combining data and results from previous studies of the VLTI/PIONIER and VLTI/GRAVITY instruments with new, multi-epoch VLTI/MATISSE observations, we aim to provide a comprehensive picture of the structure of the inner regions of the circumstellar disc around the F-type Herbig Ae/Be star HD 142527 A, the primary of a binary star system. We model the multi-wavelength interferometric data using a parametrised, geometrically thin disc model, allowing for azimuthal asymmetry, exploring a first-order disc modulation and an off-centre Gaussian component. We find time-variable structures in the N-band observables, which we reproduce with time-dependent models. This variability manifests as azimuthally asymmetric emission, evidenced by strong, non-zero closure phases in the N-band data. Fits to individual epochs of the N-band observations yield better $\chi^2_\text{r}$ values than fits to all epochs simultaneously. This suggests substantial changes in the geometry of the inner disc emission from ~1 au up to a few astronomical-unit scales from one year to the next. Moreover, our models produce a very close-in inner disc rim $R_\text{rim}\approx0.1$ au. All together, we find a very complex, substantially non-point symmetric and temporally-variable disc ($r_\text{out}\lesssim6$ au) around the primary. The very close-in inner rim indicates the presence of material inside the typical wall-like sublimation radius $R_\text{rim,literature}\approx0.3$ au. The complex, temporally variable inner-disc geometry is likely affected or even caused by the close passing (~5 au) and short orbit ($P\approx24$ yr) of the companion HD 142527 B.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the dynamics of Young Stellar Objects: Time-Domain Interferometry with six 4-m class telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of the inner regions of young stellar objects (YSOs) is driven by a variety of physical phenomena, from magnetospheres and accretion to the dust sublimation rim and inner disk flows. These inner environments evolve on timescales of hours to days, exactly when bursts, dips, and rapid structural changes carry the most valuable information about star and planet formations, but remain hardly reachable with current facilities. A better reactive infrastructure with six or more telescopes, combined with alerts from large time-domain surveys (e.g., at the era of LSST/Rubin type facilities), and equipped with instruments spanning from the V-band to the thermal infrared (N), would provide the instantaneous uv-coverage and spectral diagnostics needed to unambiguously interpret and image these events as they happen. Such a world's first time-domain interferometric observatory would enable qualitatively new science: directly linking optical and infrared variability to spatially resolved changes in magnetospheric accretion, inner-disk geometry, and dust and gas dynamics in the innermost astronomical unit. Crucially, connecting these processes to outer-scale unresolved information from JWST, ALMA, and the ELT would yield a complete tomography of the planet-forming region.</description>

      <title>Shells and bubbles around compact clusters of massive stars: 3D MHD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (3D MHD) simulations of the plasma flow structure in the vicinity of a compact cluster of young massive stars. The cluster is considered at the evolutionary stage dominated by Wolf-Rayet stars. This stage occurs in clusters with ages of several million years, close to the onset of supernova explosions; the well-known objects Westerlund 1 and 2 are the prototypes. The collisions of powerful winds from massive stars in the cluster core, calculated as interactions of individual outflows, are accompanied by their partial thermalization and produce a collective cluster wind. The MHD dynamics of the cluster wind bubble expansion into the interstellar medium is considered, depending on the density of the surrounding medium with a uniform magnetic field. We show that when expanding into a cold neutral medium, the cluster wind is able to reshape its surrounding environment over the Wolf-Rayet star lifetime, sweeping up more than $10^4$ $M_{\odot}$ of gas in $\sim 2 \times 10^5$ yr and producing extended, thin and dense shells with an amplified magnetic field. In a cold neutral medium with a density of $\sim 20$ cm$^{-3}$ and a magnetic field of $\sim 3.5$ $\mu$G, a thin shell forms around the cluster wind bubble, characterized by a cellular structure in its density and magnetic field distributions. The cellular magnetic field structure appears in parts of the shell expanding transversely to the orientation of the external magnetic field. Magnetic fields in the shell are amplified to strengths $\gtrsim 50$ $\mu$G. The formation of the cellular structure is associated with the development of instabilities. The expansion of the bubble into a warm neutral interstellar medium also leads to the formation of a shell with an amplified magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Broadband infrared spectroscopy of methanol isotopologues in pure, H2O-rich, and CO-rich ice analogues</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deuterium fractionation is highly efficient during the early stages of star formation, particularly in starless and prestellar cores where temperatures are low (&lt;10 K) and molecular freeze-out onto dust grains is significant. Methanol forms early in these environments following CO freeze-out via successive hydrogenation reactions on grain surfaces, while the production of deuterated methanol requires elevated gas-phase D/H ratios generated through dissociative recombination of deuterated H3+. Consequently, large abundances of deuterated methanol are observed toward young stellar objects where prestellar ices have recently sublimated. Here, we present laboratory infrared spectra of methanol and its deuterated isotopologues in astrophysical ice analogues, complemented by anharmonic vibrational calculations used to guide band assignments. Experiments were performed at the CASICE laboratory using a Bruker Vertex 70v spectrometer coupled to a closed-cycle helium cryostat, with isotopologue ices deposited at 10 K under high-vacuum conditions. Infrared transmission spectra were recorded over 6000-30 cm-1 (1.67-333 um) and compared with spectra of pure isotopologue ices. Distinctive mid-infrared band patterns are identified for each deuterated species. In particular, CH2DOH exhibits a characteristic doublet at 1293 and 1326 cm-1 (7.73 and 7.54 um), while CHD2OH shows a similar doublet at 1301 and 1329 cm-1 (7.69 and 7.52 um), both remaining largely invariant across all studied ice mixtures. These robust spectral signatures provide reliable tracers for identifying deuterated methanol in JWST observations and for constraining astrochemical gas-grain models of deuterium enrichment prior to star and planet formation.</description>

      <title>Probing Atmospheric Escape Through the Near-Infrared Helium Triplet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The most productive tracer of exoplanetary atmospheric escape is the measurement of excess absorption in the near-infrared metastable helium triplet during transits. Atmospheric escape of a close-in planet's atmosphere plays a role in its evolutionary pathway, but to which extent remains unknown. It could explain demographic features like the radius valley and Neptunian desert. We will describe the development of instrumental, reduction, and modelling techniques to study exoplanetary atmospheric escape, focusing on the helium triplet. One such development is the NIGHT spectrograph, intended to provide the first survey of escaping atmospheres. NIGHT spectra will be processed with ANTARESS, a state-of-the-art workflow for reducing high-resolution spectral time-series of exoplanet transits and computing transmission spectra in a robust and reproducible way. Transmission spectra contain the potential signature of the planetary atmosphere as well as distortions induced by the occultation of local regions of the stellar surface along the transit chord. Transmission spectra cannot be corrected for those stellar distortions without biasing the planetary signal. They must instead be directly interpreted using a numerical model like the EvE code, which generates realistic stellar spectra that account for the system's 3D architecture, the planet's atmospheric structure, and its local occultation of the stellar disc. This global approach, from the measurement and computation of transmission spectra to their interpretation, will be a legacy of the NCCR PlanetS, becoming the standard procedure to study high-resolution spectroscopy of planetary transits.</description>

      <title>Generation and Expansion-Driven Growth of Switchbacks in the Outer Solar Corona and Solar Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze \emph{Parker Solar Probe} and \emph{Solar Orbiter} measurements of magnetic-field reversals (``switchbacks'') across the Alfv\'en surface ($M_a\simeq 1$), where $M_a$ is the Alfv\'en Mach number. The reported ``sub-Alfv\'enic switchback dropout'' follows from two diagnostic biases: conditioning on an instantaneous $M_a$, which is transiently elevated above unity by radial-velocity enhancements during large-amplitude Alfv\'enic rotations, and short-window local-mean backgrounds that partially track these rotations and suppress deflection angles. Treating $M_a$ as a bulk-stream property via rolling medians and referencing deflections to event-independent backgrounds -- a Parker-spiral direction or a sufficiently long rolling median -- recovers sub-Alfv\'enic switchbacks systematically. The mean deflection $\langle \theta \rangle$ separates into two regimes with $M_a$. For $M_a \lesssim 1$, $\langle \theta \rangle$ rises rapidly with weak dependence on the background window, consistent with expansion-driven amplification of Alfv\'enic fluctuations. For $M_a \gtrsim 1$, the evolution becomes scale dependent: large-scale $\langle \theta \rangle$ continues to grow with $M_a$ at reduced rate, while small-scale growth saturates, consistent with turbulent decay and dissipation. Collectively, these results indicate that switchbacks need not originate only in the super-Alfv\'enic solar wind. Instead, they are consistent with a formation pathway in which coronal fluctuations are amplified by large-scale expansion through the sub-Alfv\'enic regime, with subsequent propagation into the super-Alfv\'enic wind where turbulent decay modifies their scale-dependent properties.</description>

Abstract: The Sun is a magnetically active star and is the source of the solar wind, electromagnetic radiation and energetic particles which affect the heliosphere and the Earths atmosphere. The magnetic field of the Sun is responsible for most of the dynamic activity of the Sun. This thesis research seeks to understand solar magnetic field generation and the role that magnetic fields play in the dynamics of the solar atmosphere. Specifically, this thesis focuses on two themes: in the first part, we study the origin and behaviour of solar magnetic fields using magnetohydrodynamic dynamo theory and modelling, and in the second part, utilizing observations and data analysis we study two major problems in solar physics, namely, the coronal heating problem and initiation mechanisms of solar flares.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Search for Big Dippers in ASAS-SN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dipper stars are extrinsically variable stars with deep dimming events due to extended, often dusty, structures produced by a wide range of mechanisms such as collisions, protoplanetary evolution or stellar winds. ASAS-SN has discovered 12 dipper-like objects as part of its normal operations. Here we systematically search the $\sim 5.1$ million ASAS-SN targets with $13&lt;g&lt;14$~mag for dippers with $\Delta g\ge0.3$~mag to identify 4 new candidates. We also discover 15 long-period eclipsing binary candidates. We characterized the 19 new and 12 previously discovered objects using the ASAS-SN light curves and archival multi-wavelength data. We divide them into three categories: long-period eclipsing binaries with a single eclipse (13 total), long-period eclipsing binaries with multiple eclipses (7 total) and dipper stars with dust or disk occultations (11 total).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the solitary Alfv\'en wave, an exact nonlinear solution of the ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations, and construct a three-dimensional numerical model -- an \emph{Alfv\'enon}. The model is characterized by an unperturbed far field, quasi-constant $|\boldsymbol{B}|$, and open field-line topology. Direct MHD simulations of the Alfv\'enon demonstrate remarkable stability, confirming that it behaves as a nonlinear solitary Alfv\'enic solution under ideal MHD evolution.</description>

      <title>Dynamical mass of a solar-like oscillator at the main-sequence turnoff from Gaia astrometry &amp; ground-based spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Asteroseismology is widely used for precise determining of masses of solar-like oscillating stars by performing individual-frequency modeling or applying homological scaling relations. However, these methods lack dynamical validation on the main sequence due to the absence of eclipsing double-lined binary system (SB2) as benchmark objects. By providing the orbital inclination, astrometric binary systems from ESA Gaia DR3 offer an abundant alternative for eclipsing systems. We present KIC693187 as the first SB2, hosting a solar-like oscillating post-main-sequence star with dynamical masses. By combining Gaia astrometry with spectroscopic obtained with the Las Cumbres Observatory network (LCO), we find $M_1^\mathrm{dyn}$=0.99$\pm$0.05$M_\odot$ and $M_2^\mathrm{dyn}$=0.89$\pm$0.04$M_\odot$ for the primary and secondary, respectively. Asteroseismic parameters were extracted from photometry of the NASA \Kepler satellite. The mass from individual frequency modeling is $M_1^\mathrm{IF}$=0.92$\pm$0.01$M_\odot$. Taking into account the systematic uncertainty of 0.04$M_\odot$ for best fit models from individual frequency fitting, we find an agreement within 1.2$\sigma$. From scaling relations we obtain a mass range of 0.93 to 0.98$M_\odot$ by using the observed large frequency separations (\dnu) in the scaling relations for the primary. By using standard corrections for departures from the asymptotic regime of \dnu, we obtained a mass range of 0.83 to 1.03$M_\odot$. The upper ends of both ranges agree well with the dynamical mass of the primary. This approach provides the first empirical validation for main-sequence solar-like oscillators and opens a new window for validating asteroseismology. Through a dedicatded program targeting astrometric SB2 binary systems, ESA's PLATO space mission will provide will enlarge the benchmark sample substantially.</description>

      <title>Nonmodal growth and optimal perturbations in magnetohydrodynamic shear flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In astrophysical shear flows, the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability is generally suppressed by magnetic tension provided a sufficiently strong streamwise magnetic field. This is often used to infer upper (or lower) bounds on field strengths in systems where shear-driven fluctuations are (or are not) observed, on the basis that perturbations cannot grow in the absence of linear instability. On the contrary, by calculating the maximum growth that small-amplitude perturbations can achieve in finite time for such a system, we show that perturbations can grow in energy by orders of magnitude even when the flow is sub-Alfv\'enic, raising the possibility that shear-driven turbulence may be found even in the presence of strong magnetic fields, and challenging inferences from the observed presence or absence of shear-driven fluctuations. We further show that magnetic fields introduce additional nonmodal growth mechanisms relative to the hydrodynamic case, and that 2D simulations miss key aspects of these growth mechanisms.</description>

      <title>New and updated timing models for seven young energetic X-ray pulsars, including the Big Glitcher PSR J0537-6910</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present new timing models and update our previous ones for the rotational evolution of seven young energetic pulsars, including four of the top five in spin-down luminosity Edot among all known pulsars. For each of the six pulsars that were monitored on a regular basis by NICER, their rotation phase-connected timing model covers the entire period of NICER observations, in many cases from 2017-2025. For PSR J0058-7218, which was only identified in 2021, we extend the baseline of its timing model by 3 years and report detections of its first three glitches. The timing model for PSR J0537-6910 over the entire 8 years of NICER monitoring is presented, including a total of 23 glitches; we also report its spin frequency and pulsed spectrum from a 2016 NuSTAR observation. For PSR B0540-69, its complete timing model from 2015-2025 is provided, including a braking index evolution from near 0 to 1.6 during this period. The 8-year timing model for PSR J1412+7922 (also known as Calvera) is reported, which includes a position that is consistent with that measured from imaging. For PSR J1811-1925, we present its 3.5-year timing model. For PSR J1813-1749, its incoherent timing model is extended through early 2025 using new Chandra observations. For PSR J1849-0001, its 7-year timing model is provided, including a position that is consistent with and more accurate than its imaging position and its first glitch that is one of the largest ever measured. Our timing models of these seven X-ray pulsars enable their study at other energies and in gravitational wave data.</description>

      <title>Neutron star cooling implications and magnetic field of the Vela Junior central compact object from all XMM-Newton and Chandra spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The central compact object (CCO) in the Vela Junior supernova remnant is a young neutron star whose relatively low X-ray flux and small distance suggest it has a mass high enough to activate fast neutrino cooling processes. Here we analyse all XMM-Newton MOS and pn and Chandra ACIS-S spectra of the Vela Junior CCO, with observations taking place over the 9 years from 2001 to 2010. We find that the best-fit flux and spectral model parameters do not vary significantly when treating each observation independently, and therefore we fit all the spectra simultaneously using various spectral models to characterize the predominantly thermal emission from the neutron star surface. Our results indicate the Vela Junior CCO has an atmosphere composed of hydrogen, a hot spot temperature (unredshifted) of 3.5x10^6 K, and a colder surface temperature of (6.6-8.8)x10^5 K. Possible absorption lines at ~0.6 keV and 0.9 keV provide evidence for the first-time of an average surface magnetic field B~3x10^10 G for this CCO, which is similar to the magnetic field of other CCOs. At the accurate new Vela Junior distance of 1.4 kpc, the observed luminosity that is dominated by the hot spot is ~5x10^32 erg s^-1. The luminosity from the rest of the colder surface is (1.3-4.0)x10^32 erg s^-1. The cool luminosity and temperature imply the Vela Junior CCO is indeed colder than many other young neutron stars and probably has a high mass that triggered fast neutrino cooling.</description>
