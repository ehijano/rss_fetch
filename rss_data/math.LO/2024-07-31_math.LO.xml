      <title>Fra\"{i}ss\'{e}'s Conjecture and big Ramsey degrees of structures admitting finite monomorphic decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we show that a countable structure admitting a finite monomorphic decomposition has finite big Ramsey degrees if and only if so does every monomorphic part in its minimal monomorphic decomposition. The necessary prerequisite for this result is the characterization of monomorphic structures with finite big Ramsey degrees: a countable monomorphic structure has finite big Ramsey degrees if and only if it is chainable by a chain with finite big Ramsey degrees. Interestingly, both characterizations require deep structural properties of chains. Fra\"{i}ss\'{e}'s Conjecture (actually, its positive resolution due to Laver) is instrumental in the characterization of monomorphic structures with finite big Ramsey degrees, while the analysis of big Ramsey combinatorics of structures admitting a finite monomorphic decomposition requires a product Ramsey theorem for big Ramsey degrees. We find this last result particularly intriguing because big Ramsey degrees misbehave notoriously when it comes to general product statements.</description>

      <title>Two strong undefinability results in inquisitive and team semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove two (strong) undefinability results for logics based on inquisitive semantics (or its variant, team semantics). Namely: 1) we show the undefinability of intuitionistic implication in extended propositional inquisitive logic with tensor; 2) we show the undefinability of global disjunction in extended propositional dependence logic.</description>

      <title>Almost free modules, perfect decomposition and Enochs's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a module $X$ and a regular cardinal $\kappa$ we study various notions of $(\kappa,\mathrm{Add}(X))$-freeness and $(\kappa,\mathrm{Add}(X))$-separability. Bearing on appropriate set-theoretic assumptions, we construct a non-trivial $\kappa^+$-generated, $(\kappa^+,\mathrm{Add}(X))$-free and $(\kappa^+,\mathrm{Add}(X))$-separable module. Our construction allows $\kappa$ to be singular thus extending \cite[Theorem~4.7]{CortesGuilTorrecillas}. Bearing on similar set-theoretic assumptions, we characterize when every module $X$ has a perfect decomposition. As a subproduct we show that Enoch's conjecture for classes $\mathrm{Add}(X)$ is consistent with ZFC -- a fact first proved by \v{S}aroch \cite{Saroch}.</description>

      <title>Uniform extension of definable $C^{m,\omega}$-Whitney jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09156v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that definable Whitney jets of class $C^{m,\omega}$, where $m$ is a nonnegative integer and $\omega$ is a modulus of continuity, are the restrictions of definable $C^{m,\omega}$-functions; "definable" refers to an arbitrary given o-minimal expansion of the real field. This is true in a uniform way: any definable bounded family of Whitney jets of class $C^{m,\omega}$ extends to a definable bounded family of $C^{m,\omega}$-functions. We also discuss a uniform $C^m$-version and how the extension depends on the modulus of continuity.</description>

      <title>On Rosser theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11749v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rosser theories play an important role in the study of the incompleteness phenomenon and mete-mathematics of arithmetic. In this paper, we first define notions of $n$-Rosser theories, exact $n$-Rosser theories, effectively $n$-Rosser theories and effectively exact $n$-Rosser theories (see Definition 1.6). Our definitions are not restricted to arithmetic languages. Then we systematically examine properties of $n$-Rosser theories and relationships among them. Especially, we generalize some important theorems about Rosser theories for RE sets in the literature to $n$-Rosser theories in a general setting.</description>

      <title>Equiconsistency of the Minimalist Foundation with its classical version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Minimalist Foundation, for short MF, was conceived by the first author with G. Sambin in 2005, and fully formalized in 2009, as a common core among the most relevant constructive and classical foundations for mathematics.
  To better accomplish its minimality, MF was designed as a two-level type theory, with an intensional level mTT, an extensional one emTT, and an interpretation of the latter into the first.
  Here, we first show that the two levels of MF are indeed equiconsistent by interpreting mTT into emTT. Then, we show that the classical extension emTT^c is equiconsistent with emTT by suitably extending the G\"odel-Gentzen double-negation translation of classical logic in the intuitionistic one. As a consequence, MF turns out to be compatible with classical predicative mathematics \`a la Weyl, contrary to the most relevant foundations for constructive mathematics.
  Finally, we show that the chain of equiconsistency results for MF can be straightforwardly extended to its impredicative version to deduce that Coquand-Huet's Calculus of Constructions equipped with basic inductive types is equiconsistent with its extensional and classical versions too.</description>

      <title>On first-order transductions of classes of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.14412v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study various aspects of the first-order transduction quasi-order on graph classes, which provides a way of measuring the relative complexity of graph classes based on whether one can encode the other using a formula of first-order (FO) logic. In contrast with the conjectured simplicity of the transduction quasi-order for monadic second-order logic, the FO-transduction quasi-order is very complex, and many standard properties from structural graph theory and model theory naturally appear in it. We prove a local normal form for transductions among other general results and constructions, which we illustrate via several examples and via the characterizations of the transductions of some simple classes. We then turn to various aspects of the quasi-order, including the (non-)existence of minimum and maximum classes for certain properties, the strictness of the pathwidth hierarchy, the fact that the quasi-order is not a lattice, and the role of weakly sparse classes in the quasi-order.</description>

      <title>On ordinary differentially large fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a characterisation of differentially large fields in arbitrary characteristic and a single derivation in the spirit of Blum axioms for differentially closed fields. In the case of characteristic zero, we use these axioms to characterise differential largeness in terms of being existentially closed in the differential algebraic Laurent series ring, and we prove that any large field of infinite transcendence degree can be expanded to a differentially large field even under certain prescribed constant fields. As an application, we show that the theory of proper dense pairs of models of a complete and modelcomplete theory of large fields, is a complete theory. As a further consequence of the expansion result we show that there is no real closed and differential field that has a prime model extension in closed ordered differential fields, unless it is itself a closed ordered differential field.</description>

      <title>Computable learning of natural hypothesis classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is about the recent notion of computably probably approximately correct learning, which lies between the statistical learning theory where there is no computational requirement on the learner and efficient PAC where the learner must be polynomially bounded. Examples have recently been given of hypothesis classes which are PAC learnable but not computably PAC learnable, but these hypothesis classes are unnatural or non-canonical in the sense that they depend on a numbering of proofs, formulas, or programs. We use the on-a-cone machinery from computability theory to prove that, under mild assumptions such as that the hypothesis class can be computably listable, any natural hypothesis class which is learnable must be computably learnable. Thus the counterexamples given previously are necessarily unnatural.</description>
