      <title>Planet Hunters TESS V: a planetary system around a binary star, including a mini-Neptune in the habitable zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the discovery and validation of a transiting long-period mini-Neptune orbiting a bright (V = 9.0 mag) G dwarf (TOI 4633; R = 1.05 RSun, M = 1.10 MSun). The planet was identified in data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite by citizen scientists taking part in the Planet Hunters TESS project. Modeling of the transit events yields an orbital period of 271.9445 +/- 0.0040 days and radius of 3.2 +/- 0.20 REarth. The Earth-like orbital period and an incident flux of 1.56 +/- 0.2 places it in the optimistic habitable zone around the star. Doppler spectroscopy of the system allowed us to place an upper mass limit on the transiting planet and revealed a non-transiting planet candidate in the system with a period of 34.15 +/- 0.15 days. Furthermore, the combination of archival data dating back to 1905 with new high angular resolution imaging revealed a stellar companion orbiting the primary star with an orbital period of around 230 years and an eccentricity of about 0.9. The long period of the transiting planet, combined with the high eccentricity and close approach of the companion star makes this a valuable system for testing the formation and stability of planets in binary systems.</description>

      <title>Capillary processes in extraterrestrial contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Earth is no longer the only known celestial body containing one or more liquid phases. The Cassini spacecraft has discovered seas of hydrocarbons at the surface of Titan, while a series of corroborating evidences argue in favour of the existence of an aqueous ocean beneath the icy crust of several moons. Capillarity embraces a family of physical processes occurring at the free surface of a liquid. These phenomena depend on the liquid properties and on the local planetary conditions. Capillarity may have important direct or indirect implications on the geoscientific and astrobiological points of view. In this paper, we discuss capillarity physics among solar system objects and expected consequences for planetary science.</description>

      <title>Comparative Mid-Infrared Spectroscopy of Dark, Primitive Asteroids: Does Shared Taxonomic Class Indicate Shared Silicate Composition?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primitive asteroids with low albedos and red slopes in the visible and near infrared (VNIR) are found in both the Main Belt and the Jupiter Trojan clouds. In order to determine whether the VNIR spectral similarities of primitive Main Belt asteroids and Jupiter Trojans are reflective of a true compositional similarity, we compare the mid-infrared silicate emission features of Main Belt and Jupiter Trojan asteroids. Using archival data from the Spitzer Space Telescope's IRS spectrograph and observations from the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy's (SOFIA) FORCAST instrument, we analyze the 5-40 micron spectra of thirteen primitive Main Belt asteroids and compare them to those of Jupiter Trojans in the literature. We find that while many primitive asteroids in the Main Belt resemble their Trojan counterparts with strong spectral signatures of olivine-rich high-porosity silicate regoliths, we identify (368) Haidea as a spectrally distinctive asteroid that lacks strong evidence of olivine in its MIR spectrum. Differences in silicate compositions among D-type asteroids imply a diversity of origins for primitive asteroids.</description>

      <title>EL meteorites do date the giant planet instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our recent work, we combined dynamical simulations, meteoritic data and thermal models as well as asteroid observations to argue that the current parent body of the EL meteorites was implanted into the asteroid belt not earlier than 60 Myr after the beginning of the Solar System and that the most likely capture mechanism was the giant planet orbital instability. In the study "The link between Athor and EL meteorites does not constrain the timing of the giant planet instability" that appeared in arXiv, Izidoro and collaborators argue that the implantation of Athor into the asteroid belt does not necessarily require that the giant planet orbital instability occurred at the implantation time. Here we provide further arguments that, in the end, the giant planet instability is still the most likely dynamical process to implant asteroid Athor into the asteroid main belt between 60 and 100 Myr after the beginning of the Solar System.</description>

      <title>SPHERE RefPlanets: Search for epsilon Eridani b and warm dust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carried out very deep VLT/SPHERE imaging polarimetry of the nearby system Eps Eri based on 38.5 hours of integration time with a 600 - 900 nm broadband filter to search for polarized scattered light from a planet or from circumstellar dust using AO, coronagraphy, high precision differential polarimetry, and angular differential imaging. We have improved several data reduction and post-processing techniques and also developed new ones to further increase the sensitivity of SPHERE/ZIMPOL. The data provide unprecedented contrast limits, but no significant detection of a point source or an extended signal from circumstellar dust. For each observing epoch, we obtained a point source contrast for the polarized intensity between $2\cdot 10^{-8}$ and $4\cdot 10^{-8}$ at the expected separation of the planet Eps Eri b of 1'' near quadrature phase. The polarimetric contrast limits are about six to 50 times better than the intensity limits because polarimetric imaging is much more efficient in speckle suppression. Combining the entire 14-month data set to the search for a planet moving on a Keplerian orbit with the K-Stacker software further improves the contrast limits by a factor of about two, to about $8 \cdot 10^{-9}$ at 1''. This would allow the detection of a planet with a radius of about 2.5 Jupiter radii. The surface brightness contrast limits achieved for the polarized intensity from an extended scattering region are about 15 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ at 1'', or up to 3 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ deeper than previous limits. For Eps Eri, these limits exclude the presence of a narrow dust ring and they constrain the dust properties. This study shows that the polarimetric contrast limits for reflecting planets with SPHERE/ZIMPOL can be improved to a level $&lt;10^{-8}$ simply by collecting more data over many nights and using the K-Stacker software.</description>

      <title>ROME III. The Arecibo Search for Star-Planet Interactions at 5 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.08899v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After nearly three decades of discovery, many exoplanetary systems have been studied and characterized in detail with one important exception: exoplanet magnetism. Although many surveys sought to detect magnetospheric radio emissions from exoplanets to directly measure their magnetic field strengths, they have yet to reveal an unambiguous detection. However, the indirect detection of exoplanet magnetic fields by measuring their influence on their host stars via magnetic star-planet interactions has recently gained prominence as an alternative method of discovery. This third paper of the ROME (Radio Observations of Magnetized Exoplanets) series presents the results of a targeted radio survey of eight nearby exoplanet-hosting systems that may engage in star-planet interactions. This survey, conducted with the Arecibo radio telescope at $\sim$5 GHz, has the greatest frequency coverage of any to date, while providing mJy-level sensitivity over $&lt;$1 s integration times. No exoplanet-induced stellar radio bursts were detected. The orbital phase coverage of candidate systems for magnetic star-planet interactions is described, and the survey results are examined within the context of the plasma flow-obstacle paradigm and searches for star-planet interactions at other wavelengths.</description>

      <title>ROME IV. The Arecibo Search for Substellar Magnetospheric Radio Emissions in Purported Exoplanet-Hosting Systems at 5 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plasma flow-obstacle interactions, such as those between an exoplanet's magnetosphere and the host star's stellar wind, may lead to detectable radio emissions. Despite many attempts to detect magnetospheric (auroral) radio emissions from exoplanets, a reproducible, unambiguous detection remains elusive. This fourth paper of the ROME (Radio Observations of Magnetized Exoplanets) series presents the results of a targeted radio survey of nine nearby systems that host exoplanet, brown dwarf, or low-mass-stellar companions conducted with the Arecibo radio telescope at $\sim$5 GHz. This search for magnetospheric radio emissions has the greatest sensitivity ($\sim$1 mJy during $&lt;$1 s integration times) and collected full Stokes parameters over the largest simultaneous bandpass of any survey to date. It is also the first survey to search for radio emission from brown dwarfs of spectral class Y, which may illuminate open questions regarding their magnetism, interior and atmospheric structure, and formation histories. No magnetospheric radio emissions from substellar companions were detected. These results are examined within the context of recent theoretical work on plasma flow-obstacle interactions, and radio emissions observed from the solar system planets and ultracool dwarfs.</description>

      <title>A broken debris cascade as a possible source of hot dust emission in transitioning planet-forming disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Planet-forming disks turn from gas-rich, massive disks made of dust and gas into planetary systems containing only small amounts dust produced by collisions between smaller planetary objects like planetesimals, asteroids, or comets. Traditionally we talk about protoplanetary (age $\sim$1 Myr), transitional ($\sim$ 5-10 Myr), and debris disks ($\sim$ 10-hundreds of Myr), even though the overlap between these phases may be relevant. We aim to show that in the transition phase of a disk, when gas surface densities are reduced but not yet negligible, a seemingly small amount of collisional activity may lead to the production of dust on a level that is observationally relevant by creating regions of optical depth 1 or above. In particular, we aim to show that the hot dust emission component of transitional disks may in fact be debris dust produced in such collisions. We develop an analytical model to derive the conditions under which observationally relevant amounts of dust can be produced. We focus on the effect of the gas surface density during the transition phase of a disk from fully gas-dominated to the gas-poor debris stage. We show that the decrease of the gas surface density has an important effect. It allows smaller planetesimals to become collisional, starting a cascade. At the same time, small particles are not destroyed by collisions. That interrupted cascade is critical to preserve the produced dust for significant time intervals, allowing a seemingly minor amount of planetesimal collisions to be effective in producing detectable amounts of dust. The warm emission of low amounts of dust in many transitional planet-forming disks might be caused entirely by second-generation dust, exposing planetary material at a time much earlier than the age of what are traditionally considered as debris disks.</description>
