      <title>Thermal Earth Model for the Conterminous United States Using an Interpolative Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network (InterPIGNN)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a data-driven spatial interpolation algorithm based on physics-informed graph neural networks used to develop national temperature-at-depth maps for the conterminous United States. The model was trained to approximately satisfy the three-dimensional heat conduction law by simultaneously predicting subsurface temperature, surface heat flow, and rock thermal conductivity. In addition to bottomhole temperature measurements, we incorporated other physical quantities as model inputs, such as depth, geographic coordinates, elevation, sediment thickness, magnetic anomaly, gravity anomaly, gamma-ray flux of radioactive elements, seismicity, and electric conductivity. We constructed surface heat flow, and temperature and thermal conductivity predictions for depths of 0-7 km at an interval of 1 km with spatial resolution of 18 km$^2$ per grid cell. Our model showed superior temperature, surface heat flow and thermal conductivity mean absolute errors of 4.8{\deg} C, 5.817 mW/m$^2$ and 0.022 W/(C-m)$, respectively. The predictions were visualized in two-dimensional spatial maps across the modeled depths. This thorough modeling of the Earth's thermal processes is crucial to understanding subsurface phenomena and exploiting natural underground resources.</description>

      <title>Rapid hydrofracture of icy moon shells: insights from glaciology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Europa's surface features many regions of complex topography termed 'chaos terrains'. One set of hypotheses for chaos terrain formation require upward migration of liquid water from perched water bodies formed by convection and tidal heating within the icy shell. However, consideration of the behaviour of terrestrial ice sheets suggests the rapid downwards, not upwards, movement of water from perched water bodies, initiated through hydrofracture and without a propagation limit provided there is a sufficient volume of water to fill the resulting vertical fracture. I suggest that drainage of perched water bodies to the subsurface ocean through hydrofracture is a likely phenomenon at Europa and other icy moons. This may at first appear to rule out perched water bodies in the formation of chaos areas, but the violence of such drainage events and loss of mechanical support could lead to the collapse of the surface shell and a temporary surface-ocean connection. Alternatively, hydrofracture provides a mechanism for entire ice-shell fracture if a surface impact melts enough near-surface ice.</description>

      <title>Internally Driven $\beta$-plane Plasma Turbulence Using the Hasegawa-Wakatani System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General problem of plasma turbulence can be formulated as advection of potential vorticity (PV), which handles flow self-organization, coupled to a number of other fields, whose gradients provide free energy sources. Therefore, focusing on PV evolution separates the underlying linear instability from the flow self-organization, and clarifies key spatial scales in terms of balances between various time scales. Considering the Hasegawa-Wakatani model as a minimal, nontrivial model of plasma turbulence where the energy is injected internally by a linear instability, we find that the critical wavenumber $k_{c}=C/\kappa$ where $C$ is the adiabaticity parameter and $\kappa$ is the normalized density gradient separates the adiabatic (or highly zonostrophic) behavior for large scales from the hydrodynamic behavior at small scales. In the adiabatic range the non-zonal part of the wave-number spectrum goes from $E(k)\propto\gamma_{k}U^{-1}k^{-2}$ around the peak to $E(k) \propto \omega_{k}^{2} k^{-3}$ in the "inertial" range, where $\gamma_{k}$ and $\omega_{k}$ are the linear growth and frequency and $U$ is the rms zonal velocity. This proposed spectrum fits very well for the large $k_{c}$ case, where the bulk of the spectrum is in the adiabatic range. In contrast for small $k_{c}$, we get the usual forward enstrophy cascade with $E(k)\propto\epsilon_{W}^{2/3}k^{-3}$, where $\epsilon_{W}$ is the enstrophy dissipation. In contrast for $k_{c}\approx 1$, the system transitions to hydrodynamic forward enstrophy cascade right after the injection range, with zonal flows at large scales and forward enstrophy cascade at small scales. It is argued that the ratio $R_{\beta}\equiv k_{\beta}/k_{\text{peak}}\approx k_{c}/k_{\text{peak}}$ where $k_{\text{peak}}$ is the peak wave-number can be defined as the zonostrophy parameter.</description>

      <title>Quasi-geostrophic projection of rotating shallow-water equations</title>

Abstract: With a new unifying model for layered rotating shallow-water (RSW) and quasi-geostrophic (QG) equations, this paper sheds light on the relation between these two sets of equations. We propose here a new formulation of the quasi-geostrophic equations as a projection of the rotating shallow-water equations. This QG formulation uses the same prognostic variables as RSW, namely velocity and layer thickness, restoring the proximity of these two sets of equations. It allows direct access to the ageostrophic velocities hidden in geostrophic velocities resolved by the QG equations. It opens the path of studying the difference between QG and RSW using the same underlying numerical discretization. We illustrate this new possibility on a vortex shear instability and a double-gyre configuration.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Kalman filter in geoscience meets model predictive control</title>

Abstract: Although data assimilation originates from control theory, the relationship between modern data assimilation methods in geoscience and model predictive control has not been extensively explored. In the present paper, I discuss that the modern data assimilation methods in geoscience and model predictive control essentially minimize the similar quadratic cost functions. Inspired by this similarity, I propose a new ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF)-based method for controlling spatio-temporally chaotic systems, which can readily be applied to high-dimensional and nonlinear Earth systems. In this method, the reference vector, which serves as the control target, is assimilated into the state space as a pseudo-observation by ensemble Kalman smoother to obtain the appropriate perturbation to be added to a system. A proof-of-concept experiment using the Lorenz 63 model is presented. The system is constrained in one wing of the butterfly attractor without tipping to the other side by reasonably small control perturbations which are comparable with previous works.</description>

      <title>When Geoscience Meets Foundation Models: Towards General Geoscience Artificial Intelligence System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06799v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geoscience foundation models (GFMs) represent a revolutionary approach within Earth sciences to integrate massive cross-disciplinary data for improved simulation and understanding of Earth system dynamics. As a data-centric artificial intelligence paradigm, GFMs extract valuable insights from petabytes of both structured and unstructured data. Their versatility in task specification, diverse inputs and outputs, and multi-modal knowledge representation enable a comprehensive analysis that surpasses the capabilities of individual data sources. Critically, the scalability and generalizability of GFMs empower them to address a wide array of prediction, simulation, and decision tasks related to the intricate interactions among Earth system components. By unraveling the causal mechanisms underlying observed patterns and changes, GFMs contribute to advancing our knowledge of the Earth system and its responses to various drivers and perturbations. Collaboration between domain experts and computer scientists plays a pivotal role in fostering innovations in these invaluable tools for understanding the past, present, and future of our planet. Moreover, we introduce recent advances including key technologies for constructing GFMs, especially remote sensing applications. However, challenges remain in validation and verification, scalability, interpretability, knowledge representation, and addressing social bias. Going forward, the key lies in enhancing model integration, resolution, accuracy, and equity through interdisciplinary teamwork. Despite current limitations, GFMs hold great promise for providing critical insights into pressing issues including climate change, natural hazards, and sustainability through their ability to explore multiple scenarios and quantify uncertainties. Their continued evolution toward integrated, data-driven modeling holds paradigm-shifting potential for Earth science.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing tracer transport in convective penetration of a stably stratified layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use large-eddy simulations to study the penetration of a buoyant plume carrying a passive tracer into a stably stratified layer with constant buoyancy frequency. Using a buoyancy-tracer volume distribution, we develop a method for objectively partitioning buoyancy-tracer space into three regions, each of which corresponds to a coherent region in physical space. Specifically, we identify a source region where undiluted plume fluid enters the stratified layer, a transport region where much of the transition from undiluted to mixed fluid occurs in the plume cap, and an accumulation region corresponding to the radially spreading intrusion. This method enables quantification of different measures of turbulence and mixing within each of the three regions, including potential energy and turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates, an activity parameter, and the instantaneous mixing efficiency. We find that the most intense buoyancy gradients lie in a thin layer at the cap of the penetrating plume. This forms the primary stage of mixing between plume and environment and exhibits a mixing efficiency around 50%. Newly generated mixtures of environmental and plume fluid joining the intrusion are subjected to relatively weak turbulence and weaker buoyancy gradients as mixtures are homogenised. As the intrusion spreads radially, environmental fluid surrounding the intrusion is mixed into the intrusion with moderate mixing efficiency. This dominates the total entrainment of environmental fluid into the plume as a whole. However, the 'strongest' entrainment, as measured by the specific entrainment rate, is largest in the plume cap where the most buoyant environmental fluid is entrained.</description>
