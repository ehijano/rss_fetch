      <title>Detrended cross-correlations and their random matrix limit: an example from the cryptocurrency market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlations in complex systems are often obscured by nonstationarity, long-range memory, and heavy-tailed fluctuations, which limit the usefulness of traditional covariance-based analyses. To address these challenges, we construct scale and fluctuation-dependent correlation matrices using the multifractal detrended cross-correlation coefficient $\rho_r$ that selectively emphasizes fluctuations of different amplitudes. We examine the spectral properties of these detrended correlation matrices and compare them to the spectral properties of the matrices calculated in the same way from synthetic Gaussian and $q$Gaussian signals. Our results show that detrending, heavy tails, and the fluctuation-order parameter $r$ jointly produce spectra, which substantially depart from the random case even under absence of cross-correlations in time series. Applying this framework to one-minute returns of 140 major cryptocurrencies from 2021-2024 reveals robust collective modes, including a dominant market factor and several sectoral components whose strength depends on the analyzed scale and fluctuation order. After filtering out the market mode, the empirical eigenvalue bulk aligns closely with the limit of random detrended cross-correlations, enabling clear identification of structurally significant outliers. Overall, the study provides a refined spectral baseline for detrended cross-correlations and offers a promising tool for distinguishing genuine interdependencies from noise in complex, nonstationary, heavy-tailed systems.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic description of world GDP distribution over countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the concept of Rayleigh-Jeans thermalization of classical fields for a description of the world Gross Domestic Product (GDP) distribution over countries. The thermalization appears due to a variety of interactions between countries with conservation of two integrals being total GDP and probability (norm). In such a case there is an emergence of Rayleigh-Jeans condensation at states with low GDP. This phenomenon has been studied theoretically and experimentally in multimode optical fibers and we argue that it is at the origin of emergence of poverty and oligarchic phases for GDP of countries. A similar phenomenon has been discussed recently in the framework of the Wealth Thermalization Hypothesis to explain the high inequality of wealth distribution in human society and companies at Stock Exchange markets. We show that the Rayleigh-Jeans thermalization well describes the GDP distribution during the last 50 years.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Supply Chain Interdependencies for Stock Return Prediction: A Full-State Graph Convolutional LSTM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stock return prediction is fundamental to financial decision-making, yet traditional time series models fail to capture the complex interdependencies between companies in modern markets. We propose the Full-State Graph Convolutional LSTM (FS-GCLSTM), a novel temporal graph neural network that incorporates value-chain relationships to enhance stock return forecasting. Our approach features two key innovations: First, we represent inter-firm dependencies through value-chain networks, where nodes correspond to companies and edges capture supplier-customer relationships, enabling the model to leverage information beyond historical price data. Second, FS-GCLSTM applies graph convolutions to all LSTM components - current input features, previous hidden states, and cell states - ensuring that spatial information from the value-chain network influences every aspect of the temporal update mechanism. We evaluate FS-GCLSTM on Eurostoxx 600 and S&amp;P 500 datasets using LSEG value-chain data. While not achieving the lowest traditional prediction errors, FS-GCLSTM consistently delivers superior portfolio performance, attaining the highest annualized returns, Sharpe ratios, and Sortino ratios across both markets. Performance gains are more pronounced in the denser Eurostoxx 600 network, and robustness tests confirm stability across different input sequence lengths, demonstrating the practical value of integrating value-chain data with temporal graph neural networks.</description>

      <title>Order-Flow Filtration and Directional Association with Short-Horizon Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electronic markets generate dense order flow with many transient orders, which degrade directional signals derived from the limit order book (LOB). We study whether simple structural filters on order lifetime, modification count, and modification timing sharpen the association between order book imbalance (OBI) and short-horizon returns in BankNifty index futures, where unfiltered OBI is already known to be a strong short-horizon directional indicator. The efficacy of each filter is evaluated using a three-step diagnostic ladder: contemporaneous correlations, linear association between discretised regimes, and Hawkes event-time excitation between OBI and return regimes. Our results indicate that filtration of the aggregate order flow produces only modest changes relative to the unfiltered benchmark. By contrast, when filters are applied on the parent orders of executed trades, the resulting OBI series exhibits systematically stronger directional association. Motivated by recent regulatory initiatives to curb noisy order flow, we treat the association between OBI and short-horizon returns as a policy-relevant diagnostic of market quality. We then compare unfiltered and filtered OBI series, using tick-by-tick data from the National Stock Exchange of India, to infer how structural filters on the order flow affect OBI-return dynamics in an emerging market setting.</description>

      <title>A 4% withdrawal rate for American retirement spending, derived from a discrete-time model of stochastic returns on assets and their sample moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What grounds the rule of thumb that a(n American) retiree can safely withdraw 4% of their initial retirement wealth in their first year of retirement, then increase that rate of consumption with inflation? I address that question with a discrete-time model of returns to a retirement portfolio consumed at a rate that grows by $s$ per period. The model's key parameter is $\gamma$, an $s$-adjusted rate of return to wealth, derived from the first 2-4 moments of the portfolio's probability distribution of returns; for a retirement lasting $t$ periods the model recommends a rate of consumption of $\gamma / (1 - (1 - \gamma)^t)$. Estimation of $\gamma$ (and hence of the implied rate of spending in retirement) reveals that the 4% rule emerges from adjusting high expected rates of return down for: consumption growth, the variance in (and kurtosis of) returns to wealth, the longevity risk of a retiree potentially underestimating $t$, and the inclusion of bonds in retirement portfolios without leverage. The model supports leverage of retirement portfolios dominated by the S&amp;P 500, with leverage ratios $&gt; 1.6$ having been historically optimal under the model's approximations. Historical simulations of 30-year retirements suggest that the model proposes withdrawal rates having roughly even odds of success, that leverage greatly improves those odds for stocks-heavy portfolios, and that investing on margin could have allowed safe withdrawal rates $&gt; 6$% per year.</description>

      <title>Model Monitoring: A General Framework with an Application to Non-life Insurance Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Maintaining the predictive performance of pricing models is challenging when insurance portfolios and data-generating mechanisms evolve over time. Focusing on non-life insurance, we adopt the concept-drift terminology from machine learning and distinguish virtual drift from real concept drift in an actuarial setting. Methodologically, we (i) formalize deviance loss and Murphy's score decomposition to assess global and local auto-calibration; (ii) study the Gini score as a rank-based performance measure, derive its asymptotic distribution, and develop a consistent bootstrap estimator of its asymptotic variance; and (iii) combine these results into a statistically grounded, model-agnostic monitoring framework that integrates a Gini-based ranking drift test with global and local auto-calibration tests. An application to a modified motor insurance portfolio with controlled concept-drift scenarios illustrates how the framework guides decisions on refitting or recalibrating pricing models.</description>
