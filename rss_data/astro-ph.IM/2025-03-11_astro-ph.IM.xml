      <title>Measuring Type Ia Supernova Angular-Diameter Distances with Intensity Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the potential of intensity interferometry, based on the Hanbury Brown-Twiss effect, for measuring supernova sizes and distances. Through optimized telescope positioning, observing strategy, and advancements in single-photon detection technology, this method can provide precise angular size measurements of Type Ia supernovae as bright as 12~mag, corresponding to a local volume out to $z\sim0.004$, with an anticipated rate of $\sim 1$ events per year. The combination of angular size data with known physical dimensions enables accurate distance determination. Multiple telescope pairs at different relative positions allow tomographic mapping of the ejecta structure while reducing distance uncertainties. As Type Ia supernovae serve as standardizable candles for measuring the Universe's expansion history, combining intensity interferometry distances with the supernova Hubble diagram facilitates measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$.</description>

      <title>HOLISMOKES XVI: Lens search in HSC-PDR3 with a neural network committee and post-processing for false-positive removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have carried out a systematic search for galaxy-scale lenses exploiting multi-band imaging data from the third public data release of the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey with the focus on false-positive removal, after applying deep learning classifiers to all 110 million sources with i-Kron radius above 0.8". To improve the performance, we tested the combination of multiple networks from our previous lens search projects and found the best performance by averaging the scores from five of our networks. Although this ensemble network leads already to a false-positive rate (FPR) of 0.01% at a true-positive rate (TPR) of 75% on known real lenses, we have elaborated techniques to further clean the network candidate list before visual inspection. In detail, we tested the rejection using SExtractor and the modeling network from HOLISMOKES IX, which resulted together in a candidate rejection of 29% without lowering the TPR. We carried out a comprehensive multi-stage visual inspection involving eight individuals and identified 95 grade A (average grade G &gt;2.5) and 503 grade B (2.5 &gt;G &gt;1.5) lens candidates, including 92 discoveries reported for the first time. This inspection also incorporated a novel environmental characterization using histograms of photometric redshifts. We publicly release the average grades, mass model predictions, and environment characterization of all visually inspected candidates, while including references for previously discovered systems, which makes this catalog one of the largest compilation of known lenses. The results demonstrate that (1) the combination of multiple networks enhances the selection performance and (2) both automated masking tools as well as modeling networks, which can be easily applied to hundreds of thousands of network candidates, help reduce the number of false positives that is the main limitation in lens search to date.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Charge-coupled Device Readout Enabled by the Floating-Gate Amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple-Amplifier Sensing (MAS) charge-coupled devices (CCDs) have recently been shown to be promising silicon detectors that meet noise sensitivity requirements for next generation Stage-5 spectroscopic surveys and potentially, future space-based imaging of extremely faint objects such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory. Building upon the capability of the Skipper CCD to achieve deeply sub-electron noise floors, MAS CCDs utilize multiple floating-gate amplifiers along the serial register to increase the readout speed by a factor of the number of output nodes compared to a Skipper CCD. We introduce and experimentally demonstrate on a 16-channel prototype device new readout techniques that exploit the MAS CCD's floating-gate amplifiers to optimize the correlated double sampling (CDS) by resetting once per line instead of once per pixel. With this new mode, we find an optimal filter to subtract the noise from the signal during read out. We also take advantage of the MAS CCD's structure to tune the read time by independently changing integration times for the signal and reference level. Together with optimal weighted averaging of the 16 outputs, these approaches enable us to reach a sub-electron noise of 0.9 e$^-$ rms pix$^{-1}$ at 19 $\mu$s pix$^{-1}$ for a single charge measurement per pixel - simultaneously giving a 30% faster readout time and 10% lower read noise compared to performance previously evaluated without these techniques.</description>

      <title>Modelling steerable beams of satellite constellations for radio astronomy impact studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modelling is essential for studies that quantify the impact from satellite downlinks on radio astronomy sites. To estimate this impact it is necessary to know not only the position and velocity of satellites but also their behaviour in the radio spectrum domain. As many large satellite constellations are using steerable beam antennas, deterministically predicting the transmitted power towards a defined direction (in this case where a radio telescope points) becomes an almost impossible task and therefore another approach has to be used. This work presents a method to simulate and estimate the percentiles of the radiation pattern of satellites with steerable beam patterns based on simulations and a comparison with measurements of Starlink satellites using the Onsala Twin Telescopes in Sweden.</description>

      <title>CSST Strong Lensing Preparation: Fast Modeling of Galaxy-Galaxy Strong Lenses in the Big Data Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy-galaxy strong lensing provides a powerful probe of galaxy formation, evolution, and the properties of dark matter and dark energy. However, conventional lens-modeling approaches are computationally expensive and require fine-tuning to avoid local optima, rendering them impractical for the hundreds of thousands of lenses expected from surveys such as Euclid, CSST, and Roman Space Telescopes. To overcome these challenges, we introduce TinyLensGPU, a GPU-accelerated lens-modeling tool that employs XLA-based acceleration with JAX and a neural-network-enhanced nested sampling algorithm, nautilus-sampler. Tests on 1,000 simulated galaxy-galaxy lenses demonstrate that on an RTX 4060 Ti GPU, TinyLensGPU achieves likelihood evaluations approximately 2,000 times faster than traditional methods. Moreover, the nautilus-sampler reduces the number of likelihood evaluations by a factor of 3, decreasing the overall modeling time per lens from several days to roughly 3 minutes. Application to 63 SLACS lenses observed by the Hubble Space Telescope recovers Einstein radii consistent with the literature values (within $\lesssim 5\%$ deviation), which is within known systematic uncertainties. Catastrophic failures, where the sampler becomes trapped in local optima, occur in approximately 5\% of the simulated cases and 10\% of the SLACS sample. We argue that such issues are inherent to automated lens modeling but can be mitigated by incorporating prior knowledge from machine learning techniques. This work thus marks a promising step toward the efficient analysis of strong lenses in the era of big data. The code and data are available online: https://github.com/caoxiaoyue/TinyLensGpu.</description>

      <title>A directed continuous-wave search from Scorpius X-1 with the five-vector resampling technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous gravitational-wave signals (CWs), which are typically emitted by rapidly rotating neutron stars with non-axisymmetric deformations, represent particularly intriguing targets for the Advanced LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detectors. These detectors operate within sensitivity bands that encompass more than half of the known pulsars in our galaxy existing in binary systems (i.e., over 417 pulsars), which are the targeted sources of this paper. However, the detection of these faint signals is especially challenged by the Doppler modulation due to the source's orbital motion, typically described by five Keplerian parameters, which must be determined with high precision to effectively detect the signal. This modulation spreads the signal across multiple frequency bins, resulting in a notable reduction of signal-to-noise ratio and potentially hindering signal detection. To overcome this issue, a robust five-vector resampling data-analysis algorithm has been developed to conduct thorough directed/narrowband CW searches at an affordable computational cost. We employ this methodology for the first time to search for CWs from Scorpius X-1, using publicly available data from the third observing run of the Advanced LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detectors. No statistically significant CW signals can be claimed. Hence, we proceeded setting 95% confidence-level upper limits in selected frequency bands and orbital parameter ranges, while also evaluating overall sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Increasing Determinism of All-vs-all Orbital Evolution Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All-vs-all orbital evolutionary simulations for the low Earth orbit (LEO) simulate the long term evolution of the LEO environment. Although these simulations typically offer the highest fidelity, they are also highly computationally intensive. One factor that effectively reduces the efficiency of the approach is that all-vs-all approaches are stochastic and the distribution of the output has large variance. This paper introduces a new, quasi-deterministic all-vs-all simulator, whose variance is greatly reduced compared to traditional methods. The proposed approach virtually simulates collisions happening everywhere and all the time; however, their effect is appropriately reduced to maintain an unbiased estimate of the mean. Additional techniques are used to augment the proposed approach and obtain very precise estimates of any number of standard deviations from the mean, for the evaluation of the Value at Risk (VaR) with a single, low-variance run. Depending on the settings, results show that the variance in total number of debris generated can be reduced by a factor that averages 1,500, while increasing the computational cost by a factor of less than 1.5. Variance can be reduced even more when computing the VaR, albeit a no longer negligible bias is introduced. Low-variance results enable several key applications, such as sensitivity analysis, sustainability assessment of small missions, and fast evaluation of collision risk induced by existing debris. Additionally, rapid computations of the VaR can improve the evaluation of policy robustness, and include confidence intervals in risk assessment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observational cosmology has provided an extraordinary perspective on our universe and our place within it. However, as our understanding of the universe has increased, some glaring holes in our knowledge have become apparent: What physics is responsible for the super-luminal expansion of the universe at early times? What drives the accelerating expansion of the universe at late times? What is the nature of the mysterious dark matter that makes up 83\% of the matter in the universe? These fundamental physical questions are intimately linked to fundamental astronomical questions about how galaxies and stars have formed and evolved within our universe. Cosmic surveys are the primary means by which we study the origin, structure, composition, and evolution of our universe. In particular, many of these questions require the spectroscopy of large numbers of astronomical sources. Spectroscopy provides key data on the physics of primordial inflation and late-time cosmic acceleration, the astrophysics of galaxy evolution, and the nature and effects of dark matter in galaxies. For example, observable features in the three-dimensional structure of the universe are key predictions of cosmological models, and their time evolution provides unique constraints on the nature of dark energy, inflation and the gravitational effects of dark matter. The next major advance in our understanding of the universe requires spectroscopic measurements of hundreds of millions of astronomical objects.</description>

      <title>A Neural Symbolic Model for Space Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we unveil a new AI model, termed PhyE2E, to discover physical formulas through symbolic regression. PhyE2E simplifies symbolic regression by decomposing it into sub-problems using the second-order derivatives of an oracle neural network, and employs a transformer model to translate data into symbolic formulas in an end-to-end manner. The resulting formulas are refined through Monte-Carlo Tree Search and Genetic Programming. We leverage a large language model to synthesize extensive symbolic expressions resembling real physics, and train the model to recover these formulas directly from data. A comprehensive evaluation reveals that PhyE2E outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, delivering superior symbolic accuracy, precision in data fitting, and consistency in physical units. We deployed PhyE2E to five applications in space physics, including the prediction of sunspot numbers, solar rotational angular velocity, emission line contribution functions, near-Earth plasma pressure, and lunar-tide plasma signals. The physical formulas generated by AI demonstrate a high degree of accuracy in fitting the experimental data from satellites and astronomical telescopes. We have successfully upgraded the formula proposed by NASA in 1993 regarding solar activity, and for the first time, provided the explanations for the long cycle of solar activity in an explicit form. We also found that the decay of near-Earth plasma pressure is proportional to r^2 to Earth, where subsequent mathematical derivations are consistent with satellite data from another independent study. Moreover, we found physical formulas that can describe the relationships between emission lines in the extreme ultraviolet spectrum of the Sun, temperatures, electron densities, and magnetic fields. The formula obtained is consistent with the properties that physicists had previously hypothesized it should possess.</description>

      <title>Multi-detector characterization of gravitational-wave burst tensor polarizations with the BayesWave algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Einstein's theory of general relativity predicts that gravitational waves (GWs) are tensor-polarized, with two modes of polarization: plus ($h_+$) and cross ($h_\times$). The unmodeled GW burst analysis pipeline, \textit{BayesWave}, offers two tensor-polarized signal models: the elliptical polarization model ($E$) and the relaxed polarization model ($R$). Future expansion of the global GW detector network will enable more accurate studies of GW polarizations with GW bursts. Here a multi-detector analysis is conducted to compare the performance of $E$ and $R$ in characterizing elliptical and nonelliptical GW polarizations, using nonprecessing and precessing binary black holes (BBHs) respectively as representative synthetic sources. It is found that both models reconstruct the elliptical nonprecessing BBH signals accurately, but $E$ has a higher Bayesian evidence than $R$ as it is has fewer model parameters. The same is true for precessing BBHs that are reconstructed equally well by both models. However, for some events with high precession and especially with three or more detectors, the reconstruction accuracy and evidence of $R$ surpass $E$. The analysis is repeated for BBH events from the third LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run, and the results show that $E$ is preferred over $R$ for existing detections. Although $E$ is generally preferred for its simplicity, it insists on elliptical polarizations, whereas $R$ can measure generic GW polarization content in terms of Stokes parameters. The accuracy of $R$ in recovering polarization content improves as the detector network expands, and the performance is independent of the GW signal morphology.</description>

      <title>Identification of Star Clusters in M31 from PAndAS Images Based on Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The identification of star clusters holds significant importance in studying galaxy formation and evolution history. However, the task of swiftly and accurately identifying star clusters from vast amounts of photometric images presents an immense challenge. To address these difficulties, we employ deep learning models for image classification to identify young disk star clusters in M31 from the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey (PAndAS) images. For training, validation, and testing, we utilize the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey catalogs. We evaluate the performance of various deep learning models, using different classification thresholds and limiting magnitudes. Our findings indicate that the ResNet-50 model exhibits the highest overall accuracy. Moreover, using brighter limiting magnitudes and increasing the classification thresholds can effectively enhance the accuracy and precision of cluster identification. Through our experiments, we found that the model achieves optimal performance when the limiting magnitude is set to brighter than 21 mag. Based on this, we constructed a training dataset with magnitudes less than 21 mag and trained a second ResNet-50 model. This model achieved a purity of 89.30%, a recall of 73.55%, and an F1 score of 80.66% when the classification threshold was set to 0.669. Applying the second model to all sources in the PAndAS fields within a projected radius of 30 kpc from the center of M31, we identified 2,228 new unique star cluster candidates. We conducted visual inspections to validate the results produced by our automated methods, and we ultimately obtained 1,057 star cluster candidates, of which 745 are newly identified.</description>

Abstract: The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) is the world's leading instrument for high-resolution imaging of the 0.3 to 10 mm wavelength sky. This interferometer exemplifies successful international collaboration even down to its individual components, including its telescope dishes and receivers produced in global partnerships. Over the past roughly ten years of ALMA operation, these receivers have been responsible for nearly ten thousand publications, as carefully monitored by the online ALMA Science Archive. However, the citations of the relevant receiver papers have not managed to grow together with their use in the astronomical community, which points out an information gap among the astronomical community. To overcome this gap, this memo provides a comprehensive list of receiver references, which was created in direct contact with the receiver groups.</description>

      <title>CCSNscore: A multi-input deep learning tool for classification of core-collapse supernovae using SED-Machine spectra</title>

Abstract: Supernovae (SNe) come in various flavors and are classified into different types based on emission and absorption lines in their spectra. SN candidates are now abundant with the advent of large systematic sky surveys like the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), however, the identification bottleneck lies in their spectroscopic confirmation and classification. Fully robotic telescopes with dedicated spectrographs optimized for SN follow-up have eased the burden of data acquisition. However, the task of classifying the spectra still largely rests with the astronomers. Automating this classification step reduces human effort and can make the SN type available sooner to the public. For this purpose, we have developed a deep-learning based program for classifying core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) with ultra-low resolution spectra from the SED-Machine spectrograph on the Palomar 60-inch telescope. The program consists of hierarchical classification task layers, with each layer composed of multiple binary classifiers running in parallel to produce a reliable classification. The binary classifiers utilize RNN and CNN architecture and are designed to take multiple inputs to supplement spectra with $g$- and $r$-band photometry from ZTF. On non-host-contaminated and good quality SEDM spectra ("gold" test set) of CCSNe, CCSNscore is ~94% accurate in distinguishing between hydrogen-rich (Type II) and hydrogen-poor (Type Ibc) CCSNe. With light curve input, CCSNscore classifies ~83% of the gold set with high confidence (score $\geq 0.8$ and score-error $&lt;0.05$), with ~98% accuracy. Based on SNIascore's and CCSNscore's real-time performance on bright transients ($m_{pk}\leq18.5$) and our reporting criteria, we expect ~0.5% (~4) true SNe Ia to be misclassified as SNe Ibc and ~6% (~17) of true CCSNe to be misclassified between Type II and Type Ibc annually on the Transient Name Server.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning generated observations of galaxy clusters from dark-matter-only simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04229</link>

Abstract: Hydrodynamical simulations play a fundamental role in modern cosmological research, serving as a crucial bridge between theoretical predictions and observational data. However, due to their computational intensity, these simulations are currently constrained to relatively small volumes. Therefore, this study investigates the feasibility of utilising dark matter-only simulations to generate observable maps of galaxy clusters using a deep learning approach based on the U-Net architecture. We focus on reconstructing Compton-y parameter maps (SZ maps) and bolometric X-ray surface brightness maps (X-ray maps) from total mass density maps. We leverage data from \textsc{The Three Hundred} simulations, selecting galaxy clusters ranging in mass from $10^{13.5} h^{-1}M_{\odot}\leq M_{200} \leq 10^{15.5} h^{-1}M_{\odot}$. Despite the machine learning models being independent of baryonic matter assumptions, a notable limitation is their dependency on the underlying physics of hydrodynamical simulations. To evaluate the reliability of our generated observable maps, we employ various metrics and compare the observable-mass scaling relations. For clusters with masses greater than $2 \times 10^{14} h^{-1} M_{\odot}$, the predictions show excellent agreement with the ground-truth datasets, with percentage errors averaging (0.5 $\pm$ 0.1)\% for the parameters of the scaling laws.</description>

      <title>GRB Redshift Estimation using Machine Learning and the Associated Web-App</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), observed at redshifts as high as 9.4, could serve as valuable probes for investigating the distant Universe. However, this necessitates an increase in the number of GRBs with determined redshifts, as currently, only 12% of GRBs have known redshifts due to observational biases. Aims. We aim to address the shortage of GRBs with measured redshifts, enabling us to fully realize their potential as valuable cosmological probes Methods. Following Dainotti et al. (2024c), we have taken a second step to overcome this issue by adding 30 more GRBs to our ensemble supervised machine learning training sample, an increase of 20%, which will help us obtain better redshift estimates. In addition, we have built a freely accessible and user-friendly web app that infers the redshift of long GRBs (LGRBs) with plateau emission using our machine learning model. The web app is the first of its kind for such a study and will allow the community to obtain redshift estimates by entering the GRB parameters in the app. Results. Through our machine learning model, we have successfully estimated redshifts for 276 LGRBs using X-ray afterglow parameters detected by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and increased the sample of LGRBs with known redshifts by 110%. We also perform Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate the future applicability of this research. Conclusions. The results presented in this research will enable the community to increase the sample of GRBs with known redshift estimates. This can help address many outstanding issues, such as GRB formation rate, luminosity function, and the true nature of low-luminosity GRBs, and enable the application of GRBs as standard candles</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Survey Year 6 Results: Point-spread Function Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the point-spread function (PSF) modeling for weak lensing shear measurement using the full six years of the Dark Energy Survey (DES Y6) data. We review the PSF estimation procedure using the PIFF (PSFs In the Full FOV) software package and describe the key improvements made to PIFF and modeling diagnostics since the DES year three (Y3) analysis: (i) use of external Gaia and infrared photometry catalogs to ensure higher purity of the stellar sample used for model fitting, (ii) addition of color-dependent PSF modeling, the first for any weak lensing analysis, and (iii) inclusion of model diagnostics inspecting fourth-order moments, which can bias weak lensing measurements to a similar degree as second-order modeling errors. Through a comprehensive set of diagnostic tests, we demonstrate the improved accuracy of the Y6 models evident in significantly smaller systematic errors than those of the Y3 analysis, in which all $g$ band data were excluded due to insufficiently accurate PSF models. For the Y6 weak lensing analysis, we include $g$ band photometry data in addition to the $riz$ bands, providing a fourth band for photometric redshift estimation. Looking forward to the next generation of wide-field surveys, we describe several ongoing improvements to PIFF, which will be the default PSF modeling software for weak lensing analyses for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time.</description>
