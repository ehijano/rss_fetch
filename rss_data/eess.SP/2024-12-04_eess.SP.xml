      <title>A new flower pollination algorithm for equalization in synchronous DS/CDMA multiuser communication systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a modified version of an emerging nature-inspired technique, named Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA), for equalizing digital multiuser channels. This equalization involves two different tasks: 1) estimation of the channel impulse response, and 2) estimation of the users' transmitted symbols. The new algorithm is developed and applied in a Direct-Sequence / Code-Division Multiple-Access (DS/CDMA) multiuser communications system. Important issues such as robustness, convergence speed and population diversity control have been in deep investigated. A method based on the entropy of the flowers' fitness is proposed for in-service monitoring and adjusting population diversity. Numerical simulations analyze the performance, showing comparisons with well-known conventional multiuser detectors such as Matched Filter (MF), Minimum Mean Square Error Estimator (MMSEE) or several Bayesian schemes, as well as with other nature-inspired strategies. Numerical analysis shows that the proposed algorithm enables transmission at higher symbol rates under stronger fading and interference conditions, constituting an attractive alternative to previous algorithms, both conventional and nature-inspired, whose performance is frequently sensible to near-far effects and multiple-access interference problems. These results have been validated by running hypothesis tests to confirm statistical significance.</description>

      <title>Radar-based Measurement of the Body Movements of Multiple Students in Classroom Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the feasibility of the radar-based measurement of body movements in scenarios involving multiple students using a pair of 79-GHz millimeter-wave radar systems with array antennas. We quantify the body motion using the Doppler frequency calculated from radar echoes. The measurement accuracy is evaluated for two experimental scenarios, namely university students in an office and elementary school students in a classroom. The body movements measured using the two radar systems are compared to evaluate the repeatability and angle dependency of the measurement. Moreover, in the first scenario, we compare the radar-estimated body movement with subjective evaluation scores provided by two evaluators. In the first scenario, the coefficient of correlation between the radar-estimated body movement and the subjective evaluation score is 0.73 on average, with a maximum value of 0.97; in the second scenario, the average correlation coefficient of body movements measured using two radar systems is as high as 0.78. These results indicate that the proposed approach can be used to monitor the body movements of multiple students in realistic scenarios.</description>

      <title>A New Statistical Model for Waveguide Invariant-Based Range Estimation in Shallow Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the undersea environment, positioning is often challenging, and thus, ranging based on passive acoustic data can provide valuable information for subsurface navigation and source localization. We present a range estimation method based on the waveguide invariant (WI) theory that uses ship noise recorded underwater as an acoustic source. The WI is a scalar parameter that describes the interference patterns in spectrograms caused by pairs of modes of acoustic waves propagating in a waveguide, e.g., in shallow water. The WI theory enables ranging using a single receiver without a detailed knowledge of the environment. The machinery of a large ship induces broadband background noise characterized by sets of prominent narrowband tonal signals. We develop a likelihood function for a WI-based range estimation by introducing a statistical model for the broadband component when it dominates over the background noise. The capability of the resulting range estimation method is demonstrated on real acoustic measurements of a moving container ship recorded during the Seabed Characterization Experiment 2017 (SBCEX17).</description>

      <title>Robust Precoding for Multi-User Visible Light Communications with Quantized Channel Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the design of multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) precoders for indoor visible light communication (VLC) systems. The goal is to minimize the transmitted optical power per light emitting diode (LED) under imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter side. Robust precoders for imperfect CSI available in the literature include noisy and outdated channel estimation cases. However, to the best of our knowledge, no work has considered adding robustness against channel quantization. In this paper, we fill this gap by addressing the case of imperfect CSI due to the quantization of VLC channels. We model the quantization errors in the CSI through polyhedric uncertainty regions. For polyhedric uncertainty regions and positive real channels, as is the case of VLC channels, we show that the robust precoder against channel quantization errors that minimizes the transmitted optical power while guaranteeing a target signal to noise plus interference ratio (SNIR) per user is the solution of a second order cone programming (SOCP) problem. Finally, we evaluate its performance under different quantization levels through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>BiCSI: A Binary Encoding and Fingerprint-Based Matching Algorithm for Wi-Fi Indoor Positioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional global positioning systems often underperform indoors, whereas Wi-Fi has become an effective medium for various radio sensing services. Specifically, utilizing channel state information (CSI) from Wi-Fi networks provides a non-contact method for precise indoor positioning; yet, accurately interpreting the complex CSI matrix to develop a reliable strategy for physical similarity measurement remains challenging. This paper presents BiCSI, which merges binary encoding with fingerprint-based techniques to improve position matching for detecting semi-stationary targets. Inspired by gene sequencing processes, BiCSI initially converts CSI matrices into binary sequences and employs Hamming distances to evaluate signal similarity. The results show that BiCSI achieves an average accuracy above 98% and a mean absolute error (MAE) of less than three centimeters, outperforming algorithms directly dependent on physical measurements by at least two-fold. Moreover, the proposed method for extracting feature vectors from CSI matrices as fingerprints significantly reduces data storage requirements to the kilobyte range, far below the megabytes typically required by conventional machine learning models. Additionally, the results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm adapts well to multiple physical similarity metrics, and remains robust over different time periods, enhancing its utility and versatility in various scenarios.</description>

      <title>VR Based Emotion Recognition Using Deep Multimodal Fusion With Biosignals Across Multiple Anatomical Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emotion recognition is significantly enhanced by integrating multimodal biosignals and IMU data from multiple domains. In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-scale attention-based LSTM architecture, combined with Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks, by leveraging multi-domain signals from the head (Meta Quest Pro VR headset), trunk (Equivital Vest), and peripheral (Empatica Embrace Plus) during affect elicitation via visual stimuli. Signals from 23 participants were recorded, alongside self-assessed valence and arousal ratings after each stimulus. LSTM layers extract features from each modality, while multi-scale attention captures fine-grained temporal dependencies, and SE blocks recalibrate feature importance prior to classification. We assess which domain's signals carry the most distinctive emotional information during VR experiences, identifying key biosignals contributing to emotion detection. The proposed architecture, validated in a user study, demonstrates superior performance in classifying valance and arousal level (high / low), showcasing the efficacy of multi-domain and multi-modal fusion with biosignals (e.g., TEMP, EDA) with IMU data (e.g., accelerometer) for emotion recognition in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>A Tractable Closed-Form Approximation of the Ergodic Rate in Poisson Cellular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The employment of stochastic geometry for the analysis and design of ultra dense networks (UDNs) has provided significant insights into network densification. In addition to the characterization of the network performance and behavior, these tools can also be exploited toward solving complex optimization problems that could maximize the capacity benefits arising in UDNs. However, this is preconditioned on the existence of tractable closed form expressions for the considered figures of merit. In this course, the present paper introduces an accurate approximation for the moment generating function (MGF) of the aggregate other-cell interference created by base stations whose positions follow a Poisson point process of given spatial density. Given the pivotal role of the MGF of the aggregate interference in stochastic geometry and the tractability of the derived MGF, the latter can be employed to substantially simplify ensuing stochastic geometry analyses. Subsequently, the present paper employs the introduced MGF to provide closed form expressions for the downlink ergodic capacity for the interference limited case, and validates the accuracy of these expressions by the use of extensive Monte Carlo simulations. The derived expressions depend on the density of users and base stations, setting out a densification road map for network operators and designers of significant value.</description>

      <title>User Grouping and Resource Allocation in Multiuser MIMO Systems under SWIPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a broadcast multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) network with multiple users and simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). In this scenario, it is assumed that some users are able to harvest power from radio frequency (RF) signals to recharge batteries through wireless power transfer from the transmitter, while others are served simultaneously with data transmission. The criterion driving the optimization and design of the system is based on the weighted sum rate for the users being served with data. At the same time, constraints stating minimum per-user harvested powers are included in the optimization problem. This paper derives the structure of the optimal transmit covariance matrices in the case where both types of users are present simultaneously in the network, particularizing the results to the cases where either only harvesting nodes or only information users are to be served. The tradeoff between the achieved weighted sum rate and the powers harvested by the user terminals is analyzed and evaluated using the rate-power (R-P) region. Finally, we propose a two-stage user grouping mechanism that decides which users should be scheduled to receive information and which users should be configured to harvest energy from the RF signals in each particular scheduling period, this being one of the main contributions of this paper.</description>

      <title>Communicate or Sense? AP Mode Selection in mmWave Cell-Free Massive MIMO-ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a promising technology for future mobile networks, enabling sensing applications to be performed by existing communication networks, consequently improving the system efficiency. Millimeter wave (mmWave) signals provide high sensing resolution and high data rate but suffer from sensitivity to blockage. Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), with a large number of distributed access points (APs), can overcome this challenge by providing macro diversity against changing blockages and can save energy consumption by deactivating unfavorable APs. Thus, in this work, we propose a joint dynamic AP mode selection and power allocation scheme for mmWave cell-free massive MIMO-ISAC, where APs are assigned either as ISAC transmitters, sensing receivers, or shut down. Due to the large size of the original problem, we propose three different sub-optimal algorithms that minimize the number of active APs while guaranteeing the sensing and communication constraints. Numerical results demonstrate that assigning ISAC transmitters only satisfying communication constraints, followed up by sensing receiver assignment only for sensing constraint achieves the best performance-complexity balance.</description>

      <title>ECG-SleepNet: Deep Learning-Based Comprehensive Sleep Stage Classification Using ECG Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate sleep stage classification is essential for understanding sleep disorders and improving overall health. This study proposes a novel three-stage approach for sleep stage classification using ECG signals, offering a more accessible alternative to traditional methods that often rely on complex modalities like EEG. In Stages 1 and 2, we initialize the weights of two networks, which are then integrated in Stage 3 for comprehensive classification. In the first phase, we estimate key features using Feature Imitating Networks (FINs) to achieve higher accuracy and faster convergence. The second phase focuses on identifying the N1 sleep stage through the time-frequency representation of ECG signals. Finally, the third phase integrates models from the previous stages and employs a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) to classify five distinct sleep stages. Additionally, data augmentation techniques, particularly SMOTE, are used in enhancing classification capabilities for underrepresented stages like N1. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in the classification performance, with an overall accuracy of 80.79% an overall kappa of 0.73. The model achieves specific accuracies of 86.70% for Wake, 60.36% for N1, 83.89% for N2, 84.85% for N3, and 87.16% for REM. This study emphasizes the importance of weight initialization and data augmentation in optimizing sleep stage classification with ECG signals.</description>

      <title>A Machine Hearing System for Robust Cough Detection Based on a High-Level Representation of Band-Specific Audio Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cough is a protective reflex conveying information on the state of the respiratory system. Cough assessment has been limited so far to subjective measurement tools or uncomfortable (i.e., non-wearable) cough monitors. This limits the potential of real-time cough monitoring to improve respiratory care. Objective: This paper presents a machine hearing system for audio-based robust cough segmentation that can be easily deployed in mobile scenarios. Methods: Cough detection is performed in two steps. First, a short-term spectral feature set is separately computed in five predefined frequency bands: [0, 0.5), [0.5, 1), [1, 1.5), [1.5, 2), and [2, 5.5125] kHz. Feature selection and combination are then applied to make the short-term feature set robust enough in different noisy scenarios. Second, high-level data representation is achieved by computing the mean and standard deviation of short-term descriptors in 300 ms long-term frames. Finally, cough detection is carried out using a support vector machine trained with data from different noisy scenarios. The system is evaluated using a patient signal database which emulates three real-life scenarios in terms of noise content. Results: The system achieves 92.71% sensitivity, 88.58% specificity, and 90.69% Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Conclusion: Our research outcome paves the way to create a device for cough monitoring in real-life situations. Significance: Our proposal is aligned with a more comfortable and less disruptive patient monitoring, with benefits for patients (allows self-monitoring of cough symptoms), practitioners (e.g., assessment of treatments or better clinical understanding of cough patterns), and national health systems (by reducing hospitalizations).</description>

      <title>Stimulated Raman Scattering in Nonlinear Silicon Nanophotonic Waveguides: Theory and Applications in Photonic Integrated Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonics caught world attention since channel capacity limit of metallic interconnects approached due to research and design in high speed digital processors. Use of dielectrics, instead, suitable for light propagation was more attractive due to its extremely wide bandwidth. Many of the devices, both active and passive, have been demonstrated using these insulating materials. Due to its excellent optical characteristics, established fabrication history, and cheaper throughput, silicon found its place in photonics arena. However, due to its indirect band structure, efficient light sources are not possible using silicon as the base material. Nevertheless, techniques such as stimulated Raman scattering and third-harmonic generation have made it possible to avoid this natural hurdle in the path of silicon as a light source. This paper reviews basic theory of stimulated Raman scattering, its applications in the context of silicon based photonic integrated circuits and describes ways to improve this nonlinear effect. This paper also covers few of the most important demonstrations of stimulated Raman scattering published in literature from the last decade.</description>

      <title>Exploring Evolutionary Spectral Clustering for Temporal-Smoothed Clustered Cell-Free Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clustered cell-free networking, which dynamically partitions the whole network into nonoverlapping subnetworks, has been recently proposed to mitigate the cell-edge problem in cellular networks. However, prior works only focused on optimizing clustered cell-free networking in static scenarios with fixed users. This could lead to a large number of handovers in the practical dynamic environment with moving users, seriously hindering the implementation of clustered cell-free networking in practice. This paper considers user mobility and aims to simultaneously maximize the sum rate and minimize the number of handovers. By transforming the multi-objective optimization problem into a time-varying graph partitioning problem and exploring evolutionary spectral clustering, a temporal-smoothed clustered cell-free networking algorithm is proposed, which is shown to be effective in smoothing network partitions over time and reducing handovers while maintaining similar sum rate.</description>

      <title>Learn More by Using Less: Distributed Learning with Energy-Constrained Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a solution for distributed model training across decentralized, privacy-preserving devices, but the different energy capacities of participating devices (system heterogeneity) constrain real-world implementations. These energy limitations not only reduce model accuracy but also increase dropout rates, impacting on convergence in practical FL deployments. In this work, we propose LeanFed, an energy-aware FL framework designed to optimize client selection and training workloads on battery-constrained devices. LeanFed leverages adaptive data usage by dynamically adjusting the fraction of local data each device utilizes during training, thereby maximizing device participation across communication rounds while ensuring they do not run out of battery during the process. We rigorously evaluate LeanFed against traditional FedAvg on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, simulating various levels of data heterogeneity and device participation rates. Results show that LeanFed consistently enhances model accuracy and stability, particularly in settings with high data heterogeneity and limited battery life, by mitigating client dropout and extending device availability. This approach demonstrates the potential of energy-efficient, privacy-preserving FL in real-world, large-scale applications, setting a foundation for robust and sustainable pervasive AI on resource-constrained networks.</description>

      <title>Flexible-Antenna Systems: A Pinching-Antenna Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flexible-antenna systems have recently received significant research interest due to their capability to reconfigure wireless channels intelligently. This paper focuses on a new type of flexible-antenna technology, termed pinching antennas, which can be realized by applying small dielectric particles on a waveguide. Analytical results are first developed for the simple case with a single pinching antenna and a single waveguide, where the unique feature of the pinching-antenna system to create strong line-of-sight links and mitigate large-scale path loss is demonstrated. An advantageous feature of pinching-antenna systems is that multiple pinching antennas can be activated on a single waveguide at no extra cost; however, they must be fed with the same signal. This feature motivates the application of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and analytical results are provided to demonstrate the superior performance of NOMA-assisted pinching-antenna systems. Finally, the case with multiple pinching antennas and multiple waveguides is studied, which resembles a classical multiple-input single-input (MISO) interference channel. By exploiting the capability of pinching antennas to reconfigure the wireless channel, it is revealed that a performance upper bound on the interference channel becomes achievable, where the achievability conditions are also identified. Computer simulation results are presented to verify the developed analytical results and demonstrate the superior performance of pinching-antenna systems.</description>

      <title>Analysis, Design, and Fabrication of a High-Gain Low-Profile Metasurface Antenna Using Direct Feeding of Sievenpiper s HIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: HISs have recently shown the ability to support leaky waves, and to excite plasmonic and HIS resonance frequency modes for use as an antenna. In this paper, we analyzed, designed, and fabricated a TMA by directly feeding edge-located HIS cells through a microstrip feeding network. In contrast to other metasurface antennas that necessitate an external antenna to excite metasurfaces, our approach is inspired by the TMA design methodology that directly feeds the HIS cells rather than using it as a reflector. We developed a circuit model for the proposed structure and compared the results with those obtained from full-wave simulations. In addition, our further objective was to simplify the structure based on the working principle of the proposed antenna. This objective was achieved by converting square patches into parallel strip lines, leading to an aperture efficiency of 0.77. This simplification also creates additional space to explore various resonant patterns on the top surface and the feeding network on the bottom surface of the TMA. Full-wave simulation results indicate that, despite the compact dimensions of the proposed array with 64 electrically small patch resonators (1.84{\lambda}*1.84{\lambda}*0.032{\lambda}, where{\lambda}is the free space wavelength at 6.0 GHz), it achieves a realized gain, HPBW of about 15.1 dBi and 28{\deg} respectively at 6 GHz. Finally, we constructed a prototype and conducted measurements to validate the design. Measured results demonstrate good agreement with simulation ones with a gain of about 13.5 (+-0.5) dBi and a HPBW of 27{\deg} at 6 GHz. The proposed TMA is scaled to fit within the required dimensions for smart handheld devices at higher frequencies, while maintaining high gain capability. The design s scalability, single-feed, and compact footprint make it optimal for diverse wireless communication systems, such as car to car communications.</description>

      <title>Mobile Cell-Free Massive MIMO with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: A Scalable Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) offers significant advantages in mobility scenarios, mainly due to the elimination of cell boundaries and strong macro diversity. In this paper, we examine the downlink performance of cell-free mMIMO systems equipped with mobile-APs utilizing the concept of unmanned aerial vehicles, where mobility and power control are jointly considered to effectively enhance coverage and suppress interference. However, the high computational complexity, poor collaboration, limited scalability, and uneven reward distribution of conventional optimization schemes lead to serious performance degradation and instability. These factors complicate the provision of consistent and high-quality service across all user equipments in downlink cell-free mMIMO systems. Consequently, we propose a novel scalable framework enhanced by multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to tackle these challenges. The established framework incorporates a graph neural network (GNN)-aided communication mechanism to facilitate effective collaboration among agents, a permutation architecture to improve scalability, and a directional decoupling architecture to accurately distinguish contributions. In the numerical results, we present comparisons of different optimization schemes and network architectures, which reveal that the proposed scheme can effectively enhance system performance compared to conventional schemes due to the adoption of advanced technologies. In particular, appropriately compressing the observation space of agents is beneficial for achieving a better balance between performance and convergence.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Informed Deep Neural Networks for Power Flow Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces PINN4PF, an end-to-end deep learning architecture for power flow (PF) analysis that effectively captures the nonlinear dynamics of large-scale modern power systems. The proposed neural network (NN) architecture consists of two important advancements in the training pipeline: (A) a double-head feed-forward NN that aligns with PF analysis, including an activation function that adjusts to active and reactive power consumption patterns, and (B) a physics-based loss function that partially incorporates power system topology information. The effectiveness of the proposed architecture is illustrated through 4-bus, 15-bus, 290-bus, and 2224-bus test systems and is evaluated against two baselines: a linear regression model (LR) and a black-box NN (MLP). The comparison is based on (i) generalization ability, (ii) robustness, (iii) impact of training dataset size on generalization ability, (iv) accuracy in approximating derived PF quantities (specifically line current, line active power, and line reactive power), and (v) scalability. Results demonstrate that PINN4PF outperforms both baselines across all test systems by up to two orders of magnitude not only in terms of direct criteria, e.g., generalization ability but also in terms of approximating derived physical quantities.</description>

      <title>An ADHD Diagnostic Interface Based on EEG Spectrograms and Deep Learning Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative approach to Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis by employing deep learning (DL) techniques on electroencephalography (EEG) signals. This method addresses the limitations of current behavior-based diagnostic methods, which often lead to misdiagnosis and gender bias. By utilizing a publicly available EEG dataset and converting the signals into spectrograms, a Resnet-18 convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was used to extract features for ADHD classification. The model achieved a high precision, recall, and an overall F1 score of 0.9. Feature extraction highlighted significant brain regions (frontopolar, parietal, and occipital lobes) associated with ADHD. These insights guided the creation of a three-part digital diagnostic system, facilitating cost-effective and accessible ADHD screening, especially in school environments. This system enables earlier and more accurate identification of students at risk for ADHD, providing timely support to enhance their developmental outcomes. This study showcases the potential of integrating EEG analysis with DL to enhance ADHD diagnostics, presenting a viable alternative to traditional methods.</description>

      <title>A Near-Field Super-Resolution Network for Accelerating Antenna Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a deep neural network-enabled method to accelerate near-field (NF) antenna measurement. We develop a Near-field Super-resolution Network (NFS-Net) to reconstruct significantly undersampled near-field data as high-resolution data, which considerably reduces the number of sampling points required for NF measurement and thus improves measurement efficiency. The high-resolution near-field data reconstructed by the network is further processed by a near-field-to-far-field (NF2FF) transformation to obtain far-field antenna radiation patterns. Our experiments demonstrate that the NFS-Net exhibits both accuracy and generalizability in restoring high-resolution near-field data from low-resolution input. The NF measurement workflow that combines the NFS-Net and the NF2FF algorithm enables accurate radiation pattern characterization with only 11% of the Nyquist rate samples. Though the experiments in this study are conducted on a planar setup with a uniform grid, the proposed method can serve as a universal strategy to accelerate measurements under different setups and conditions.</description>

      <title>PITN: Physics-Informed Temporal Networks for Cuffless Blood Pressure Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monitoring blood pressure with non-invasive sensors has gained popularity for providing comfortable user experiences, one of which is a significant function of smart wearables. Although providing a comfortable user experience, such methods are suffering from the demand for a significant amount of realistic data to train an individual model for each subject, especially considering the invasive or obtrusive BP ground-truth measurements. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel physics-informed temporal network~(PITN) with adversarial contrastive learning to enable precise BP estimation with very limited data. Specifically, we first enhance the physics-informed neural network~(PINN) with the temporal block for investigating BP dynamics' multi-periodicity for personal cardiovascular cycle modeling and temporal variation. We then employ adversarial training to generate extra physiological time series data, improving PITN's robustness in the face of sparse subject-specific training data. Furthermore, we utilize contrastive learning to capture the discriminative variations of cardiovascular physiologic phenomena. This approach aggregates physiological signals with similar blood pressure values in latent space while separating clusters of samples with dissimilar blood pressure values. Experiments on three widely-adopted datasets with different modailties (\emph{i.e.,} bioimpedance, PPG, millimeter-wave) demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed methods over previous state-of-the-art approaches. The code is available at~\url{https://github.com/Zest86/ACL-PITN}.</description>
