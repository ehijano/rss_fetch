      <title>A hot white dwarf merger remnant revealed by an ultraviolet detection of carbon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric carbon has been detected in the optical spectra of six hydrogen-rich ultra-massive white dwarfs, revealing large carbon abundances (log C/H &gt; $-$0.5) attributable to the convective dredge-up of internal carbon into thin hydrogen surface layers. These rare white dwarfs likely originate from stellar mergers, making them "smoking guns" for one of the binary evolution channels leading to thermonuclear supernovae. However, optical spectroscopy can uncover only the most carbon-enriched objects, suggesting that many more merger remnants may masquerade as normal pure-hydrogen atmosphere white dwarfs. Here, we report the discovery of atmospheric carbon in a Hubble Space Telescope far-ultraviolet spectrum of WD$\,$0525+526, a long-known hydrogen-rich ultra-massive white dwarf. The carbon abundance (log C/H = $-$4.62) is 4$-$5 dex lower than in the six counterparts and thus detectable only at ultraviolet wavelengths. We find that the total masses of hydrogen and helium in the envelope ($10^{-13.8}$ and $10^{-12.6}$ of the total white dwarf mass) are substantially lower than those expected from single-star evolution, implying that WD$\,$0525+526 is a merger remnant. Our modelling indicates that the low surface carbon abundance arises from an envelope structure in which a thin hydrogen-rich layer floats atop a semi-convection zone$-$a process that has been largely overlooked in white dwarfs. Our study highlights the importance of ultraviolet spectroscopy in identifying and characterising merger remnants.</description>

      <title>Meridional circulation molecular-weighted</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meridional circulation in stratified stellar/planetary interiors in the presence of stable molecular weight gradients remains poorly understood, thereby affecting angular momentum transport in evolutionary models. We extend the downward control principle of atmospheric sciences to include compositional stratification. Using a linearized analysis we show that stable compositional gradients slow down the penetration of circulation into the depths, emphasizing the importance of time-dependent solutions. However, additional effects such as horizontal turbulence or magnetic fields are needed to halt it completely. We also find limits demarcating linear and nonlinear regimes in terms of Schmidt and Rossby numbers. Nonlinear simulations exhibit compositional mixing due to meridional currents, enabling deeper penetration than otherwise. We propose slowly evolving and steady-state for the solar tachocline, and helioseismically observed heavy element abundances, acknowledging the absence of constraints on the radial variation of the Schmidt number. In the context of stellar evolution, differential rotation profiles of solar-type main-sequence stars may follow analytical solutions extending from Banik &amp; Menou (2024), thereby aiding further probes into magneto/hydrodynamic instabilities and outward angular momentum transport.</description>

      <title>3D hydrodynamic simulations of massive main-sequence stars -- IV. Internal gravity waves matter for SLF variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The power spectrum of light curves from satellites like CoRoT and TESS of massive main-sequence stars have shown stochastic low-frequency (SLF) variability or excess power in the low frequency regime. To investigate the origin of this phenomenon, we conducted high-resolution 3D hydrodynamic \texttt{PPMstar} simulations of a non-rotating $25 \mathrm{M_\odot}$ zero-age main sequence star, modeling 95\% of the stellar structure with both core and thin outer envelope convection zones. The thin outer envelope convection zone was implemented through modification of the opacity model, shifting the Fe opacity bump inward and enhancing its amplitude to ensure computational feasibility. The luminosity power spectrum from our primary simulation (M424) exhibits qualitative and quantitative characteristics similar to observed SLF variability, with a two-order-of-magnitude difference between high and low frequencies matching observational data. The spectrum displays distinct features attributable to internal gravity waves (IGWs) evanescent in the thin outer envelope convection zone, originating from the thin outer envelope convective boundary. To isolate the contributions of different stellar regions, we performed controlled numerical experiments with suppressed core convection, envelope convection and thin outer envelope-only configurations. The comparative analysis demonstrates that thin outer envelope convection alone produces significantly less power at low frequencies than the full-star configuration. Our results indicate that IGWs excited at the thin outer envelope convection inner boundary and interacting with the thin outer envelope convection are the dominant contributors to SLF variability in our simulations. The IGW spectral characteristics depend on the complete stellar stratification, demonstrating that interior structure could influence observable surface variability.</description>

      <title>Hot springs and dust reservoirs: JWST reveals the dusty, molecular aftermath of extragalactic stellar mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of four Luminous Red Novae (LRNe): dusty, extragalactic transients from stellar mergers following common-envelope evolution (CEE) in massive binary stars. Our targets - AT2021blu, AT2021biy, AT2018bwo, and M31-LRN-2015 - span a broad range in progenitor primary masses ($\approx$3-24M$_{\odot}$) and post-merger ages ($\approx$1100-3700 days). All four were observed with the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) from 5-25$\mu$m; AT2021blu and AT2021biy additionally have 5-12$\mu$m spectra from the Low-Resolution Spectrometer. These spectra show strong features of oxygen-rich molecules, including water vapor, supporting the recent association of water fountain sources with CEE. Radiative transfer modeling of the spectral energy distributions yields dust masses of $\approx$4.2$\times10^{-5}$, 3$\times10^{-4}$, 7.5$\times10^{-5}$, and 7.7$\times10^{-4}$M$_{\odot}$ respectively - corresponding to $\approx10$%, 60%, 6% and 12% of median dust masses in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) at similar phases. Accounting for their occurrence rates, we estimate that LRNe can contribute $\sim$25% as much dust as CCSNe to the cosmic dust budget. Furthermore, the lower expansion velocities of LRNe may reduce dust destruction by reverse shocks compared to CCSNe, potentially increasing this contribution. In addition to dust masses, we use our \emph{JWST} observations to measure late-time properties such as the luminosities, temperatures, radii, and dust-to-gas ratios of the merger remnants. Our results highlight the need for broader infrared studies of LRNe to quantify their contribution to the cosmic dust budget, study the evolution of oxygen-rich molecules, and probe the final fates of CEE.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Search for Main-Sequence Dipper Stars Using the Zwicky Transient Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Main-sequence dipper stars, characterized by irregular and often aperiodic luminosity dimming events, offer a unique opportunity to explore the variability of circumstellar material and its potential links to planet formation, debris disks, and broadly star-planet interactions. The advent of all-sky time-domain surveys has enabled the rapid discovery of these unique systems. We present the results of a large systematic search for main-sequence dipper stars, conducted across a sample of 63 million FGK main-sequence stars using data from Gaia eDR3 and the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey. Using a novel light curve scoring algorithm and a scalable workflow tailored for analyzing millions of light curves, we have identified 81 new dipper star candidates. Our sample reveals a diverse phenomenology of light curve dimming shapes, such as skewed and symmetric dimmings with timescales spanning days to years, some of which closely resemble exaggerated versions of KIC 8462852. Our sample reveals no clear periodicity patterns sensitive to ZTF in many of these dippers and no infrared excess or irregular variability. Using archival data collated for this study, we thoroughly investigate several classification scenarios and hypothesize that the mechanisms of such dimming events are either driven by circumstellar clumps or occultations by stellar/sub-stellar companions with disks. Our study marks a significant step forward in understanding main-sequence dipper stars.</description>

      <title>Precise Parameters for Two LISA Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present precise parameters for two compact double white dwarf binaries, SDSS J232230.20+050942.0 (J2322+0509) and SDSS J063449.92+380352.2 (J0634+3803), with orbital periods of 20 and 26.5 minutes, respectively. These systems will serve as verification sources for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). To significantly improve the electromagnetic (EM) constraints on these two systems and the LISA detectability predictions, we conducted spectroscopic follow-up observations using HST/STIS, Keck I/LRIS, and Keck II/ESI. Our analysis significantly improves the temperature, surface gravity, and mass constraints for both primary and secondary components in J2322+0509, as well as dynamical properties such as radial velocities and orbital periods in both systems. For J2322+0509, we derive an updated inclination of $i$ = 25$^{+4.5}_{-3.0}$ deg, while for J0634+3803, we obtain $i$ = 43$^{+7.0}_{-5.6}$ deg. We assess the detectability of these sources using LDASOFT. Incorporating EM priors on inclination significantly enhances the gravitational wave signal recovery, reducing uncertainties in amplitude by a factor of 2-4 and shortening the detection time by up to a few months. Our results underscore the importance of multi-messenger observations in characterizing double white dwarf binaries and maximizing LISA's early scientific capabilities.</description>

      <title>Rediscussion of eclipsing binaries. Paper XXVI. The F-type long-period system HP Draconis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HP Dra is a well-detached eclipsing binary containing two late-F stars on an orbit with a relatively large period of 10.76 d and a small eccentricity of 0.036. It has been observed in 14 sectors using the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We use these data plus literature spectroscopic measurements to establish the properties of the component stars to high precision, finding masses of 1.135 +/- 0.002 Msun and 1.098 +/- 0.002 Msun and radii of 1.247 +/- 0.005 Rsun and 1.150 +/- 0.005 Rsun. We find a much smaller third light than previous analyses, resulting in significant changes to the measured radii. These properties match theoretical predictions for an age of 3.5 Gyr and a solar metallicity. We present a spectrum of the Ca H and K lines in which chromospheric activity is visible from both components. The distance we find to the system, 77.9 +/- 1.2 pc, matches the Gaia DR3 parallax value of 79.2 +/- 0.3 pc.</description>

      <title>MONOS: Multiplicity Of Northern O-type Spectroscopic systems. III. New orbits and Gaia TESS analysis for 10 SB2E systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MONOS project (Multiplicity Of Northern O-type Spectroscopic systems) aims to characterize O-type spectroscopic binaries in the northern hemisphere (dec &gt; -20 deg) using high-resolution spectroscopy and multi-epoch photometry. This study uses Gaia DR3 epoch photometry and TESS light curves to detect periodic variability and refine orbital solutions. We analyze ten O-type binaries with quality Gaia and TESS data and available high-resolution spectra, complemented by Hipparcos or MUDEHaR photometry. Periods are derived using three techniques and combined with radial velocities to model each system with the phoebe code, yielding orbital and stellar parameters. We present eight previously unpublished orbits-two with new periods-and refine two others. In several cases, our periods match Gaia's, though we highlight issues such as half-period aliases. Among our key results, we report the first known Oe+O spectroscopic binary (BD +61 487) and a system of overcontact O-type supergiants in an eccentric orbit with evidence of past mass transfer (HD 169 727). The solutions are consistent with spectral classifications and theory, including short periods (&lt; 3 days), high mass ratios, and semi-detached or overcontact configurations. These results expand the sample of O-type binaries with robust orbital characterization, especially in the short-period regime where tidal effects and mass transfer dominate. The combined use of Gaia, TESS, and spectroscopy proves effective and scalable, supporting future surveys and aiding our understanding of massive multiple-star evolution.</description>

      <title>Wave coupling in partially ionized plasmas with shear flows I. Fast-to-Alfv\'en transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the interplay between magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves and shear flows in a partially ionized solar plasma, focusing on the energy exchange mediated by the flow and the transformation between wave modes. We consider a simple model composed of a uniform partially ionized plasma with a straight magnetic field. A shear flow is present in the direction of the magnetic field with a velocity that varies linearly across the magnetic field. The linearized MHD equations in the single-fluid approximation are used, which include the ambipolar diffusion term due to ion-neutral collisions. A nonmodal approach is adopted, in order to convert the flow spatial inhomogeneity into a temporal one, adding a temporal dependence into the component of the wavevector in the direction of the flow inhomogeneity. A system of three ordinary differential equations is derived, which generally governs the temporal evolution of the coupled MHD waves, their interaction with the shear flow, and their ambipolar damping. Numerical solutions are computed to study the coupling and mutual transformation between the fast magnetosonic wave and the Alfv\'en wave. A detailed parameter study is conducted, demonstrating how the energy transfer and mode transformation are affected. The role of ambipolar diffusion is investigated by comparing the results of the ideal case with those obtained when ambipolar diffusion is included. It is found that ambipolar diffusion can significantly affect the efficiency of the energy exchange between modes and introduces a new coupling mechanism. Additionally, a specific application to solar prominence threads is included, showing that wave coupling and energy exchange can occur within these and other similar structures in the solar atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Probing chromospheric fine structures with an H{\alpha} proxy using MURaM-ChE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: H$\alpha$ observations of the solar chromosphere reveal dynamic small-scale structures known as spicules at the limb and rapid blue and red shifted excursions (RBEs/RREs) on-disk. We want to understand what drives these dynamic features, their magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) properties and their role in energy and heat transport to the upper solar atmosphere. To do this, we aim to develop a proxy for synthetic H$\alpha$ observations in radiative-MHD simulations to help identify these features. We use the chromospheric extension to the MURaM code (MURaM-ChE) to simulate an enhanced network region. We develop a proxy for H$\alpha$ based on a photon escape probability. This is a Doppler-shifted proxy that we use to identify fine structures in the line wings. We study on-disk features in 3D, obtaining their 3D structure from the absorption coefficient. We validate the H$\alpha$ proxy by comparing it against features detected in the wings of H$\alpha$ synthesized using MULTI3D. We detect numerous small-scale structures rooted at the network patches, similar to observations in H$\alpha$. The dynamics of an example feature (RBE) at a Doppler shift of 37 km/s show that flux emergence and consequent reconnection drive the formation of this feature. Pressure gradient forces build up to drive a flow along the field line carrying the feature, making it a jet. There is strong viscous and resistive heating at the first appearance of the feature associated with the flux emergence. At the same time and location, a heating front appears and propagates along the field lines at speeds comparable to the Alfven velocity. We show that a synthetic observable based on an escape probability is able to reliably identify features observed with the H$\alpha$ spectral line. We demonstrate its applicability by studying the formation, dynamics and properties of an RBE.</description>

      <title>Dance to Demise -- How Massive Stars May Form Dense Circumstellar Shells Before Explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of red supergiant (RSG) progenitors of core-collapse (CC) supernovae (SNe) with initial masses between 12-20 Msun focusing on effects of enhanced mass loss due to pulsation-driven instabilities in their envelopes and subsequent dynamical ejections during advanced stages of nuclear burning. Using time-dependent mass loss rates from detailed MESA stellar evolution models, including prescriptions for both pulsation-driven superwinds and shock-induced ejections, we construct the circumstellar medium (CSM) before the SN explosion. We calculate resulting CSM density profiles and column densities considering the radiation-driven acceleration of the stellar wind. Our models produce episodes of enhanced mass loss ~10^-4-10^-2 Msun/yr in the last centuries-decades before explosion forming dense CSM (&gt;~10^-15 g/cm^3 at distances &lt;~10^15 cm) - consistent with multi-wavelength observations of Type II SNe such as SN 2023ixf, SN 2020ywx, SN 2017hcc, SN 2005ip and SN 1998S. The formation of such dense CS shells, as predicted by our single star RSG models, provides a natural explanation for observed flash-ionization signatures, X-ray and radio emission, and has important implications for dust formation around Type II SNe.</description>

Observations revealed the long-term evolution of the large-scale magnetic field reconstructed with Zeeman-Doppler imaging, and a diversity of their topologies. These large-scale magnetic fields only account for a small amount of the unsigned magnetic flux that can be probed by directly modeling the Zeeman broadening of spectral lines in unpolarized spectra. We aim at investigating the long-term behavior of the average small-scale magnetic field of M dwarfs with time, and assess our ability to detect rotational modulation from time series of field measurements derived from unpolarized spectra. We perform fits of synthetic spectra computed with ZeeTurbo to near-infrared high-resolution spectra recorded with SPIRou between 2019 and 2024 in the context of the SLS and SPICE large programs. The analysis is performed on the spectra of 2 partially convective (AD Leo, DS Leo) and 3 fully convective (PM J18482+0741, CN Leo, Barnard star) M dwarfs, along with EV Lac whose mass is close to the fully-convective limit. Our analysis provides measurements of the average small-scale magnetic field, which are compared to longitudinal magnetic field and temperature variation measurements (d$Temp$) obtained from the same data. We were able to detect the rotation period in the small-scale magnetic field series for 4 of the 6 stars in our sample. We find that the average magnetic field can vary by up to 0.3 kG throughout the year (e.g., CN Leo), or of up to 1 kG across rotation phases. The rotation periods retrieved from longitudinal and small-scale magnetic fields are found in agreement within error bars. d$Temp$ measurements are found to anti-correlate with small-scale magnetic field measurements for three stars (EV Lac, DS Leo and Barnard's star).</description>

      <title>Beta Canis Majoris: The Other Major Ionization Source of the Local Interstellar Clouds</title>

Abstract: Two nearby B-type stars, $\epsilon$ CMa ($124\pm2$ pc) and $\beta$ CMa ($151\pm5$ pc), are important contributors to the photoionization of the local interstellar clouds. At spectral type B1 II-III, $\beta$ CMa is slightly hotter than $\epsilon$ CMa (B2 II-III), but its ionizing flux at Earth is attenuated by a much larger H I column density. At the external surface of the clouds, the two stars produce similar fluxes in the Lyman continuum (LyC). From the $\beta$ CMa angular diameter, bolometric flux, and position on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, we obtain a consistent set of stellar parameters: $T_{\rm eff} = 25,180\pm1120$ K, $\log g = 3.70\pm0.08$, radius $R = 8.44\pm0.56\,R_{\odot}$, mass $M = 13\pm1\,M_{\odot}$, and luminosity $L = 10^{4.41\pm0.06}\, L_{\odot}$. The EUVE-observed fluxes and non-LTE model atmospheres are used to determine the ionizing photon production rate $Q_{\rm H} = 10^{46.0}$ photons s$^{-1}$ and fluxes incident on the local clouds, $\Phi_{\rm HI} \approx 3700$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and $\Phi_{\rm HeI} \approx 110$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the H I and He I continua. The corresponding photoionization rates are $\Gamma_{\rm HI} \approx 1.5\times10^{-14}$ s$^{-1}$ and $\Gamma_{\rm HeI} \approx 7.3\times10^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$. Within the local cloud, the LyC flux is attenuated by an H I column density $N_{\rm HI} = (1.9\pm0.1)\times10^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$, with optical depth $\tau_{\rm LL} = 12.0\pm 0.6$ at the Lyman limit. The radial velocities and proper motions of $\beta$ CMa and $\epsilon$ CMa indicate that both stars passed within $10\pm1$ pc of the Sun approximately 4.4 Myr ago, with incident ionizing fluxes 180-200 times larger. Their EUV radiation photoionized and heated the tunnel in the local interstellar gas, associated dynamically with past supernova explosions in the Sco-Cen OB association.</description>

      <title>Analysis and simulations of binary black hole merger spins -- the question of spin-axis tossing at black hole formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of binary black hole (BH) mergers remains a topic of active debate, with effective spins (chi_eff) measured by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration providing crucial insights. In this study, our objective is to investigate the empirical chi_eff distribution (and constrain individual spin components) of binary BH mergers and compare them with extensive simulations, assuming that they originate purely from isolated binaries or a mixture of formation channels. We explore scenarios using BH kicks with and without the effect of spin-axis tossing during BH formation. We employ simple yet robust Monte Carlo simulations of the final core collapse forming the second-born BH, using minimal assumptions to ensure transparency and reproducibility. The synthetic chi_eff distribution is compared to the empirical data from LVK science runs O1-O3 using functional data analysis, kernel density estimations, and three different statistical tests, accounting for data uncertainties. We find strong indications for spin-axis tossing during BH formation if LVK sources are dominated by the isolated binary channel. Simulations with spin-axis tossing achieve high p-values (up to 0.882) using Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Cramer-von Mises, and Anderson-Darling tests, while without tossing, all p-values drop below 0.001 for isolated binaries. A statistically acceptable solution without tossing, however, emerges if ~72+/-8% of detected binary BH mergers result from dynamical interactions causing random BH spin directions. Finally, for an isolated binary origin, we find a preference for mass reversal in ~30% of the progenitor binaries. Predictions from this study can be tested with LVK O4+O5 data as well as the 3G detectors, Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, enabling improved constraints on formation channel ratios and the critical question of BH spin-axis tossing.</description>

      <title>Worlds Next Door: A Candidate Giant Planet Imaged in the Habitable Zone of $\alpha$ Cen A. II. Binary Star Modeling, Planet and Exozodi Search, and Sensitivity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JWST observed our closest solar twin, $\alpha$ Cen A, with the MIRI coronagraph in F1550C (15.5 $\mu$m) at three distinct epochs between August 2024 and April 2025. For the first time with JWST, we demonstrate the application of reference star differential imaging to simultaneously subtract the coronagraphic image of a primary star and the point spread function (PSF) of its binary companion to conduct a deep search for exoplanets and dust emission. We achieve a typical 5$\sigma$ point source contrast sensitivity between $\sim$$10^{-5}$-$10^{-4}$ at separations $\gtrsim$ 1" and an exozodiacal disk (coplanar with $\alpha$ Cen AB) sensitivity of $\sim$5-8$\times$ the Solar System's zodiacal cloud around $\alpha$ Cen A. The latter is an extraordinary limit, representing the deepest sensitivity to exozodiacal disks achieved for any stellar system to date. Post-processing with the PCA-KLIP algorithm reveals a point source, called $S1$, in August 2024, detected at S/N $=$ 4-6 (3.3-4.3$\sigma$), a separation of $\approx$1.5" (2 au), and with a F1550C flux (contrast) of $\approx$3.5 mJy ($\approx 5.5 \times 10^{-5}$). Various tests conducted with the data show that $S1$ is unlikely to be a detector or PSF subtraction artifact and confirm that it is neither a background nor a foreground object. $S1$ is not re-detected in the two follow-up observations (February and April 2025). If $S1$ is astrophysical in nature, the only explanation is that it has moved to a region of poor sensitivity due to orbital motion. We perform PSF injection-recovery tests and provide 2D sensitivity maps for each epoch to enable orbital completeness calculations. Additional observations are necessary to re-detect candidate $S1$ and confirm its nature as a planet orbiting our nearest solar-type neighbor.</description>

      <title>Worlds Next Door: A Candidate Giant Planet Imaged in the Habitable Zone of $\alpha$ Cen A. I. Observations, Orbital and Physical Properties, and Exozodi Upper Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on coronagraphic observations of the nearest solar-type star, $\alpha$ Cen A, using the MIRI instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope. With three epochs of observation (August 2024, February 2025, and April 2025), we achieve a sensitivity sufficient to detect $T_{\rm eff}\approx$ 225-250 K (1-1.2 $R_{\rm Jup}$) planets between 1"-2" and exozodiacal dust emission at the level of $&gt;$5-8$\times$ the brightness of our own zodiacal cloud. The lack of exozodiacal dust emission sets an unprecedented limit of a few times the brightness of our own zodiacal cloud$-$a factor of $\gtrsim$10 more sensitive than measured toward any other stellar system to date. In August 2024, we detected a F$_\nu$(15.5 $\mu$m) = 3.5 mJy point source, called $S1$, at a separation of 1.5" from $\alpha$ Cen A. Because the August 2024 epoch had only one successful observation at a single roll angle, it is not possible to unambiguously confirm $S1$ as a bona fide planet. Our analysis confirms that $S1$ is neither a background nor a foreground object. $S1$ is not recovered in the February and April 2025 epochs. However, if $S1$ is the counterpart of the object, $C1$, seen by the VLT/NEAR program in 2019, we find that there is a 52% chance that the $S1+C1$ candidate was missed in both follow-up JWST/MIRI observations due to orbital motion. Incorporating constraints from the non-detections, we obtain families of dynamically stable orbits for $S1+C1$ with periods between 2-3 years. These suggest that the planet candidate is on an eccentric ($e \approx 0.4$) orbit significantly inclined with respect to $\alpha$ Cen AB orbital plane ($i_{\rm mutual} \approx 50^\circ$, or $\approx 130^\circ$). Based on the photometry and orbital properties, the planet candidate could have a temperature of 225 K, a radius of $\approx$1-1.1 $R_{\rm Jup}$ and a mass between 90-150 $M_{\rm Earth}$, consistent with RV limits.</description>

      <title>PEACHES IV: Tracing the Formation &amp; Evolution of C$_2$H in Perseus Low-Mass Protostars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The radical hydrocarbon molecule C$_2$H is widely detected in various stages of star and planet formation, and has emerged as a useful tracer of high-C/O gas within the photochemically active surface layers of mature (Class II) protoplanetary disks. However, the chemistry and evolution of C$_2$H within younger (Class 0/I) protostars remains much more poorly understood. Here, using data observed as part of the PEACHES survey along with new ALMA ACA observations, we investigate the C$_2$H emission towards an unbiased sample of 35 Class 0/I low-mass protostars in Perseus. With this large sample, we identify a clear association between C$_2$H emission and the protostellar outflow cavity walls, and a consistent spatial anti-correlation between C$_2$H and SO emission. Together, these trends confirm that C$_2$H is tracing photochemically active, O-poor gas in these younger sources. We fitted the C$_2$H spectra with a simple LTE model to yield column density maps, and find values ranging from 10$^{14}$ -- 10$^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ in these sources. We also looked for trends in the C$_2$H emission morphology as a function of various protostellar evolutionary metrics, but find no clear patterns: the C$_2$H emission remains spatially extended in most sources, independent of age. This indicates that the transition to the compact C$_2$H emission observed on the surface of Class II disks must happen rapidly, sometime just after the embedded stage.</description>

      <title>Mathematical formulation of mode-to-mode energy transfers and energy fluxes in compressible turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding compressible turbulence is critical for modeling atmospheric, astrophysical, and engineering flows. However, compressible turbulence poses a more significant challenge than incompressible turbulence. We present a novel mathematical framework to compute \textit{mode-to-mode energy transfer rates} and energy fluxes for compressible flows. The formalism captures detailed energy conservation within triads and allows decomposition of transfers into rotational, compressive, and mixed components, providing a clear picture of energy exchange among velocity and internal energy modes. We also establish analogies with incompressible hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic flows, highlighting the framework's universality in studying energy transfers.</description>

      <title>Low-frequency spectra of neutron star + OB supergiant binaries: Does wind density drive persistent and flaring modes of accretion?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron star high-mass X-ray binaries, where the compact object orbits a massive star in a sufficiently tight orbit to allow accretion to occur, are well-studied in wavebands between the infrared and hard X-rays. Their low-frequency millimeter and radio properties, on the other hand, remain poorly understood. In this paper, we present the first work in a series focusing on the millimeter and radio emission of systems where a neutron star accretes from an OB supergiant. We report ALMA and NOEMA millimeter observations of twelve systems, supplemented by VLA radio observations of six of those targets. Our targets include six Supergiant X-ray Binaries (SgXBs), four Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs), and two intermediate systems. Nine out of twelve targets, including all SFXTs, are detected in at least one millimeter band, while in the radio, only two targets are detected. All detected targets display inverted radio/millimeter spectra, with spectral indices in the range $\alpha =0.6-0.8$ for those systems where accurate SED fits could be performed. We conclude, firstly, that the low-frequency SEDs of neutron star SFXTs and SgXBs are dominated by free-free emission from the OB supergiant's stellar wind, and that jet emission is unlikely to be observed unless the systems can be detected at sub-GHz frequencies. Secondly, we find that SFXTs are fainter at 100 GHz than prototypical SgXBs, probably due to systematically less dense winds in the former, as supported further by the differences in their fluorescence Fe K$\alpha$ lines. We furthermore compare the stellar wind constraints obtained from our millimeter observations with those from IR/optical/UV studies and bow shock detections, and present evidence for long-term stellar wind variability visible in the thermal emission.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent response of protoplanetary disk temperature to an FU Ori-type luminosity outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The most prominent cases of young star variability are accretion outbursts in FU Ori-type systems. The high power of such outbursts causes dramatic changes in the physical and chemical structure of a surrounding protoplanetary disk. As characteristic thermal timescales in the disk are comparable to the duration of the outburst, the response of its thermal structure is inherently time dependent.
  Aims. We analyzed how the disk thermal structure evolves under the substantial-yet transient-eating of the outburst. To cover different possible physical mechanisms driving the outburst, we examined two scenarios: one in which the increased accretion rate is confined to a compact sub-au inner region and the other where it affects the entire disk.
  Methods. To model the disk temperature response to the outburst we performed time-dependent radiation transfer using the HURAKAN code. The disk structure and the luminosity profile roughly correspond to those of the FU Ori system itself, which went into outburst about 90 years ago and reached a luminosity of 450 L_Sun.
  Results. We find that optically thick disk regions require several years to become fully heated during the outburst and a decade to cool after it. The upper layers and outer parts of the disk, which are optically thin to thermal radiation, are heated and cooled almost instantaneously. This creates an unusual radial temperature profile during the early heating phase with minima at several au both for the fully active and compact active disk scenarios. At the cooling phase, upper layers being colder than the midplane for both scenarios. Near- and mid-infrared SEDs demonstrate a significant and almost instantaneous rise by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude during the outburst, while the millimeter flux shows a change of only a factor of a few, and is slightly delayed with respect to the central region luminosity profile.</description>

      <title>A transition from H$_2$O to C$_2$H$_2$ dominated spectra with decreasing stellar luminosity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chemical composition of the inner regions of disks around young stars will determine the properties of planets forming there. Many disk physical processes drive the chemical evolution, some of which depend on/correlate with the stellar properties. We aim to explore the connection between stellar properties and inner disk chemistry, using mid-infrared spectroscopy. We use JWST-MIRI observations of a large, diverse sample of sources to explore trends between C$_2$H$_2$ and H$_2$O. Additionally, we calculate the average spectrum for the T Tauri ($M_{*}$$&gt;$0.2 $M_{\odot}$) and very low-mass star (VLMS, $M_{*}$$\leq$0.2 $M_{\odot}$) samples and use slab models to determine the properties. We find a significant anti-correlation between the flux ratio of C$_2$H$_2$/H$_2$O and the stellar luminosity. Disks around VLMS have significantly higher $F_{\rm{C_2H_2}}$/$F_{\rm{H_2O}}$ flux ratios than their higher-mass counterparts. We also explore trends with the strength of the 10 $\mu$m silicate feature, stellar accretion rate, and disk dust mass, all of which show correlations with the flux ratio, which may be related to processes driving the carbon-enrichment in disks around VLMS, but also have degeneracies with system properties. Slab model fits to the average spectra show that the VLMS H$_2$O emission is quite similar in temperature and column density to a warm ($\sim$600 K) H$_2$O component in the T Tauri spectrum, indicating that the high C/O gas phase ratio in these disks is not due to oxygen depletion alone. Instead, the presence of many hydrocarbons, including some with high column densities, points to carbon enhancement in the disks around VLMS. The observed differences in the inner disk chemistry as a function of host properties are likely to be accounted for by differences in the disk temperatures, stellar radiation field, and the evolution of dust grains.</description>

      <title>ASASSN-24fw: An 8-month long, 4.1 mag, optically achromatic and polarized dimming event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss ASASSN-24fw, a 13th-magnitude star that optically faded by $\Delta g = 4.12 \pm 0.02$ mag starting in September 2024 after over a decade of quiescence in ASAS-SN. The dimmimg lasted $\sim$8 months before returning to quiescence in late May 2025. The spectral energy distribution (SED) before the event is that of a pre-main sequence or a modestly evolved F star with some warm dust emission. The shape of the optical SED during the dim phase is unchanged and the optical and near-infrared spectra are those of an F star. The SED and the dilution of some of the F star infrared absorption features near minimum suggest the presence of a $\sim$0.25$M_\odot$ M dwarf binary companion. The 43.8 year period proposed by Nair &amp; Denisenko (2024) appears correct and is probably half the precession period of a circumbinary disk. The optical eclipse is nearly achromatic, although slightly deeper in bluer filters, $\Delta (g-z)=0.31\pm0.15$ mag, and the $V$ band emission is polarized by up to 4%. The materials most able to produce such small optical color changes and a high polarization are big ($\sim$20 $\mu$m) carbonaceous or water ice grains. Particle distributions dominated by big grains are seen in protoplanetary disks, Saturn-like ring systems and evolved debris disks. We also carry out a survey of occultation events, finding 46 additional systems, of which only 7 (4) closely match $\varepsilon$ Aurigae (KH 15D), the two archetypes of stars with long and deep eclipses. The full sample is widely distributed in an optical color-magnitude diagram, but roughly half show a mid-IR excess. It is likely many of the others have cooler dust since it seems essential to produce the events.</description>

      <title>Suppression of the collisionless tearing mode by flow shear: implications for reconnection onset in the Alfv\'enic solar wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the collisionless tearing mode instability of a current sheet with a strong shear flow across the layer. The growth rate decreases with increasing shear flow, and is completely stabilized as the shear flow becomes Alfv\'enic. We also show that in the presence of strong flow shear, the tearing mode growth rate decreases with increasing background ion-to-electron temperature ratio, the opposite behaviour to the tearing mode without flow shear. We find that even a relatively small flow shear is enough to dramatically alter the scaling behaviour of the mode, because the growth rate is small compared to the shear flow across the ion scales (but large compared to shear flow across the electron scales). Our results may explain the relative absence of reconnection events in the near-Sun Alfv\'enic solar wind observed recently by NASA's Parker Solar Probe.</description>

      <title>Detectability of compact intermediate-mass black hole binaries as low-frequency gravitational wave sources: the influence of dynamical friction of dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The black hole (BH) spin could significantly change the density of dark matter (DM) in its vicinity, creating a mini-spike of the density of DM. The dynamical friction (DF) between DM and the companion star of a BH can provide an efficient loss of angular momentum, driving the BH-main sequence (MS) star binary to evolve toward a compact orbit system. We investigate the influence of the DF of DM on the detectability of intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH)-MS binaries as low-frequency gravitational wave (GW) sources. Taking into account the DF of DM, we employ the detailed binary evolution code MESA to model the evolution of a large number of IMBH-MS binaries. Our simulation shows that the DF of DM can drive those IMBH-MS binaries to evolve toward low-frequency GW sources for a low donor-star mass, a high spike index, or a short initial orbital period. When the spike index $\gamma=1.60$, those IMBH-MS binaries with donor-star masses of $1.0-3.4~ M_{\odot}$ and initial orbital periods of $0.65-16.82~ \rm days$ could potentially evolve into visible LISA sources within a distance of $10~\rm kpc$. The DF of DM can enlarge the initial parameter space and prolong the bifurcation periods. In the low-frequency GW source stage, the X-ray luminosities of those IMBH X-ray binaries are $\sim 10^{35}-10^{36}~\rm erg\,s^{-1}$, hence they are ideal multimessenger objects.</description>
