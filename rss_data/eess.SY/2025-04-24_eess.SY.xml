      <title>One-Point Sampling for Distributed Bandit Convex Optimization with Time-Varying Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the distributed bandit convex optimization problem with time-varying constraints. In this problem, the global loss function is the average of all the local convex loss functions, which are unknown beforehand. Each agent iteratively makes its own decision subject to time-varying inequality constraints which can be violated but are fulfilled in the long run. For a uniformly jointly strongly connected time-varying directed graph, a distributed bandit online primal-dual projection algorithm with one-point sampling is proposed. We show that sublinear dynamic network regret and network cumulative constraint violation are achieved if the path-length of the benchmark also increases in a sublinear manner. In addition, an $\mathcal{O}({T^{3/4 + g}})$ static network regret bound and an $\mathcal{O}( {{T^{1 - {g}/2}}} )$ network cumulative constraint violation bound are established, where $T$ is the total number of iterations and $g \in ( {0,1/4} )$ is a trade-off parameter. Moreover, a reduced static network regret bound $\mathcal{O}( {{T^{2/3 + 4g /3}}} )$ is established for strongly convex local loss functions. Finally, a numerical example is presented to validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Nash Equilibrium Learning In Large Populations With First Order Payoff Modifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish Nash equilibrium learning -- convergence of the population state to a suitably defined Nash equilibria set -- for a class of payoff dynamical mechanism with a first order modification. The first order payoff modification can model aspects of the agents' bounded rationality, anticipatory or averaging terms in the payoff mechanism, or first order Pad\'e approximations of delays. To obtain our main results, we apply a combination of two nonstandard system-theoretic passivity notions.</description>

      <title>Distributed Space Resource Logistics Architecture Optimization under Economies of Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an optimization framework for distributed resource logistics system design to support future multimission space exploration. The performance and impact of distributed In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) systems in facilitating space transportation are analyzed. The proposed framework considers technology trade studies, deployment strategy, facility location evaluation, and resource logistics after production for distributed ISRU systems. We develop piecewise linear sizing and cost estimation models based on economies of scale that can be easily integrated into network-based mission planning formulations. A case study on a multi-mission cislunar logistics campaign is conducted to demonstrate the value of the proposed method and evaluate key tradeoffs to compare the performance of distributed ISRU systems with traditional concentrated ISRU. Finally, a comprehensive sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the proposed system under varying conditions, comparing concentrated and distributed ISRU systems.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Distributed Architecture for the Least Allan Variance Atomic Timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a hierarchical distributed timing architecture based on an ensemble of miniature atomic clocks. The goal is to ensure synchronized and accurate timing in a normal operating mode where Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are available, as well as in an emergency operating mode during GNSS failures. At the lower level, the miniature atomic clocks employ a distributed control strategy that uses only local information to ensure synchronization in both modes. The resulting synchronized time or generated time scale has the best frequency stability, as measured by the Allan variance, over the short control period. In the upper layer, a supervisor controls the long-term behavior of the generated time scale. In the normal operating mode, the supervisor periodically anchors the generated time scale to the standard time based on GNSS signals, while in the emergency operating mode, it applies optimal floating control to reduce the divergence rate of the generated time scale, which is not observable from the measurable time difference between the miniature atomic clocks. This floating control aims to explicitly control the generated time scale to have the least Allan variance over the long control period. Finally, numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the architecture in high-precision, GNSS-resilient atomic timing.</description>

      <title>Anytime Safe Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of solving constrained
  reinforcement learning problems with anytime guarantees, meaning
  that the algorithmic solution returns a safe policy regardless of
  when it is terminated. Drawing inspiration from anytime constrained
  optimization, we introduce Reinforcement Learning-based Safe
  Gradient Flow (RL-SGF), an on-policy algorithm which employs
  estimates of the value functions and their respective gradients
  associated with the objective and safety constraints for the current
  policy, and updates the policy parameters by solving a convex
  quadratically constrained quadratic program. We show that if the
  estimates are computed with a sufficiently large number of episodes
  (for which we provide an explicit bound), safe policies are updated
  to safe policies with a probability higher than a prescribed
  tolerance. We also show that iterates asymptotically converge to a
  neighborhood of a KKT point, whose size can be arbitrarily reduced
  by refining the estimates of the value function and their gradients.
  We illustrate the performance of RL-SGF in a navigation example.</description>

      <title>Power-based control of output oscillations with online estimation of biased harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently introduced discrete power-based control (Ruderman (2024b)) reduces largely the communication efforts in the control loop when compensating for the marginally damped or even slowly diverging output oscillations. The control commutates twice per oscillations period (at the amplitude peaks) and uses the measured harmonic output only. The power-based control scheme requires the knowledge of the instantaneous frequency, amplitude, and bias parameters of the harmonic signal. This paper extends the power-based control by the finite-time estimation of the biased harmonics (Ahmed et al. (2022)). Also an improved analytic calculation of the impulse weighting factor is provided. The power-based oscillations control with online estimation of the harmonic parameters is evaluated experimentally on the fifth-order actuator system with a free hanging load under gravity and measurement noise.</description>

      <title>Distributed Optimization with Efficient Communication, Event-Triggered Solution Enhancement, and Operation Stopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In modern large-scale systems with sensor networks and IoT devices it is essential to collaboratively solve complex problems while utilizing network resources efficiently. In our paper we present three distributed optimization algorithms that exhibit efficient communication among nodes. Our first algorithm presents a simple quantized averaged gradient procedure for distributed optimization, which is shown to converge to a neighborhood of the optimal solution. Our second algorithm incorporates a novel event-triggered refinement mechanism, which refines the utilized quantization level to enhance the precision of the estimated optimal solution. It enables nodes to terminate their operation according to predefined performance guarantees. Our third algorithm is tailored to operate in environments where each message consists of only a few bits. It incorporates a novel event-triggered mechanism for adjusting the quantizer basis and quantization level, allowing nodes to collaboratively decide operation termination based on predefined performance criteria. We analyze the three algorithms and establish their linear convergence. Finally, an application on distributed sensor fusion for target localization is used to demonstrate their favorable performance compared to existing algorithms in the literature.</description>

      <title>LiDAL-Assisted RLNC-NOMA in OWC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical wireless communication (OWC) is envisioned as a key enabler for immersive indoor data transmission in future wireless communication networks. However, multi-user interference management arises as a challenge in dense indoor OWC systems composed of multiple optical access points (APs) serving multiple users. In this paper, we propose a novel dual-function OWC system for communication and localization. Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) with random linear network coding (RLNC) is designed for data transmission, where NOMA allows the serving of multiple users simultaneously through controlling the power domain, and RLNC helps minimize errors that might occur during signal processing phase. This setup is assisted with a light detection and localization system (LiDAL) that can passively obtain spatio-temporal indoor information of user presence and location for dynamic-user grouping. The designed LiDAL system helps to improve the estimation of channel state information (CSI) in realistic indoor network scenarios, where the CSI of indoor users might be noisy and/or highly correlated. We evaluate the performance of NOMA combined with RLNC by analyzing the probability of successful decoding compared to conventional NOMA and orthogonal schemes. In addition, we derive the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) to evaluate the accuracy of location estimation. The results show that the proposed RLNC-NOMA improves the probability of successful decoding and the overall system performance. The results also show the high accuracy of the unbiased location estimator and its assistant in reducing the imperfection of CSI, leading to high overall system performance.</description>

      <title>Data-Assimilated Model-Based Reinforcement Learning for Partially Observed Chaotic Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of many applications in energy and transport sectors is to control turbulent flows. However, because of chaotic dynamics and high dimensionality, the control of turbulent flows is exceedingly difficult. Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) methods can discover optimal control policies by interacting with the environment, but they require full state information, which is often unavailable in experimental settings. We propose a data-assimilated model-based RL (DA-MBRL) framework for systems with partial observability and noisy measurements. Our framework employs a control-aware Echo State Network for data-driven prediction of the dynamics, and integrates data assimilation with an Ensemble Kalman Filter for real-time state estimation. An off-policy actor-critic algorithm is employed to learn optimal control strategies from state estimates. The framework is tested on the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, demonstrating its effectiveness in stabilizing a spatiotemporally chaotic flow from noisy and partial measurements.</description>

      <title>Distributed Unknown Input Observers for Discrete-Time Linear Time-Invariant Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a Distributed Unknown Input Observer (D-UIO) design methodology that uses a technique called node-wise detectability decomposition to estimate the state of a discrete-time linear time-invariant (LTI) system in a distributed way, even when there are noisy measurements and unknown inputs. In the considered scenario, sensors are associated to nodes of an underlying communication graph. Each node has a limited scope as it can only access local measurements and share data with its neighbors. The problem of designing the observer gains is divided into two separate sub-problems: (i) design local output injection gains to mitigate the impact of measurement noise, and (ii) design diffusive gains to compensate for the lack of information through a consensus protocol. A direct and computationally efficient synthesis strategy is formulated by linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and solved via semidefinite programming. Finally, two simulative scenarios are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the distributed observer when two different node-wise decompositions are adopted.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Control for a Moving Receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are emerging as key enablers of reliable industrial automation in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) band, particularly in environments with frequent line-of-sight (LoS) blockage. While prior works have largely focused on theoretical aspects, real-time validation under user mobility remains underexplored. In this work, we propose and experimentally evaluate a self-adaptive beamforming algorithm that enables RIS reconfiguration based on a low-rate feedback link from the mobile user equipment (UE) to the RIS controller. The algorithm maintains received signal power above a predefined threshold without requiring UE position knowledge. Using a hexagonal RIS with 127 elements operating at 23.8 GHz, we validate our approach in a semi-anechoic environment over a 60 cm*100 cm observation area. The results demonstrate up to 24 dB gain in received power compared to the baseline with inactive RIS elements, highlighting the practical benefits of adaptive RIS control in mobile non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios.</description>

      <title>Learning Verifiable Control Policies Using Relaxed Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To provide safety guarantees for learning-based control systems, recent work has developed formal verification methods to apply after training ends. However, if the trained policy does not meet the specifications, or there is conservatism in the verification algorithm, establishing these guarantees may not be possible. Instead, this work proposes to perform verification throughout training to ultimately aim for policies whose properties can be evaluated throughout runtime with lightweight, relaxed verification algorithms. The approach is to use differentiable reachability analysis and incorporate new components into the loss function. Numerical experiments on a quadrotor model and unicycle model highlight the ability of this approach to lead to learned control policies that satisfy desired reach-avoid and invariance specifications.</description>

      <title>Mass-Adaptive Admittance Control for Robotic Manipulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Handling objects with unknown or changing masses is a common challenge in robotics, often leading to errors or instability if the control system cannot adapt in real-time. In this paper, we present a novel approach that enables a six-degrees-of-freedom robotic manipulator to reliably follow waypoints while automatically estimating and compensating for unknown payload weight. Our method integrates an admittance control framework with a mass estimator, allowing the robot to dynamically update an excitation force to compensate for the payload mass. This strategy mitigates end-effector sagging and preserves stability when handling objects of unknown weights. We experimentally validated our approach in a challenging pick-and-place task on a shelf with a crossbar, improved accuracy in reaching waypoints and compliant motion compared to a baseline admittance-control scheme. By safely accommodating unknown payloads, our work enhances flexibility in robotic automation and represents a significant step forward in adaptive control for uncertain environments.</description>

      <title>Vision Controlled Orthotic Hand Exoskeleton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the design and implementation of an AI vision-controlled orthotic hand exoskeleton to enhance rehabilitation and assistive functionality for individuals with hand mobility impairments. The system leverages a Google Coral Dev Board Micro with an Edge TPU to enable real-time object detection using a customized MobileNet\_V2 model trained on a six-class dataset. The exoskeleton autonomously detects objects, estimates proximity, and triggers pneumatic actuation for grasp-and-release tasks, eliminating the need for user-specific calibration needed in traditional EMG-based systems. The design prioritizes compactness, featuring an internal battery. It achieves an 8-hour runtime with a 1300 mAh battery. Experimental results demonstrate a 51ms inference speed, a significant improvement over prior iterations, though challenges persist in model robustness under varying lighting conditions and object orientations. While the most recent YOLO model (YOLOv11) showed potential with 15.4 FPS performance, quantization issues hindered deployment. The prototype underscores the viability of vision-controlled exoskeletons for real-world assistive applications, balancing portability, efficiency, and real-time responsiveness, while highlighting future directions for model optimization and hardware miniaturization.</description>

      <title>Eigendecomposition Parameterization of Penalty Matrices for Enhanced Control Design: Aerospace Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern control algorithms require tuning of square weight/penalty matrices appearing in quadratic functions/costs to improve performance and/or stability output. Due to simplicity in gain-tuning and enforcing positive-definiteness, diagonal penalty matrices are used extensively in control methods such as linear quadratic regulator (LQR), model predictive control, and Lyapunov-based control. In this paper, we propose an eigendecomposition approach to parameterize penalty matrices, allowing positive-definiteness with non-zero off-diagonal entries to be implicitly satisfied, which not only offers notable computational and implementation advantages, but broadens the class of achievable controls. We solve three control problems: 1) a variation of Zermelo's navigation problem, 2) minimum-energy spacecraft attitude control using both LQR and Lyapunov-based methods, and 3) minimum-fuel and minimum-time Lyapunov-based low-thrust trajectory design. Particle swarm optimization is used to optimize the decision variables, which will parameterize the penalty matrices. The results demonstrate improvements of up to 65% in the performance objective in the example problems utilizing the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Fast Online Adaptive Neural MPC via Meta-Learning</title>

Abstract: Data-driven model predictive control (MPC) has demonstrated significant potential for improving robot control performance in the presence of model uncertainties. However, existing approaches often require extensive offline data collection and computationally intensive training, limiting their ability to adapt online. To address these challenges, this paper presents a fast online adaptive MPC framework that leverages neural networks integrated with Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). Our approach focuses on few-shot adaptation of residual dynamics - capturing the discrepancy between nominal and true system behavior - using minimal online data and gradient steps. By embedding these meta-learned residual models into a computationally efficient L4CasADi-based MPC pipeline, the proposed method enables rapid model correction, enhances predictive accuracy, and improves real-time control performance. We validate the framework through simulation studies on a Van der Pol oscillator, a Cart-Pole system, and a 2D quadrotor. Results show significant gains in adaptation speed and prediction accuracy over both nominal MPC and nominal MPC augmented with a freshly initialized neural network, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach for real-time adaptive robot control.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Regret Benchmarks in Online Non-Stochastic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the online non-stochastic control problem, an agent sequentially selects control inputs for a linear dynamical system when facing unknown and adversarially selected convex costs and disturbances. A common metric for evaluating control policies in this setting is policy regret, defined relative to the best-in-hindsight linear feedback controller. However, for general convex costs, this benchmark may be less meaningful since linear controllers can be highly suboptimal. To address this, we introduce an alternative, more suitable benchmark--the performance of the best fixed input. We show that this benchmark can be viewed as a natural extension of the standard benchmark used in online convex optimization and propose a novel online control algorithm that achieves sublinear regret with respect to this new benchmark. We also discuss the connections between our method and the original one proposed by Agarwal et al. in their seminal work introducing the online non-stochastic control problem, and compare the performance of both approaches through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Zero-shot Sim-to-Real Transfer for Reinforcement Learning-based Visual Servoing of Soft Continuum Arms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft continuum arms (SCAs) soft and deformable nature presents challenges in modeling and control due to their infinite degrees of freedom and non-linear behavior. This work introduces a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for visual servoing tasks on SCAs with zero-shot sim-to-real transfer capabilities, demonstrated on a single section pneumatic manipulator capable of bending and twisting. The framework decouples kinematics from mechanical properties using an RL kinematic controller for motion planning and a local controller for actuation refinement, leveraging minimal sensing with visual feedback. Trained entirely in simulation, the RL controller achieved a 99.8% success rate. When deployed on hardware, it achieved a 67% success rate in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, demonstrating robustness and adaptability. This approach offers a scalable solution for SCAs in 3D visual servoing, with potential for further refinement and expanded applications.</description>

      <title>Meta-Learning Online Dynamics Model Adaptation in Off-Road Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-speed off-road autonomous driving presents unique challenges due to complex, evolving terrain characteristics and the difficulty of accurately modeling terrain-vehicle interactions. While dynamics models used in model-based control can be learned from real-world data, they often struggle to generalize to unseen terrain, making real-time adaptation essential. We propose a novel framework that combines a Kalman filter-based online adaptation scheme with meta-learned parameters to address these challenges. Offline meta-learning optimizes the basis functions along which adaptation occurs, as well as the adaptation parameters, while online adaptation dynamically adjusts the onboard dynamics model in real time for model-based control. We validate our approach through extensive experiments, including real-world testing on a full-scale autonomous off-road vehicle, demonstrating that our method outperforms baseline approaches in prediction accuracy, performance, and safety metrics, particularly in safety-critical scenarios. Our results underscore the effectiveness of meta-learned dynamics model adaptation, advancing the development of reliable autonomous systems capable of navigating diverse and unseen environments.

      <title>Friedkin-Johnsen Model with Diminishing Competition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12601v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter studies the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) model with diminishing competition, or stubbornness. The original FJ model assumes that each agent assigns a constant competition weight to its initial opinion. In contrast, we investigate the effect of diminishing competition on the convergence point and speed of the FJ dynamics. We prove that, if the competition is uniform across agents and vanishes asymptotically, the convergence point coincides with the nominal consensus reached with no competition. However, the diminishing competition slows down convergence according to its own rate of decay. We study this phenomenon analytically and provide upper and lower bounds on the convergence rate. Further, if competition is not uniform across agents, we show that the convergence point may not coincide with the nominal consensus point. Finally, we evaluate our analytical insights numerically.</description>

      <title>Combining Physics-based and Data-driven Modeling for Building Energy Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building energy modeling plays a vital role in optimizing the operation of building energy systems by providing accurate predictions of the building's real-world conditions. In this context, various techniques have been explored, ranging from traditional physics-based models to data-driven models. Recently, researchers are combining physics-based and data-driven models into hybrid approaches. This includes using the physics-based model output as additional data-driven input, learning the residual between physics-based model and real data, learning a surrogate of the physics-based model, or fine-tuning a surrogate model with real data. However, a comprehensive comparison of the inherent advantages of these hybrid approaches is still missing. The primary objective of this work is to evaluate four predominant hybrid approaches in building energy modeling through a real-world case study, with focus on indoor thermodynamics. To achieve this, we devise three scenarios reflecting common levels of building documentation and sensor availability, assess their performance, and analyze their explainability using hierarchical Shapley values. The real-world study reveals three notable findings. First, greater building documentation and sensor availability lead to higher prediction accuracy for hybrid approaches. Second, the performance of hybrid approaches depends on the type of building room, but the residual approach using a Feedforward Neural Network as data-driven sub-model performs best on average across all rooms. This hybrid approach also demonstrates a superior ability to leverage the simulation from the physics-based sub-model. Third, hierarchical Shapley values prove to be an effective tool for explaining and improving hybrid models while accounting for input correlations.</description>

      <title>Physics-based battery model parametrisation from impedance data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10896v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-invasive parametrisation of physics-based battery models can be performed by fitting the model to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data containing features related to the different physical processes. However, this requires an impedance model to be derived, which may be complex to obtain analytically. We have developed the open-source software PyBaMM-EIS that provides a fast method to compute the impedance of any PyBaMM model at any operating point using automatic differentiation. Using PyBaMM-EIS, we investigate the impedance of the single particle model, single particle model with electrolyte (SPMe), and Doyle-Fuller-Newman model, and identify the SPMe as a parsimonious option that shows the typical features of measured lithium-ion cell impedance data. We provide a grouped parameter SPMe and analyse the features in the impedance related to each parameter. Using the open-source software PyBOP, we estimate 18 grouped parameters both from simulated impedance data and from measured impedance data from a LG M50LT lithium-ion battery. The parameters that directly affect the response of the SPMe can be accurately determined and assigned to the correct electrode. Crucially, parameter fitting must be done simultaneously to data across a wide range of states-of-charge. Overall, this work presents a practical way to find the parameters of physics-based models.</description>

      <title>Towards Routing and Edge Computing in Satellite-Terrestrial Networks: A Column Generation Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Edge computing that enables satellites to process raw data locally is expected to bring further timeliness and flexibility to satellite-terrestrial networks (STNs). In this letter, we propose a three-layer edge computing protocol, where raw data collected by the satellites can be processed locally, or transmitted to other satellites or the ground station via multi-hop routing for further processing. The overall computing capacity of the proposed framework is maximized by determining the offloading strategy and routing formation, subject to channel capacity and hop constraints. Given that the problem scale grows exponentially with the number of satellites and maximum-allowed hops, the column generation approach is employed to obtain the global optimal solution by activating only a subset of variables. Numerical results reveal that the proposed three-layer computing protocol, when tolerating a 5-hop routing latency, achieves a 60% improvement in computation capacity compared to the single-layer local computing configuration.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the error analysis of system pole estimation in $n$-dimensional discrete-time Linear Time-Invariant systems with $m$ outputs and $p$ inputs, using the classical Ho-Kalman algorithm based on finite input-output sample data. Building upon prior work, we establish end-to-end estimation guarantees for system poles under both single-trajectory and multiple-trajectory settings. Specifically, we prove that, with high probability, the estimation error of system poles decreases at a rate of at least $\mathcal{O}\{T^{-\frac{1}{2n}}\}$ in the single-trajectory case and $\mathcal{O}\{N^{-\frac{1}{2n}}\}$ in the multiple-trajectory case, where $T$ is the length of a single trajectory, and $N$ is the number of trajectories. Furthermore, we reveal that in both settings, achieving a constant estimation accuracy for system poles requires the sample size to grow super-polynomially with respect to the larger of the two ratios, $ \max\{n/m, n/p\} $. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the non-asymptotic results of system pole estimation.</description>

      <title>Application of Battery Storage to Switching Predictive Control of Power Distribution Systems Including Road Heating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In regions with heavy snowfall, the living environment is becoming a serious problem due to heavy snow accumulation. A road heating is an electrical device which promotes snow melting by burying a heating cable as a thermal source underground in such regions. When integrating the road heating into power distribution systems, we need to optimize the flow of electric power by appropriately integrating distributed power sources and conventional power distribution equipment. In this paper, we introduce a battery storage to the power distribution system including road heating, and extend the predictive switching control of the systems due to the authors' previous study to the case where battery storage is installed. As a main result, we propose a predictive switching control that utilizes photovoltaic (PV) power generation and surplus power stored in the battery storage effectively, and achieves the reduction of distribution loss, attenuation of voltage fluctuation, and efficient snow melting, simultaneously. We verify the effectiveness of the application of battery storage through numerical simulation using actual time series data of weather conditions and active power of the PV power generation and load.</description>

Abstract: We propose a distributed model predictive control (MPC) framework for coordinating heterogeneous, nonlinear multi-agent systems under individual and coupling constraints. The cooperative task is encoded as a shared objective function minimized collectively by the agents. Each agent optimizes an artificial reference as an intermediate step towards the cooperative objective, along with a control input to track it. We establish recursive feasibility, asymptotic stability, and transient performance bounds under suitable assumptions. The solution to the cooperative task is not predetermined but emerges from the optimized interactions of the agents. We demonstrate the framework on numerical examples inspired by satellite constellation control, collision-free narrow-passage traversal, and coordinated quadrotor flight.</description>

      <title>Tightening Quadratic Convex Relaxations for the AC Optimal Transmission Switching Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.12097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Alternating Current Optimal Transmission Switching (ACOTS) problem incorporates line switching decisions into the AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) framework, offering well-known benefits in reducing operational costs and enhancing system reliability. ACOTS optimization models contain discrete variables and nonlinear, non-convex constraints, which make it difficult to solve. In this work, we develop strengthened quadratic convex (QC) relaxations for ACOTS, where we tighten the relaxation with several new valid inequalities, including a novel kind of on/off cycle-based polynomial constraints by taking advantage of the network structure. We linearize the sum of on/off trilinear terms in the relaxation using extreme-point representation, demonstrating theoretical tightness, and efficiently incorporate on/off cycle-based polynomial constraints through disjunctive programming-based cutting planes. Combined with an optimization-based bound tightening algorithm, this results in the tightest QC-based ACOTS relaxation to date. We additionally propose a novel maximum spanning tree-based heuristic to improve the computational performance by fixing certain lines to be switched on. Our extensive numerical experiments on medium-scale PGLib instances show significant improvements on relaxation bounds, while tests on large-scale instances with up to 2,312 buses demonstrate substantial performance gains. To our knowledge, this is the first ACOTS relaxation-based approach to demonstrate near-optimal switching solutions on realistic large-scale power grid instances.</description>

      <title>Coding for Gaussian Two-Way Channels: Linear and Learning-Based Approaches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although user cooperation cannot improve the capacity of Gaussian two-way channels (GTWCs) with independent noises, it can improve communication reliability. In this work, we aim to enhance and balance the communication reliability in GTWCs by minimizing the sum of error probabilities via joint design of encoders and decoders at the users. We first formulate general encoding/decoding functions, where the user cooperation is captured by the coupling of user encoding processes. The coupling effect renders the encoder/decoder design non-trivial, requiring effective decoding to capture this effect, as well as efficient power management at the encoders within power constraints. To address these challenges, we propose two different two-way coding strategies: linear coding and learning-based coding. For linear coding, we propose optimal linear decoding and discuss new insights on encoding regarding user cooperation to balance reliability. We then propose an efficient algorithm for joint encoder/decoder design. For learning-based coding, we introduce a novel recurrent neural network (RNN)-based coding architecture, where we propose interactive RNNs and a power control layer for encoding, and we incorporate bi-directional RNNs with an attention mechanism for decoding. Through simulations, we show that our two-way coding methodologies outperform conventional channel coding schemes (that do not utilize user cooperation) significantly in sum-error performance. We also demonstrate that our linear coding excels at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), while our RNN-based coding performs best at low SNRs. We further investigate our two-way coding strategies in terms of power distribution, two-way coding benefit, different coding rates, and block-length gain.</description>

      <title>Approximate solution of stochastic infinite horizon optimal control problems for constrained linear uncertain systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a Model Predictive Control (MPC) with a single-step prediction horizon to approximate the solution of infinite horizon optimal control problems with the expected sum of convex stage costs for constrained linear uncertain systems. The proposed method aims to enhance a given sub-optimal controller, leveraging data to achieve a nearly optimal solution for the infinite horizon problem. The method is built on two techniques. First, we estimate the expected values of the convex costs using a computationally tractable approximation, achieved by sampling across the space of disturbances. Second, we implement a data-driven approach to approximate the optimal value function and its corresponding domain, through systematic exploration of the system's state space. These estimates are subsequently used to calculate the terminal cost and terminal set within the proposed MPC. We prove recursive feasibility, robust constraint satisfaction, and convergence in probability to the target set. Furthermore, we prove that the estimated value function converges to the optimal value function in a local region. The effectiveness of the proposed MPC is illustrated with detailed numerical simulations and comparisons with a value iteration method and a Learning MPC that minimizes a certainty equivalent cost.</description>

      <title>Neural Risk Limiting Dispatch in Power Networks: Formulation and Generalization Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Risk limiting dispatch (RLD) has been proposed as an approach that effectively trades off economic costs with operational risks for power dispatch under uncertainty. However, how to solve the RLD problem with provably near-optimal performance still remains an open problem. This paper presents a learning-based solution to this challenge. We first design a data-driven formulation for the RLD problem, which aims to construct a decision rule that directly maps day-ahead observable information to cost-effective dispatch decisions for the future delivery interval. Unlike most existing works that follow a predict-then-optimize paradigm, this end-to-end rule bypasses the additional suboptimality introduced by separately handling prediction and optimization. We then propose neural RLD, a novel solution method to the data-driven formulation. This method leverages an L2-regularized neural network to learn the decision rule, thereby transforming the data-driven formulation into a neural network training task that can be efficiently completed by stochastic gradient descent. A theoretical performance guarantee is further established to bound the suboptimality of our method, which implies that its suboptimality approaches zero with high probability as more samples are utilized. Simulation tests across various systems demonstrate our method's superior performance in convergence, suboptimality, and computational efficiency compared with benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Low-Latency, Quantum-Ready RF Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work has shown the promise of applying deep learning to enhance software processing of radio frequency (RF) signals. In parallel, hardware developments with quantum RF sensors based on Rydberg atoms are breaking longstanding barriers in frequency range, resolution, and sensitivity. In this paper, we describe our implementations of quantum-ready machine learning approaches for RF signal classification. Our primary objective is latency: while deep learning offers a more powerful computational paradigm, it also traditionally incurs latency overheads that hinder wider scale deployment. Our work spans three axes. (1) A novel continuous wavelet transform (CWT) based recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that enables flexible online classification of RF signals on-the-fly with reduced sampling time. (2) Low-latency inference techniques for both GPU and CPU that span over 100x reductions in inference time, enabling real-time operation with sub-millisecond inference. (3) Quantum-readiness validated through application of our models to physics-based simulation of Rydberg atom QRF sensors. Altogether, our work bridges towards next-generation RF sensors that use quantum technology to surpass previous physical limits, paired with latency-optimized AI/ML software that is suitable for real-time deployment.</description>

      <title>A Passivity Analysis for Nonlinear Consensus on Balanced Digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work deals with the output consensus problem for multiagent systems over balanced digraphs by passivity analysis. As the standard diffusive coupling structure only models the undirected interconnection, we propose a general approach capable of processing directed coupling and performing passivity analysis. To mitigate the complexity arising from the nonlinearity and directed interconnections, we reformulate the output consensus problem as a convergence analysis on a submanifold. We provide passivity analysis and establish a sufficient condition based on passivity for achieving output agreement in multi-agent systems over balanced digraphs. The results are supported by a numerical example.</description>

      <title>A Cardinality-Constrained Approach to Combinatorial Bilevel Congestion Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06482v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial bilevel congestion pricing (CBCP), a variant of the mixed (continuous/discrete) network design problems, seeks to minimize the total travel time experienced by all travelers in a road network, by strategically selecting toll locations and determining toll charges. Conventional wisdom suggests that these problems are intractable since they have to be formulated and solved with a significant number of integer variables. Here, we devise a scalable local algorithm for the CBCP problem that guarantees convergence to an approximate Karush-Kuhn-Tucker point. Our approach is novel in that it eliminates the use of integer variables altogether, instead introducing a cardinality constraint that limits the number of toll locations to a user-specified upper bound. The resulting bilevel program with the cardinality constraint is then transformed into a block-separable, single-level optimization problem that can be solved efficiently after penalization and decomposition. We are able to apply the algorithm to solve, in about 20 minutes, a CBCP instance with up to 3,000 links. To the best of our knowledge, no existing algorithm can solve CBCP problems at such a scale while providing any assurance of convergence.</description>

      <title>Indirect Adaptive Control Using a Static Update Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The update law in the indirect adaptive control scheme can be extended to include feedthrough of an error term. This reduces undesired oscillations of the calculated weights. When the ${\sigma}$-modification is used for achieving robustness against unstructured uncertainties, the gain of the feedthrough in the update law cannot be chosen arbitrarily. Compared to our previous result, we show stability of the closed loop for a larger parameter-range for the gain of the feedthrough in the update law. This parameter-range includes a configuration for which the influence of the integration in the update law diminishes over time, i.e. for which the adaptation for large times is governed solely by the feedthrough in the update law. By initializing at zero, this allows for removing the integration from the update law, resulting in a static update law. For the purely linear case, the adaptation acts like a disturbance observer. Frequency-domain analysis of the closed loop with a second order plant shows that removing the integration from the update law with ${\sigma}$-modification and feedthrough affects how precisely disturbances in the low-frequency band are observed. If the damping injected into the adaptation process by the ${\sigma}$-modification exceeds certain bounds, then the precision is increased by using the static update law.</description>

      <title>Dual NUP Representations and Min-Maximization in Factor Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Normals with unknown parameters (NUP) can be used to convert nontrivial model-based estimation problems into iterations of linear least-squares or Gaussian estimation problems. In this paper, we extend this approach by augmenting factor graphs with convex-dual variables and pertinent NUP representations. In particular, in a state space setting, we propose a new iterative forward-backward algorithm that is dual to a recently proposed backward-forward algorithm.</description>

      <title>The Price of Simplicity: Analyzing Decoupled Policies for Multi-Location Inventory Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22639v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What is the performance cost of using simple, decoupled control policies in inherently coupled systems? Motivated by industrial refrigeration systems, where centralized compressors exhibit economies of scale yet traditional control employs decoupled room-by-room temperature regulation, we address this question through the lens of multi-location inventory control. Here, a planner manages multiple inventories to meet stochastic demand while minimizing costs that are coupled through nonlinear ordering functions reflecting economies of scale. Our main contributions are: (i) a surprising equivalence result showing that optimal stationary base-stock levels for individual locations remain unchanged despite the coupling when restricting attention to decoupled strategies; (ii) tight performance bounds for simple decoupled policies relative to optimal coupled policies, revealing that the worst-case ratio depends primarily on the degree of nonlinearity in the cost function and scales with the number of locations for systems with fixed costs; and (iii) analysis of practical online algorithms that achieve competitive performance without solving complex dynamic programs. Numerical simulations demonstrate that while decoupled policies significantly outperform their worst-case guarantees in typical scenarios, they still exhibit meaningful suboptimality compared to fully coordinated strategies. These results provide actionable guidance for system operators navigating the trade-off between control complexity and operational efficiency in coupled systems.</description>

      <title>Feedback Stackelberg-Nash equilibria in difference games with quasi-hierarchical interactions and inequality constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15019v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of two-player deterministic finite-horizon difference games with coupled inequality constraints, where each player has two types of decision variables: one involving sequential interactions and the other simultaneous interactions. We refer to this class of games as quasi-hierarchical dynamic games and define a solution concept called the feedback Stackelberg-Nash (FSN) equilibrium. Under separability assumption on cost functions, we provide a recursive formulation of the FSN solution using dynamic programming. We show that the FSN solution can be derived from the parametric feedback Stackelberg solution of an associated unconstrained game involving only sequential interactions, with a specific choice of the parameters that satisfy certain implicit complementarity conditions. For the linear-quadratic case, we show that an FSN solution is obtained by reformulating these complementarity conditions as a single large-scale linear complementarity problem. Finally, we illustrate our results using a dynamic duopoly game with production constraints.</description>

      <title>SLAM-Based Navigation and Fault Resilience in a Surveillance Quadcopter with Embedded Vision Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an autonomous aerial surveillance platform, Veg, designed as a fault-tolerant quadcopter system that integrates visual SLAM for GPS-independent navigation, advanced control architecture for dynamic stability, and embedded vision modules for real-time object and face recognition. The platform features a cascaded control design with an LQR inner-loop and PD outer-loop trajectory control. It leverages ORB-SLAM3 for 6-DoF localization and loop closure, and supports waypoint-based navigation through Dijkstra path planning over SLAM-derived maps. A real-time Failure Detection and Identification (FDI) system detects rotor faults and executes emergency landing through re-routing. The embedded vision system, based on a lightweight CNN and PCA, enables onboard object detection and face recognition with high precision. The drone operates fully onboard using a Raspberry Pi 4 and Arduino Nano, validated through simulations and real-world testing. This work consolidates real-time localization, fault recovery, and embedded AI on a single platform suitable for constrained environments.</description>
