      <title>Space AI: Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for Space to Improve Life on Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming domains from healthcare and agriculture to finance and industry. As progress on Earth meets growing constraints, the next frontier is outer space, where AI can enable autonomous, resilient operations under extreme uncertainty and limited human oversight. This paper introduces Space AI as a unified interdisciplinary field at the intersection of artificial intelligence and space science and technology. We consolidate historical developments and contemporary progress, and propose a systematic framework that organises Space AI into four mission contexts: 1 AI on Earth, covering intelligent mission planning, spacecraft design optimisation, simulation, and ground-based data analytics; 2 AI in Orbit, focusing on satellite and station autonomy, space robotics, on-board/near-real-time data processing, communication optimisation, and orbital safety; (3) AI in Deep Space, enabling autonomous navigation, adaptive scientific discovery, resource mapping, and long-duration human-AI collaboration under communication constraints; and 4 AI for Multi-Planetary Life, supporting in-situ resource utilisation, habitat and infrastructure construction, life-support and ecological management, and resilient interplanetary networks. Ultimately, Space AI can accelerate humanity's capability to explore and operate in space, while translating advances in sensing, robotics, optimisation, and trustworthy AI into broad societal impact on Earth.</description>

      <title>Starkindler: An Uncertainty Aware Objective for Photometric Redshift Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photometric Redshift is critical for analyzing astronomical objects, but existing ML methods often overlook the aleatoric uncertainties inherent in observed data. We introduce Starkindler, a novel training objective that explicitly incorporates observational errors into the model's objective function, thereby directly accounting for aleatoric uncertainty. Unlike traditional probabilistic models that focus solely on epistemic uncertainty, Starkindler provides uncertainty estimates that are regularised by aleatoric uncertainty, and is designed to be more interpretable. We train a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) using data from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and compare against the Photometric redshift estimates provided by SDSS. We show improvements in accuracy, calibration and reduction in predicted outlier rate. We also conduct an ablation study which confirms that excluding observational errors significantly degrades model performance, underscoring the importance of accounting for aleatoric uncertainty. Our results suggest that Starkindler not only enhances predictive performance but also provides interpretable uncertainty estimates, making it a robust tool for astronomical data analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct dark matter detection experiments search for rare signals induced by hypothetical, galactic dark matter particles in low-background detectors operated deep underground. I will briefly review the direct detection principles, the expected signals and backgrounds, and the main experimental techniques. I will then discuss the status of ongoing experiments aiming to discover new particles in the keV - TeV mass range, as well as future detectors and their sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Two birds with one stone: simultaneous realization of both Lunar Coordinate Time and lunar geoid time by a single orbital clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Among options for definition of the lunar reference time, the option taking Lunar Coordinate Time (O1) has its simplicity but cannot be realized by any clock without steering, while another option adopting the lunar geoid (selenoid) proper time (O2) has its convenience for users on the lunar surface but would bring a new scaling of spatial coordinates and mass parameter of the Moon. Aims. We propose a ''time aligned orbit'' that the readings of an ideal clock in this orbit could equal to the selenoid proper time in O2 and these readings could be converted to Lunar Coordinate Time in O1 by a known linear transformation. Methods. We show that there exist the time aligned orbit around the Moon with its semi-major axis of about 1.5 lunar radius slightly depending on its inclination. We conduct a set of numerical simulations to assess to what extent a clock on these orbits could realize O2 in a more realistic lunar environment. Results. We find that the proper time in our simulations would desynchronize from the selenoid proper time up to 190 ns after a year with a frequency offset of 6E-15, which is solely 3.75% of the frequency difference in O2 caused by the lunar surface topography. These numbers might be further reduced to 13 ns and 4E-16, if we could account for the deviation of the mean orbits in our simulations from the nominal ones. Conclusions. One might simultaneously realize O1 and O2 by deployment of a single clock in the time aligned orbit. This approach also has its scalability for other terrestrial planets beyond the Earth-Moon system.</description>

      <title>Why Machine Learning Models Systematically Underestimate Extreme Values II: How to Fix It with LatentNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attenuation bias -- the systematic underestimation of regression coefficients due to measurement errors in input variables -- affects astronomical data-driven models. For linear regression, this problem was solved by treating the true input values as latent variables to be estimated alongside model parameters. In this paper, we show that neural networks suffer from the same attenuation bias and that the latent variable solution generalizes directly to neural networks. We introduce LatentNN, a method that jointly optimizes network parameters and latent input values by maximizing the joint likelihood of observing both inputs and outputs. We demonstrate the correction on one-dimensional regression, multivariate inputs with correlated features, and stellar spectroscopy applications. LatentNN reduces attenuation bias across a range of signal-to-noise ratios where standard neural networks show large bias. This provides a framework for improved neural network inference in the low signal-to-noise regime characteristic of astronomical data. This bias correction is most effective when measurement errors are less than roughly half the intrinsic data range; in the regime of very low signal-to-noise and few informative features. Code is available at https://github.com/tingyuansen/LatentNN.</description>

      <title>Lossless compression of simulated radio interferometric visibilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Processing radio interferometric data often requires storing forward-predicted model data. In direction-dependent calibration, these data may have a volume an order of magnitude larger than the original data. Existing lossy compression techniques work well for observed, noisy data, but cause issues in calibration when applied to forward-predicted model data. Aims. To reduce the volume of forward-predicted model data, we present a lossless compression method called Simulated Signal Compression (Sisco) for noiseless data that integrates seamlessly with existing workflows. We show that Sisco can be combined with baseline-dependent averaging for further size reduction. Methods. Sisco decomposes complex floating-point visibility values and uses polynomial extrapolation in time and frequency to predict values, groups bytes for efficient encoding, and compresses residuals using the Deflate algorithm. We evaluate Sisco on diverse LOFAR, MeerKAT, and MWA datasets with various extrapolation functions. Implemented as an open-source Casacore storage manager, it can directly be used by any observatory that makes use of this format. Results. We find that a combination of linear and quadratic prediction yields optimal compression, reducing noiseless forward-predicted model data to 24% of its original volume on average. Compression varies by dataset, ranging from 13% for smooth data to 38% for less predictable data. For pure noise data, compression achieves just a size of 84% due to the unpredictability of such data. With the current implementation, the achieved compression throughput is with 534 MB/s mostly dominated by I/O on our testing platform, but occupies the processor during compression or decompression. Finally, we discuss the extension to a lossy algorithm.</description>

      <title>Sidelobe Modification for an Offset Gregorian Reflector System using a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Equipped Subreflector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In past work, we described the use of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) mounted on the rim of an axisymmetric prime focus-fed reflector to create nulls in the close-in sidelobes. In this paper, we show that similar performance is possible in an offset Gregorian reflector system using a RIS on the rim of the subreflector. Applications include radio astronomy, where offset Gregorian reflectors are common and observations are subject to deleterious levels of interference from satellites entering through sidelobes. We show that an efficient RIS replacing the outer one-third of the subreflector surface, employing passive elements with 1-bit phase-only control, can create a null in the peak of the second sidelobe in the quiescent pattern. This is achieved using a simple unconstrained optimization algorithm to set the states of the RIS elements. The algorithm yields a deep null with just 0.2~dB reduction in main lobe directivity, despite lacking any constraints on main lobe pattern. Compared to our previous approach of mounting the RIS on the rim of the main reflector, the subreflector-based approach demonstrated in this paper requires a much smaller RIS and can implemented in existing systems by replacing the subreflector.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Zoo Evo: 1 million human-annotated images of galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Galaxy Zoo Evo, a labeled dataset for building and evaluating foundation models on images of galaxies. GZ Evo includes 104M crowdsourced labels for 823k images from four telescopes. Each image is labeled with a series of fine-grained questions and answers (e.g. "featured galaxy, two spiral arms, tightly wound, merging with another galaxy"). These detailed labels are useful for pretraining or finetuning. We also include four smaller sets of labels (167k galaxies in total) for downstream tasks of specific interest to astronomers, including finding strong lenses and describing galaxies from the new space telescope Euclid. We hope GZ Evo will serve as a real-world benchmark for computer vision topics such as domain adaption (from terrestrial to astronomical, or between telescopes) or learning under uncertainty from crowdsourced labels. We also hope it will support a new generation of foundation models for astronomy; such models will be critical to future astronomers seeking to better understand our universe.</description>

      <title>Clustering Confuses Spectro-photometry: An Investigation of 2D and 3D Forced Profile Matching for Stacking Line-intensity Mapping Data on Source Catalogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Line-intensity mapping (LIM) is an emerging observational technique that is used to observe the universe on large scales at low resolution through spectral line emission. Stacking analyses coadd cutouts of LIM data on positions of known signal emitters, robustly detecting signal otherwise hidden in a noisy map. In this article, we present two augmentations of a stacking pipeline, both aiming to refine the sensitivity of the stack by assuming a specific observed signal shape in 2D spatial axes or 3D spatial and spectral axes, as well as stacking on source coordinates more precise than the resolution of the LIM data cube. We test these methods on a series of simplistic and complex simulations mimicking observations with the CO Mapping Array Project (COMAP) Pathfinder. We find that these fitting methods provide up to a 25% advantage in detection significance over the original stack method in realistic COMAP-like simulations. We also find that the optimal fitting profile, given our CO line model and galaxy model, is larger than the 5' width of the COMAP beam and takes on a Lorentzian shape in the spectral dimension. Our findings suggest a nuanced dependence of the optimal profile size and shape on the LIM signal itself, including redshift-space clustering and fingers-of-God effects that depend on the tracer luminosity function and bias.</description>

      <title>Double to tenfold M-shell photoionization of singly charged lanthanum ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the photon-ion merged-beams technique at the PETRA\,III synchrotron light source, we have measured cross sections for double and up to tenfold photoionization of La$^{+}$ ions by a single photon in the energy range 820--1400~eV, where resonances and thresholds occur that are associated with the excitation or ionization of one $M$-shell electron. These cross sections represent experimental benchmark data for the further development of quantum theoretical methods, which will have to provide the bulk of the atomic data required for the modeling of nonequilibrium plasmas such as kilonovae. In the present work, we have upgraded the Jena Atomic Calculator (JAC) and pushed the state-of-the-art of quantum calculations for heavy many-electron systems to new limits. In particular, we have performed large-scale calculations of the La$^+$ photoabsorption cross section and of the deexcitation cascades, which set in after the initial creation of a $3d$ hole. Our theoretical results largely agree with our experimental findings. However, our theoretical product-ion charge state distributions are somewhat narrower than the experimental ones, which is most probably due to the simplifications necessary to keep the cascade calculations tractable.</description>

      <title>A Linearized Approach to Radial-Velocity Extraction. II: Shot-Noise-Limited Precision via Spectral Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) formalism for radial velocity extraction to cases where the underlying spectral components are unknown. The method factorizes a spectroscopic time series into principal spectra and time-dependent kernels, enabling simultaneous recovery of both. In Fourier space, each inverse-wavelength slice is decomposed by singular value decomposition, and radial velocity shifts are inferred from phase differences between epochs. In the high-SNR regime, this provides a linearized and statistically tractable estimate of differential velocities. The method is validated on synthetic and SOAP simulations and applied to EXPRES observations of HD 34411 and $\tau$ Ceti, recovering coherent signals and reaching the instrumental precision limit of ~30 cm/s. Apart from p-mode modulation, the residuals show no significant long-term correlations and allow the detection of signals with semi-amplitudes down to ~50 cm/s with $\lesssim10$ cm/s uncertainty. The framework thus enables extreme-precision radial velocity measurements in the presence of spectral variability, representing a step toward detecting and characterizing Earth-like planets around solar-type stars.</description>

      <title>Search for Annual Modulation in Combined ANAIS 112 and COSINE 100 Data using Bayesian Model Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a Bayesian model comparison test between a sinusoidal modulation model and a constant value model using about three years of combined COSINE-100 and ANAIS-112 data. We use both uniform priors and normal priors (based on DAMA best-fit values) for the angular frequency and phase of the cosine signal. We find natural log of Bayes factor for the cosine model comapred to the constant value model to be less than 1.15 for the data in both 1-6 keV and 2-6 keV energy intervals. This shows that there is no evidence for cosine signal from dark matter interactions in the combined ANAIS-112/COSINE-100 data. Our analysis codes have also been made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Predicting the detection yields of giant planets and brown dwarfs with CSST astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST), which will begin its scientific operations around 2027, is going to survey the sky area of the median-to-high Galactic latitude and median-to-high ecliptic latitude. The high astrometric precision of the CSST Survey Camera for faint objects enables the detection of a number of giant planets and brown dwarfs around M-dwarfs and brown dwarfs via differential astrometry in its optical survey. In this paper, we predict the number of giant planets and brown dwarfs around stars and brown dwarfs detectable with CSST astrometry. We generate synthetic samples of CSST stellar and substellar sources, and carry out companion injection-recovery simulations in the samples using different occurrence rates for FGK-dwarfs, M-dwarfs, and brown dwarfs. We calculate companion yields based on CSST astrometric precision. Our analysis reveals that over its 10-year mission, the CSST Survey Camera could barely discover giant planets and low-mass BDs around FGK-dwarfs, but is projected to detect 20 - 170 giant planets and low-mass brown dwarfs around M-dwarfs within 300 pc, and 300 - 570 brown dwarf binaries within 600 pc. Therefore, CSST astrometry is likely to significantly increase the current sample of substellar companions around M-dwarfs and brown dwarfs. This sample will deepen our understanding of planet formation and evolution around low-mass stars and brown dwarfs.</description>

In particular, NaI-based cryogenic scintillating calorimeters have emerged as promising candidates, like in the COSINUS experiment, for testing the annually modulating signal reported by DAMA/LIBRA. In this study, we investigate defect formation within NaI crystals and its impact on the dark matter detection signal. Using molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory techniques, we simulate a DM particle collision on an NaI crystal, focusing on the possible defects formation and their structural and electronic properties. Our analysis includes a detailed study of the electronic states associated with the interstitial atoms and vacancies, the energetic cost of defect formation, and the anisotropic threshold displacement energy. Finally, we highlight the potential to exploit dark matter-induced defects as a novel detection channel, enabled by the introduction of new states within the electronic band gap.</description>

      <title>The new generation lunar gravitational wave detectors: sky map resolution and joint analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lunar-based gravitational-wave interferometry is a fascinating endeavor, and was proposed as a promising approach to bridge the observational gap between space-borne and ground-based detectors. In this work, we adopt the Fisher-matrix method to examine the angular-resolution performance of the newly proposed Crater Interferometry Gravitational-wave Observatory (CIGO) on the lunar crater rim near the north pole, together with TianQin and LISA, for monochromatic sources in the 0.1-10 Hz band. We find that above 0.1 Hz, CIGO achieves better localization accuracy than the other two space-based missions and dominates the combined detector network's performance, provided that lunar noise mitigation is achieved in the 0.1-2.87 Hz frequency range. We further explore an upgraded Tetrahedron configuration, TCIGO, with a fourth station at the bottom of a crater, which forms a regular tetrahedral constellation on the lunar surface. The result shows that TCIGO yields a five-fold improvement in angular-resolution capability over CIGO and gets better sky coverage across the target frequency band.</description>

      <title>First Use of GPS Satellites for Beam Calibration of Radio Dish Telescopes</title>

Abstract: We present results from the first application of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS; e.g., the Global Positioning System, GPS) for radio beam calibration using a commercial GNSS receiver with the Deep Dish Development Array (D3A) at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory (DRAO). Several GNSS satellites pass through the main and sidelobes of the beam each day, enabling efficient mapping of the 2D beam structure. Due to the high SNR and abundance of GNSS satellites, we find evidence that GNSS can probe several sidelobes of the beam through repeatable measurements of the beam over several days. Over three days of measurements, the smallest observed difference in the primary beam's main lobe was 0.56 dB-Hz. We also compare our results in the sidelobes to simulations and find rough agreement in shape. When scaling the observations and simulations to match in the main lobe power levels, we find deviations in at least one of the first few nulls of approximately 5 dB or less. There is saturation in the main lobe for most satellites, which can likely be mitigated by better attenuation before the receiver input. We compare our work to other satellite systems that have been successful and are likely complementary to this technique. However, GNSS offers key advantages, including continuous transmission, broader frequency coverage relevant to CHORD, SKA-mid, and the DSA-2000, as well as more frequent satellite passes, making it a promising calibration method. These results also motivate further development of this technique for radio astronomy applications.</description>

      <title>A Generative Model for Disentangling Galaxy Photometric Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ongoing and future photometric surveys will produce unprecedented volumes of galaxy images, necessitating robust, efficient methods for deriving galaxy morphological parameters at scale. Traditional approaches, such as parametric light-profile fitting, offer valuable insights but become computationally prohibitive when applied to billions of sources. In this work, we propose a Conditional AutoEncoder (CAE) framework to simultaneously model and characterize galaxy morphology. Our CAE is trained on a suite of realistic mock galaxy images generated via GalSim, encompassing a broad range of galaxy types, photometric parameters (e.g., flux, half-light radius, Sersic index, ellipticity), and observational conditions. By encoding each galaxy image into a low-dimensional latent representation conditioned on key parameters, our model effectively recovers these morphological features in a disentangled manner, while also reconstructing the original image. The results demonstrate that the CAE approach can accurately and efficiently infer complex structural properties, offering a powerful alternative to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Robust and scalable simulation-based inference for gravitational wave signals with gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) data stream will inevitably contain gaps due to maintenance and environmental disturbances, introducing nonstationarities and spectral leakage that compromise standard frequency-domain likelihood evaluations. We present a scalable Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) framework capable of robust parameter estimation directly from gapped time-series data. We employ Flow Matching Posterior Estimation (FMPE) conditioned on a learned summary of the data, optimized through an end-to-end training strategy. To address the computational challenges of long-duration signals, we propose a dual-pathway summarizer architecture: a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) operating on the time domain for high precision, and a novel wavelet-based 2D CNN utilizing asymmetric, dilated kernels to achieve scalability for datasets spanning months. We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework on simulated Galactic Binary-like signals, showing that our joint training approach yields tighter, unbiased posteriors compared to two-stage reconstruction pipelines. Furthermore, we provide the first systematic comparison showing that FMPE offers superior stability and coverage calibration over conventional Normalizing Flows in the presence of severe data artifacts.</description>

      <title>Towards an agnostic algorithm for sampling empirical structure models: The case of Uranus and Neptune</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16995v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an algorithm to efficiently sample the full space of planetary interior density profiles. Our approach uses as few assumptions as possible to pursue an agnostic algorithm. The algorithm avoids the common Markov Chain Monte Carlo method and instead uses an optimisation-based gradient-descent approach designed for computational efficiency. In this work, we use Uranus and Neptune as test cases and obtain empirical models that provide density and pressure profiles consistent with the observed physical properties (total mass, radius, and gravitational moments). We compare our findings to other work and find that while other studies are generally in line with our findings, they do not cover the entire space of solutions faithfully. Furthermore, we present guidance for modellers that construct Uranus or Neptune interior models with a fixed number of layers. We provide a statistical relation between the steepness classifying a density discontinuity and the resulting number of discontinuities to be expected. For example, if one classifies a discontinuity as a density gradient larger than 0.02 kg$\,$m$^{-4}$, then most solutions should have at most one such discontinuity. Finally, we find that discontinuities, if present, are concentrated around a planetary normalised radius of 0.65 for Uranus and 0.7 for Neptune. Our algorithm to efficiently and faithfully investigate the full space of possible interior density profiles can be used to study all planetary objects with gravitational field data.</description>
