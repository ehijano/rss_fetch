      <title>Acoustic axes conditions revised</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The explanation of the basic acoustic properties of crystals requires a recognition of the acoustic axes. To derive the acoustic axes in a given material, one requires both a workable method and the necessary and sufficient criteria for the existence of the acoustic axes in a partial propagation direction. We apply the reduced form of the acoustic tensor to the acoustic axis conditions in the present work. Using this tensor, we obtain in a compact form, allowing for qualitative analysis, the necessary and sufficient criteria for the existence of the acoustic axis. Furthermore, the well-known Khatkevich criteria and their variants are recast in terms of the reduced acoustic tensor. This paper's primary input is an alternate minimal polynomial-based system of acoustic axes conditions. In this approach, we derive an additional characteristic of acoustic axes: the directions in which the minimal polynomial of the third order is reduced to that of the second order. Next, we offer a general solution to the second-order minimum polynomial equation, that utilizes a scalar and a unit vector for defining the acoustic tensor along the acoustic axis. It is shown that the scalar matches the eigenvalue of the reduced acoustic tensor, and the vector corresponds to the polarization into the single eigenvalue direction. We use the minimal polynomial construction to demonstrate the equivalence of different acoustic axis criteria. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach to actual computations of the acoustic axes and their fundamental properties (phase speeds and polarizations) for high symmetry cases, such as isotropic materials and RTHC crystals.</description>

      <title>Simulations of Classical Three-Body Thermalization in One Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One-dimensional systems, such as nanowires or electrons moving along strong magnetic field lines, have peculiar thermalization physics. The binary collision of point-like particles, typically the dominant process for reaching thermal equilibrium in higher dimensional systems, cannot thermalize a 1D system. We study how dilute classical 1D gases thermalize through three-body collisions. We consider a system of identical classical point particles with pairwise repulsive inverse power-law potential $V_{ij} \propto 1/|x_i-x_j|^n$ or the pairwise Lennard-Jones potential. Using Monte Carlo methods, we compute a collision kernel and use it in the Boltzmann equation to evolve a perturbed thermal state with temperature $T$ toward equilibrium. We explain the shape of the kernel and its dependence on the system parameters. Additionally, we implement molecular dynamics simulations of a many-body gas and show agreement with the Boltzmann evolution in the low density limit. For the inverse power-law potential, the rate of thermalization is proportional to $\rho^2 T^{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{n}}$ where $\rho$ is the number density. The corresponding proportionality constant decreases with increasing $n$.</description>
