      <title>UCFE: A User-Centric Financial Expertise Benchmark for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the UCFE: User-Centric Financial Expertise benchmark, an innovative framework designed to evaluate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to handle complex real-world financial tasks. UCFE benchmark adopts a hybrid approach that combines human expert evaluations with dynamic, task-specific interactions to simulate the complexities of evolving financial scenarios. Firstly, we conducted a user study involving 804 participants, collecting their feedback on financial tasks. Secondly, based on this feedback, we created our dataset that encompasses a wide range of user intents and interactions. This dataset serves as the foundation for benchmarking 12 LLM services using the LLM-as-Judge methodology. Our results show a significant alignment between benchmark scores and human preferences, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.78, confirming the effectiveness of the UCFE dataset and our evaluation approach. UCFE benchmark not only reveals the potential of LLMs in the financial sector but also provides a robust framework for assessing their performance and user satisfaction.The benchmark dataset and evaluation code are available.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning in Non-Markov Market-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a deep reinforcement learning (RL) framework for an optimal market-making (MM) trading problem, specifically focusing on price processes with semi-Markov and Hawkes Jump-Diffusion dynamics. We begin by discussing the basics of RL and the deep RL framework used, where we deployed the state-of-the-art Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm for the deep learning part. The SAC algorithm is an off-policy entropy maximization algorithm more suitable for tackling complex, high-dimensional problems with continuous state and action spaces like in optimal market-making (MM). We introduce the optimal MM problem considered, where we detail all the deterministic and stochastic processes that go into setting up an environment for simulating this strategy. Here we also give an in-depth overview of the jump-diffusion pricing dynamics used, our method for dealing with adverse selection within the limit order book, and we highlight the working parts of our optimization problem. Next, we discuss training and testing results, where we give visuals of how important deterministic and stochastic processes such as the bid/ask, trade executions, inventory, and the reward function evolved. We include a discussion on the limitations of these results, which are important points to note for most diffusion models in this setting.</description>

      <title>Neuro-Symbolic Traders: Assessing the Wisdom of AI Crowds in Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep generative models are becoming increasingly used as tools for financial analysis. However, it is unclear how these models will influence financial markets, especially when they infer financial value in a semi-autonomous way. In this work, we explore the interplay between deep generative models and market dynamics. We develop a form of virtual traders that use deep generative models to make buy/sell decisions, which we term neuro-symbolic traders, and expose them to a virtual market. Under our framework, neuro-symbolic traders are agents that use vision-language models to discover a model of the fundamental value of an asset. Agents develop this model as a stochastic differential equation, calibrated to market data using gradient descent. We test our neuro-symbolic traders on both synthetic data and real financial time series, including an equity stock, commodity, and a foreign exchange pair. We then expose several groups of neuro-symbolic traders to a virtual market environment. This market environment allows for feedback between the traders belief of the underlying value to the observed price dynamics. We find that this leads to price suppression compared to the historical data, highlighting a future risk to market stability. Our work is a first step towards quantifying the effect of deep generative agents on markets dynamics and sets out some of the potential risks and benefits of this approach in the future.</description>
