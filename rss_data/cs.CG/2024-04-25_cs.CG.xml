      <title>Minimum Consistent Subset in Trees and Interval Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Minimum Consistent Subset (MCS) problem, we are presented with a connected simple undirected graph $G=(V,E)$, consisting of a vertex set $V$ of size $n$ and an edge set $E$. Each vertex in $V$ is assigned a color from the set $\{1,2,\ldots, c\}$. The objective is to determine a subset $V' \subseteq V$ with minimum possible cardinality, such that for every vertex $v \in V$, at least one of its nearest neighbors in $V'$ (measured in terms of the hop distance) shares the same color as $v$. The decision problem, indicating whether there exists a subset $V'$ of cardinality at most $l$ for some positive integer $l$, is known to be NP-complete even for planar graphs.
  In this paper, we establish that the MCS problem for trees, when the number of colors $c$ is considered an input parameter, is NP-complete. We propose a fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithm for MCS on trees running in $O(2^{6c}n^6)$ time, significantly improving the currently best-known algorithm whose running time is $O(2^{4c}n^{2c+3})$.
  In an effort to comprehensively understand the computational complexity of the MCS problem across different graph classes, we extend our investigation to interval graphs. We show that it remains NP-complete for interval graphs, thus enriching graph classes where MCS remains intractable.</description>

      <title>Filling holes in LoD2 building models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new algorithm for filling holes in Level of Detail 2 (LoD2) building mesh models, addressing the challenges posed by geometric inaccuracies and topological errors. Unlike traditional methods that often alter the original geometric structure or impose stringent input requirements, our approach preserves the integrity of the original model while effectively managing a range of topological errors. The algorithm operates in three distinct phases: (1) pre-processing, which addresses topological errors and identifies pseudo-holes; (2) detecting and extracting complete border rings of holes; and (3) remeshing, aimed at reconstructing the complete geometric surface. Our method demonstrates superior performance compared to related work in filling holes in building mesh models, achieving both uniform local geometry around the holes and structural completeness. Comparative experiments with established methods demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness in delivering more complete and geometrically consistent hole-filling results, albeit with a slight trade-off in efficiency. The paper also identifies challenges in handling certain complex scenarios and outlines future directions for research, including the pursuit of a comprehensive repair goal for LoD2 models to achieve watertight 2-manifold models with correctly oriented normals.

      <title>CWF: Consolidating Weak Features in High-quality Mesh Simplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In mesh simplification, common requirements like accuracy, triangle quality, and feature alignment are often considered as a trade-off. Existing algorithms concentrate on just one or a few specific aspects of these requirements. For example, the well-known Quadric Error Metrics (QEM) approach prioritizes accuracy and can preserve strong feature lines/points as well but falls short in ensuring high triangle quality and may degrade weak features that are not as distinctive as strong ones. In this paper, we propose a smooth functional that simultaneously considers all of these requirements. The functional comprises a normal anisotropy term and a Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation (CVT) energy term, with the variables being a set of movable points lying on the surface. The former inherits the spirit of QEM but operates in a continuous setting, while the latter encourages even point distribution, allowing various surface metrics. We further introduce a decaying weight to automatically balance the two terms. We selected 100 CAD models from the ABC dataset, along with 21 organic models, to compare the existing mesh simplification algorithms with ours. Experimental results reveal an important observation: the introduction of a decaying weight effectively reduces the conflict between the two terms and enables the alignment of weak features. This distinctive feature sets our approach apart from most existing mesh simplification methods and demonstrates significant potential in shape understanding.</description>

      <title>Few-shot point cloud reconstruction and denoising via learned Guassian splats renderings and fine-tuned diffusion features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01112v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing deep learning methods for the reconstruction and denoising of point clouds rely on small datasets of 3D shapes. We circumvent the problem by leveraging deep learning methods trained on billions of images. We propose a method to reconstruct point clouds from few images and to denoise point clouds from their rendering by exploiting prior knowledge distilled from image-based deep learning models. To improve reconstruction in constraint settings, we regularize the training of a differentiable renderer with hybrid surface and appearance by introducing semantic consistency supervision. In addition, we propose a pipeline to finetune Stable Diffusion to denoise renderings of noisy point clouds and we demonstrate how these learned filters can be used to remove point cloud noise coming without 3D supervision. We compare our method with DSS and PointRadiance and achieved higher quality 3D reconstruction on the Sketchfab Testset and SCUT Dataset.</description>
