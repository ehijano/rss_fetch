      <title>An optimal Brouwer's fixed point theorem for discontinuous functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brouwer's fixed point theorem states that any continuous function from a closed $n$-dimensional ball to itself has a fixed point. In 1961, Klee showed that if such a function has discontinuities that are bounded, then it has a point that is close to being fixed. We improve upon Klee's results in any finite-dimensional Euclidean space, and prove that our bounds are the best possible.</description>

      <title>Spherically Supported Property and the Exterior Sphere Condition with Infinite Radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present several new characterizations of the spherically supported geometric property introduced in [19], emphasizing its connection with the exterior sphere condition with infinite radius. Moreover, we strengthen and provide a more direct and simpler proof of the main result established in [19].</description>

      <title>On the uniform continuity of homeomorphisms between the spheres of $\ell_\infty^k$ and $\ell_1^k$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of whether there is a sequence of homeomorphisms $(F_k)_k$ between the unit spheres of the $k$-dimensional Banach spaces $\ell_\infty^k$ and $\ell_1^k$ which is also equi-uniformly continuous. We prove that this cannot be the case if the sequence $(F_k)_k$ either (1) does not increase support sizes (which is a property strictly weaker than support preservation) or (2) is step preserving (which is a property strictly weaker than being equivariant with respect to permutations of the canonical basis). We also provide quantitative estimates relating the moduli of uniform continuity of the maps to the dimension of the spaces. This gives partial answers to a question of W. B. Johnson and it is related to the problem of whether $c_0$ has Kasparov and Yu's Property (H). Our results also apply to more general spaces other than $\ell_1$ such as spaces with unconditional bases which are not equivalent to the standard $c_0$ basis. Finally, we derive an asymptotic concentration inequality that must be satisfied by step preserving equi-uniformly continuous maps defined on the positive parts of these unit spheres.</description>

      <title>Regions surrounded by cylinders of circles of fixed radii and exposition of their shapes by natural graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate regions formed by cylinders of circles of fixed radii. We investigate graphs obtained by collapsing each level set of the functions represented by the natural projections of them to the $1$-dimensional line. Some specific trees obtained in simple ways from so-called balanced trees are shown to be realized as such graphs. Related studies on regions in the Euclidean plane surrounded by real algebraic curves are presented by several researchers. One of pioneering studies is presented by Bodin, Popescu-Pampu and Sorea in 2022--3 as an elementary and surprisingly new study. The author has been interested in related studies and also in constructing natural and explicit real algebraic maps onto such regions, generalizing the canonical projections of the unit spheres. Such studies in real algebraic geometry, different from theory of existence in the last century, mainly studied by Nash and Tognoli, are remarked.</description>

      <title>Embedding Borel graphs into grids of asymptotically optimal dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a Borel graph all of whose finite subgraphs embed into the $d$-dimensional grid with diagonals. We show that then $G$ itself admits a Borel embedding into the Schreier graph of a free Borel action of $\mathbb Z^{O(d)}$. This strengthens an earlier result of the authors, in which $O(d)$ is replaced by $O(\rho \log \rho)$, where $\rho$ is the polynomial growth rate of $G$.</description>
