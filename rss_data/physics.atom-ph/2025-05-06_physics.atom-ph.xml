      <title>Magneto-optical trap loading with an effusive oven in a large optical access experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimental, numerical, and analytical study of a strontium magneto-optical trap (MOT) loaded from an effusive oven in a configuration optimized for high numerical aperture optical tweezers. Our approach orients the cold atom flux along the MOT symmetry axis to reduce the experimental complexity and maximize the overall optical access into the scientific region of study. We use a moving molasses technique to enable this configuration and show that its performance depends critically on metastable-state shelving (to 5s5p 3P2) during the atom transfer to the 3D MOT. Furthermore, we find that the parameters for optimal transfer efficiency are bounded by dark-state loss (to 5s5p 3P0) in the trap region where repumping is present. These observations are verified to great degree of accuracy using both our developed analytical and numerical models. The corresponding 3D simulation tool is used to perform a comprehensive study of the trap loading dynamics, beginning at the oven exit and ending at the 3D MOT, demonstrating its effectiveness in optimizing an effusive oven experiment.</description>

      <title>Narrowline cooling of dysprosium atoms in an optical tweezer array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform narrowline cooling of single dysprosium atoms trapped in a 1D optical tweezers array, employing the narrow single-photon transition at 741 nm. At the trapping wavelength of 532 nm, the excited state is less trapped than the ground state. To obtain efficient cooling performances, we chirp the frequency of the cooling beam to subsequently address the red sidebands of different motional states. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the cooling protocol through Raman thermometry, which we characterize for our experimental conditions. We obtain an array of 75 atoms close to the motional ground state in the radial direction of the tweezers. Our results demonstrate the possibility to manipulate the motional degree of freedom of dysprosium in optical tweezers arrays, a key ingredient to exploit the potential of lanthanide-based tweezers platforms for quantum science.</description>

      <title>Attosecond-Resolved Photoionization Dynamics and Interference-Enhanced Photoelectron Circular Dichroism in Chiral Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral molecules exhibit enantiosensitive light-matter interactions, with photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) serving as a sensitive probe of molecular chirality through the asymmetry in the photoelectron wavepacket amplitude. Here, we demonstrate a photoelectron interferometric approach to access the phase of the photoelectron wavepacket and uncover attosecond dynamics in chiral molecule photoionization. Using circularly polarized attosecond XUV pulse trains synchronized with IR fields, we reveal distinct time delays between forward- and backward-ejected photoelectrons in a randomly oriented ensemble of chiral molecules. Moreover, we predict a pronounced enhancement of PECD due to the interference of the two photoionization pathways. The forward-backward time delay difference and the PECD are more prominent when the IR field counter-rotates with the XUV field. These results imply the counter-rotating IR field is more efficient in generating odd-parity photoelectron wavepackets in continuum-continuum transitions, highlighting the critical role of long-range chiral potential. Our work demonstrates a way of coherent control over the chiral photoelectron wavepackets, providing a route to enhance chiral signals and manipulate ultrafast chiral dynamics on attosecond time scales.</description>

      <title>Thermal properties of zero sound in asymmetric nuclear matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The zero-sound modes at finite temperature are investigated with the relativistic random phase approximation to signal the uncertainty of the equation of state (EOS) of asymmetric nuclear matter. It is observed that in typically selected stiff and soft relativistic mean-field (RMF) models, zero-sound modes arise at low temperature, whereas increasing the temperature gradually breaks the zero sound in soft models, with a smaller density range compared to stiff models. At high density, the presence or absence of zero sound turns out to be correspondingly the character of the stiff or soft RMF EOS. More strikingly, we find by analyzing the dispersion relation and sound velocity that at finite temperature the zero-sound modes in RMF models with the stiff EOS undergo a thermal bifurcation, resulting in the transform of zero sound into the first sound at some momentum $Q&gt;T$. The thermally bifurcated sound branch in the stiff models and the zero-sound branch in the soft models are both highly sensitive to the slope of the symmetry energy, providing promising signals for the pending high-density symmetry energies. In addition, it is found that there exists a nonlinear dispersion relation for both the stiff and soft models that supports the zero sound in the relatively lower density region.</description>

      <title>Methods for quantum interference in atomic ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An experimental method for obtaining quantum interference signal in atomic ensemble using a bi-chromatic field is discussed. Here, the quantum interference signal is obtained by scanning the magnetic field rather than conventional method of changing the frequency separation between the light fields. We could simultaneously observe resonances due to population redistribution and quantum superposition between non-degenerate states, which otherwise involves fundamentally different approaches. The method is implemented to Rubidium atoms in buffer gas filled as well as anti-relaxation coated atomic cells. Apart from phenomenological interest, the modified experimental procedure is found to be convenient for in-situ calibration of three axis magnetic coils. The investigation will be useful for high as well as low vector magnetic field sensing.</description>

      <title>Signatures of linearized gravity in atom interferometers: A simplified computational framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a general framework for calculating the leading-order, general relativistic contributions to the gravitational phase shift in single-photon atom interferometers within the context of linearized gravity. We show that the atom gradiometer observable, which only depends on the atom interferometer propagation phase, can be written in terms of three distinct contributions: the Doppler phase shift, which accounts for the tidal displacement of atoms along the baseline, the Shapiro phase shift, which accounts for the delay in the arrival time of photons at atom-light interaction points, and the Einstein phase shift, which accounts for the gravitational redshift measured by the atoms. For specific atom gradiometer configurations, we derive the signal and response functions for two physically motivated scenarios: (i) transient gravitational waves in the transverse-traceless gauge and, for the first time, in the proper detector frame, and (ii) transient massive objects sourcing weak and slow-varying Newtonian potentials. We find that the Doppler contribution of realistic Newtonian noise sources (e.g., a freight truck or a piece of space debris) at proposed atom gradiometer experiments, such as AION, MAGIS and AEDGE, can exceed the shot noise level and thus affect physics searches if not properly subtracted.</description>

      <title>Interplay between external driving, dissipation and collective effects in the Markovian and non-Markovian regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03297v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how external driving and dissipation jointly influence the dynamics of open quantum systems is essential for advancing the study of non-equilibrium quantum phenomena and developing quantum technologies. The present study addresses the issue by exploring the behavior of open systems in driven optical setups coupled to a bosonic field. Starting from an exact non-Markovian master equation for linear systems, we extend the analysis to an ensemble of quantum emitters and validate the proposed solution. The analytical results unveil a range of intriguing phenomena, including pronounced non-Markovian corrections to the coherent driving and a collective cross-driving effect. These effects are experimentally accessible in platforms such as cavity QED, photonic crystals, and state-dependent optical lattices. In the Markovian limit, comparison with exact solutions reveal short-time non-Markovian effects that endure well beyond the environmental correlation decay time, alongside memory effects triggered by short laser pulses. These findings offer valuable insights into the dynamics of driven open systems, laying the groundwork for precise quantum state control.</description>

      <title>Fano resonance in XUV generated by helium with few-cycle intense laser pulses and its classical analogy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We integrate numerically the Schr\"odinger equation for the model helium atom irradiated by intense few-cycle laser pulse and find the emitted XUV spectra. They demonstrate resonant peaks at the frequencies of transitions from the doubly-excited autoionizing states (AISs) to the ground state. We study the properties of these peaks depending on the laser pulse duration and find that the decay of the AISs due to photoionization by the laser field affects them. Moreover, we consider the classical system of two coupled oscillators and find that both the quantum (the atom with AIS in the field) and the classical (the coupled oscillators with friction) systems demonstrate Fano-like resonant peak described by an essentially complex asymmetry parameter. We find a remarkable similarity in the behavior of these systems and conclude that the classical system of coupled oscillators with friction is an analogy of the AIS having an extra decay channel in addition to the autoionization one.</description>

      <title>Universality in the microwave shielding of ultracold polar molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microwave shielding is an important technique that can suppress the losses that arise from collisions of ultracold polar molecules. It has been instrumental in achieving molecular Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) for NaCs [Bigagli et al., Nature 631, 289 (2024)]. We demonstrate that microwave shielding is universal, in the sense that the 2-body collision properties of different molecules are very similar when expressed in suitable reduced units of length and energy. This applies to rate coefficients for inelastic scattering and loss, to scattering lengths, and to the properties of 2-molecule bound states. We also explore the small deviations from universality that arise at very large Rabi frequencies. In general, the collision properties are near-universal except when the Rabi frequency exceeds a few percent of the molecular rotational constant. The universality extends to elliptically polarized microwaves and to combinations of multiple fields. Our results indicate that the methods that have been used to achieve BEC for NaCs can be transferred directly to most other polar molecules.</description>

      <title>Reducing thermal noises by quantum refrigerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reducing the thermal noises in microwave (MW) resonators can bring about significant progress in many research fields. In this study, we consider using three-level or four-level systems as "quantum refrigerators" to cool down MW resonators so as to reduce the thermal noises, and investigate their possible cooling limits. In such a quantum refrigerator system, the MW resonator is coupled with many three-level or four-level systems. Proper light pump makes the multilevel systems concentrated into their ground states, which continuously absorb the thermal photons in the MW resonator. By adiabatic elimination, we give a more precise description for this cooling process. For three level systems, though the laser driving can cool down the multilevel systems efficiently, a too strong driving strength also significantly perturbs their energy levels, breaking the resonant interaction between the atom and the resonator, which weakens the cooling effect, and that sets a finite region for cooling parameters. In four level systems, by adopting an indirect pumping approach, such a finite cooling region can be further released. In both cases, we obtain analytical results for the cooling limit of the MW resonator. Based on practical parameters, our estimation shows the cooling limit could reach lower than the liquid helium temperature, without resorting to the traditional cryogenic systems.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Atom Loss Errors in Fault Tolerant Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Errors associated with qubit loss constitute an important source of noise in many quantum hardware systems, particularly in neutral atom quantum computers. We develop a theoretical framework to handle these errors in logical algorithms, incorporating decoding techniques and circuit-level optimizations. Focusing on experimentally-motivated error models, we introduce a delayed-erasure decoder which leverages information from state-selective readout to accurately correct loss errors, even when their precise locations are unknown. Our decoding technique is compatible with a wide range of quantum error correction codes and general logical circuits. Using this decoder, we identify strategies for detecting and correcting atom loss based on the logical circuit structure. For deep circuits with a large number of gate layers prior to logical measurements, we explore methods to integrate loss detection into syndrome extraction with minimal overhead, identifying optimal strategies depending on the qubit loss fraction in the noise. In contrast, many algorithmic subroutines involve frequent gate teleportation, shortening the circuit depth before logical measurement and naturally replacing qubits without additional overhead. We simulate such a teleportation-based algorithm, involving a toy model for small-angle synthesis and find a significant improvement in logical error rates as the loss fraction increases, with loss handled solely through teleportation. These results provide a path forward for advancing large-scale fault tolerant quantum computation in systems with loss errors.</description>

      <title>The Unitarity-Limit Expansion for Two Nucleons with Perturbative Pions: Digest and Ideas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the Unitarity Limit, the NN S-wave binding energies are zero, the scattering lengths infinite, Physics is universal, i.e. insensitive to details of the interactions, and observables display richer symmetries, namely invariance under both scaling and Wigner's combined SU(4) transformation of spin and isospin. This presentation is a digest of the first quantitative exploration of corrections to this picture when pions are included [1] (see there for a more comprehensive list of references). Since the pion mass and decay constant introduce dimensionful scales in the NN system, they explicitly break the symmetries of the Unitarity fixed point. In $\chi$EFT, these symmetries must therefore be classified as emergent. This text focuses on the $\chi$EFT variant with Perturbative ("KSW") Pions at next-to-next-to leading order (N2LO). This leads to the Hypothesis that both scale invariance and Wigner-SU(4) symmetry in the Unitarity Expansion show persistence, i.e. the footprint of both combined dominates even for $k\gtrsim m_\pi$ and is more relevant than chiral symmetry, so that the tensor/Wigner-SU(4) symmetry-breaking part of OPE is suppressed and does not enter before N3LO. Included are also ideas about underlying mechanisms and LO results of $\chi$EFT with Nonperturbative Pions in the expansion about Unitarity.</description>
