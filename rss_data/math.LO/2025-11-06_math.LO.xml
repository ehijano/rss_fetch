      <title>Ignorance as an excuse, formally</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a lively debate in the current literature on epistemology on which type of ignorance may provide a moral excuse. A good candidate is the one in which an agent has never thought about or considered as true a proposition $p$. From a logical perspective, it is usual to model situations involving ignorance by means of epistemic logic. However, no formal analysis has been provided for ignorance as an excuse. We fill this gap by proposing an original logical setting for modelling this type of ignorance. In particular, we introduce a complete and sound logic in which excusable ignorance is expressed as a primitive modality. This logic is characterized by Kripke semantics with possibly incomplete worlds. Moreover, to consider the conditions of a possible change of an agent's ignorance, we will extend the setting to public announcement logic equipped with a novel update procedure.</description>

      <title>The noncommutative weak Extension Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study the noncommutative weak Extension Principle, a lifting principle aiming to characterise $^*$-homomorphisms between coronas of nonunital separable $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebras. While this principle fails if the Continuum Hypothesis is assumed, we show that this principle holds under mild forcing axioms such as the Open Colouring Axiom and Martin's Axiom. Further, we introduce and study the notion of nonmeagre ideals in multipliers and coronas of noncommutative $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebras, generalising the usual notion of nonmeagre ideals in $\mathcal P(\mathbb N)$.</description>

      <title>Universal Proof Theory, TACL 2022 Lecture Notes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10888v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: These lecture notes survey the emerging area of Universal Proof Theory, which investigates general questions about the existence, equivalence, and characterization of good proof systems for broad classes of logics. In particular, the notes concentrate on the existence problem: for which logics do there exist proof systems satisfying desirable meta-properties (e.g. cut elimination, analyticity, termination)? After a brief historical and conceptual introduction, we survey different flavours of proof theory (Hilbert systems, natural deduction, sequent calculi) in the context of classical, intuitionistic, modal, and substructural logics. We then develop a general method for obtaining positive and negative existence results, based on interpolation and uniform interpolation techniques, and apply it to a range of logics (intermediate, modal, non-normal, conditional, and substructural). We also discuss variations of the method. As these are lecture notes, proofs are often sketched or omitted, with pointers to papers containing the full proofs. The survey thus aims to chart the scope and challenges of Universal Proof Theory for future work.</description>

      <title>A Proof-Theoretic Approach to the Semantics of Classical Linear Logic (Technical Report)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08349v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear logic (LL) is a resource-aware, abstract logic programming language that refines both classical and intuitionistic logic. Linear logic semantics is typically presented in one of two ways: by associating each formula with the set of all contexts that can be used to prove it (e.g. phase semantics) or by assigning meaning directly to proofs (e.g. coherence spaces).
  This work proposes a different perspective on assigning meaning to proofs by adopting a proof-theoretic perspective. More specifically, we employ base-extension semantics (BeS) to characterise proofs through the notion of base support.
  Recent developments have shown that BeS is powerful enough to capture proof-theoretic notions in structurally rich logics such as intuitionistic linear logic. In this paper, we extend this framework to the classical case, presenting a proof-theoretic approach to the semantics of the multiplicative-additive fragment of linear logic (MALL).</description>

      <title>On the Computability of Finding Capacity-Achieving Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work studies the problem of constructing capacity-achieving codes from an algorithmic perspective. Specifically, we prove that there exists a Turing machine which, given a discrete memoryless channel $p_{Y|X}$, a target rate $R$ less than the channel capacity $C(p_{Y|X})$, and an error tolerance $\epsilon &gt; 0$, outputs a block code $\mathcal{C}$ achieving a rate at least $R$ and a maximum block error probability below $\epsilon$. The machine operates in the general case where all transition probabilities of $p_{Y|X}$ are computable real numbers, and the parameters $R$ and $\epsilon$ are rational. The proof builds on Shannon's channel coding theorem and relies on an exhaustive search approach that systematically enumerates all codes of increasing block length until a valid code is found. This construction is formalized using the theory of recursive functions, yielding a $\mu$-recursive function $\mathrm{FindCode} : \mathbb{N}^3 \rightharpoonup \mathbb{N}$ that takes as input appropriate encodings of $p_{Y|X}$, $R$, and $\epsilon$, and, whenever $R &lt; C(p_{Y|X})$, outputs an encoding of a valid code. By Kleene's normal form theorem, which establishes the computational equivalence between Turing machines and $\mu$-recursive functions, we conclude that the problem is solvable by a Turing machine. This result can also be extended to the case where $\epsilon$ is a computable real number, while we further discuss an analogous generalization of our analysis when $R$ is computable as well. We note that the assumptions that the probabilities of $p_{Y|X}$, as well as $\epsilon$ and $R$, are computable real numbers cannot be further weakened, since computable reals constitute the largest subset of $\mathbb{R}$ representable by algorithmic means.</description>
