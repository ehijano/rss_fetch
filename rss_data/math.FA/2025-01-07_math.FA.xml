      <title>Subspaces of $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$ Invariant Under Crystallographic Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that the subspaces of $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$ that are invariant under translations consist precisely of the sets of functions whose Fourier transforms are zero almost everywhere on a measurable set. More recently, Bownik and Ross \cite{BownikRoss} utilized range functions to give a characterization of subspaces of $L^2(G)$ -- where $G$ is a locally compact abelian group -- invariant under translation by elements of a closed co-compact subgroup $\Gamma$. In this thesis we introduce a unitary representation on $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$ which acts by crystal symmetry shifts. We show that this representation is unitarily equivalent to a direct integral of factor representations, and use this to characterize the subspaces of $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$ invariant under crystal symmetry shifts. Finally, we show that our decomposition is -- up to an identification of the base space -- the \textit{central decomposition} guaranteed by direct integral theory.</description>

      <title>Precompactness in bivariate metric semigroup-valued bounded variation spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that if a set in bivariate metric semigroups-valued bounded variation spaces is pointwise totally bounded and joint equivariated then it is precompact. These spaces include bounded Jordan variation spaces, bounded Wiener variation spaces, bounded Waterman variation spaces, bounded Riesz variation spaces and bounded Korenblum variation spaces. To do so, we introduce the concept of equimetric set.</description>

      <title>Dynamical localization and eigenvalue asymptotics: power-law unbounded discrete operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a notion of Strong Power-Law SULE, proving that such an assumption implies uniform power-law dynamical localization. As an application of this study, we obtain a result on dynamical localization for long-range hopping lattice operators with uniform electric field, where the hopping coefficients decay slowly. We also prove, on a hypothesis of semi-uniform polynomial decay of eigenfunctions, that the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues of self-adjoint operators of the form $H = A + V$ in $\ell^2(\mathbb{Z})$, where $A$ is bounded and $V$ grows according to a power-law $n^\alpha$, is governed by the same power-law $n^\alpha$; in particular, one has a new interpretation of results on the stable asymptotic behavior of eigenvalues for such models with electric field under sufficiently small perturbations.</description>

      <title>On directional preservation of orthogonality and its application to isometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the local preservation of Birkhoff-James orthogonality by linear operators between normed linear spaces, at a point and in a particular direction. We obtain a complete characterization of the same, which allows us to present refinements of the local preservation of orthogonality explored earlier. We also study the directional preservation of orthogonality with respect to certain special subspaces of the domain space, and apply the results towards identifying the isometries on a polyhedral normed linear space. In particular, we obtain refinements of the Blanco-Koldobsky-Turn\v{s}ek Theorem for polyhedral normed linear spaces, including $ \ell_{\infty}^{n}, \ell_{1}^{n}. $</description>

      <title>Spectral decomposition of power-bounded operators: The finite spectrum case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate power-bounded operators, including surjective isometries, on Banach spaces. Koehler and Rosenthal asserted that an isolated point in the spectrum of a surjective isometry on a Banach space lies in the point spectrum, with the corresponding eigenspace having an invariant complement. However, they did not provide a detailed proof of this claim, at least as understood by the authors of this manuscript. Here, by applications of a theorem of Gelfand and the Riesz projections, we demonstrate that the theorem of Koehler and Rosenthal holds for any power-bounded operator on a Banach space. This not only furnishes a detailed proof of the theorem but also slightly generalizes its scope. As a result, we establish that if $T: X \to X$ is a power-bounded operator on a Banach space $X$ whose spectrum consists of finitely many points ${\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \dots, \lambda_m}$, then for every $1 \leq i, j \leq m$, there exist projections $P_j$ on $X$ such that $P_iP_j=\delta_{ij}P_i$, $\sum_{j=1}^mP_j=I$, and $T=\Sigma_{j=1}^m \lambda_j P_j$. It follows that such an operator $T$ is an algebraic operator.</description>

      <title>A well-posed variational approach to the identification and convergent approximation of material laws from boundary data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate the problem of material identification as a problem of optimal control in which the deformation of the specimen is the state variable and the unknown material law is the control variable. We assume that the material obeys finite elasticity and that the deformation of the specimen is in static equilibrium with prescribed boundary displacements. We further assume that the attendant total energy of the specimen can be measured, e.g., with the aid of the work-energy identity. In particular, no full-field measurements, such as DIC, are required. The cost function measures the maximum discrepancy between the total elastic energy corresponding to a trial material law and the measured total elastic energy over a range of prescribed boundary displacements. The question of material identifiability is thus reduced to the question of existence and uniqueness of controls. We propose a specific functional framework, prove existence of optimal controls and show that the question of material identifiability hinges on the separating properties of the boundary data. The proposed framework naturally suggests and supports approximation by maxout neural networks, i.e., neural networks of piecewise affine or polyaffine functions and a maximum, or join, activation function. We show that maxout neural networks have the requisite density property in the space of energy densities and result in convergent approximations as the number of neurons increases to infinity. Simple examples are also presented that illustrate the minimax structure of the identification problem.</description>

      <title>Besov--Triebel--Lizorkin-Type Spaces with Matrix $A_\infty$ Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduced by A. Volberg, matrix $A_{p,\infty}$ weights provide a suitable generalization of Muckenhoupt $A_\infty$ weights from the classical theory. In our previous work, we established new characterizations of these weights. Here, we use these results to study inhomogeneous Besov-type and Triebel--Lizorkin-type spaces with such weights. In particular, we characterize these spaces, in terms of the $\varphi$-transform, molecules, and wavelets, and obtain the boundedness of almost diagonal operators, pseudo-differential operators, trace operators, pointwise multipliers, and Calder\'on--Zygmund operators on these spaces. This is the first systematic study of inhomogeneous Besov--Triebel--Lizorkin-type spaces with $A_{p,\infty}$-matrix weights, but some of the results are new even when specialized to the scalar unweighted case.</description>

      <title>Global second order regularity for degenerate p-Laplace type equations with log-concave weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider weighted p-Laplace type equations with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions in convex domains, where the weight is a log-concave function which may degenerate at the boundary. In the case of bounded domains, we provide sharp global second-order estimates. For unbounded domains, we prove local estimates at the boundary. The results are new even for the case p = 2.</description>

Abstract: We study compactness of Hankel and Toeplitz operators on Bergman spaces of convex Reinhardt domains in $\mathbb{C}^2$ and we restrict the symbols to the class of functions that are continuous on the closure of the domain. We prove that Toeplitz operators as well as the Hermitian squares of Hankel operators are compact if and only if the Berezin transforms of the operators vanish on the boundary of the domain.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a separable Hilbert space and $\mathcal{L}_{0}\subset B(\mathcal{H})$ a complete reflexive lattice. Let $\mathscr{K}$ be the direct sum of $n_0$ copies of $\mathcal{H}$ ($n_{0}\in\mathbb{N}$ and $n_0\geq 2$) or the direct sum of countably infinite many copies of $\mathcal{H}$ respectively. We construct two class of subspace lattices $\mathcal{L}$ on $\mathscr{K}$. Let $Alg\mathcal{L}$ be the corresponding subspace lattice algebra. We show that every local derivation from $Alg\mathcal{L} $ into $B(\mathscr{K})$ is a derivation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given $1\leq p&lt;\infty$, we show that ergodic flows in the $L^p$-space over a $\sigma$-finite measure space generated by strongly continuous semigroups of Dunford-Schwartz operators and modulated by bounded Besicovitch almost periodic functions converge almost uniformly (in Egorov's sense). The corresponding local ergodic theorem is proved with identification of the limit. Then we extend these results to arbitrary fully symmetric spaces, including Orlicz, Lorentz, and Marcinkiewicz spaces.</description>

      <title>The Banach Algebra $L^{1}(G)$ and Tame Functionals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.12298v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an affirmative answer to a question due to M. Megrelishvili, and show that for a locally compact group $G$ we have $\operatorname{Tame}(L^{1}(G)) = \operatorname{Tame}(G)$, which means that a functional is tame over $L^{1}(G)$ if and only if it is tame as a function over $G$. In fact, it is proven that for every norm-saturated, convex vector bornology on $\operatorname{RUC}_{b}(G)$, being small as a function and as a functional is the same. This proves that $\operatorname{Asp}(L^{1}(G)) = \operatorname{Asp}(G)$ and reaffirms a well-known, similar result which states that $\operatorname{WAP}(G) = \operatorname{WAP}(L^{1}(G))$.</description>

      <title>A functional characterization of isometries between non-reversible Finsler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a functional characterization of isometries between non-reversible Finsler manifolds, in the form of a generalization of the Myers-Nakai Theorem for Riemannian manifolds. We show that, since non-reversible Finsler manifolds are a fundamentally asymmetric object, such a result can not be obtained by means of a symmetric function space, and we define the appropriate asymmetric structure needed to describe all possible isometries between this class of manifolds. The result is based on the ideas used in a previous generalization for reversible Finsler manifolds proved in \cite{GJR-13}, in which the normed algebra of $C^1$-smooth Lipschitz functions is used. To reflect the quasi-metric structure of non-reversible Finsler manifolds, this normed algebra had to be modified to include the cone of smooth semi-Lipschitz functions, resulting in a partial loss of the normed space and algebra structures. In order to achieve the desired result, we define new algebraic/quasi-metric structures to model the behavior of the aforementioned function space.</description>

      <title>On the relaxation to equilibrium of a quantum oscillator interacting with a radiation field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we investigate from the point of view of spectral theory the problem of relaxation to thermodynamical equilibrium of a quantum harmonic oscillator interacting with a radiation field. Our starting point is a system of infinitely many Pauli master equations governing the time evolution of the occupation probabilities of the available quantum states. The system we consider is derived from the evolution equation for the reduced density operator obtained after the initial interaction of the oscillator with the radiation field, the latter acting as a heat bath. We provide a complete spectral analysis of the infinitesimal generator of the equations, showing thereby that it generates an infinite-dimensional system of hyperbolic type. This implies that every global solution to the equations converge exponentially rapidly toward the corresponding Gibbs equilibrium state. We also provide a complete spectral analysis of a linear pencil naturally associated with the Pauli equations. All of our considerations revolve around the notion of compactness, more specifically around the existence of a new compact embedding result involving a space of sequences of Sobolev type into a weighted space of square-integrable summable sequences.</description>
