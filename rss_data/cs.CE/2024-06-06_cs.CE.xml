      <title>Diversity in Evolutionary Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the dynamics imposed by natural selection on the populations of two competing, sexually reproducing, haploid species. In this setting, the fitness of any genome varies over time due to the changing population mix of the competing species; crucially, this fitness variation arises naturally from the model itself, without the need for imposing it exogenously as is typically the case. Previous work on this model [14] showed that, in the special case where each of the two species exhibits just two phenotypes, genetic diversity is maintained at all times. This finding supported the tenet that sexual reproduction is advantageous because it promotes diversity, which increases the survivability of a species.
  In the present paper we consider the more realistic case where there are more than two phenotypes available to each species. The conclusions about diversity in general turn out to be very different from the two-phenotype case.
  Our first result is negative: namely, we show that sexual reproduction does not guarantee the maintenance of diversity at all times, i.e., the result of [14] does not generalize. Our counterexample consists of two competing species with just three phenotypes each. We show that, for any time~$t_0$ and any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, there is a time $t\ge t_0$ at which the combined diversity of both species is smaller than~$\varepsilon$. Our main result is a complementary positive statement, which says that in any non-degenerate example, diversity is maintained in a weaker, ``infinitely often'' sense.
  Thus, our results refute the supposition that sexual reproduction ensures diversity at all times, but affirm a weaker assertion that extended periods of high diversity are necessarily a recurrent event.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Assisted Discovery of Flow Reactor Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08841v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Additive manufacturing has enabled the fabrication of advanced reactor geometries, permitting larger, more complex design spaces. Identifying promising configurations within such spaces presents a significant challenge for current approaches. Furthermore, existing parameterisations of reactor geometries are low-dimensional with expensive optimisation limiting more complex solutions. To address this challenge, we establish a machine learning-assisted approach for the design of the next-generation of chemical reactors, combining the application of high-dimensional parameterisations, computational fluid dynamics, and multi-fidelity Bayesian optimisation. We associate the development of mixing-enhancing vortical flow structures in novel coiled reactors with performance, and use our approach to identify key characteristics of optimal designs. By appealing to the principles of flow dynamics, we rationalise the selection of novel design features that lead to experimental plug flow performance improvements of 60% over conventional designs. Our results demonstrate that coupling advanced manufacturing techniques with `augmented-intelligence' approaches can lead to superior design performance and, consequently, emissions-reduction and sustainability.</description>
