      <title>Linearized Analysis of Rastall Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rastall gravity is a generalization of the Einstein gravity in which the matter is not conserved in the presence of a non-constant spacetime curvature. In this report, we analyze Rastall gravity using the linearized formalism. The linearized metric for a localized matter without pressure and shear stress is obtained, and a spherically symmetric metric for a non-rotating mass is derived. A phenomenological consequence, known as the gravitoelectromagnetism, is subsequently discussed in detail, where it is shown that a free-falling observer will see the motion of a nearby free particle as being subject to a velocity-independent gravitoelectric force and a velocity-dependent gravitomagnetic force. An explicit calculation of the gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic fields as seen by an observer moving in a circular orbit in a spherically symmetric gravitational field is presented, and it is shown that the resulting gravitomagnetic field is perpendicular to the observer's moving direction.</description>

      <title>Pattern-recognition techniques to search for gravitational waves from inspiraling, dark-dressed primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05546v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are compelling dark matter (DM) candidates, but current constraints suggest they cannot compose all of DM. This implies that additional DM components could coexist with PBHs, one of which could form "dark dresses" (DDs) around PBHs. DDs would cause PBH binaries to experience dynamical friction (DF), which would accelerate their inspirals with respect to those in vacuum. Ignoring DF effects in matched-filtering searches could lead to significant sensitivity loss, especially in systems with asymmetric mass-ratios of q ~ 10^{-3}. We thus show that a method designed to find time-frequency power-law tracks from inspiraling PBHs in vacuum could actually handle the presence of DDs with minimal modifications. This method, the generalized frequency-Hough (GFH), maps points in the detector's time-frequency plane to lines in the source parameter space. We show that this pattern-recognition technique can recover simulated DD signals in Gaussian noise, marking an important step forward in developing DM-aware methods beyond matched filtering.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric Newtonian Noise May Constrain Third-Generation Gravitational-Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced gravitational-wave detector designs are pushing towards lower frequencies, where certain types of noise, previously considered negligible, may come to dominate the detectors' noise budgets. In particular, we revisit atmospheric Newtonian noise, caused by the fluctuating gravitational field as regions of high and low gas density move past the detector. We consider density perturbations both due to pressure waves (infrasound) and due to advected temperature fluctuations. In the absence of detailed site-specific models of topography, airflow, and building design, we present general scaling formulae that estimate the spectrum of atmospheric Newtonian noise, and show how it is affected by broad detector design choices. We confirm previous analyses that show that atmospheric Newtonian noise is not likely a strong contributor to advanced LIGO; however, it will be a dominant factor for third-generation detectors targeting low frequencies, with the low-frequency cutoff principally constrained by the depth of the detector underground.</description>

      <title>Periodic Kerr solution as an infinite soliton chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine numerical analysis with the inverse scattering method to study the periodic analog of Kerr solution. The periodic analog of the Schwarzschild solution is known to be regular and exhibit Kasner asymptotic behaviour for an arbitrary size of event horizon not exceeding the period. The previous numerical analysis of the rotating version of the periodic Schwarzschild black hole in [arXiv:2210.12898] based on the heat flow, together with analytical results in [arXiv:2407.16960] shows that there exist obstructions to putting the periodic Schwarzschild solution in rotation in a certain parameter range. In this paper we apply an efficient numerical approach based on the inverse scattering method, interpreting the periodic Kerr solution as an infinite chain of solitons. This allows to completely describe the existence domain in the space of physical parameters (the period, mass and the angular momentum); we study the dependence of Kasner exponent and the shape of the ergosphere on parameters of the problem.</description>

      <title>Topological Origin of Horizon Temperature via the Chern-Gauss-Bonnet Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes a connection between the Hawking temperature of spacetime horizons and global topological invariants, specifically the Euler characteristic of Wick-rotated Euclidean spacetimes. This is demonstrated for both de Sitter and Schwarzschild, where the compactification of the near-horizon geometry allows for a direct application of the Chern-Gauss-Bonnet theorem. For de Sitter, a simple argument connects the Gibbon-Hawking temperature to the global thermal de Sitter temperature of the Bunch-Davies state. This establishes that spacetime thermodynamics are a consequence of the geometrical structure of spacetime itself, therefore suggesting a deep connection between global topology and semi-classical analysis.</description>

      <title>Dirac stars with wormhole topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider configurations consisting of a gravitating nonlinear spinor field and a massless ghost scalar field providing a nontrivial spacetime topology. For such a mixed system, we have constructed families of asymptotically flat asymmetric solutions describing Dirac stars with wormhole topology. The physical properties of such systems are completely determined by the values of three input quantities: the nonlinearity parameter of the spinor field, the spinor frequency, and the throat parameter. Depending on the specific values of these parameters, the configurations may be regular or singular and possess one or two throats, as well as they may contain possible horizons of different kinds. Furthermore, because of the asymmetry, masses and sizes of the configurations observed at the two asymptotic ends of the wormhole may differ considerably. For large negative values of the nonlinearity parameter, it is possible to obtain configurations whose masses are comparable to the Chandrasekhar mass and effective radii are of the order of kilometers.</description>

      <title>Screening Mechanisms on White Dwarfs: Symmetron &amp; Dilaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work provides the first comparison of the symmetron and dilaton fields in white dwarfs. We show how these screening mechanisms behave inside {such stars} and their impact on stellar properties. Employing a custom-developed shooting method, we solve the scalar-tensor equilibrium equations in the Newtonian approximation. We consider a Chandrasekhar equation of state and examine a range of potential mass scales and coupling strengths for both fields. Both fields enhance the pressure drop in low-density white dwarfs, leading to smaller stellar masses, radii, and luminosities. Unlike chameleon models, their effects are suppressed in more massive stars, with symmetron fields fully decoupling and dilaton fields weakening but not vanishing. Consequently, no mass-radius curve for screened white dwarfs exceeds the Newtonian prediction in any of these three mechanisms. The mass-radius deviations are generally more pronounced at lower densities, depending on model parameters. Due to their common runaway potential, we confirm that dilaton and chameleon fields display similar field and gradient profiles. In contrast, due to their environment-dependent coupling, the dilaton and symmetron mechanisms exhibit stronger density-dependent screening effects. These findings highlight both phenomenological differences and theoretical similarities among these mechanisms, motivating asteroseismology studies to constrain the symmetron and dilaton parameter spaces.</description>

      <title>Galactic double neutron stars as dual-line gravitational-wave sources: Prospects with LISA and Cosmic Explorer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double neutron star (DNS) systems could serve as intriguing dual-line gravitational-wave (GW) sources, emitting both high- and low-frequency GWs, arising respectively from the asymmetric spinning bodies of individual neutron stars (NSs) and the binary orbital inspiral. Detecting such dual-line signals could provide novel perspectives on binary orbital geometry and NS internal physics. We expand upon previously calculated spinning NS waveforms by incorporating higher-order terms of NS structural parameters. A population simulation is performed for spinning NS components in DNS systems potentially detectable by the space-based Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Based on 4-year LISA observation of 35 resolvable DNS systems, we estimate that 6 (22) spinning NS components could be detected by the next-generation ground-based GW detector, Cosmic Explorer, under log-uniform (uniform) sampling of NS structural parameters. For these dual-line sources, the median signal-to-noise ratio achievable with Cosmic Explorer is approximately 20--30. Through the dual-line GW detection strategy, the relative measurement accuracy of the NS moment of inertia is estimated to be $\sim 8\%$.</description>

      <title>Black holes as gravitational mirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrolensing is a gravitational lensing effect in which light emitted by a background source is deflected by a black hole and redirected toward the observer after undergoing nearly complete loops around the black hole. In this context, we explore the possibility of seeing objects of the solar system in past eras through telescope observations by using black holes as a gravitational mirror. We consider the motion of the light around Reissner-Nordstr\"om space-time and discuss the properties of the trajectories of boomerang photons. It was shown that, depending on the angle of emission and the position of the source, the photons could return to the emission point. Afterward, we explore the possibility of considering the returning photons in retrolensing geometry where the observer is between the source and the lens in which two classes of black holes are explored: The supermassive Sgr A* black hole at the galactic center and a nearby stellar black hole. For the first time in the literature, we propose the study of the returning photons of planets instead of stars in retrolensing geometry.</description>

      <title>Fermionic quantum cosmology as a framework for resolving type IV singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an innovative approach to resolving type IV singularities in fermionic quantum cosmology. The Eisenhart-Duval lift procedure is employed to construct an extended minisuperspace metric, which allows for the formulation of the Dirac equation in minisuperspace. Through this approach, fermionic degrees of freedom are effectively incorporated into a homogeneous and isotropic cosmological model with a scalar field. By applying a kind of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, solutions to the Dirac equation for an approximate potential characteristic of type IV singularities are obtained, expressed in terms of Tricomi confluent hypergeometric functions and associated Laguerre polynomials. The elimination of non-physical, divergent solutions results in a quantum regularization of the classical singularity. These results indicate the potential of fermionic models in quantum cosmology for mitigating the singularity problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the exact dynamics of electromagnetic waves in cold electron-positron plasma in the simplest background of Big Bounce and Big Crunch cosmologies. We show that these waves are described by a Mathieu equation in a Big Bounce cosmology, which opens the possibility of electromagnetic wave amplification due to the cosmological constant in this Universe. On the contrary, in a Big Crunch cosmology, electromagnetic plasma waves are described by a modified Mathieu equation. In both cases, the features (grow/collapse) of the Universes imprint similar characteristics in the temporal evolution of these waves.</description>

      <title>Constraints to Lorentz violation and ultrahigh-energy electrons in D-foamy space-times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We entertain the constraints that the absence of vacuum Cherenkov radiation of ultrahigh-energy electrons inferred from LHAASO observations of the Crab Nebula can impose on generic models in which Lorentz symmetry of the particle vacuum is violated, as established by some recent studies in \href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2022.137034}{\emph{Phys. Lett. B} {\bf 829} (2022) 137034}; \href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2022.137536}{{\bf 835} (2022) 137536}; \href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.108.063006}{\emph{Phys. Rev. D} {\bf108} (2023) 063006}. We demonstrate in the present paper, that implementing a phenomenological approach to the Lorentz violation, the rates of this vacuum process are substantial such that one is justified in deriving bounds on the violation scales from simple threshold analysis just as these works did. Albeit such results are likely effective then, they do not apply in the same form among scenarios. Specifically, we show that these Cherenkov constraints are naturally evaded in models of space-time foam inspired from~(supercritical) string theory, involving D-branes as space-time defects in a brane-world scenario, in which subluminous energy-dependent refractive indices of light have been suggested. We examine here two specific foam situations and find for both cases~(though, for different reasons) the potentiality that charged quanta such as electrons do \emph{not} radiate as they pass through the gravitational vacuum `medium' despite moving faster than photons.</description>

      <title>Revealing the nature of ultra-long period objects with space-based gravitational-wave interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A few members of the recently-discovered class of ultra-long period objects have been identified as binaries with white-dwarf primaries. In most cases however, electromagnetic data are inconclusive and isolated magnetars remain a viable candidate. If the pulsation period matches that of the orbit though -- as is the case for ILT J1101+5521 and GLEAM-X J0704-37 -- several of these elusive radio transients should be gravitational-wave bright in the mHz band. Space-based interferometers could thus be used to provide independent constraints on their nature. We quantify the signal-to-noise ratio for the known systems, assuming they are compact binaries, and show that a few should be detectable with only a few months of data folding. Astrophysical implications for (non-)detections are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of large curvature perturbations associated with the production of primordial black holes is studied in the context of a Higgs inflaton. To enable this amplification, we consider an inflationary model in which the tree-level action for gravity and the Standard Model Higgs is modified by quantum corrections, described by a series of higher-dimension operators. Finally within a minimal EFT framework, we present two viable models in which the spectrum of curvature perturbations generated by the Higgs field is consistent with CMB observations and can lead to the formation of primordial black holes in the asteroid mass range, potentially accounting for the entirety of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Overtones' outburst and Hawking evaporation of Kazakov-Solodukhin quantum corrected black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11083v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kazakov-Solodukhin black hole metric represents a spherically symmetric deformation of the Schwarzschild solution due to quantum-gravity corrections. Assuming the absence of nonspherical deformations of the metric, this problem was solved nonperturbatively. In this study, we investigate the intensity of Hawking radiation in the background of such quantum-corrected black holes and the behavior of their quasinormal modes (QNM). Our findings indicate that while the geometry and such classical characteristics as the fundamental QNM frequencies or the shadow radius are only slightly altered, the Hawking radiation and the frequencies of QNM overtones of sufficiently small black holes change much more significantly. This Hawking radiation enhancement arises due to much larger grey-body factors, while the Hawking temperature remains unaffected. The effect becomes significant at the latest stage of black hole evaporation.</description>

Abstract: Based on the results of a previous analysis of the Markovian master equation for the irreversible evolution of an open system embedded in de Sitter space, we include in the cosmological Friedmann equations a contribution from the presence of a physical bath at temperature $T_{\rm dS} = h / 2 \pi$, where $h$ is the Hubble parameter. We show that this provides a mechanism for the irreversible relaxation of the cosmological constant and a graceful exit to inflation, without need for subsequent reheating. Thermal particle production during inflation gives adiabatic, Gaussian, and approximately scale-invariant cosmological perturbations. We thus obtain the main features of inflation without any inflaton potential. To clarify the thermodynamic interpretation of these results, we consider the analogy of this irreversible relaxation to superfluorescence in quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Breaking the degeneracy of non-canonical quartic inflation by reheating considerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04872v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here, the quartic inflationary potential $V(\phi)=\frac{\lambda}{4}\phi^4$ within a non-canonical framework characterized by a power-law Lagrangian is investigated. We demonstrate that the predictions of this model align with the Planck 2018 observational data. We explore how the predictions of the model depend on the non-canonical parameter $\alpha$ and the number of $e$-folds $N$. Notably, the sound speed, non-Gaussianity parameter, scalar spectral index, and tensor-to-scalar ratio are all affected by variations in $\alpha$. However, the scalar spectral index exhibits a degeneracy with respect to variation in $\alpha$, which can be broken by incorporating reheating consideration. By applying a combination of theoretical and observational constraints on $(r-n_{\rm s})$, non-Gaussianity, and reheating parameters, we find that the duration of inflation is constrained to the range $55 \leq N\leq55.7$ $e$-folds for $60 \leq \alpha \leq 130$. Finally, we investigate relic gravitational waves and demonstrate that their energy density spectrum falls within the sensitivity range of gravitational waves detectors for this constrained range of $e$-folds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07864v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We re-consider the graviton self-energy induced by a loop of massless, minimally coupled scalars on de Sitter background. On flat space background it can be represented as a sum of two tensor differential operators acting on scalar structure functions. On a general background these tensor differential operators can be constructed from the linearized Ricci scalar and the linearized Weyl tensor. However, in cosmology one requires a third contribution which we derive here.</description>

      <title>Late Time Phenomena in $f(T,\mathcal{T})$ Gravity Framework: Role of $H_0$ Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explored the behavior of the $f(T, \mathcal{T})$ cosmological model with the use of various data set combinations. We also compared the results for this model between the Pantheon+ (without SH0ES) and the Pantheon+\&amp;SH0ES (with SH0ES) data sets. Additionally, we incorporated data from BAO along with $H_0$ priors. We observed that integrating SH0ES data points leads to a higher estimation of $H_0$ than Pantheon+ (without SH0ES). We perform an extensive MCMC analysis for each combination of data sets, providing constraints on the model parameters. We also computed the $\chi^2_{min}$ value for each combination of data sets to evaluate the chosen model against the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Our primary finding is that the various dataset combinations in the $f(T, \mathcal{T})$ model we examined relate to a range of Hubble constants, which could contribute to reducing the cosmic tension associated with this parameter. Additionally, we investigate the evolution of matter fluctuations by solving the density contrast evolution equation numerically. We calculate numerical solutions for the weighted growth rate $f\sigma_8$ using these findings. We plotted the cosmological background parameters to check the behavior of the $f(T, \mathcal{T})$ model in late-time. Based on the behavior of these background cosmological parameters, we conclude that our selected models reflect the late-time cosmic dynamics of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Template bank for sub solar mass compact binary mergers in the fourth observing run of Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo, and KAGRA</title>

Abstract: Matched-filtering searches for gravitational-wave signals from compact binary mergers employ template banks which are a collection of modeled waveforms described by unique intrinsic parameters. We present two banks designed for low-latency and archive sub-solar mass (SSM) searches in data from the fourth observing run of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA, and demonstrate the efficacy of the banks via simulated signals. Further, we introduce a set of modifications to the geometric, manifold algorithm that allow the method to work for exceedingly low component masses necessary for SSM bank production. The archive search bank contains a total of $3,452,006$ templates, and covers a mass parameter space of $0.2$ to $10\ M_\odot$ in the larger component and $0.2$ to $1.0\ M_\odot$ in the smaller component, the spin parameter space of $-0.9$ to $0.9$ for masses above $0.5$ $M_\odot$ and $-0.1$ to $0.1$ for masses below $0.5$ $M_\odot$, and the mass ratio parameter space of $1$ to $10$. The PSD used was from a week of the first half of the fourth observing run of Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo, and KAGRA, and the low frequency cutoff was set to $45$ Hz with a maximum waveform duration of $128$ seconds. The bank simulations performed using SBank have shown that the banks presented in this paper have sufficient efficacy for use in their respective searches.</description>

Abstract: We propose the concept of mutual information for particle pair (MIPP) in curved spacetime, and show that MIPP has potential to be a proper chaos indicator. We tested this method in the Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetime and compared it with the fast Lyapunov indicator. The results show that the MIPP effectively identify orbital states and demonstrates prominent performance in recognizing transitions between orbital states. Our result show that information theory significantly deepen our understanding of dynamics of few-body system.</description>

      <title>Testing general covariance in effective models motivated by Loop Quantum Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we introduce a criterion for testing general covariance in effective quantum gravity theories. It adapts the analysis of invariance under general spacetime diffeomorphisms of the Einstein-Hilbert action to the case of effective canonical models. While the main purpose is to test models obtained in Loop Quantum Gravity, the criterion is not limited to those physical systems and may be applied to any canonically formulated modified theory of gravity. The approach here is hence not that of finding an effective model, but rather to examine a given one represented by a quantum corrected Hamiltonian. Specifically, we will apply the criterion to spherically symmetric spacetimes in vacuum with inverse triad and holonomy modifications that arise as a consequence of the loop quantization procedure. It is found that, in addition to the initial modifications of the Hamiltonian, quantum corrections of the classical metric itself are needed as well in order to obtain generally covariant models. A comparison with recent alternative criteria is included in the discussion.</description>

Abstract: We numerically study, under a Gowdy symmetry assumption, nonlinear perturbations of the decelerated FLRW fluid solutions to the Einstein-Euler system toward the future for linear equations of state $p=K\rho$ with $0\leq K\leq 1$. This article builds on the work of Fajman et al. (2024 arXiv:2405.03431) in which perturbations of the homogeneous fluid solution on a fixed, decelerating FLRW background were studied. Our numerical results show that for all values of $K$, perturbations of the FLRW solution develop shocks in finite time. This behaviour contrasts known results for spacetimes with accelerated expansion in which shock formation is suppressed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06857v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations indicate a $4.9\sigma$ tension between the CMB and quasar dipoles. This tension challenges the cosmological principle. We propose that if we live in a gigaparsec scale void, the CMB and quasar dipolar tension can be reconciled. This is because we are unlikely to live at the center of the void. And a within 10\% offset from the center will impact the quasars and CMB differently in their dipolar anisotropies. As we consider a large and thick void, our setup can also ease the Hubble tension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12672v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum diffusion describes the inflow of vacuum quantum fluctuations as they get amplified by gravitational instability, and stretched to large distances during inflation. In this picture, the dynamics of the universe's expansion becomes stochastic, and the statistics of the curvature perturbation is encoded in the distribution of the duration of inflation. This provides a non-perturbative framework to study cosmological fluctuations during inflation, which is well-suited to the case of primordial black holes since they originate from large fluctuations. We show that standard, perturbative expectations for the primordial black hole abundance can be significantly modified by quantum-diffusion effects, and we identify a few open challenges.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the significance of astrophysical events with multimessenger coincidences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coincident multimessenger observations of cosmic sources can offer numerous benefits, especially when used in the context of synergistic astrophysics. One significant advantage is enhancing the detection significance of separate detectors by correlating their data and assuming joint emission. We have formulated an approach for updating the Bayesian posterior probability of an astrophysical origin, namely $p_{\rm astro}$, relying on multimessenger coincidences assuming an emission model. The description is applicable to any combination of messengers. We demonstrated the formalism for the gravitational waves and high-energy neutrinos case. Applying our method to the public data of candidate coincident high-energy neutrinos with subthreshold gravitational-wave triggers, we found that in the case of highly energetic neutrino coincidences, $p_{\rm astro}$ can increase from approximately $\sim 0.1$ to $\sim 0.9$. The amount of improvement depends on the assumed joint emission model. If models are trusted, the marked improvement makes subthreshold detections much more confident. Moreover, the model dependency can also be used to test the consistency of different models. This work is a crucial step toward the goal of uniting all detectors on equal footing into a statistically integrated, Earth-sized observatory for comprehensive multimessenger astrophysics.</description>

Abstract: Unlike a classical charged bosonic field, a classical charged fermion field on a static charged black hole does not exhibit superradiant scattering. We demonstrate that the quantum analogue of this classical process is however present. We construct a vacuum state for the fermion field which has no incoming particles from past null infinity, but which contains, at future null infinity, a nonthermal flux of particles. This state describes both the discharge and energy loss of the black hole, and we analyze how the interpretation of this phenomenon depends on the ambiguities inherent in defining the quantum vacuum.</description>

      <title>Planck-PR4 anisotropy spectra show (better) consistency with General Relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the results from a series of analyses on two parametric tests of gravity that modify the growth of linear, sub-horizon matter perturbations in the $\Lambda$CDM model. The first test, known as the $(\mu,\Sigma)$ framework, modifies the Poisson and lensing equations from General Relativity (GR). The second test introduces the growth index $\gamma$, which directly affects the time evolution of matter density perturbations. Our study is motivated by results from the analysis of the Planck-PR3 2018 spectra, which indicate a preference for $\Sigma_0 \neq 0$ and $\gamma_0 &gt; 0.55$, both of which deviate from the $\Lambda$CDM predictions at a significance level of $\sim 2.5\sigma$. To clarify the nature of these anomalous results and understand how the lensing anomaly fits into the picture, we analyze the most recent Planck-PR4 spectra extracted from the updated \texttt{NPIPE} maps. Overall, the Planck-PR4 data show better consistency with GR. The updated likelihood \texttt{Camspec} provides constraints on $\Sigma_0$ and $\gamma_0$ that are consistent with GR within $1.5\sigma$ and $2\sigma$, respectively. The updated likelihoods \texttt{HiLLiPoP} and \texttt{LoLLiPoP} show even closer agreement, with all parameter values consistent with a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology within $1\sigma$. This enhanced consistency is closely correlated with the lensing anomaly. Across the different likelihoods, the tendency of $\Sigma_0$ and $\gamma_0$ to drift towards non-standard values matches the observed preference for $A_L &gt; 1$, both of which are significantly reduced or disappear within the Planck-PR4 data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19931v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modular crossed product algebras have recently assumed an important role in perturbative quantum gravity as they lead to an intrinsic regularization of entanglement entropies by introducing quantum reference frames (QRFs) in place of explicit regulators. This is achieved by imposing certain boost constraints on gravitons, QRFs and other fields. Here, we revisit the question of how these constraints should be understood through the lens of perturbation theory and particularly the study of linearization (in)stabilities, exploring when linearized solutions can be integrated to exact ones. Our aim is to provide some clarity about the status of justification, under various conditions, for imposing such constraints on the linearized theory in the $G_N\to0$ limit as they turn out to be of second-order. While for spatially closed spacetimes there is an essentially unambiguous justification, in the presence of boundaries or the absence of isometries this depends on whether one is also interested in second-order observables. Linearization (in)stabilities occur in any gauge-covariant field theory with non-linear equations and to address this in a unified framework, we translate the subject from the usual canonical formulation into a systematic covariant phase space language. This overcomes theory-specific arguments, exhibiting the universal structure behind (in)stabilities, and permits us to cover arbitrary generally covariant theories. We comment on the relation to modular flow and illustrate our findings in several gravity and gauge theory examples.</description>

      <title>Extracting more information from entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02668v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extract the complex frequency of the lowest quasi-normal mode from the holographically computed entropy density near thermodynamic equilibrium. The system consists of a purely thermal Supersymmetric Yang-Mills N=4 plasma in homogeneous isotropization dynamics. The initial state is far-from-equilibrium, proceeding to thermalization over time. The system evolves to equilibrium entropy forming a stairway pattern. The analysis reveals that the rate of increase of the stairway is twice the decay rate of the lowest quasi-normal mode. This leads us to propose a model explaining how this information is encoded in entropy. The model is extended to consider finite temperature, R-charge density and scalar condensate of the medium, disclosing an additional feature. The system's main dissipation channel may shift to one driven by the scalar condensate, depending on the chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Very Special Relativity in Accelerated Frames: Non-relativistic Effects in Gravitational Spectroscopy of Ultracold Neutrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the phenomenology of fermionic systems in uniform gravitational fields within the framework of Very Special Relativity (VSR). We focus on the case of gravitational spectroscopy with ultracold neutrons, explored in experiments like \emph{q}\textsc{Bounce}. Calculating the leading ($c^0$) and next-to-leading ($c^{-1}$) order corrections to the non-relativistic Hamiltonian in an accelerated frame, we obtain the perturbed fermionic energy spectrum. At leading order, we do not find any modifications except for a trivial mass shift, thus preserving the equivalence between inertial and gravitational mass and particle-antiparticle sectors. The next-to-leading order corrections, instead, introduce time-dependent anisotropic contributions depending on the preferred spatial direction in VSR, and can then be used to probe novel Lorentz-violating signatures. Taking \emph{q}\textsc{Bounce} sensitivity as a benchmark, we derive a first rough constraint for the neutron VSR parameter. Finally, we suggest alternative spin-flipping setups to better probe VSR effects and foresee potential future research directions.</description>

      <title>Observational and Theoretical Constraints on First-Order Phase Transitions in Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the equation of state (EOS) of neutron stars (NSs) is a fundamental challenge in astrophysics and nuclear physics. A first-order phase transition (FOPT) at high densities could lead to the formation of a quark core, significantly affecting NS properties. This review explores observational and theoretical constraints on such transitions using multi-messenger astrophysics. X-ray observations, including mass-radius measurements from NICER and spectral features like quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) and cyclotron resonance scattering features (CRSFs), provide indirect evidence of EOS modifications. Gravitational wave detections, particularly from binary NS mergers such as GW170817, constrain tidal deformability and post-merger oscillations, which may carry signatures of phase transitions. Pulsar timing offers additional constraints through measurements of mass, spin evolution, and glitches, with millisecond pulsars exceeding twice the solar mass posing challenges to purely hadronic EOSs. Theoretical models and numerical simulations predict that an FOPT could impact gravitational wave signals, twin-star configurations, and NS cooling. Future advancements, including next-generation gravitational wave detectors, high-precision X-ray telescopes, and improved theoretical modeling, will enhance our ability to probe phase transitions in NSs. A combination of these approaches will provide crucial insights into the existence and properties of deconfined quark matter in NS interiors.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Gas Accretion onto Supermassive Black Hole Binaries from Inspiral through Merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accreting supermassive black hole binaries are powerful multimessenger sources emitting both gravitational and EM radiation. Understanding the accretion dynamics of these systems and predicting their distinctive EM signals is crucial to informing and guiding upcoming efforts aimed at detecting gravitational waves produced by these binaries. To this end, accurate numerical modeling is required to describe both the spacetime and the magnetized gas around the black holes. In this paper, we present two key advances in this field of research. First, we have developed a novel 3D GRMHD framework that combines multiple numerical codes to simulate the inspiral and merger of supermassive black hole binaries starting from realistic initial data and running all the way through merger. Throughout the evolution, we adopt a simple but functional prescription to account for gas cooling through photon emission. Next, we have applied our new computational method to follow the time evolution of a circular, equal-mass, non-spinning black hole binary for ~200 orbits, starting from a separation of 20r_g and reaching the post-merger evolutionary stage of the system. We have shown how mass continues to flow toward the binary even after the binary "decouples" from its surrounding disk, but the accretion rate onto the black holes diminishes. We have identified how the minidisks orbiting each black hole are slowly drained and eventually dissolve as the binary compresses. We confirm previous findings that the system's luminosity decreases by only a factor of a few during inspiral; however, we observe an abrupt increase by ~50% in this quantity at the time of merger, likely accompanied by an equally abrupt change in spectrum. Finally, we have demonstrated that during the inspiral, fluid ram pressure regulates the fraction of the magnetic flux transported to the binary that attaches to the black holes' horizons.</description>

      <title>Constraining Axion Dark Matter with Galactic-Centre Resonant Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the influence of fuzzy dark-matter cores on the orbits of stars at the Galactic centre. This dark matter candidate condenses into dense, solitonic cores, and, if a super-massive black hole is present at the centre of such a core, its central part forms a `gravitational atom'. Here, we calculate the atom's contribution to the gravitational potential felt by a Galactic-centre star, for a general state of the atom. We study the angular-momentum dynamics this potential induces, and show that it is similar to vector resonant relaxation. Its influence is found to be sufficiently strong that such a dynamical component should be accounted for in Galactic-centre modelling. For the Milky Way, the atom is expected to have some spherical asymmetry, and we use this to derive a stability condition for the disc of young, massive stars at the Galactic centre - if the atom's mass is too large, then the disc would be destroyed. Thus, the existence of this disc constrains the mass of the axion particles comprising the solitonic core. We study an example model of the core, where all of the rotation of the core's inner region is assumed to come from an $l=1$ state, and its amplitude is determined by the halo's spin parameter; such a core is found to be in tension with the stability of the clockwise stellar disc for $4.4\times 10^{-20}\,\textrm{eV} \leq m_a \leq 5.3\times 10^{-20}\,\textrm{eV}$ at $2\sigma$. Other core models would vary the constrained values of $m_a$ somewhat. These constraints will tighten significantly with future, improved data.</description>

      <title>Quantum Schwarzschild-(A)dS Black Holes: Unitarity and Singularity Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the canonical quantisation of spherically symmetric spacetimes within unimodular gravity, leaving sign choices in the metric general enough to include both the interior and exterior Schwarzschild-(Anti-)de Sitter spacetime. In unimodular gravity the cosmological constant appears as an integration constant analogous to a total energy, and the quantum Wheeler-DeWitt equation takes the form of a Schr\"odinger equation in unimodular time. We discuss self-adjoint extensions of the Schr\"odinger-like Hamiltonian arising from the requirement of unitarity in unimodular time, and identify a physically motivated one-parameter family of extensions. For semiclassical states we are able to derive analytical expressions for expectation values of the metric, representing a quantum-corrected, nonsingular extension of the classical Schwarzschild-(A)dS geometry which describes a quantum transition between asymptotic black hole and white hole states. The sign of the self-adjoint extension parameter corresponds to the allowed sign of the black hole/white hole mass, and so it can be chosen to ensure that this mass is always positive. We also discuss tunnelling states which allow for a change in the sign of the mass, but which are not semiclassical in high-curvature regions. Our mechanism for singularity resolution and the explicit form of the quantum-corrected metric can be compared to other proposals for black holes in quantum gravity, and in the asymptotically AdS case can be contrasted with holographic arguments.</description>

      <title>Algebraic and Positive Geometry of the Universe: from Particles to Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the intersection of algebra, geometry, and combinatorics with particle physics and cosmology has led to significant advances. Central to this progress is the twofold formulation of the study of particle interactions and observables in the universe: on the one hand, Feynman's approach reduces to the study of intricate integrals; on the other hand, one encounters the study of positive geometries. This article introduces key developments, mathematical tools, and the connections that drive progress at the frontier between algebraic geometry, the theory of $D$-modules, combinatorics, and physics. All these threads contribute to shaping the flourishing field of positive geometry, which aims to establish a unifying mathematical language for describing phenomena in cosmology and particle physics.</description>

      <title>Magnetar structure in non-linear electrodynamics with mixed poloidal-toroidal fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetars have inferred polar field strengths in excess of the Schwinger limit, where non-linear electromagnetic effects can be significant. Their internal fields may be even stronger, suggesting that Maxwellian characterizations of hydromagnetic structure may require revision. A generalized Grad-Shafranov equation, describing static and axisymmetric fluid stars with mixed poloidal-toroidal fields, is introduced and subsequently solved in a perturbative scheme to calculate quadrupolar deformations. In the Born-Infeld theory, we show that the toroidal field has a maximum strength set by the scale parameter, $b$, implying an upper limit to the stellar prolateness, $|\epsilon_{\rm max}| \sim 10^{-5} \left(b/10^{16}\text{ G}\right)^2$, that is independent of field specifics. Observations of magnetar phenomena that are interpreted as evidence for ellipticity, such as precession, can thus implicitly constrain post-Maxwellian parameters in a way that complements terrestrial experiments. Toroidal ceilings also have implications for dynamo theory and gravitational waves, which we revisit together with field evolution in crusts abiding by beyond-Maxwell physics.</description>

      <title>Multimessenger hierarchical triple merger gravitational-wave event pair GW190514-GW190521 inside AGN J124942.3 + 344929</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16864v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a candidate electromagnetic (EM) counterpart to the binary black hole merger GW190521, identified as ZTF19abanrhr within active galactic nuclei (AGN) J124942.3 + 344929. Additionally, GW190514 is proposed as a plausible precursor merger to GW190521 within a hierarchical merger scenario. In this study, we investigate the potential association between GW190514 and GW190521 as a hierarchical triple merger associated with ZTF19abanrhr, taking into account of the sky position, distance, and mass of the sources using a Bayesian criterion. Our analysis reveals that the association is favored over a random coincidence, with a log Bayes factor of 16.8, corresponding to an odds ratio of $\sim$$199:1$, assuming an astrophysical prior odds of $10^{-5}$. Notably, when accounting for the primary masses of the two gravitational-wave events as potential products of mergers in the AGN formation channel, the Bayes factor increases significantly, further enhancing the preference for this association by a factor of $\sim$$10^2$, corresponding to a log Bayes factor of 21.5 and an odds ratio of $\sim$$2\times10^4:1$. Our results suggest strong evidence for the first hierarchical triple merger associated with an EM counterpart in the AGN formation channel. This work is crucial for understanding the formation mechanisms of massive black holes, the role of AGNs in hierarchical mergers, and the implications of multimessenger astronomy.</description>

      <title>Searching for continuous gravitational waves from slowly spinning neutron stars with DECIGO, Big Bang Observer, Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17087v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider stably rotating highly magnetised neutron stars and glitching pulsars. We discuss the prospects for detecting continuous gravitational waves from these sources below 20 Hz with next-generation ground-based facilities such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer and space-based observatories such as DECIGO and Big Bang Observer. We demonstrate that these constitute interesting science targets. We use a robust sensitivity estimation method for future searches based on demonstrated performance. We show that the spin-down upper limit on the gravitational wave amplitude of all highly magnetised pulsars and magnetars suitable for a years-long fully coherent search, exceeds the smallest gravitational wave amplitude estimated detectable with DECIGO and Big Bang Observer. We find that the hidden magnetar candidate PSR J1852+0040 can be detected by Cosmic Explorer if it is emitting at least at 20% of its spin-down luminosity. Finally, post-glitch transient continuous gravitational waves from magnetars are an interesting target for deci-Hz detectors, with all but one of the recorded glitches giving rise to a spin-down limit signal above the smallest detectable level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the matrix model characterizing the Ising model coupled to Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT) from the point of view of the Functional Renormalization Group Equation (FRGE). This model is a dually weighted matrix model, whose Feynman diagrams are in correspondence with discrete triangulations of two-dimensional geometries with a preferred time foliation. In particular, we find the fixed points of the beta-function equations, showing that the number of relevant directions in each case is compatible with the physical interpretation of the CFT at the fixed point. In addition to recovering the fixed points for topological gravity and pure gravity with a cosmological constant, we find a new fixed point featuring three relevant directions which matches the number of primary fields in the Ising CFT.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo simulation of GRB data to test Lorentz-invariance violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lorentz-invariance violation (LV) at energy scales approaching the Planck regime serves as a critical probe for understanding quantum gravity phenomenology. Astrophysical observations of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) present a promising avenue for testing LV-induced spectral lag phenomena; however, interpretations are complicated by degeneracies between LV effects and intrinsic emission delays. This study systematically investigates three competing time delay models: Model A (LV delay combined with a constant intrinsic delay), Model B (energy-dependent intrinsic delay without LV), and Model C (LV delay combined with energy-dependent intrinsic delay). We utilize mock GRB datasets generated under distinct delay mechanisms and employ Bayesian parameter estimation on simulated observations of 10 GRBs. Our findings demonstrate that Model C consistently recovers input parameters across all datasets. In contrast, Models A and B struggle to reconcile data generated under alternative mechanisms, particularly when confronted with high-energy TeV photons from GRB 190114C and GRB 221009A. Our analysis confirms that the incorporation of energy-dependent intrinsic delays in Model C is essential for establishing robust LV constraints, effectively resolving prior ambiguities in the interpretation of multi-GeV and TeV photon emissions. The results validate Model C as a generalized framework for future LV searches, yielding a subluminal LV scale of \(E_{\rm LV} \simeq 3 \times 10^{17}\) GeV based on realistic datasets. These findings are consistent with earlier constraints derived from Fermi-LAT datasets. This work underscores the necessity for joint modeling of LV and astrophysical emission processes in next-generation LV studies utilizing observatories such as LHAASO and CTA.</description>
