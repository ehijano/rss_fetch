      <title>Learned frequency-domain scattered wavefield solutions using neural operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving the wave equation is essential to seismic imaging and inversion. The numerical solution of the Helmholtz equation, fundamental to this process, often encounters significant computational and memory challenges. We propose an innovative frequency-domain scattered wavefield modeling method employing neural operators adaptable to diverse seismic velocities. The source location and frequency information are embedded within the input background wavefield, enhancing the neural operator's ability to process source configurations effectively. In addition, we utilize a single reference frequency, which enables scaling from larger-domain forward modeling to higher-frequency scenarios, thereby improving our method's accuracy and generalization capabilities for larger-domain applications. Several tests on the OpenFWI datasets and realistic velocity models validate the accuracy and efficacy of our method as a surrogate model, demonstrating its potential to address the computational and memory limitations of numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Milankovi\'c Forcing in Deep Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astronomical (or Milankovi\'c) forcing of the Earth system is key to understanding rhythmic climate change on time scales &gt;~ 10 kyr. Paleoceanographic and paleoclimatological applications concerned with past astronomical forcing rely on astronomical calculations (solutions), which represent the backbone of cyclostratigraphy and astrochronology. Here we present state-of-the-art astronomical solutions over the past 3.5 Gyr. Our goal is to provide tuning targets and templates for interpreting deep-time cyclostratigraphic records and designing external forcing functions in climate models. Our approach yields internally consistent orbital and precession-tilt solutions, including fundamental solar system frequencies, orbital eccentricity and inclination, lunar distance, luni-solar precession rate, Earth's obliquity, and climatic precession. Contrary to expectations, we find that the long eccentricity cycle (previously assumed stable and labeled ''metronome'', recent period ~405 kyr), can become unstable on long time scales. Our results reveal episodes during which the long eccentricity cycle is very weak or absent and Earth's orbital eccentricity and climate-forcing spectrum are unrecognizable compared to the recent past. For the ratio of eccentricity-to-inclination amplitude modulation (frequently observable in paleorecords) we find a wide distribution around the recent 2:1 ratio, i.e., the system is not restricted to a 2:1 or 1:1 resonance state. Our computations show that Earth's obliquity was lower and its amplitude (variation around the mean) significantly reduced in the past. We therefore predict weaker climate forcing at obliquity frequencies in deep time and a trend toward reduced obliquity power with age in stratigraphic records. For deep-time stratigraphic and modeling applications, the orbital parameters of our 3.5-Gyr integrations are made available at 400-year resolution.</description>

      <title>Strength and Sensitivity of Land-Atmosphere Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The land-atmosphere coupling strength has been defined as the percentage of precipitation variability explained by the variation of soil moisture in the Global Land-Atmosphere Coupling Experiment (GLACE). While it is useful to identify global hotspots of land-atmosphere interaction, this coupling strength is different from coupling sensitivity, which directly quantifies how precipitation generation responds to the perturbation of soil moisture and is essential for our understanding of the global water cycle. To disentangle these two quantities, here we theoretically explore the relationships among coupling strength, sensitivity, and soil moisture variances. We use climate model outputs to show that the largest soil moisture variances are located in the transitional climate zones and the variations of soil moisture largely account for the geographical patterns of coupling hotspots. The coupling sensitivity is not necessarily low in non-hotspot regions, which could impose great impacts on the development of extreme climate events. We therefore call for more research attention on coupling sensitivity to improve our understanding of the climate system.</description>

      <title>Hyperuniformity on Mars: Pebbles scattered on sand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Gale Crater near Mars' equator, dunes and ripples of sand stand out from the general orderless, rocky terrain. In addition, images from Curiosity, the Mars Science Laboratory rover, reveal more subtle orderly forms: widespread, meter-scale domains of evenly spaced, pebble-size rocks (termed clasts) on wind-blown sand in scattered locations. Here, we examine quantitatively several clast domains on both Mars and Earth, and compare their geometry with that of random points. The clast distributions are more orderly than expected by chance; they differ significantlty from those associated with uniform (Poisson) random processes. Moreover, they are hyperuniform, a self-organized state recently recognized in diverse active materials and biological systems but that appears novel for planetary surfaces. These patches are often surrounded by recent wind-borne ripples, suggesting an interplay between sand transport, ripple activity and clasts. Using numerical simulations, we show that clast displacements induced by gravity, combined with the evolution of the sand surface caused by aeolian sand transport and ripple migration, can produce realistic hyperuniform and random clast distributions, as well as distinct clast alignements. Our findings highlight the existence of easily overlooked disordered hyperuniform states on ground surfaces, suggesting novel self-organized states beyond distinct geometric patterns.</description>
