      <title>C*-algebras of self-similar actions of groupoids on higher-rank graphs and their equilibrium states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02472</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.02472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a self-similar action of a groupoid $G$ on a finite higher-rank graph. To these actions we associate a compactly aligned product system of Hilbert bimodules, and thereby obtain corresponding universal Nica--Toeplitz and Cuntz--Pimsner algebras. We consider natural actions of the real numbers on both algebras and study the KMS states of the associated dynamics. For large inverse temperatures, we describe the simplex of KMS states on the Nica--Toeplitz algebra in terms of traces on the full $C^*$-algebra of $G$. We prove that if the graph is $G$-aperiodic and the action satisfies a finite-state condition, then there is a unique KMS state on the Cuntz--Pimsner algebra.</description>

      <title>Topological Boundaries of Representations and Coideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a locally compact quantum group $\mathbb{G}$, a (left) coideal is a (left) $\mathbb{G}$-invariant von Neumann subalgebra of $L^\infty(\mathbb{G})$. We introduce and analyze various generalizations of amenability and coamenability to coideals of discrete and compact quantum groups. We focus on a particular class of coideals found in the category of compact quantum groups, which are associated with a compact quasi-subgroup. This class includes all coideals of the quotient type. We also introduce the notion of a Furstenberg-Hamana boundary for representations of discrete quantum groups and use it to study amenability and coamenability properties of coideals. We then prove that a coideal of a compact quantum group that is associated with a compact quasi-subgroup is coamenable if and only if its codual coideal is $\mathbb{G}$-injective. If $\mathbb{G}$ is a unimodular or an exact discrete quantum group, we can replace $\mathbb{G}$-injectivity in the latter statement with the weaker condition of relative amenability. This result leads to a complete characterization of the unique trace property. Specifically, a unimodular discrete quantum group $\mathbb{G}$ has the unique trace property if and only if the action of $\mathbb{G}$ on its noncommutative Furstenberg boundary is faithful. We also demonstrated that if a unimodular discrete quantum group $\mathbb{G}$ is $C^*$-simple then it has the unique trace property. These findings are the quantum analogs of the groundbreaking results of Breuillard, Kalantar, Kennedy, and Ozawa and they provide answers to questions posted by Kalantar, Kasprzak, Skalski, and Vergnioux.</description>

      <title>The logarithmic Dirichlet Laplacian on Ahlfors regular spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the logarithmic analogue of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on Ahlfors regular metric-measure spaces. This operator is intrinsically defined with spectral properties analogous to those of elliptic pseudo-differential operators on Riemannian manifolds. Specifically, its heat semigroup consists of compact operators which are trace-class after some critical point in time. Moreover, its domain is a Banach module over the Dini continuous functions and every H\"older continuous function is a smooth vector. Finally, the operator is compatible, in the sense of noncommutative geometry, with the action of a large class of non-isometric homeomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Classification conjectures for Leavitt path algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04262v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of Leavitt path algebras is intrinsically related, via graphs, to the theory of symbolic dynamics and $C^*$-algebras where the major classification programs have been a domain of intense research in the last 50 years. In this survey article, we gather together current lines of research in the classification of Leavitt path algebras, questions, conjectures, and some of the results about them that have been obtained so far.</description>
