      <title>Nonreciprocal electrical transport in linear systems with balanced gain and loss in the bulk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate electrical transport in a quantum wire of $N$ sites connected to an equal number $(N_i/2)$ of sources and drains of charges in bulk. Each source and drain injects and extracts charges at the same rate, respectively. We show that the linear-response electrical current is nonreciprocal in such a system when the arrangement of sources and drains breaks the system's parity. We prove that inelastic scattering is essential for nonreciprocity in this system. For this, we invoke a master equation description of classical charge transport in a similar system. The nonreciprocal current in quantum wire matches that in the classical model for $N_i/N \sim 1$, generating a finite scattering length much smaller than the length of the wire. The nonreciprocity in the quantum wire oscillates with wire length when $N_i/N \ll 1$, and it can vanish at specific lengths.</description>

      <title>Extremely high-density ($&gt;10^{14}$cm$^{-2}$) with very low sheet resistance 2D electron gases in N-polar AlGaN/GaN heterostructures with GaN/AlN superlattice back barriers grown on sapphire substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the realization of extremely high-density ($&gt;10^{14}$cm$^{-2}$) 2D electron gases in N-polar AlGaN/GaN heterostructures grown on sapphire substrates. By introduction the GaN/AlN superlattice (SL) back barrier between GaN buffer layer and AlGaN barrier layer we observed a giant enhancement of the 2D electron gas density at the GaN/Al$_{0.3}$Ga$_{0.7}$N interface from $3\times10^{13}$cm$^{-2}$ (without SL) to $1.4\times10^{14}$cm$^{-2}$ (with SL back barrier) that is only an order of magnitude below the intrinsic crystal limit of $\approx10^{15}$cm$^{-2}$. We found that the changes of 2D electron gas density with SL correlated well with changes of the wafer warp parameter which suggested the strain-induced 2D electron gas density. Simultaneously, the room temperature electron mobility was as high as 169 cm$^2$/Vs, which with the electron density of $1.4\times10^{14}$cm$^{-2}$ gives a very low sheet resistance of 264 $\Omega$/sq (one of the lowest reported so far for the N-polar 2D electron gas channel). The finding of the very high-density 2D electron gas with very low sheet resistance in N-polar III-nitride heterostructures can push the power performance N-polar GaN HEMTs into a new level which is unreachable by the conventional N-polar GaN HEMTs.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric Properties of Benzothieno-Benzothiophene Self-Assembled Monolayers in Molecular Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a combined experimental (C-AFM and SThM) and theoretical (DFT) study of the thermoelectric properties of molecular junctions made of self-assembled monolayers on Au of thiolated benzothieno-benzothiophene (BTBT) and alkylated BTBT derivatives (C8-BTBT-C8). We measure the thermal conductance per molecule at 15 pW/K and 8.8 pW/K, respectively, among the lowest values for molecular junctions so far reported (10-50 pW/K). The lower thermal conductance for C8-BTBT-C8 is consistent with two interfacial thermal resistances introduced by the alkyl chains, which reduce the phononic thermal transport in the molecular junction. The Seebeck coefficients are 36 {\mu}V/K and 245 {\mu}V/K, respectively, the latter due to the weak coupling of the core BTBT with the electrodes. We deduce a thermoelectric figure of merit ZT up to ca. 1E-4 for the BTBT molecular junctions at 300K, on a par with the values reported for archetype molecular junctions (olygo(phenylene ethynylene) derivatives).</description>

      <title>Thermal Generation of Spin Current in a Quantum Dot Coupled to Magnetic Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study thermally-generated spin current in the system consisting of a quantum dot connected to two magnetic insulators. The external leads are kept at different temperatures which leads to an imbalance of magnon populations in two magnetic insulators resulting in the flow of the magnon (spin) current. We take into account many-body magnon interactions and incorporate energy-dependent density of states of the magnetic insulators. Both features can strongly affect magnon distribution in the magnetic insulators and the coupling strengths between the leads and the dot, and thus, the thermally generated spin current. All the calculations are carried out in the weak coupling regime. We show, that results obtained with a density of states being a function of energy differ significantly from the ones obtained with a density of states taken as a constant. In turn, magnon interactions in the leads proved to be important at high temperatures and large values of energy of transported spin waves.</description>

      <title>Reflectors Tune Near-Field Thermal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore near-field thermal radiation transport in nanoparticles embedded within a multilayer slab structure, focusing on dynamic modulation of heat flux via cavity interactions. Our findings reveal that by tuning the distance between reflectors and nanoparticles, thermal transport can be significantly suppressed or enhanced, driven by selective excitation of surface modes within the cavity. By precisely adjusting inter-slab gaps, we achieve multi-order control over thermal flux while maintaining stability across a broad range of configurations. Notably, internal slab arrangement plays a pivotal role, with compact designs yielding the most pronounced effects. This work unveils a novel mechanism for manipulating near-field heat transfer, with exciting potential for nanoscale thermal management and thermal sensing technologies.</description>

      <title>Industrial 300$\,$mm wafer processed spin qubits in natural silicon/silicon-germanium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realisation of an universal quantum computer will require the operation of thousands to millions of qubits. The possibility of using existing industrial semiconductor fabrication techniques and infrastructure for up-scaling and reproducibility makes silicon based spin qubits one of the most promising platforms to achieve this goal. The implementation of the up to now largest semiconductor based quantum processor was realized in a silicon/silicon-germanium heterostructure known for its low charge noise, long qubit coherence times and fast driving speeds, but the high structural complexity creates challenges for industrial implementations. Here we demonstrate quantum dots hosted in a natural Si/SiGe heterostructure fully fabricated by an industrial 300$\,$mm semiconductor wafer process line from heterostructure growth to Co micromagnet monolithic integration. We report charge noise values below 2$\,\mathrm{\mu eV/\sqrt{Hz}}$, spin relaxation times of over 1$\,$s and coherence times $T_2^*$ and $T_2^H$ of 1$\,\mathrm{\mu s}$ and 50$\,\mathrm{\mu s}$ respectively, for quantum wells grown using natural silicon. Further, we achieve Rabi frequencies up to 5$\,$MHz and single qubit gate fidelities above 99$\,\%$. In addition to scalability, the high reproducibility of the 300$\,$mm processes enables the deterministic study of qubit metric dependencies on process parameters, which is essential for optimising qubit quality.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometric superfluid weight in multiband superconductors: A microscopic interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Even in non-interacting limit, electrons on different Bloch bands of a multiband system do not move as if they are oblivious to the presence of one another. Instead, they move in concert by virtue of a non-Abelian interband Berry connection. While the impact of this quantum geometric attribute manifests most famously through the Hall response of topological bands, the geometric effects in superconductors have attracted significant recent attention. In particular, much has been discussed about the quantum-metric-induced superfluid weight (SW) in flatband superconductors. In this study, we revisit the geometric SW in generic multiband superconductors and trace its origin to a series of microscopic processes. We separately derive the SW of models containing only intraband Cooper pairing and those involving interband pairing. Two classes of processes enabled by the so-called interband velocity (or the closely related interband Berry connection) are identified: one is equivalent to the transfer of Cooper pairs between different bands, and the other corresponds to virtual back-and-forth single-electron tunneling between the bands. The former contribution manifests as effective Josephson coupling between the multiband superconducting order parameters, while the latter constitutes the only source of SW for a superconducting flatband well isolated from other bands. We further numerically evaluate the SW of a simple topologically trivial two-band superconductor, showcasing how the geometric contribution is sensitive to the details of the multiband pairing configuration. In particular, we highlight an intriguing scenario of negative SW, which may pave way for the formation of novel pair density wave order. Our study provides deeper and more intuitive insight into the origin and nature of the SW induced by the quantum geometry of paired Bloch electrons.</description>

      <title>Topological argument for robustness of coherent states in quantum optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent states, being the closest analog to classical states of wave systems, are well known to possess special properties that set them apart from most other quantum optical states. For example, they are robust against photon loss and do not easily get entangled upon interaction with a beamsplitter, and hence are called ``pointer states'', which is often attributed to them being eigenstates of the annihilation operator. Here we provide insights into a topological argument for their robustness using two separate but exact mappings of a prototypical quantum optics model - the driven Jaynes-Cummings model. The first mapping is based on bosonization and refermionization of the Jaynes-Cummings model into the fermionic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model hosting zero-energy topologically protected edge states. The second mapping is based on the algebra of deformed f-oscillators. We choose these mappings to explicitly preserve the translational symmetry of the model along a Fock-state ladder basis, which is important for maintaining the symmetry-protected topology of such 1D lattices. In addition, we show that the edge state form is preserved even when certain chiral symmetry is broken, corresponding to a single-photon drive for the quantum optics model that preserves the coherent state; however, the addition of two-photon drive immediately disturbs the edge state form, as confirmed by numerical simulations of the mapped SSH model; this is expected since two-photon drive strongly perturbs the coherent state into a squeezed state. Our theory sheds light on a fundamental reason for the robustness of coherent states, both in existence and entanglement -- an underlying connection to topology.</description>

      <title>Topological Surface State Evolution in Bi$_2$Se$_3$ via Surface Etching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological insulators are materials with an insulating bulk interior while maintaining gapless boundary states against back scattering. Bi$_2$Se$_3$ is a prototypical topological insulator with a Dirac-cone surface state around $\Gamma$. Here, we present a controlled methodology to gradually remove Se atoms from the surface Se-Bi-Se-Bi-Se quintuple layers, eventually forming bilayer-Bi on top of the quintuple bulk. Our method allows us to track the topological surface state and confirm its robustness throughout the surface modification. Importantly, we report a relocation of the topological Dirac cone in both real space and momentum space, as the top surface layer transitions from quintuple Se-Bi-Se-Bi-Se to bilayer-Bi. Additionally, charge transfer among different surface layers is identified. Our study provides a precise method to manipulate surface configurations, allowing for the fine-tuning of the topological surface states in Bi$_2$Se$_3$, which represents a significant advancement towards nano-engineering of topological states.</description>

      <title>Precise structure and polarization determination of Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 with electron ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) is a promising candidate for next generation ferroelectric memories and transistors. However, its ferroelectricity origin is still under debate due to the complex of its phase and microstructure in practical samples. In this study, we investigate the atomic structure of substrate-free HZO freestanding film with multislice electron ptychography, for which the ultra-high space resolution (up to ~25 pm) and capability to simultaneously image the cation and oxygen allow us to precisely determine the intrinsic atomic structures of different phases and reveal subtle changes among them. We clarify that the orthorhombic phase is ferroelectric with spontaneous polarization ~34{\pm}4 {\mu}C/cm2 (corresponding to 56{\pm}6 pm in displacement) that is accurately measured through statistical analysis. Significant polarization suppression is observed near the grain boundary, while no distinguishable structural changes are detected near the 180{\deg} ferroelectric domain walls. Through the direct oxygen imaging of orthorhombic phase from the [111] zone axis, we quantify a substantial number of oxygen vacancies with a preferential distribution, which influences the polarization direction and strength. These findings provide fundamentals for HZO research, and thus lay a foundation for the design of high-performance ferroelectric devices.</description>

      <title>Liquid Metal Oxide-assisted Integration of High-k Dielectrics and Metal Contacts for Two-Dimensional Electronics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals semiconductors are promising for future nanoelectronics. However, integrating high-k gate dielectrics for device applications is challenging as the inert van der Waals material surfaces hinder uniform dielectric growth. Here, we report a liquid metal oxide-assisted approach to integrate ultrathin, high-k HfO2 dielectric on 2D semiconductors with atomically smooth interfaces. Using this approach, we fabricated 2D WS2 top-gated transistors with subthreshold swings down to 74.5 mV/dec, gate leakage current density below 10-6 A/cm2, and negligible hysteresis. We further demonstrate a one-step van der Waals integration of contacts and dielectrics on graphene. This can offer a scalable approach toward integrating entire prefabricated device stack arrays with 2D materials. Our work provides a scalable solution to address the crucial dielectric engineering challenge for 2D semiconductors, paving the way for high-performance 2D electronics.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov Controlled Counterdiabatic Quantum Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum algorithm integrating counterdiabatic (CD) protocols with quantum Lyapunov control (QLC) to tackle combinatorial optimization problems. This approach offers versatility, allowing implementation as either a digital-analog or purely digital algorithm based on selected control strategies. By examining spin-glass Hamiltonians, we illustrate how the algorithm can explore alternative paths to enhance solution outcomes compared to conventional CD techniques. This method reduces the dependence on extensive higher-order CD terms and classical optimization techniques, rendering it more suitable for existing quantum computing platforms. The combination of digital compression via CD protocols and the adaptable nature of QLC methods positions this approach as a promising candidate for near-term quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Nanocavities for Molecular Optomechanics: their fundamental description and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vibrational Raman scattering -- a process where light exchanges energy with a molecular vibration through inelastic scattering -- is most fundamentally described in a quantum framework where both light and vibration are quantized. When the Raman scatterer is embedded inside a plasmonic nanocavity, as in some sufficiently controlled implementations of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), the coupled system realizes an optomechanical cavity, where coherent and parametrically amplified light-vibration interaction becomes a resource for vibrational state engineering and nanoscale nonlinear optics. The purpose of this Perspective is to clarify the connection between the languages and parameters used in the fields of molecular cavity optomechanics (McOM) vs. its conventional, `macroscopic' counterpart, and to summarize the main results achieved so far in McOM and the most pressing experimental and theoretical challenges. We aim to make the theoretical framework of molecular cavity optomechanics practically usable for the SERS and nanoplasmonics community at large. While quality factors ($Q$'s) and mode volumes ($V$'s) essentially describe the performance of a nanocavity in enhancing light-matter interaction, we point to the light-cavity coupling efficiencies ($\eta$'s) and optomechanical cooperativities ($\mathcal{C}$'s) as the key parameters for molecular optomechanics. As an illustration of the significance of these quantities, we investigate the feasibility of observing optomechanically induced transparency with a molecular vibration -- a measurement that would allow for a direct estimate of the optomechanical cooperativity.</description>

      <title>Ultracompact programmable silicon photonics using layers of low-loss phase-change material Sb$_2$Se$_3$ of increasing thickness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12582</link>

Abstract: High-performance programmable silicon photonic circuits are considered to be a critical part of next generation architectures for optical processing, photonic quantum circuits and neural networks. Low-loss optical phase change materials (PCMs) offer a promising route towards non-volatile free-form control of light. Here, we exploit direct-write digital patterning of waveguides using layers of the PCM Sb$_2$Se$_3$ with a thickness of up to 100 nm, demonstrating the ability to strongly increase the effect per pixel compared to previous implementations where much thinner PCM layers were used. We exploit the excellent refractive index matching between Sb$_2$Se$_3$ and silicon to achieve a low-loss hybrid platform for programmable photonics. A five-fold reduction in modulation length of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer is achieved compared to previous work using thin-film Sb$_2$Se$_3$ devices, decreased to 5 $\mu$m in this work. Application of the thicker PCM layers in direct-write digital programming of a multimode interferometer (MMI) shows a three-fold reduction of the number of programmed pixels to below 10 pixels per device. The demonstrated scaling of performance with PCM layer thickness is important for establishing the optimum working range for hybrid silicon-PCM devices and holds promise for achieving ultracompact programmable photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Stiff and Deformable Quasicrystalline Architected Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Architected materials achieve unique mechanical properties through precisely engineered microstructures that minimize material usage. However, a key challenge of low-density materials is balancing high stiffness with stable deformability up to large strains. Current microstructures, which employ slender elements such as thin beams and plates arranged in periodic patterns to optimize stiffness, are largely prone to instabilities, including buckling and brittle collapse at low strains. This challenge is here addressed by introducing a new class of aperiodic architected materials inspired by quasicrystalline lattices. Beam networks derived from canonical quasicrystalline patterns, such as the Penrose tiling in 2D and icosahedral quasicrystals in 3D, are shown to create stiff, stretching-dominated topologies with non-uniform force chain distributions, effectively mitigating the global instabilities observed in periodic designs. Numerical and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of these designs in combining stiffness and stable deformability at large strains, representing a significant advancement in the development of low-density metamaterials for applications requiring high impact resistance and energy absorption. Our results demonstrate the potential of deterministic quasi-periodic topologies to bridge the gap between periodic and random structures, while branching towards uncharted territory in the property space of architected materials.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic Weyl node-network semimetals protected by spin symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry protected topology has been studied extensively in the past twenty years, but the topology protected by spin symmetry has just begun to be studied. In this work, based on spin symmetry analysis, we propose that a class of Weyl nodal line semimetals is protected by the spin symmetry. Then, by the first-principles electronic structure calculations, we predict that both altermagnetic $\rm Nb_2FeB_2$ and $\rm Ta_2FeB_2$ are node-network semimetals protected by the spin symmetry. Moreover, both altermagnetic $\rm Nb_2FeB_2$ and $\rm Ta_2FeB_2$ have nodal rings protected by the mirror symmetry and Dirac points protected by nonsymmorphic spin symmetry. Furthermore, both altermagnetic $\rm Nb_2FeB_2$ and $\rm Ta_2FeB_2$ transform node-network semimetal phase into Weyl semimetal phase when considering spin-orbit coupling. Therefore, our work not only enriches the topological phases protected by spin symmetry, but also provides an excellent material platform to investigate the exotic physical properties of multiple altermagnetic topological semimetal phases in experiment.</description>

      <title>Chiral superfluidity of helium-3 in the quasi-two-dimensional limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anisotropic pair breaking close to surfaces favors chiral superfluid $^3$He-A over time-reversal invariant $^3$He-B. Confining superfluid $^3$He into a cavity of height $D$ of the order of the Cooper pair size characterized by the coherence length $\xi_0$ -- ranging between 16 nm (34 bar) and 77 nm (0 bar) -- extends the surface effects over the whole sample volume, thus allowing stabilization of the A phase at pressures $P$ and temperatures $T$ where otherwise the B phase would be stable. In this work the surfaces of such a confined sample are covered with a superfluid $^4$He film to create specular quasiparticle scattering boundary conditions, preventing the suppression of the superfluid order parameter. We show that the chiral A phase is the stable superfluid phase under strong confinement over the full $P-T$ phase diagram down to a quasi-two-dimensional limit $D/\xi_0 = 1$. The planar phase, which is degenerate with the chiral A phase in the weak-coupling limit, is not observed. The gap inferred from measurements over the wide pressure range from 0.2 to 21.0 bar leads to an empirical ansatz for temperature-dependent strong-coupling effects. We discuss how these results pave the way for the realization of the fully-gapped two-dimensional $p_x + ip_y$ superfluid under more extreme confinement.</description>

Abstract: Many theories predict a quartic acoustic attenuation increase at sub-THz frequencies in glassy media for the excess vibrational modes known as the boson peak anomaly. Here by introducing phase-sensitive acoustic spectroscopy techniques with a THz bandwidth, we investigate the acoustic properties of vitreous silica at 15 and 300K in the crucial but unexplored sub-THz gap region below the boson peak. Our results indicate a strong negative dispersion starting at \SI{500}{GHz} and the onset of an athermal quartic-frequency-scaling acoustic attenuation term, which emerges above all other thermal losses.</description>

      <title>Bulk vs. Surface: Non-universal partitioning of the topological magnetoelectric effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17859v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electronic ground state of a three-dimensional (3D) band insulator with time-reversal ($\Theta$) symmetry or time-reversal times a discrete translation ($\Theta T_{1/2}$) symmetry is classified by a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-valued topological invariant and characterized by quantized magnetoelectric response. Here we demonstrate by explicit calculation in model $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological insulator thin-films that whereas the magnetoelectric response is localized at the surface in the $\Theta$ symmetry (non-magnetic) case, it is non-universally partitioned between surface and interior contributions in the $\Theta T_{1/2}$ (anti-ferromagnetic) case, while remaining quantized. Within our model the magnetic field induced polarization arises entirely from an anomalous ${\cal N}=0$ Landau level subspace within which the projected Hamiltonian is a generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model whose topological properties are consistent with those of the starting 3D model. We identify a novel connection between the ground state geometry of that 3D model and surface-interior-partitioning in thin films.</description>

      <title>Bulk-boundary correspondence in extended trimer Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an extended trimer Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) tight-binding Hamiltonian keeping up to next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hopping terms and on-site potential energy. The Bloch Hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of all the eight generators (i.e. Gell-Mann matrices) of the SU(3) group. We provide exact analytical expressions of three dispersive energy bands and the corresponding eigenstates for any choices of the system parameters. The system lacks full chiral symmetry since the energy spectrum is not symmetric around zero, except at isolated Bloch wavevectors. We explore parity, time reversal, and certain special chiral symmetries for various system parameters. We discuss the bulk-boundary correspondence by numerically computing the Zak phase for all the bands and the boundary modes in the open boundary condition. There are three different kinds of topological phase transitions, which are classified based on the gap closing points in the Brillouin zone (BZ) while tuning the nearest-neighbor (NN) and NNN hopping terms. We find that quantized changes (in units of $\pi$) in two out of three Zak phases characterize these topological phase transitions. We propose another bulk topological invariant, namely the {\it sub-lattice winding number}, which also characterizes the topological phase transitions changing from $ \nu^{\alpha} = 0 \leftrightarrow 2 $ and $ \nu^{\alpha} = 0 \leftrightarrow 1 \leftrightarrow 2 $ ($\alpha $: sub-lattice index). The sub-lattice winding number not only provides a relatively simple analytical understanding of topological phases but also successfully establishes bulk-boundary correspondence in the absence of inversion symmetry, which may help in characterizing the bulk-boundary correspondence of systems without chiral and inversion symmetry.</description>

      <title>Nanomechanical crystalline AlN resonators with high quality factors for quantum optoelectromechanics</title>

Abstract: High-\Qm{} mechanical resonators are crucial for applications where low noise and long coherence time are required, as mirror suspensions, quantum cavity optomechanical devices, or nanomechanical sensors. Tensile strain in the material enables the use of dissipation dilution and strain engineering techniques, which increase the mechanical quality factor. These techniques have been employed for high-\Qm{} mechanical resonators made from amorphous materials and, recently, from crystalline materials such as InGaP, SiC, and Si. A strained crystalline film exhibiting substantial piezoelectricity expands the capability of high-\Qm{} nanomechanical resonators to directly utilize electronic degrees of freedom. In this work we realize nanomechanical resonators with \Qm{} up to $2.9\times 10^{7}$ made from tensile-strained \SI{290}{\nano\meter}-thick AlN, which is an epitaxially-grown crystalline material offering strong piezoelectricity. We demonstrate nanomechanical resonators that exploit dissipation dilution and strain engineering to reach a \Qf-product approaching $10^{13}$\,\SI{}{\hertz} at room temperature. We realize a novel resonator geometry, triangline, whose shape follows the Al-N bonds and offers a central pad that we pattern with a photonic crystal. This allows us to reach an optical reflectivity above 80\% for efficient coupling to out-of-plane light. The presented results pave the way for quantum optoelectromechanical devices at room temperature based on tensile-strained AlN.</description>

Abstract: Fractal lattices, with their self-similar and intricate structures, offer potential platforms for engineering physical properties on the nanoscale and also for realizing and manipulating high order topological insulator states in novel ways. Here we present a theoretical study on localized corner and edge states, emerging from topological phases in Sierpinski Carpet within a $\pi$-flux regime. A topological phase diagram is presented correlating the quadrupole moment with different hopping parameters. Particular localized states are identified following spatial signatures in distinct fractal generations. The specific geometry and scaling properties of the fractal systems can guide the supported topological states types and their associated functionalities. A conductive device is proposed by coupling identical Sierpinski Carpet units providing transport response through projected edge states which carry on the details of the system's topology. Our findings suggest that fractal lattices may also work as alternative routes to tune energy channels in different devices.</description>

Abstract: Atomically-thin materials based on transition metal dichalcogenides and graphene offer a promising avenue for unlocking the mechanisms underlying the spin Hall effect (SHE) in heterointerfaces. Here, we develop a microscopic theory of the SHE for twisted van der Waals heterostructures that fully incorporates twisting and disorder effects, and illustrate the critical role of symmetry breaking in the generation of spin-Hall currents. We find that an accurate treatment of vertex corrections leads to a qualitatively and quantitatively different SHE than that obtained from popular approaches like the ``$i\,\eta$'' and ladder approximations. A pronounced oscillatory behavior of skew-scattering processes with twist angle, $\theta$, is predicted, reflecting a non-trivial interplay of Rashba and valley-Zeeman effects and yields a vanishing SHE for $\theta = 30^\circ$ and, for graphene-WSe$_2$, an optimal SHE for $\theta \approx 17^\circ$. Our findings reveal disorder and broken symmetries as important knobs to optimize interfacial SHEs.</description>

Abstract: We present an experimental study on optical properties and dynamics of direct and spatially and momentum indirect excitons in AlGaAs/AlAs quantum wells near the crossover between $\varGamma-$ and $X$-valley confined electron states. The time-integrated photoluminescence experiment at $T=$4.8 K revealed three simultaneously observed optical transitions resulting from (a) a direct exciton recombination, involving an electron and a hole states both located in the $\varGamma$-valley in the quantum well layer, and (b) two spatially and momentum indirect excitons, comprising of the confined electron states in the $X$-valley in the AlAs barrier with different effective masses and quantum well holes in the $\varGamma$-valley. This interpretation has been based on the optical pumping density-dependent, temperature-dependent and spatially-resolved photoluminescence measurements, which provided the characterization of the structure, crucial in potential system's applications. Additionally, the time-resolved photoluminescence experiments unveiled complex carrier relaxation dynamics in the investigated quantum well system, which is strongly governed by a non-radiative carrier recombination - the characteristics further critical in potential system's use. This solid state platform hosting both direct and indirect excitons in a highly tunable monolithic system can benefit and underline the operation principles of novel electronic and photonic devices.</description>

Abstract: The emergence of strong relativistic spin-orbit effects in low-dimensional systems provides a rich opportunity for exploring unconventional states of matter. Here, we present a route to realise tunable relativistic band structures based on the lateral patterning of proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling. The concept is illustrated on a patterned graphene-transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructure, where the spatially periodic spin-orbit coupling induces a rich mini-band structure featuring massless and massive Dirac bands carrying large spin Berry curvature. The envisaged systems support robust and gate-tunable spin Hall responses driven by the quantum geometry of mini-bands, which can be tailored through metasurface fabrication methods and twisting effects. These findings open pathways to two-dimensional quantum material design and low-power spintronic applications.</description>

Abstract: Although energy level repulsion is typically observed in interacting quantum systems, non-Hermitian physics predicts the effect of level attraction, which occurs when significant energy dissipation is present. Here, we show a manifestation of dissipative coupling in a high-quality AlGaAs-based polariton microcavity, where two polariton branches attract, resulting in an anomalous, inverted dispersion of the lower branch in momentum dispersion. Using angle-resolved photoluminescence measurements we observe the evolution of the level attraction with exciton-photon detuning, leading to changes in anomalous dispersion shape within a single sample. The dissipative coupling is explained by the interaction with an indirect exciton, acting as a highly dissipative channel in our system, and the observed dispersions are well captured within a phenomenological model. Our results present a new mechanism of dissipative coupling in light-matter systems and offer a tunable and well-controlled AlGaAs-based platform for engineering the non-Hermitian and negative mass effects in polariton systems.</description>

Abstract: Superlattices from twisted graphene mono- and bi-layer systems give rise to on-demand many-body states such as Mott insulators and unconventional superconductors. These phenomena are ascribed to a combination of flat bands and strong Coulomb interactions. However, a comprehensive understanding is lacking because the low-energy band structure strongly changes when the electron filling is varied. Here, we gain direct access to the filling-dependent low energy bands of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) and twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG) by applying micro-focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to in situ gated devices. Our findings for the two systems are in stark contrast: The doping dependent dispersion for TBG can be described in a simple model, combining a filling-dependent rigid band shift with a many-body related bandwidth change. In TDBG, on the other hand, we find a complex behaviour of the low-energy bands, combining non-monotonous bandwidth changes and tuneable gap openings. Our work establishes the extent of electric field tunability of the low energy electronic states in twisted graphene superlattices and can serve to underpin the theoretical understanding of the resulting phenomena.</description>

      <title>Stimulated magnon scattering by non-degenerate parametric excitation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parametric spin wave excitation allows studying a variety of nonlinear phenomena, such as magnon scattering. In patterned micro- and nanostructures the magnon spectra is discrete and translational symmetry is broken, which means allowable scattering channels differ from those in continuous films. An example is non-degenerate scattering by which high-power transverse field pumping creates two magnons with distinct frequencies around half the pumping frequency. Through micromagnetics simulations, we show under certain conditions that combining two pumping frequencies generates new magnon modes through a process of stimulated magnon scattering. Such processes are found to depend on the film geometry and sequence of the pumping fields.</description>

Abstract: We study the low-frequency noise (LFN), i.e. flicker noise, also referred to as 1/f noise, in 2D networks of molecularly functionalized gold nanoparticles (NMN: nanoparticle-molecule network). We examine the noise behaviors of the NMN hosting alkyl chains (octanethiol), fatty acid oleic acids (oleylamine), redox molecule switches (polyoxometalate derivatives) or photo-isomerizable molecules (azobenzene derivatives) and we compare their 1/f noise behaviors. These noise metrics are used to evaluate which molecules are the best candidates to build in-materio reservoir computing molecular devices based on NMNs.</description>

      <title>Mirror-induced effects in cavity polaritonics: Influence on edge states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical cavities are widely used to induce strong light-matter coupling and thereby enable the presence of polaritons. While polaritons are at the source of most of the observed physics, the mirrors forming the cavity may also themselves be responsible for a number of phenomena, independently of the strong light-matter coupling regime. Here we use a toy model of a chain of dipolar emitters coupled to a cuboidal cavity. We unveil several effects originating solely from the boundary conditions imposed by the cavity mirrors, that are dominant when the distances of the emitters to the cavity walls are of the order of the interdipole separation. In particular, we show that mirrors in the direction transverse to the chain may act as effective defects, leading to the emergence of Tamm edge states. Considering a topological chain, we demonstrate that such transverse mirrors may also protect edge states against the effects of the strong light-matter coupling. Finally, we find that mirrors parallel to the chain, by the image charges they involve, induce topological phase transitions even in the case of highly off-resonant photons.</description>

      <title>Excitons in the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18224v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Excitons, Coulomb-driven bound states of electrons and holes, are typically composed of integer charges. However, in bilayer systems influenced by charge fractionalization, a more exotic form of interlayer exciton can emerge, where pairing occurs between constituents that carry fractional charges. Despite numerous theoretical predictions for such fractional excitons, their experimental observation has remained elusive. Here, we report transport signatures of excitonic pairing within fractional quantum Hall effect states. By probing the composition of these excitons and their impact on the underlying wavefunction, we uncover two novel quantum phases of matter. One of these orders can be viewed as the fractional counterpart of the exciton condensate at a total filling of one, while the other involves a more unusual type of exciton that obeys fermionic and anyonic quantum statistics, challenging the standard paradigm of bosonic excitons.</description>

      <title>The Streda Formula for Floquet Systems: Topological Invariants and Quantized Anomalies from Cesaro Summation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces a general theoretical framework, which expresses the topological invariants of two-dimensional Floquet systems in terms of tractable response functions: Building on the Sambe representation of periodically-driven systems, and inspired by the St\v{r}eda formula for static systems, we evaluate the flow of the unbounded Floquet density of states in response to a magnetic perturbation. This Floquet-St\v{r}eda response, which is a priori mathematically ill-defined, is regularized by means of a Ces\`aro summation method. As a key outcome of this approach, we relate all relevant Floquet winding numbers to simple band properties of the Floquet-Bloch Hamiltonian. These general relations indicate how the topological characterization of Floquet systems can be entirely deduced from the stroboscopic time-evolution of the driven system. Importantly, we identify two physically distinguishable contributions to the Floquet-St\v{r}eda response: a quantized flow of charge between the edge and the bulk of the system, and an 'anomalous' quantized flow of energy between the system and the driving field, which provides new insight on the physical origin of the anomalous edge states. As byproducts, our theory provides: a general relation between Floquet winding numbers and the orbital magnetization of Floquet-Bloch bands; a local marker for Floquet winding numbers, which allows to access Floquet topology in inhomogeneous samples; an experimental protocol to extract these Floquet winding numbers from density-measurements in the presence of an engineered bath; as well as general expressions for these topological invariants in terms of the magnetic response of the Floquet density of states, opening a route for the topological characterization of interacting Floquet systems.</description>

Abstract: Frequency-based synthetic dimensions are a promising avenue to extend the dimensionality of photonic systems. In this work, we show how a tilted synthetic lattice is naturally realised by periodically modulating a single-mode resonator under a coherent monochromatic drive. We theoretically study the Bloch wave dynamics in the tilted synthetic lattice, which gives rise to peculiar features in the spectral distribution of the cavity field. Our predictions are experimentally confirmed using a planar tunable superconducting microwave resonator.</description>

      <title>Magnomechanically controlled Goos-H\"{a}nchen shift in cavity QED</title>

Abstract: Phenomena involving interactions among magnons, phonons, and photons in cavity magnomechanical systems have attracted considerable attention recently, owing to their potential applications in the microwave frequency range. One such important effect is the response of a probe field to such tripartite interaction between photon-magnon-phonon. In this paper, we study Goos-H\"{a}nchen shift (GHS) of a reflected probe field in a cavity magnomechanical system. We consider a YIG sphere positioned within a microwave cavity. A microwave control field directly drives the magnon mode in YIG sphere, whereas the cavity is driven via a weak probe field. Our results show that the GHS can be coherently controlled through magnon-phonon coupling via the control field. For instance, GHS can be tuned from positive to negative by tuning the magnon-phonon coupling. Similarly, the effective cavity detuning is another important controlling parameter for GHS. Furthermore, we observe that the enhancement of GHS occurs when magnon-phonon coupling is weak at resonance, and when the magnon-photon coupling is approximately equal to the loss of microwave photons. Our findings may have potential significance in applications related to microwave switching and sensing.</description>

      <title>Toolbox for nonreciprocal dispersive models in circuit QED</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08354v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a systematic method for constructing effective dispersive Lindblad master equations to describe weakly anharmonic superconducting circuits coupled by a generic dissipationless nonreciprocal linear system, with effective coupling parameters and decay rates written in terms of the immittance parameters characterizing the coupler. This article extends the foundational work of Solgun et al. (2019) for linear reciprocal couplers described by an impedance response. Notably, we expand the existing toolbox to incorporate nonreciprocal elements, account for direct stray coupling between immittance ports, circumvent potential singularities, and include collective dissipative effects that arise from interactions with external common environments. We illustrate the use of our results with a circuit of weakly anharmonic Josephson junctions coupled to a multiport nonreciprocal environment and a dissipative port. The results obtained here can be used for the design of complex superconducting quantum processors with nontrivial routing of quantum information, as well as analog quantum simulators of condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic anomalous Hall effect in altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12115v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the anomalous Hall effect arising from the altermagnetic order and spin-orbit interaction in doped FeSb$_2$. To investigate the anomalous transport, we have constructed a tight-binding model of FeSb$_2$. We separately considered the constraints imposed on the model parameters by the spin symmetry group and magnetic symmetry group at zero and finite spin-orbit interaction, respectively. The resulting model includes the effect of exchange splitting and is applicable at both zero and finite spin-orbit interaction. In the case of spin symmetry, the analysis covers the spin-only subgroup arising from collinear magnetism, as well as non-trivial symmetry elements. This allows us to explore changes in the hopping amplitudes as symmetry is reduced by spin-orbit interaction from the spin group to the magnetic group. While the anomalous Hall effect is forbidden by spin symmetry, it is allowed by the symmetries of the magnetic group. The intrinsic Hall conductivity is shown to vanish linearly with spin-orbit interaction. This non-analytic behavior is universal to altermagnets. It originates from the singularity of the Berry curvature localized along lines on a Fermi surface confined to symmetry planes. These planes host spin degeneracy protected by spin symmetry, which is lifted by spin-orbit interaction.</description>

Abstract: The Higgs mode in superconductors corresponds to oscillations of the amplitude of the order parameter. While its detection typically entails resonant optical excitation, we present a purely transport-based setup wherein it is excited in a voltage biased Josephson junction. Demonstrating the importance of order parameter dynamics, the interplay of Higgs resonance and Josephson physics enhances the second harmonic Josephson current oscillating at twice the usual Josephson frequency in transparent junctions featuring single-band s-wave superconductors. If the leads have unequal equilibrium superconducting gaps, this second harmonic component may even eclipse its first harmonic counterpart, thus furnishing a unique hallmark of the Higgs oscillations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlling light at subwavelength scales is one of the main challenges of nanophotonics. Leveraging hyperbolic polaritons supporting arbitrarily large wavevectors can lead to extreme light confinement, effectively overcoming the diffraction limit. Hyperbolicity was initially realized in artificial metamaterials, but their performances are limited by high losses in the metallic components. While recently discovered natural low-loss hyperbolic phonon polaritons initiated a revival in the interest for hyperbolic materials, they are confined to the mid-infrared frequency range, limiting their use for several applications. Some hyperbolic materials at visible frequencies have been studied, but they are either very lossy or only feature out-of-plane hyperbolicity. Here, we demonstrate the presence of low-loss, in-plane hyperbolic plasmon polaritons in the visible and near-infrared in thin films of $\mathrm{MoOCl}_2$, a natural van der Waals crystal. The polariton dispersion is predicted based on the framework of light propagation in biaxial media, and experimentally confirmed by real space nano imaging on exfoliated flakes. $\mathrm{MoOCl}_2$ constitutes a novel material platform for visible-range applications leveraging the unboundedness of hyperbolic modes, such as hyperlensing, Purcell factor enhancement and super-resolution imaging, without the drawbacks of metamaterials.</description>

Abstract: The trans-series completion of perturbative series of a wide class of quantum mechanical systems can be determined by combining the resurgence program and extra input coming from exact WKB analysis. In this paper, we reexamine the Harper-Hofstadter model and its spectrum, Hofstadter's butterfly, in light of recent developments. We demonstrate the connection between the perturbative energy series of the Harper-Hofstadter model and the vev of $1/2$-BPS Wilson loop of 5d SYM and clarify the differences between their non-perturbative corrections. Taking insights from the cosine potential model, we construct the full energy trans-series for flux $\phi=2\pi/Q$ and provide numerical evidence with remarkably high precision. Finally, we revisit the problem of self-similarity of the butterfly and discuss the possibility of a completed version of the Rammal-Wilkinson formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To apply the powerful many-body techniques of tensor networks to massless Dirac fermions one wants to discretize the $p\cdot\sigma$ Hamiltonian and construct a matrix-product-operator (MPO) representation. We compare two alternative discretization schemes, one with a sine dispersion, the other with a tangent dispersion, applied to a one-dimensional Luttinger liquid with Hubbard interaction. Both types of lattice fermions allow for an exact MPO representation of low bond dimension, so they are efficiently computable, but only the tangent dispersion gives a power law decay of the propagator in agreement with the continuum limit: The sine dispersion is gapped by the interactions, evidenced by an exponentially decaying propagator. Our construction of a tensor network with an unpaired Dirac cone works around the fermion-doubling obstruction by exploiting the fact that the \textit{nonlocal} Hamiltonian of tangent fermions permits a \textit{local} generalized eigenproblem.</description>

Abstract: Discovering mixed state quantum orders is an on-going issue. Recently, it has been recognized that there are (at least) two kinds of symmetries in the mixed state; strong and weak symmetries. Under symmetry-respective decoherence, spontaneous strong-to-weak symmetry breaking (SSSB) can occur. This work provides a scheme to describe SSSB and other decoherence phenomena in the mixed state by employing the stabilizer formalism and the efficient numerical algorithm of Clifford circuits. We present two systematic numerical studies.In a two-dimensional (2D) circuit with a stochastic Ising type decoherence, an SSSB phase transition is clearly observed and its criticality is elucidated by the numerical methods. In particular, we calculate R\'{e}nyi-2 correlations and estimate critical exponents of the SSSB transition. For the second system, we introduce an idea of subgroup SSSB. As an example, we study a system with symmetry-protected-topological (SPT) order provided by both one-form and zero-form symmetries, and observe how the system evolves under decoherence. After displaying numerical results, we show that viewpoint of percolation is quite useful to understand the SSSB transition, which is applicable for a wide range of decohered states. Finally, we comment on SSSB of one-form-symmetry exemplifying toric code.</description>
