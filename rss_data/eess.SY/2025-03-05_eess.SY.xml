      <title>Interaction-Aware Model Predictive Decision-Making for Socially-Compliant Autonomous Driving in Mixed Urban Traffic Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the experimental validation of an interaction-aware model predictive decision-making (IAMPDM) approach in the course of a simulator study. The proposed IAMPDM uses a model of the pedestrian, which simultaneously predicts their future trajectories and characterizes the interaction between the pedestrian and the automated vehicle. The main benefit of the proposed concept and the experiment is that the interaction between the pedestrian and the socially compliant autonomous vehicle leads to smoother traffic. Furthermore, the experiment features a novel human-in-the-decision-loop aspect, meaning that the test subjects have no expected behavior or defined sequence of their actions, better imitating real traffic scenarios. Results show that intention-aware decision-making algorithms are more effective in realistic conditions and contribute to smoother traffic flow than state-of-the-art solutions. Furthermore, the findings emphasize the crucial impact of intention-aware decision-making on autonomous vehicle performance in urban areas and the need for further research.</description>

      <title>A strictly predefined-time convergent and anti-noise fractional-order zeroing neural network for solving time-variant quadratic programming in kinematic robot control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a strictly predefined-time convergent and anti-noise fractional-order zeroing neural network (SPTC-AN-FOZNN) model, meticulously designed for addressing time-variant quadratic programming (TVQP) problems. This model marks the first variable-gain ZNN to collectively manifest strictly predefined-time convergence and noise resilience, specifically tailored for kinematic motion control of robots. The SPTC-AN-FOZNN advances traditional ZNNs by incorporating a conformable fractional derivative in accordance with the Leibniz rule, a compliance not commonly achieved by other fractional derivative definitions. It also features a novel activation function designed to ensure favorable convergence independent of the model's order. When compared to five recently published recurrent neural networks (RNNs), the SPTC-AN-FOZNN, configured with $0&lt;\alpha\leq 1$, exhibits superior positional accuracy and robustness against additive noises for TVQP applications. Extensive empirical evaluations, including simulations with two types of robotic manipulators and experiments with a Flexiv Rizon robot, have validated the SPTC-AN-FOZNN's effectiveness in precise tracking and computational efficiency, establishing its utility for robust kinematic control.</description>

      <title>A Review of Artificial Intelligence Impacting Statistical Process Monitoring and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been 100 years since statistical process control (SPC) or statistical process monitoring (SPM) was first introduced for production processes and later applied to service, healthcare, and other industries. The techniques applied to SPM applications are mostly statistically oriented. Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have reinvigorated the imagination of adopting AI for SPM applications. This manuscript begins with a concise review of the historical development of the statistically based SPM methods. Next, this manuscript explores AI and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and methods applied in various SPM applications, addressing quality characteristics of univariate, multivariate, profile, and image. These AI methods can be classified into the following categories: classification, pattern recognition, time series applications, and generative AI. Specifically, different kinds of neural networks, such as artificial neural networks (ANN), convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), and generative adversarial networks (GAN), are among the most implemented AI methods impacting SPM. Finally, this manuscript outlines a couple of future directions that harness the potential of the Large Multimodal Model (LMM) for advancing SPM research and applications in complex systems. The ultimate objective is to transform statistical process monitoring (SPM) into smart process control (SMPC), where corrective actions are autonomously implemented to either prevent quality issues or restore process performance.</description>

      <title>Clearing function-based release date optimization in a multi-item multi-stage MRP planned production system in a rolling-horizon planning environment with multilevel BOM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the integration of clearing function (CF)-based release planning into Material Requirements Planning (MRP) systems, with a focus on mitigating the inherent rigidity of MRP in handling variability in production environments. By replacing the backward scheduling step of MRP with a CF-based optimization model, this work investigates its impact on overall costs, lead times, and system performance in multi-item, multi-stage production systems. Computational experiments were conducted on two distinct systems - a simple and a complex production system - under varying demand behaviors and utilization levels. The findings reveal that the CF-based release order planning consistently outperforms traditional MRP in managing cost and variability, particularly under scenarios of higher demand uncertainty and shop load. While MRP demonstrates stability in less complex scenarios, its inability to adapt dynamically to variability leads to higher costs in most conditions. The analysis underscores the potential of CF-based methods to enhance planning efficiency in dynamic production settings, providing a foundation for future research on integrating capacity constraints within the broader MRP framework.</description>

      <title>Tracking Control of Euler-Lagrangian Systems with Prescribed State, Input, and Temporal Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synthesis of a smooth tracking control policy for Euler-Lagrangian (EL) systems with stringent regions of operation induced by state, input and temporal (SIT) constraints is a very challenging task. Most existing solutions rely on prior information of the parameters of the nominal EL dynamics together with bounds on system uncertainty, and incorporate either state or input constraints to guarantee tracking error convergence in a prescribed settling time. Contrary to these approaches, this study proposes an approximation-free adaptive barrier function-based control policy for achieving local prescribed-time convergence of the tracking error to a prescribed-bound in the presence of state and input constraints. This is achieved by imposing time-varying bounds on the filtered tracking error to confine the states within their respective bounds, while also incorporating a saturation function to limit the magnitude of the proposed control action that leverages smooth time-based generator functions for ensuring tracking error convergence within the prescribed-time. Importantly, corresponding feasibility conditions pertaining to the minimum control authority, maximum disturbance rejection capability of the control policy, and the viable set of initial conditions are derived, illuminating the narrow operating domain of the EL systems arising from the interplay of SIT constraints. Numerical validation studies with three different robotic manipulators are employed to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme. A detailed performance comparison study with leading alternative designs is also undertaken to illustrate the superior performance of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Levels of Spacecraft Autonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As autonomous systems are being developed in multiple industries it has been recognized that a phased approach is needed both for technical development and user acceptance. Partially in response, the automotive and aircraft industries have published five or six Levels of Autonomy in an attempt to broadly characterize the amount of autonomy technology that is present in any particular vehicle. We have developed a similar six Levels of Spacecraft Autonomy for similar purposes. Here, we propose extending these ideas to spacecraft constellations, clusters, swarms, ground stations for spacecraft, and strategic collaboration among space and ground assets. We intend these levels of autonomy to be used to characterize and describe high-level capabilities for any given satellite for education and communication with lawmakers, government officials, and the general public. All of the proposed levels mimic those of the automotive and aircraft levels in an attempt to maintain consistency and a common understanding with our intended audiences.</description>

      <title>Transition pathways to electrified chemical production within sector-coupled national energy systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemical industry's transition to net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is particularly challenging due to the carbon inherently contained in chemical products, eventually released to the environment. Fossil feedstock-based production can be replaced by electrified chemical production, combining carbon capture and utilization (CCU) with electrolysis-based hydrogen. However, electrified chemical production requires vast amounts of clean electricity, leading to competition in our sector-coupled energy systems. In this work, we investigate the pathway of the chemical industry towards electrified production within the context of a sector-coupled national energy system's transition to net-zero emissions. Our results show that the sectors for electricity, low-temperature heat, and mobility transition before the chemical industry due to the required build-up of renewables, and to the higher emissions abatement of heat pumps and battery electric vehicles. To achieve the net-zero target, the energy system relies on clean energy imports to cover 41\% of its electricity needs, largely driven by the high energy requirements of a fully electrified chemical industry. Nonetheless, a partially electrified industry combined with dispatchable production alternatives provides flexibility to the energy system by enabling electrified production when renewable electricity is available. Hence, a partially electrified, diversified chemical industry can support the integration of intermittent renewables, serving as a valuable component in net-zero energy systems.</description>

      <title>Detecting Unobservable Contingencies in Active Distribution Systems Using a Stochastic Hybrid Systems Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a distributed contingency detection algorithm for detecting unobservable contingencies in power distribution systems using stochastic hybrid system (SHS) models. We aim to tackle the challenge of limited measurement capabilities in distribution networks that restrict the ability to detect contingencies promptly. We incorporate the dynamics of distribution network connections, load feeders, PV, and battery energy storage system (BESS) hybrid resources into a fully correlated SHS model representing the distribution system as a randomly switching system between different structures during contingency occurrence. We show that jumps in the SHS model correspond to contingencies in the physical power grid. We propose a probing approach based on magnitude-modulation inputs (MaMI) to make contingencies detectable. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through simulations on a sample distribution system.</description>

      <title>Pneumatically controlled non-magnetic, high-power, and low insertion loss RF switch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While positive-intrinsic-negative (PIN) diodes are commonly used in radio frequency (RF) circuits, their use often degrades the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) due to high insertion loss and interference from additional biasing circuit components, which is critical for SNR-prioritized applications. This work presents the design of a novel pneumatically controlled switch, called AeroSwitch, which serves as an RF switch alternative to PIN diodes by significantly reducing lossy elements and additional biasing circuitry, with a focus on the applicability of AeroSwitch for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) RF switch implantation. AeroSwitch was assessed against the PIN diode using bench testing, revealing a slightly reduced average insertion loss of 0.1 dB and an enhancement in average isolation by 15 dB. The switches are incorporated into a capacitor switch array within an L-matching network. This matching network connects to a loop RF coil, serving as a high-impedance load. The quality (Q)-factors were evaluated compared to a PIN diode capacitor switch array matching network configured identically. Overall, the AeroSwitch demonstrated an average 62% improved Q-factor compared to the PIN diode. These findings indicate that AeroSwitch offers significant advantages over the PIN diode due to its lower loss and higher isolation, potentially improving SNR. Additionally, the temperature of the AeroSwitch, while operating at 100 watts, remained consistently below 30{\deg}C, suggesting its potential as a self-temperature-regulated high-power switch. Since the AeroSwitch is non-magnetic, has high-power capability, low insertion loss, requires no electric biasing, and uses no conductive wires, this switching technique is significantly beneficial for MRI applications and medical related other RF applications.</description>

      <title>Client-Aided Secure Two-Party Computation of Dynamic Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a secure two-party computation protocol for dynamic controllers using a secret sharing scheme. The proposed protocol realizes outsourcing of controller computation to two servers, while controller parameters, states, inputs, and outputs are kept secret against the servers. Unlike previous encrypted controls in a single-server setting, the proposed method can operate a dynamic controller for an infinite time horizon without controller state decryption or input re-encryption. We show that the control performance achievable by the proposed protocol can be made arbitrarily close to that attained by the unencrypted controller. Furthermore, system-theoretic and cryptographic modifications of the protocol are presented to improve the communication complexity. The feasibility of the protocol is demonstrated through numerical examples of PID and observer-based controls.</description>

      <title>Deficient Excitation in Parameter Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates parameter learning problems under deficient excitation (DE). The DE condition is a rank-deficient, and therefore, a more general evolution of the well-known persistent excitation condition. Under the DE condition, a proposed online algorithm is able to calculate the identifiable and non-identifiable subspaces, and finally give an optimal parameter estimate in the sense of least squares. In particular, the learning error within the identifiable subspace exponentially converges to zero in the noise-free case, even without persistent excitation. The DE condition also provides a new perspective for solving distributed parameter learning problems, where the challenge is posed by local regressors that are often insufficiently excited. To improve knowledge of the unknown parameters, a cooperative learning protocol is proposed for a group of estimators that collect measured information under complementary DE conditions. This protocol allows each local estimator to operate locally in its identifiable subspace, and reach a consensus with neighbours in its non-identifiable subspace. As a result, the task of estimating unknown parameters can be achieved in a distributed way using cooperative local estimators. Application examples in system identification are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results developed in this paper.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Static Line Rating for Economic and Efficient Power Operation in South Korea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In South Korea, power grid is currently operated based on the static line rating (SLR) method, where the transmission
  line capacity is determined based on extreme weather conditions. However, with global warming, there is a concern
  that the temperatures during summer may exceed the SLR criteria, posing safety risks. On the other hand, the conservative estimates used for winter conditions limit the utilization of renewable energy. Proposals to install new lines face
  significant financial and environmental hurdles, complicating efforts to adapt to these changing conditions. Dynamic
  Line Rating (DLR) offers a real-time solution but requires extensive weather monitoring and complex integration. This
  paper proposes a novel method that improves on SLR by analyzing historical data to refine line rating criteria on a
  monthly, seasonal, and semi-annual basis. Through simulations, we show our approach significantly enhances cost effectiveness and reliability of the power system, achieving efficiencies close to DLR with existing infrastructure. This
  method offers a practical alternative to overcome the limitations of SLR and the implementation challenges of DLR.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control for Remote Patient Monitoring with Multidimensional Health States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selecting the right monitoring level in Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) systems for e-healthcare is crucial for balancing patient outcomes, various resources, and patient's quality of life. A prior work has used one-dimensional health representations, but patient health is inherently multidimensional and typically consists of many measurable physiological factors. In this paper, we introduce a multidimensional health state model within the RPM framework and use dynamic programming to study optimal monitoring strategies. Our analysis reveals that the optimal control is characterized by switching curves (for two-dimensional health states) or switching hyper-surfaces (in general): patients switch to intensive monitoring when health measurements cross a specific multidimensional surface. We further study how the optimal switching curve varies for different medical conditions and model parameters. This finding of the optimal control structure provides actionable insights for clinicians and aids in resource planning. The tunable modeling framework enhances the applicability and effectiveness of RPM services across various medical conditions.</description>

      <title>Multi-Partite Output Regulation of Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes a simple, graph-independent perspective on partitioning the node set of a graph and provides multi-agent systems (MASs) with objectives beyond cooperation and bipartition. Specifically, we first introduce the notion of $k$-partition transformation to achieve any desired partition of the nodes. Then, we use this notion to formulate the multi-partite output regulation problem (MORP) of heterogeneous linear MASs, which comprises the existing cooperative output regulation problem (CORP) and bipartite output regulation problem (BORP) as subcases. The goal of the MORP is to design a distributed control law such that each follower that belongs to the same set in the partition asymptotically tracks a predefined multiple of a reference while ensuring the internal stability of the closed-loop system. It is shown that the necessary and sufficient conditions for the solvability of the MORP with a feedforward-based distributed control law follow from the CORP and lead to the first design strategy for the control parameters. However, it has a drawback in terms of scalability due to a partition-dependent condition. We prove that this condition is implied by its partition-independent version under a mild structural condition. This implication yields the second design strategy that is much more scalable than the first one. Finally, numerical examples are provided to illustrate the generality of the MORP and compare both design strategies regarding scalability.</description>

      <title>Linear Convergence of Distributed Compressed Optimization with Equality Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the distributed strongly convex optimization problem is studied with spatio-temporal compressed communication and equality constraints. For the case where each agent holds an distributed local equality constraint, a distributed saddle-point algorithm is proposed by employing distributed filters to derive errors of the transmitted states for spatio-temporal compression purposes. It is shown that the resulting distributed compressed algorithm achieves linear convergence. Furthermore, the algorithm is generalized to the case where each agent holds a portion of the global equality constraint, i.e., the constraints across agents are coupled. By introducing an additional design freedom, the global equality constraint is shown to be equivalent to the one where each agent holds an equality constraint, for which the proposed distributed compressed saddle-point algorithm can be adapted to achieve linear convergence. Numerical simulations are adopted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Literature Review on Safety of the Intended Functionality for Automated Driving Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the automobile industry, ensuring the safety of automated vehicles equipped with the Automated Driving System (ADS) is becoming a significant focus due to the increasing development and deployment of automated driving. Automated driving depends on sensing both the external and internal environments of a vehicle, utilizing perception sensors and algorithms, and Electrical/Electronic (E/E) systems for situational awareness and response. ISO 21448 is the standard for Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF) that aims to ensure that the ADS operate safely within their intended functionality. SOTIF focuses on preventing or mitigating potential hazards that may arise from the limitations or failures of the ADS, including hazards due to insufficiencies of specification, or performance insufficiencies, as well as foreseeable misuse of the intended functionality. However, the challenge lies in ensuring the safety of vehicles despite the limited availability of extensive and systematic literature on SOTIF. To address this challenge, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on SOTIF for the ADS is performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The objective is to methodically gather and analyze the existing literature on SOTIF. The major contributions of this paper are: (i) presenting a summary of the literature by synthesizing and organizing the collective findings, methodologies, and insights into distinct thematic groups, and (ii) summarizing and categorizing the acknowledged limitations based on data extracted from an SLR of 51 research papers published between 2018 and 2023. Furthermore, research gaps are determined, and future research directions are proposed.</description>

      <title>Goal-Oriented Interference Coordination in 6G In-Factory Subnetworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subnetworks are expected to enhance wireless pervasiveness for critical applications such as wireless control of plants, however, they are interference-limited due to their extreme density. This paper proposes a goal-oriented joint power and multiple sub-bands allocation policy for interference coordination in 6G in-factory subnetworks. Current methods for interference coordination in subnetworks only focus on optimizing communication metrics, such as the block error rate, without considering the goal of the controlled plants. This oversight often leads to inefficient allocation of the limited radio resources. To address this, we devise a novel decentralized inter-subnetwork interference coordination policy optimized using a Bayesian framework to ensure the long-term stability of the subnetwork-controlled plants. Our results show that the proposed decentralized method can support more than twice the density of subnetwork-controlled plants compared to centralized schemes that aim to minimize the block error rate while reducing execution complexity significantly.</description>

      <title>Velocity-free task-space regulator for robot manipulators with external disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of task-space robust regulation of robot manipulators subject to external disturbances. A velocity-free control law is proposed by combining the internal model principle and the passivity-based output-feedback control approach. The developed output-feedback controller ensures not only asymptotic convergence of the regulation error but also suppression of unwanted external step/sinusoidal disturbances. The potential of the proposed method lies in its simplicity, intuitively appealing, and simple gain selection criteria for synthesis of multi-joint robot manipulator control systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Overall, in any system, the proportional term, integral term, and derivative term combined to produce a fast response time, less overshoot, no oscillations, increased stability, and no steady-state errors. Eliminating the steady state errors connected to typical PID systems is crucial for achieving stability. To plot the transfer function's responses with various integrator gains for auto tuning, a MATLAB M-file was developed. Auto tuning techniques were then applied to PID systems to eliminate steady state defects. this paper analyzes and tests the improvement of PID controller over the regular P-controller taking a hand follower robot as a system example using methods with simulation and numerical analysis study.</description>

      <title>Closed-loop model-predictive wind farm flow control under time-varying inflow using FLORIDyn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wind farm flow control has been a key research focus in recent years, driven by the idea that a collectively operating wind farm can outperform individually controlled turbines. Control strategies are predominantly applied in an open-loop manner, where the current flow conditions are used to look up precomputed steady-state set points. Closed-loop control approaches, on the other hand, take measurements from the farm into account and optimize their set points online, which makes them more flexible and resilient.
  This paper introduces a closed-loop model-predictive wind farm controller using the dynamic engineering model FLORIDyn to maximize the energy generated by a ten-turbine wind farm. The framework consists of an Ensemble Kalman Filter to continuously correct the flow field estimate, as well as a novel optimization strategy. To this end the paper discusses two dynamic ways to maximize the farm energy and compares this to the current look-up table industry standard. The framework relies solely on turbine measurements without using a flow field preview. In a 3-hour case study with time-varying conditions, the derived controllers achieve an overall energy gain of 3 to 4.4 % with noise-free wind direction measurements. If disturbed and biased measurements are used, this performance decreases to 1.9 to 3 % over the greedy control baseline with the same measurements. The comparison to look-up table controllers shows that the closed-loop framework performance is more robust to disturbed measurements but can only match the performance in noise-free conditions.</description>

      <title>Efficient Sampling and Sensitivity Analysis of Rare Transient Instability Events via Subset Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assessing the risk of low-probability high-impact transient instability (TI) events is crucial for ensuring robust and stable power system operation under high uncertainty. However, direct Monte Carlo (DMC) simulation for rare TI event sampling is computationally intensive. This paper proposes a subset simulation-based method for efficient small TI probability estimation, rare TI events sampling, and subsequent sensitivity analysis. Numerical studies on the modified WSCC 9-bus system demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method over DMC. Additionally, targeted stability enhancement strategies are designed to eliminate rare TI events and enhance the system's robustness to specific transient faults.</description>

      <title>Optimal Power Management for Large-Scale Battery Energy Storage Systems via Bayesian Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale battery energy storage systems (BESS) have found ever-increasing use across industry and society to accelerate clean energy transition and improve energy supply reliability and resilience. However, their optimal power management poses significant challenges: the underlying high-dimensional nonlinear nonconvex optimization lacks computational tractability in real-world implementation, and the uncertainty of the exogenous power demand makes exact optimization difficult. This paper presents a new solution framework to address these bottlenecks. The solution pivots on introducing power-sharing ratios to specify each cell's power quota from the output power demand. To find the optimal power-sharing ratios, we formulate a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) problem to achieve power-loss-minimizing BESS operation while complying with safety, cell balancing, and power supply-demand constraints. We then propose a parameterized control policy for the power-sharing ratios, which utilizes only three parameters, to reduce the computational demand in solving the NMPC problem. This policy parameterization allows us to translate the NMPC problem into a Bayesian inference problem for the sake of 1) computational tractability, and 2) overcoming the nonconvexity of the optimization problem. We leverage the ensemble Kalman inversion technique to solve the parameter estimation problem. Concurrently, a low-level control loop is developed to seamlessly integrate our proposed approach with the BESS to ensure practical implementation. This low-level controller receives the optimal power-sharing ratios, generates output power references for the cells, and maintains a balance between power supply and demand despite uncertainty in output power. We conduct extensive simulations and experiments on a 20-cell prototype to validate the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Frequency domain identification for multivariable motion control systems: Applied to a prototype wafer stage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multivariable parametric models are essential for optimizing the performance of high-tech systems. The main objective of this paper is to develop an identification strategy that provides accurate parametric models for complex multivariable systems. To achieve this, an additive model structure is adopted, offering advantages over traditional black-box model structures when considering physical systems. The introduced method minimizes a weighted least-squares criterion and uses an iterative linear regression algorithm to solve the estimation problem, achieving local optimality upon convergence. Experimental validation is conducted on a prototype wafer-stage system, featuring a large number of spatially distributed actuators and sensors and exhibiting complex flexible dynamic behavior, to evaluate performance and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Group Sparsity Methods for Compressive Space-Frequency Channel Estimation and Spatial Equalization in Fluid Antenna System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluid Antenna System (FAS) unlocks unprecedented flexibility in wireless channel optimization through spatial reconfigurability. However, its practical deployment is hindered by the coupled challenges posed by high-dimensional channel estimation and real-time position optimization. This paper bridges wireless propagation physics with compressed sensing theory to address these challenges through three aspects. First, we establish a group-sparse recovery framework for space-frequency characteristics (SFC) in FAS, formally characterizing leakage-induced sparsity degradation from limited aperture and bandwidth as a structured group-sparsity problem. By deriving dictionary-adapted group restricted isometry property (D-GRIP), we prove tight recovery bounds for a convex $\ell_1/\ell_2$-mixed norm optimization formulation that preserves leakage-aware sparsity patterns. Second, we develop a Descending Correlation Group Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (DC-GOMP) algorithm that systematically relaxes leakage constraints to reduce subcoherence. This approach enables robust FSC recovery with accelerated convergence and superior performance compared to conventional compressive sensing methods like OMP or GOMP. Third, we formulate spatial equalization (SE) as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, ensuring optimality through the branch-and-bound method. To achieve real-time implementability while maintaining near-optimal performance, we complement this with a greedy algorithm.
  Simulation results demonstrate the proposed channel estimation algorithm effectively resolves energy misallocation and enables recovery of weak details, achieving superior recovery accuracy and convergence rate. The SE framework suppresses deep fading phenomena and reduces hardware deployment overhead while maintaining equivalent link reliability.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Multi-Task Temporal Difference Learning under Low-Rank Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study policy evaluation problems in multi-task reinforcement learning (RL) under a low-rank representation setting. In this setting, we are given $N$ learning tasks where the corresponding value function of these tasks lie in an $r$-dimensional subspace, with $r&lt;N$. One can apply the classic temporal-difference (TD) learning method for solving these problems where this method learns the value function of each task independently. In this paper, we are interested in understanding whether one can exploit the low-rank structure of the multi-task setting to accelerate the performance of TD learning. To answer this question, we propose a new variant of TD learning method, where we integrate the so-called truncated singular value decomposition step into the update of TD learning. This additional step will enable TD learning to exploit the dominant directions due to the low rank structure to update the iterates, therefore, improving its performance. Our empirical results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the classic TD learning, where the performance gap increases as the rank $r$ decreases.
  From the theoretical point of view, introducing the truncated singular value decomposition step into TD learning might cause an instability on the updates. We provide a theoretical result showing that the instability does not happen. Specifically, we prove that the proposed method converges at a rate $\mathcal{O}(\frac{\ln(t)}{t})$, where $t$ is the number of iterations. This rate matches that of the standard TD learning.</description>

      <title>Active Alignments of Lens Systems with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aligning a lens system relative to an imager is a critical challenge in camera manufacturing. While optimal alignment can be mathematically computed under ideal conditions, real-world deviations caused by manufacturing tolerances often render this approach impractical. Measuring these tolerances can be costly or even infeasible, and neglecting them may result in suboptimal alignments. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that learns exclusively in the pixel space of the sensor output, eliminating the need to develop expert-designed alignment concepts. We conduct an extensive benchmark study and show that our approach surpasses other methods in speed, precision, and robustness. We further introduce relign, a realistic, freely explorable, open-source simulation utilizing physically based rendering that models optical systems with non-deterministic manufacturing tolerances and noise in robotic alignment movement. It provides an interface to popular machine learning frameworks, enabling seamless experimentation and development. Our work highlights the potential of RL in a manufacturing environment to enhance efficiency of optical alignments while minimizing the need for manual intervention.</description>

      <title>CorrA: Leveraging Large Language Models for Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance of Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present Corridor-Agent (CorrA), a framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with model predictive control (MPC) to address the challenges of dynamic obstacle avoidance in autonomous vehicles. Our approach leverages LLM reasoning ability to generate appropriate parameters for sigmoid-based boundary functions that define safe corridors around obstacles, effectively reducing the state-space of the controlled vehicle. The proposed framework adjusts these boundaries dynamically based on real-time vehicle data that guarantees collision-free trajectories while also ensuring both computational efficiency and trajectory optimality. The problem is formulated as an optimal control problem and solved with differential dynamic programming (DDP) for constrained optimization, and the proposed approach is embedded within an MPC framework. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior performance in maintaining safety and efficiency in complex, dynamic environments compared to a baseline MPC approach.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Representation in a SOTIF-Related Use Case with Dempster-Shafer Theory for LiDAR Sensor-Based Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty in LiDAR sensor-based object detection arises from environmental variability and sensor performance limitations. Representing these uncertainties is essential for ensuring the Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF), which focuses on preventing hazards in automated driving scenarios. This paper presents a systematic approach to identifying, classifying, and representing uncertainties in LiDAR-based object detection within a SOTIF-related scenario. Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) is employed to construct a Frame of Discernment (FoD) to represent detection outcomes. Conditional Basic Probability Assignments (BPAs) are applied based on dependencies among identified uncertainty sources. Yager's Rule of Combination is used to resolve conflicting evidence from multiple sources, providing a structured framework to evaluate uncertainties' effects on detection accuracy. The study applies variance-based sensitivity analysis (VBSA) to quantify and prioritize uncertainties, detailing their specific impact on detection performance.</description>

      <title>Distributed and Localized Covariance Control of Coupled Systems: A System Level Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is concerned with the finite-horizon optimal covariance steering of networked systems governed by discrete-time stochastic linear dynamics. In contrast with existing work that has only considered systems with dynamically decoupled agents, we consider a dynamically coupled system composed of interconnected subsystems subject to local communication constraints. In particular, we propose a distributed algorithm to compute the localized optimal feedback control policy for each individual subsystem, which depends only on the local state histories of its neighboring subsystems. Utilizing the system-level synthesis (SLS) framework, we first recast the localized covariance steering problem as a convex SLS problem with locality constraints. Subsequently, exploiting its partially separable structure, we decompose the latter problem into smaller subproblems, introducing a transformation to deal with nonseparable instances. Finally, we employ a variation of the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to distribute computation across subsystems on account of their local information and communication constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm on a power system with 36 interconnected subsystems.</description>

      <title>Passive Reactance Compensation for Shape-Reconfigurable Wireless Power Transfer Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The powering range of wireless power transfer (WPT) systems is typically confined to areas close to the transmitter. Shape-reconfigurable two-dimensional (2-D) relay resonator arrays have been developed to extend this range, offering greater deployment flexibility. However, these arrays encounter challenges due to cross-coupling among adjacent resonators, which detune system impedance and create power dead zones. This issue often necessitates active components such as receiver position tracking, increasing system overhead. This study introduces a passive reactance compensation mechanism that counteracts detuning effects, enabling the simultaneous activation of all resonators at a fixed operating frequency, regardless of the array's shape, thus providing a consistent charging area. The key innovation involves mechanically appending reactance elements to neutralize detuning caused by inductive coupling, facilitating hassle-free resonator reconfiguration without requiring prior knowledge. Our experiments demonstrate the elimination of dead zones with multiple configurations, boosting the minimum power transfer efficiency from 3.0% to 56.8%.</description>

      <title>ForaNav: Insect-inspired Online Target-oriented Navigation for MAVs in Tree Plantations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) are becoming essential in precision agriculture to enhance efficiency and reduce labor costs through targeted, real-time operations. However, existing unmanned systems often rely on GPS-based navigation, which is prone to inaccuracies in rural areas and limits flight paths to predefined routes, resulting in operational inefficiencies. To address these challenges, this paper presents ForaNav, an insect-inspired navigation strategy for autonomous navigation in plantations. The proposed method employs an enhanced Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG)-based tree detection approach, integrating hue-saturation histograms and global HOG feature variance with hierarchical HOG extraction to distinguish oil palm trees from visually similar objects. Inspired by insect foraging behavior, the MAV dynamically adjusts its path based on detected trees and employs a recovery mechanism to stay on course if a target is temporarily lost. We demonstrate that our detection method generalizes well to different tree types while maintaining lower CPU usage, lower temperature, and higher FPS than lightweight deep learning models, making it well-suited for real-time applications. Flight test results across diverse real-world scenarios show that the MAV successfully detects and approaches all trees without prior tree location, validating its effectiveness for agricultural automation.</description>

      <title>RGBSQGrasp: Inferring Local Superquadric Primitives from Single RGB Image for Graspability-Aware Bin Picking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bin picking is a challenging robotic task due to occlusions and physical constraints that limit visual information for object recognition and grasping. Existing approaches often rely on known CAD models or prior object geometries, restricting generalization to novel or unknown objects. Other methods directly regress grasp poses from RGB-D data without object priors, but the inherent noise in depth sensing and the lack of object understanding make grasp synthesis and evaluation more difficult. Superquadrics (SQ) offer a compact, interpretable shape representation that captures the physical and graspability understanding of objects. However, recovering them from limited viewpoints is challenging, as existing methods rely on multiple perspectives for near-complete point cloud reconstruction, limiting their effectiveness in bin-picking. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{RGBSQGrasp}, a grasping framework that leverages superquadric shape primitives and foundation metric depth estimation models to infer grasp poses from a monocular RGB camera -- eliminating the need for depth sensors. Our framework integrates a universal, cross-platform dataset generation pipeline, a foundation model-based object point cloud estimation module, a global-local superquadric fitting network, and an SQ-guided grasp pose sampling module. By integrating these components, RGBSQGrasp reliably infers grasp poses through geometric reasoning, enhancing grasp stability and adaptability to unseen objects. Real-world robotic experiments demonstrate a 92\% grasp success rate, highlighting the effectiveness of RGBSQGrasp in packed bin-picking environments.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Passive Fault-Tolerant Control of a Quadrotor with Rotor Failure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a learning-based passive fault-tolerant control (PFTC) method for quadrotor capable of handling arbitrary single-rotor failures, including conditions ranging from fault-free to complete rotor failure, without requiring any rotor fault information or controller switching. Unlike existing methods that treat rotor faults as disturbances and rely on a single controller for multiple fault scenarios, our approach introduces a novel Selector-Controller network structure. This architecture integrates fault detection module and the controller into a unified policy network, effectively combining the adaptability to multiple fault scenarios of PFTC with the superior control performance of active fault-tolerant control (AFTC). To optimize performance, the policy network is trained using a hybrid framework that synergizes reinforcement learning (RL), behavior cloning (BC), and supervised learning with fault information. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments validate the proposed method, demonstrating significant improvements in fault response speed and position tracking performance compared to state-of-the-art PFTC and AFTC approaches.</description>

      <title>Scalable Multi-Robot Task Allocation and Coordination under Signal Temporal Logic Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motion planning with simple objectives, such as collision-avoidance and goal-reaching, can be solved efficiently using modern planners. However, the complexity of the allowed tasks for these planners is limited. On the other hand, signal temporal logic (STL) can specify complex requirements, but STL-based motion planning and control algorithms often face scalability issues, especially in large multi-robot systems with complex dynamics. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that leverages the best of the two worlds. We first use a single-robot motion planner to efficiently generate a set of alternative reference paths for each robot. Then coordination requirements are specified using STL, which is defined over the assignment of paths and robots' progress along those paths. We use a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) to compute task assignments and robot progress targets over time such that the STL specification is satisfied. Finally, a local controller is used to track the target progress. Simulations demonstrate that our method can handle tasks with complex constraints and scales to large multi-robot teams and intricate task allocation scenarios.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks for Fast Contingency Analysis of Power Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04213v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The successful integration of machine learning models into decision support tools for grid operation hinges on effectively capturing the topological changes in daily operations. Frequent grid reconfigurations and N-k security analyses have to be conducted to ensure a reliable and secure power grid, leading to a vast combinatorial space of possible topologies and operating states. This combinatorial complexity, which increases with grid size, poses a significant computational challenge for traditional solvers. In this paper, we combine Physics-Informed Neural Networks with graph-aware neural network architectures, i.e., a Guided-Dropout (GD) and an Edge-Varying Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture to learn the set points for a grid that considers all probable single-line reconfigurations (all critical N-1 scenarios) and subsequently apply the trained models to N-k scenarios. We demonstrate how incorporating the underlying physical equations for the network equations within the training procedure of the GD and the GNN architectures performs with N-1, N-2, and N-3 case studies. Using the AC Power Flow as a guiding application, we test our methods on the 6-bus, 24-bus, 57-bus, and 118-bus systems. We find that GNN not only achieves the task of contingency screening with satisfactory accuracy but does this up to 400 times faster than the Newton-Raphson power flow solver. Moreover, our results provide a comparison of the GD and GNN models in terms of accuracy and computational speed and provide recommendations on their adoption for contingency analysis of power systems.</description>

      <title>Learning a convex cost-to-go for single step model predictive control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02650v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For large uncertain systems, solving model predictive control problems online can be computationally taxing. Using a shorter prediction horizon can help, but may lead to poor performance and instability without appropriate modifications. This work focuses on learning convex objective terms to enable a single-step control horizon, reducing online computational costs. We consider two surrogates for approximating the cost-to-go: (1) a convex interpolating function and (2) an input-convex neural network. Regardless of the surrogate choice, its behavior near the origin and its ability to describe the feasible region are crucial for the closed-loop performance of the new MPC problem. We address this by tailoring the surrogate to ensure good performance in both aspects. We conclude with numerical examples, in which we compare the convex surrogates to using a standard neural network in the objective, solely using an LQR cost-to-go, and to using a neural network to learn a control policy. The proposed approaches are shown to achieve better performance with less data.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Multi-Target Tracking in Dynamic Environments: Distributed Flooding Control in the Random Finite Set Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tracking multiple targets in dynamic environments using distributed sensor networks is a challenging problem for situational awareness in connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs). In such scenarios, the network of mobile sensors must coordinate their actions to accurately estimate the locations and trajectories of multiple targets, balancing limited computation and communication resources with multi-target tracking accuracy. Multi-sensor control methods can improve the performance of these networks by enabling efficient utilization of resources and enhancing the accuracy of the estimated target states. This paper proposes a novel multi-sensor control method that utilizes flooding-based communication to address this problem, ensuring distributed consensus of optimal sensor actions throughout the sensor network. Our method improves computational tractability and enables fully distributed control, ensuring the scalability and flexibility necessary for real-time CAV applications. Experimental results on several challenging multi-target tracking scenarios demonstrate that our approach significantly improves both multi-target tracking accuracy and computation time over competing methods.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Control Koopman Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07312v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel Koopman (composition) operator representation framework for control systems in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) that is free of explicit dictionary or input parametrizations. By establishing fundamental equivalences between different model representations, we are able to close the gap of control system operator learning and infinite-dimensional regression, enabling various empirical estimators and the connection to well-understood learning theory in RKHSs under one unified framework. As a consequence, our proposed framework allows for arbitrary accurate finite-rank approximations in infinite-dimensional spaces and leads to finite-dimensional predictors without apriori restrictions to a finite span of functions or inputs. To enable applications to high-dimensional control systems, we improve the scalability of our proposed control Koopman operator estimates by utilizing sketching techniques. Numerical experiments demonstrate superior prediction accuracy compared to bilinear EDMD, especially in high dimensions. Finally, we show that our learned models are readily interfaced with linear-parameter-varying techniques for model predictive control.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of Gradient Flow for Overparameterized LQR Formulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the growing use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools in control design, this paper analyses the intersection between results from gradient methods for the model-free linear quadratic regulator (LQR), and linear feedforward neural networks (LFFNNs), More specifically, it looks into the case where one wants to find a LFFNN feedback that minimizes a LQR cost. This paper starts by analyzing the structure of the gradient expression for the parameters of each layer, which implies a key conservation law of the system. This conservation law is then leveraged to generalize existing results on boundedness and global convergence of solutions to critical points, and invariance of the set of stabilizing networks under the training dynamics. This is followed by an analysis of the case where the LFFNN has a single hidden layer, for which the paper proves that the training converges not only to the critical points, but to the optimal feedback control law for all but a set of Lebesgue measure zero of the initializations. These theoretical results are followed by an extensive analysis of a simple version of the problem -- the ``vector case'' -- proving the theoretical properties of accelerated convergence and small-input input-to-state stability (ISS) for this simpler example. Finally, the paper presents numerical evidence of faster convergence of the training of general LFFNNs when compared to non-overparameterized formulations, showing that the acceleration of the solution is observable even when the gradient is not explicitly computed, but estimated from evaluations of the cost function.</description>

Abstract: Increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events motivates the assessment of power system resilience. The random nature of power system failures during these events mandates probabilistic resilience assessment, but state-of-the-art methods are computationally inefficient. In this paper, an enhanced PCE method to quantify power system resilience based on the extended AC Cascading Failure Model (AC-CFM) model is proposed. To address repeatability issues arising from PCE computation with different sample sets, we propose a novel experiment design method. Numerical studies on the IEEE 39-bus system illustrate the improved repeatability and convergence of the method. The enhanced PCE method is then used to efficiently assess the system's resilience and propose adaptation measures.</description>

Abstract: Dynamic Programming suffers from the curse of dimensionality due to large state and action spaces, a challenge further compounded by uncertainties in the environment. To mitigate these issue, we explore an off-policy based Temporal Difference Approximate Dynamic Programming approach that preserves contraction mapping when projecting the problem into a subspace of selected features, accounting for the probability distribution of the perturbed transition probability matrix. We further demonstrate how this Approximate Dynamic Programming approach can be implemented as a particular variant of the Temporal Difference learning algorithm, adapted for handling perturbations. To validate our theoretical findings, we provide a numerical example using a Markov Decision Process corresponding to a resource allocation problem.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Parameter Estimation for Electrochemical Battery Model: A Comparative Analysis of Operating Profiles on Computational Efficiency and Accuracy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parameter estimation in electrochemical models remains a significant challenge in their application. This study investigates the impact of different operating profiles on electrochemical model parameter estimation to identify the optimal conditions. In particular, the present study is focused on Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxide(NMC) lithium-ion batteries. Based on five fundamental current profiles (C/5, C/2, 1C, Pulse, DST), 31 combinations of conditions were generated and used for parameter estimation and validation, resulting in 961 evaluation outcomes. The Particle Swarm Optimization is employed for parameter identification in electrochemical models, specifically using the Single Particle Model (SPM). The analysis considered three dimensions: model voltage output error, parameter estimation error, and time cost. Results show that using all five profiles (C/5, C/2, 1C, Pulse, DST) minimizes voltage output error, while {C/5, C/2, Pulse, DST} minimizes parameter estimation error. The shortest time cost is achieved with {1C}. When considering both model voltage output and parameter errors, {C/5, C/2, 1C, DST} is optimal. For minimizing model voltage output error and time cost, {C/2, 1C} is best, while {1C} is ideal for parameter error and time cost. The comprehensive optimal condition is {C/5, C/2, 1C, DST}. These findings provide guidance for selecting current conditions tailored to specific needs.</description>

      <title>Graph-Based Dynamics and Network Control of a Single Articulated Robotic System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extensive research on graph-based dynamics and control of multi-agent systems has successfully demonstrated control of robotic swarms, where each robot is perceived as an independent agent virtually connected by a network topology. The strong advantage of the network control structure lies in the decentralized nature of the control action, which only requires the knowledge of virtually connected agents. In this paper, we seek to expand the ideas of virtual network constraints to physical constraints on a class of tree-structured robots which we denote as single articulated robotic (SAR) systems. In our proposed framework, each link can be viewed as an agent, and each holonomic constraint connecting links serves as an edge. By following the first principles of Lagrangian dynamics, we derive a consensus-like matrix-differential equation with weighted graph and edge Laplacians for the dynamics of a SAR system. The sufficient condition for the holonomic constraint forces becoming independent to the control inputs is derived. This condition leads to a decentralized leader-follower network control framework for regulating the relative configuration of the robot. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method.</description>

Abstract: Pose estimation is a crucial problem in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). However, developing a robust and consistent state estimator remains a significant challenge, as the traditional extended Kalman filter (EKF) struggles to handle the model nonlinearity, especially for inertial measurement unit (IMU) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR). To provide a consistent and efficient solution of pose estimation, we propose Eq-LIO, a robust state estimator for tightly coupled LIO systems based on an equivariant filter (EqF). Compared with the invariant Kalman filter based on the $\SE_2(3)$ group structure, the EqF uses the symmetry of the semi-direct product group to couple the system state including IMU bias, navigation state and LiDAR extrinsic calibration state, thereby suppressing linearization error and improving the behavior of the estimator in the event of unexpected state changes. The proposed Eq-LIO owns natural consistency and higher robustness, which is theoretically proven with mathematical derivation and experimentally verified through a series of tests on both public and private datasets.</description>

      <title>Learning to Refine Input Constrained Control Barrier Functions via Uncertainty-Aware Online Parameter Adaptation</title>

Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have become powerful tools for ensuring safety in nonlinear systems. However, finding valid CBFs that guarantee persistent safety and feasibility remains an open challenge, especially in systems with input constraints. Traditional approaches often rely on manually tuning the parameters of the class K functions of the CBF conditions a priori. The performance of CBF-based controllers is highly sensitive to these fixed parameters, potentially leading to overly conservative behavior or safety violations. To overcome these issues, this paper introduces a learning-based optimal control framework for online adaptation of Input Constrained CBF (ICCBF) parameters in discrete-time nonlinear systems. Our method employs a probabilistic ensemble neural network to predict the performance and risk metrics, as defined in this work, for candidate parameters, accounting for both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. We propose a two-step verification process using Jensen-Renyi Divergence and distributionally-robust Conditional Value at Risk to identify valid parameters. This enables dynamic refinement of ICCBF parameters based on current state and nearby environments, optimizing performance while ensuring safety within the verified parameter set. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms both fixed-parameter and existing adaptive methods in robot navigation scenarios across safety and performance metrics.</description>

      <title>CalibRefine: Deep Learning-Based Online Automatic Targetless LiDAR-Camera Calibration with Iterative and Attention-Driven Post-Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17648</link>

Abstract: Accurate multi-sensor calibration is essential for deploying robust perception systems in applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and intelligent transportation. Existing LiDAR-camera calibration methods often rely on manually placed targets, preliminary parameter estimates, or intensive data preprocessing, limiting their scalability and adaptability in real-world settings. In this work, we propose a fully automatic, targetless, and online calibration framework, CalibRefine, which directly processes raw LiDAR point clouds and camera images. Our approach is divided into four stages: (1) a Common Feature Discriminator that trains on automatically detected objects--using relative positions, appearance embeddings, and semantic classes--to generate reliable LiDAR-camera correspondences, (2) a coarse homography-based calibration, (3) an iterative refinement to incrementally improve alignment as additional data frames become available, and (4) an attention-based refinement that addresses non-planar distortions by leveraging a Vision Transformer and cross-attention mechanisms. Through extensive experiments on two urban traffic datasets, we show that CalibRefine delivers high-precision calibration results with minimal human involvement, outperforming state-of-the-art targetless methods and remaining competitive with, or surpassing, manually tuned baselines. Our findings highlight how robust object-level feature matching, together with iterative and self-supervised attention-based adjustments, enables consistent sensor fusion in complex, real-world conditions without requiring ground-truth calibration matrices or elaborate data preprocessing.</description>

      <title>Night-Voyager: Consistent and Efficient Nocturnal Vision-Aided State Estimation in Object Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate and robust state estimation at nighttime is essential for autonomous robotic navigation to achieve nocturnal or round-the-clock tasks. An intuitive question arises: Can low-cost standard cameras be exploited for nocturnal state estimation? Regrettably, most existing visual methods may fail under adverse illumination conditions, even with active lighting or image enhancement. A pivotal insight, however, is that streetlights in most urban scenarios act as stable and salient prior visual cues at night, reminiscent of stars in deep space aiding spacecraft voyage in interstellar navigation. Inspired by this, we propose Night-Voyager, an object-level nocturnal vision-aided state estimation framework that leverages prior object maps and keypoints for versatile localization. We also find that the primary limitation of conventional visual methods under poor lighting conditions stems from the reliance on pixel-level metrics. In contrast, metric-agnostic, non-pixel-level object detection serves as a bridge between pixel-level and object-level spaces, enabling effective propagation and utilization of object map information within the system. Night-Voyager begins with a fast initialization to solve the global localization problem. By employing an effective two-stage cross-modal data association, the system delivers globally consistent state updates using map-based observations. To address the challenge of significant uncertainties in visual observations at night, a novel matrix Lie group formulation and a feature-decoupled multi-state invariant filter are introduced, ensuring consistent and efficient estimation. Through comprehensive experiments in both simulation and diverse real-world scenarios (spanning approximately 12.3 km), Night-Voyager showcases its efficacy, robustness, and efficiency, filling a critical gap in nocturnal vision-aided state estimation.</description>
