      <title>Theorems and Conjectures on an Arithmetic Sum Associated with the Classical Theta Function $\theta_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Appearing in the modular transformation formula for the classical theta function $\theta_3(z)$ is the sum $S(h,k):=\sum_{j=1}^{k-1}(-1)^{j+1+[hj/k]}$, which is an analogue of the classical Dedekind sum $s(h,k).$ We establish several properties for $S(h,k)$ and $S(k) := \sum_{h=1}^{k-1}S(h,k).$ Several conjectures about the values of $S(k)$ are given.</description>

      <title>The arithmetic of critical values I: equicritical quartic polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A polynomial $f$ of degree $d$ and coefficients in an algebraically closed field $k$ defines a morphism $f:\mathbb{P}^1_k\longrightarrow\mathbb{P}^1_k$ which, if char$(k)\nmid d$, is unramified outside a finite set of points in the image: the critical values of $f$. In this work we establish a rigorous framework for the study of their arithmetic, which we carry out for $d=4$ and $k=\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$, uncovering a connection to the arithmetic of elliptic curves. Recent progress in the theory of Weyl sums has sparked some interest in finding pairs of polynomials having the same critical values for "nontrivial" reasons: building on our analysis, we provide a complete classification of such pairs in the case of quartics over number fields.</description>

      <title>Some zero-sum problems over $\langle x,y \mid x^2 = y^{n/2}, y^n = 1, yx = xy^s \rangle$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n \ge 8$ be even, and let $G = \langle x, y \mid x^2 = y^{n/2}, y^n = 1, yx = xy^s \rangle$, where $s^2 \equiv 1 \pmod n$ and $s \not\equiv \pm1 \pmod n$. In this paper, we provide the precise values of some zero-sum constants over $G$, namely the small Davenport constant, $\eta$-constant, Gao constant, and Erd\H os-Ginzburg-Ziv constant. In particular, the Gao's and Zhuang-Gao's Conjectures hold for $G$. We also solve the associated inverse problems when $n \equiv 0 \pmod 4$.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic genus inequalities with an application to sums of squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show variants of the genus inequality for the irreducible components of the special fiber of an arithmetic curve over a henselian discrete valuation ring of residue characteristic zero that take into account the non-existence of rational, respectively real points on the the components. We then apply this inequality to obtain the bound $2^{ng}$ (respectively $2^{n(g+1)}$) on the totally positive sum-of-two-squares index in the function field of a curve of genus $g$ over the field of $n$-fold iterated real Laurent series with (respectively without) real points. The bound $2^{n(g+1)}$ had been previously known only for hyperelliptic curves.</description>

      <title>Fibonacci Numbers as Sums of Consecutive Terms in $k$-Generalized Fibonacci Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let (F_n^{(k)})_{n\geq -(k-2)} be the k-generalized Fibonacci sequence, defined as the linear recurrence sequence whose first k terms are \(0, 0, \ldots, 0, 1\), and whose subsequent terms are determined by the sum of the preceding k terms. This article is devoted to investigating when the sum of consecutive numbers in the k-generalized Fibonacci sequence belongs to the Fibonacci sequence. Namely, given d,k \in \N, with k \geq 3, our main theorem states that there are at most finitely many n \in \N such that F_n^{(k)} + \cdots + F_{n+d}^{(k)} is a Fibonacci number. In particular, the intersection between the Fibonacci sequence and the k-generalized Fibonacci sequence is finite.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Caro and Pasten gave an explicit upper bound on the number of rational points on a hyperbolic surface that is embedded in an abelian variety of rank at most one. We show how to use their method to produce a refined bound on the number of rational points on the surface $W_2 := C+C$ in the case of a hyperelliptic curve $C$ of genus $3$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. Combining this with work of Siksek, we use this to determine $W_2(\mathbb{Q})$ in a selection of examples.</description>

      <title>The Multiple Equal-Difference Structure of Cyclotomic Cosets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the definition of equal-difference cyclotomic coset, and prove that in general any cyclotomic coset can be decomposed into a disjoint union of equal-difference subsets. Among the equal-difference decompositions of a cyclotomic coset, an important class consists of those in the form of cyclotomic decompositions, called the multiple equal-difference representations of the coset. There is an equivalent correspondence between the multiple equal-difference representations of $q$-cyclotomic cosets modulo $n$ and the irreducible factorizations of $X^{n}-1$ in binomial form over finite extension fields of $\mathbb{F}_{q}$. We give an explicit characterization of the multiple equal-difference representations of any $q$-cyclotomic coset modulo $n$, through which a criterion for $X^{n}-1$ factoring into irreducible binomials is obtained. In addition, we represent an algorithm to simplify the computation of the leaders of cyclotomic cosets.</description>

      <title>Eisenstein Cohomology and Critical Values of Certain $L$-Functions: The Case $G_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish results on the rationality of ratios of successive critical values of Langlands-Shahidi $L$-functions, as they appear in the constant term of the Eisenstein series associated with the exceptional group of type $G_2$ over a totally imaginary number field. Furthermore, we prove the rationality of the critical values for each $L$-function in the products, such as the symmetric cube $L$-functions. Our method generalizes the Harder-Raghuram method to cases where multiple $L$-functions appear in the constant term and involve an exceptional group. Finally, our results on the automorphic version of Deligne's conjecture align with its motivic counterpart, as demonstrated in the recent work of Deligne and Raghuram.</description>

      <title>Approximations by special values of multiple cosine and sine functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kurokawa and Koyama's multiple cosine function $\mathcal{C}_{r}(x)$ and Kurokawa's multiple cosine function $S_{r}(x)$ are generalizations of the classical cosine and sine functions from their infinite product representations, respectively. For any fixed $x\in[0,\frac{1}{2})$, let
  $$B=\left\{\frac{\log\mathcal{C}_{r}(x)}{\pi}~~\bigg|~~r=1,2,3,\ldots\right\}$$
  and $$C=\left\{\frac{\log S_r(x)}{\pi}~~\bigg|~~r=1,2,3,\ldots\right\}$$
  be the sets of special values of $\mathcal{C}_{r}(x)$ and $S_{r}(x)$ at $x$, respectively.
  In this paper, we will show that the real numbers can be strongly approximated by linear combinations of elements in $B$ and $C$ respectively, with rational coefficients. Furthermore, let $$D=\left\{\frac{\zeta_{E}(3)}{\pi^2},\frac{\zeta_{E}(5)}{\pi^4}, \ldots, \frac{\zeta_{E}(2k+1)}{\pi^{2k}},\ldots; \frac{\beta(4)}{\pi^3},\frac{\beta(6)}{\pi^5}, \ldots, \frac{\beta(2k+2)}{\pi^{2k+1}},\ldots\right\}$$ be the set of special values of Dirichlet's eta and beta functions. We will prove that the set $D$ has a similar approximation property, where the coefficients are values of the derivatives of rational polynomials. Our approaches are inspired by recent works of Alkan (Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 143: 3743--3752, 2015) and Lupu-Wu (J. Math. Anal. Appl. 545: Article ID 129144, 2025) as applications of the trigonometric integrals.</description>

      <title>Finite length for unramified $\mathrm{GL}_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime number and $K$ a finite unramified extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$. If $p$ is large enough with respect to $[K:\mathbb{Q}_p]$ and under mild genericity assumptions, we prove that the admissible smooth representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(K)$ that occur in Hecke eigenspaces of the mod $p$ cohomology are of finite length. We also prove many new structural results about these representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(K)$ and their subquotients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to generalize Rubin's theorem on values of Katz's $p$-adic $L$-function outside the range of interpolation from the case of Hecke characters of CM elliptic curves to more general self-dual algebraic Hecke characters. We follow the approach by Bertolini-Darmon-Prasanna, based on generalized Heegner cycles, which we extend from characters of imaginary quadratic fields of infinity type $(1,0)$ to characters of infinity type $(1+\ell,-\ell)$ for an integer $\ell\geq0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We enhance an isogeny graph of elliptic curves by incorporating level structures defined by bases of the kernels of iterates of the Verschiebung map. We extend several previous results on isogeny graphs with level structures defined by geometric points to these graphs. Firstly, we prove that these graphs form $\mathbb{Z}_p$-towers of graph coverings as the power of the Verschiebung map varies. Secondly, we prove that the connected components of these graphs display a volcanic structure.</description>

      <title>A Constructive Approach to Zauner's Conjecture via the Stark Conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a construction of $d^2$ complex equiangular lines in $\mathbb{C}^d$, also known as SICPOVMs, which were conjectured by Zauner to exist for all d. The construction gives a putatively complete list of SICs with Weyl-Heisenberg symmetry in all dimensions d &gt; 3. Specifically, we give an explicit expression for an object that we call a ghost SIC, which is constructed from the real multiplication values of a special function and which is Galois conjugate to a SIC. The special function, the Shintani-Faddeev modular cocycle, is a tuple of meromorphic functions indexed by a congruence subgroup of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$. We prove that our construction gives a valid SIC in every case assuming two conjectures: the order 1 abelian Stark conjecture for real quadratic fields and a special value identity for the Shintani-Faddeev modular cocycle. The former allows us to prove that the ghost and the SIC are Galois conjugate over an extension of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{\Delta})$ where $\Delta = (d+1)(d-3)$, while the latter allows us to prove idempotency of the presumptive fiducial projector. We provide computational tests of our SIC construction by cross-validating it with known exact solutions, with the numerical work of Scott and Grassl, and by constructing four numerical examples of inequivalent SICs in d=100, three of which are new. We further consider rank-r generalizations called r-SICs given by equichordal configurations of r-dimensional complex subspaces. We give similar conditional constructions for r-SICs for all r, d such that r(d-r) divides $(d^2-1)$. Finally, we study the structure of the field extensions conjecturally generated by the r-SICs. If $K$ is any real quadratic field, then either every abelian Galois extension of $K$, or else every abelian extension for which 2 is unramified, is generated by our construction; the former holds for a positive density of field discriminants.</description>

      <title>Characterizing perfectoid covers of abelian varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a simple characterization of all perfectoid profinite \'{e}tale covers of abelian varieties in terms of the Hodge-Tate filtration on the $p$-adic Tate module. We also compute the geometric Sen morphism for all profinite $p$-adic Lie torsors over an abelian variety, and combine this with our characterization to prove a conjecture of Rodr\'{i}guez Camargo on perfectoidness of $p$-adic Lie torsors in this case. We obtain complementary results for covers of semi-abeloid varieties, $p$-divisible rigid analytic groups, and varieties with globally generated 1-forms. Our proof of perfectoidness for covers of abelian varieties is based on results of Scholze on the canonical subgroup and holds for an arbitrary abelian variety over an algebraically closed non-archimedean extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$. In an appendix authored by Tongmu He, an alternate proof is presented in the case of abelian varieties that can be defined over a discretely valued subfield by combining our computation of the geometric Sen morphism with previous pointwise perfectoidness and purity of perfectoidness results of He.</description>

      <title>Do perfect powers repel partition numbers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2013 Zhi-Wei Sun conjectured that $p(n)$ is never a power of an integer when $n&gt;1.$ We confirm this claim in many cases. We also observe that integral powers appear to repel the partition numbers. If $k&gt;1$ and $\Delta_k(n)$ is the distance between $p(n)$ and the nearest $k$th power, then for every $d\geq 0$ we conjecture that there are at most finitely many $n$ for which $\Delta_k(n)\leq d.$ More precisely, for every $\varepsilon&gt;0,$ we conjecture that $$M_k(d):=\max\{n \ : \ \Delta_k(n)\leq d\}=o( d^{\varepsilon}).$$ In $k$-power aspect with $d$ fixed, we also conjecture that if $k$ is sufficiently large, then $$ M_k(d)=\max \left\{ n \ : \ p(n)-1\leq d\right\}. $$ In other words, $1$ generally appears to be the closest $k$th power among the partition numbers.</description>

      <title>Dirichlet dynamical zeta function for billiard flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Dirichlet dynamical zeta function $\eta_D(s)$ for billiard flow corresponding to several strictly convex disjoint obstacles. For large ${\rm Re}\: s$ we have $\eta_D(s) =\sum_{n= 1}^{\infty} a_n e^{-\lambda_n s}, \: a_n \in \mathbb R$ and $\eta_D$ admits a meromorphic continuation to $\mathbb C$. We obtain some conditions of the frequencies $\lambda_n$ and some sums of coefficients $a_n$ which imply that $\eta_D$ cannot be prolonged as entire function.</description>

      <title>Modular Features of Superstring Scattering Amplitudes: Generalised Eisenstein Series and Theta Lifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In previous papers it has been shown that the coefficients of terms in the large-$N$ expansion of a certain integrated four-point correlator of superconformal primary operators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory are rational sums of real-analytic Eisenstein series and "generalised Eisenstein series''. The latter are novel modular functions first encountered in the context of graviton amplitudes in type IIB superstring theory. Similar modular functions, known as two-loop modular graph functions, are also encountered in the low-energy expansion of the integrand of genus-one closed superstring amplitudes. In this paper we further develop the mathematical structure of such generalised Eisenstein series emphasising, in particular, the occurrence of $L$-values of holomorphic cusp forms in their Fourier mode decomposition. We show that both the coefficients in the large-$N$ expansion of the integrated correlator and two-loop modular graph functions admit a unifying description in terms of four-dimensional lattice sums generated by theta lifts of local Maass functions, which generalise the structure of real-analytic Eisenstein series. Through the theta lift representation, we demonstrate that elements belonging to these two families of non-holomorphic modular functions can be expressed as rational linear combinations of generalised Eisenstein series for which all the $L$-values of holomorphic cusp forms precisely cancel.</description>

Abstract: Based on BONGs theory, we prove the norm principle for integral and relative integral spinor norms of quadratic forms over general dyadic local fields, respectively. By virtue of these results, we further establish the arithmetic version of Springer's theorem for indefinite quadratic forms. Moreover, we solve the lifting problems on $n$-universality over arbitrary local fields.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the first derived analytic vectors of the subring of Fontaine's period ring $\mathbf{B}_e$ stable under the kernel of the cyclotomic character are non-zero. Subsequently we compute their analytic cohomology. We also give a description of the cokernel of the restriction of a variant of the Bloch-Kato exponential map for $\mathbb{Q}_p(n)$ to analytic vectors in terms of derived analytic vectors. In order to achieve the above, we relate pro-analytic vectors with derived analytic vectors in condensed mathematics for regular LF-spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.16400v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To initiate a systematic study on the applications of perfectoid methods to Noetherian rings, we introduce the notions of perfectoid towers and their tilts. We mainly show that the tilting operation preserves several homological invariants and finiteness properties. Using this, we also provide a comparison result on \'etale cohomology groups under the tilting. As an application, we prove finiteness of the prime-to-$p$-torsion subgroup of the divisor class group of a local log-regular ring that appears in logarithmic geometry in the mixed characteristic case.</description>

      <title>Mock Modularity In CHL Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dabholkar, Murthy and Zagier (DMZ) proved that there is a canonical decomposition of a meromorphic Jacobi form of integral index for $\mathrm{SL}(2, \mathbb{Z})$ with poles on torsion points into polar and finite parts, and showed that the finite part is a mock Jacobi form. In this paper we generalize the results of DMZ to meromorphic Jacobi forms of rational index for congruence subgroups of $\mathrm{SL}(2, \mathbb{Z})$. As an application, we establish that a large class of single-centered black hole degeneracies in CHL models are given by the Fourier coefficients of mock Jacobi forms. In this process we refine the result of DMZ regarding the set of charges for which the single-centered black hole degeneracies are given by a mock modular form. In particular, in the case studied by DMZ, we present examples of charges for which the single-centered degeneracies are not captured by the mock modular form of the expected index.</description>

      <title>$p$-curvature of periodic pencils of flat connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05652v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In arXiv:2401.00636 we introduced the notion of a periodic pencil of flat connections on a smooth variety $X$. Namely, a pencil is a linear family of flat connections $\nabla(s_1,...,s_n)=d-\sum_{i=1}^r\sum_{j=1}^ns_jB_{ij}dx_i,$ where $\lbrace x_i\rbrace$ are coordinates on $X$ and $B_{ij}: X\to {\rm Mat}_N$ are matrix-valued regular functions. A pencil is periodic if it is generically invariant under the shifts $s_j\mapsto s_j+1$ up to isomorphism. In this paper we show that in characteristic $p&gt;0$, the $p$-curvature operators $\lbrace C_i,1\le i\le r\rbrace$ of a periodic pencil $\nabla$ are isospectral to the commuting endomorphisms $C_i^*:=\sum_{j=1}^n (s_j-s_j^p)B_{ij}^{(1)}$, where $B_{ij}^{(1)}$ is the Frobenius twist of $B_{ij}$. Using the results of arXiv:2401.00636, this allows us to compute the eigenvalues of the $p$-curvature for many important examples of pencils of flat connections, including Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ), Casimir, and Dunkl connections, their confluent limits, and equivariant quantum connections for conical symplectic resolutions with finitely many torus fixed points. In particular, for rational values of parameters these eigenvalues are zero, so the connections are globally nilpotent. We also show that every periodic pencil has regular singularites and its residues have rational eigenvalues for rational values of parameters. In particular, this holds for the aforementioned quantum connections if they have rational coefficients. Also we generalize these results to irregular pencils (KZ, Casimir, Dunkl, and Toda), and relate them in the Dunkl case to representations of rational Cherednik algebras. Finally, we extend our main result to pseudo-pencils and discuss the generalization to difference equations.</description>

      <title>On the Quantum K-theory of Quiver Varieties at Roots of Unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Psi(\mathbb{z},\mathbb{a},q)$ be the fundamental solution matrix of the quantum difference equation in the equivariant quantum K-theory for Nakajima variety $X$. In this work, we prove that the operator $$ \Psi(\mathbb{z},\mathbb{a},q) \Psi\left(\mathbb{z}^p,\mathbb{a}^p,q^{p^2}\right)^{-1} $$ has no poles at the primitive complex $p$-th roots of unity $\zeta_p$ in the curve counting parameter $q$. As a byproduct, we show that the eigenvalues of the iterated product of the operators ${\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}}$ from the quantum difference equation on $X$ $$ {\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}} (\mathbb{z},\mathbb{a},q) {\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}} (\mathbb{z} q^{\mathcal{L}},\mathbb{a},q) \cdots {\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}} (\mathbb{z} q^{(p-1)\mathcal{L}},\mathbb{a},q) $$ evaluated at $\zeta_p$ are described by the Bethe equations for $X$ in which all variables are substituted by their $p$-th powers.
  Finally, upon a reduction of the quantum difference equation on $X$ to the quantum differential equation over the field with finite characteristic, the above iterated product transforms into a Grothendiek-Katz $p$-curvature of the corresponding differential connection whereas ${\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}} (\mathbb{z}^p,\mathbb{a}^p,q^p)$ becomes a certain Frobenius twist of that connection. In this way, we are reproducing, in part, the statement of a theorem by Etingof and Varchenko.</description>
