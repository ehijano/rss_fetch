      <title>On the stability of utilitarian aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of aggregating von Neumann-Morgenstern utilities, we show that bounded violations of the Pareto conditions characterize aggregation rules that are approximately utilitarian. When a single utility function is intended to represent the preference judgments of a group of individuals and the Pareto principles are nearly satisfied, we prove that its distance from a weighted sum of individual cardinal utilities does not exceed half of the positive parameter that differentiates our weaker versions of the Pareto conditions from their conventional forms. This result suggests the stability of Harsanyi's (1955) aggregation theorem, in that small deviations from the Pareto principles lead to aggregation rules that remain close to utilitarian aggregation.</description>

      <title>Robust Maximum Likelihood Updating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a large body of evidence that decision makers frequently depart from Bayesian updating. This paper introduces a model, robust maximum likelihood (RML) updating, where deviations from Bayesian updating are due to multiple priors/ambiguity. Using the decision maker's preferences over acts before and after the arrival of new information as the primitive of the analysis, I axiomatically characterize a representation where the decision maker's probability assessment can be described by a benchmark prior, which is reflected in her ex ante ranking of acts, and a set of plausible priors, which is revealed from her updated preferences. When new information is received, the decision maker revises her benchmark prior within the set of plausible priors via the maximum likelihood principle in a way that ensures maximally dynamically consistent behavior, and updates the new prior using Bayes' rule. RML updating accommodates most commonly observed biases in probabilistic reasoning.</description>

      <title>Matching with regional constraints: An equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In two-sided matching market, when the regional constraints are present, the deferred acceptance (DA) algorithm suffers from undesirable inefficiency due to the artificial allocation of the regional caps among hospitals. We show that, given preferences, there exist allocations that guarantee the efficiency of the DA algorithm. Furthermore, it is equivalent to the FDA algorithm developed by Kamada and Kojima (2015), which endows the latter with an interpretation as a tool for endogenous capacity design. Our proof applies the optimality within the matching with contracts (Hatfield and Milgrom 2005) framework, offering a broadly applicable method for establishing equivalence among DA-based mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty, Single Crossing Property, and Stochastic Choice Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a typical model of private information and choice under uncertainty, a decision maker observes a signal, updates her prior beliefs using Bayes rule, and maximizes her expected utility. If the decision maker's utility function satisfies the single crossing property, and the information structure is ordered according to the monotone likelihood ratio, then the comparative statics exhibit monotonicity with respect to signals. We consider the restrictions placed by this model of signal processing on state conditional stochastic choice data. In particular, we show that this model rationalizes a state conditional stochastic choice dataset if and only if the dataset itself is ordered according to the monotone likelihood ratio.</description>
