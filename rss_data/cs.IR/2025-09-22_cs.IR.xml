      <title>Efficient and Versatile Model for Multilingual Information Retrieval of Islamic Text: Development and Deployment in Real-World Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent advancements in Multilingual Information Retrieval (MLIR), a significant gap remains between research and practical deployment. Many studies assess MLIR performance in isolated settings, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we leverage the unique characteristics of the Quranic multilingual corpus to examine the optimal strategies to develop an ad-hoc IR system for the Islamic domain that is designed to satisfy users' information needs in multiple languages. We prepared eleven retrieval models employing four training approaches: monolingual, cross-lingual, translate-train-all, and a novel mixed method combining cross-lingual and monolingual techniques. Evaluation on an in-domain dataset demonstrates that the mixed approach achieves promising results across diverse retrieval scenarios. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of how different training configurations affect the embedding space and their implications for multilingual retrieval effectiveness. Finally, we discuss deployment considerations, emphasizing the cost-efficiency of deploying a single versatile, lightweight model for real-world MLIR applications.</description>

      <title>SERVAL: Surprisingly Effective Zero-Shot Visual Document Retrieval Powered by Large Vision and Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual Document Retrieval (VDR) typically operates as text-to-image retrieval using specialized bi-encoders trained to directly embed document images. We revisit a zero-shot generate-and-encode pipeline: a vision-language model first produces a detailed textual description of each document image, which is then embedded by a standard text encoder. On the ViDoRe-v2 benchmark, the method reaches 63.4% nDCG@5, surpassing the strongest specialised multi-vector visual document encoder. It also scales better to large collections and offers broader multilingual coverage. Analysis shows that modern vision-language models capture complex textual and visual cues with sufficient granularity to act as a reusable semantic proxy. By offloading modality alignment to pretrained vision-language models, our approach removes the need for computationally intensive text-image contrastive training and establishes a strong zero-shot baseline for future VDR systems.</description>

      <title>Dual-Mode Visual System for Brain-Computer Interfaces: Integrating SSVEP and P300 Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In brain-computer interface (BCI) systems, steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) and P300 responses have achieved widespread implementation owing to their superior information transfer rates (ITR) and minimal training requirements. These neurophysiological signals have exhibited robust efficacy and versatility in external device control, demonstrating enhanced precision and scalability. However, conventional implementations predominantly utilise liquid crystal display (LCD)-based visual stimulation paradigms, which present limitations in practical deployment scenarios. This investigation presents the development and evaluation of a novel light-emitting diode (LED)-based dual stimulation apparatus designed to enhance SSVEP classification accuracy through the integration of both SSVEP and P300 paradigms. The system employs four distinct frequencies, 7 Hz, 8 Hz, 9 Hz, and 10 Hz, corresponding to forward, backward, right, and left directional controls, respectively. Oscilloscopic verification confirmed the precision of these stimulation frequencies. Real-time feature extraction was accomplished through the concurrent analysis of maximum Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) amplitude and P300 peak detection to ascertain user intent. Directional control was determined by the frequency exhibiting maximal amplitude characteristics. The visual stimulation hardware demonstrated minimal frequency deviation, with error differentials ranging from 0.15%to 0.20%across all frequencies. The implemented signal processing algorithm successfully discriminated all four stimulus frequencies whilst correlating them with their respective P300 event markers. Classification accuracy was evaluated based on correct task intention recognition. The proposed hybrid system achieved a mean classification accuracy of 86.25%, coupled with an average ITR of 42.08 bits per minute (bpm).</description>

      <title>CFDA &amp; CLIP at TREC iKAT 2025: Enhancing Personalized Conversational Search via Query Reformulation and Rank Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 2025 TREC Interactive Knowledge Assistance Track (iKAT) featured both interactive and offline submission tasks. The former requires systems to operate under real-time constraints, making robustness and efficiency as important as accuracy, while the latter enables controlled evaluation of passage ranking and response generation with pre-defined datasets. To address this, we explored query rewriting and retrieval fusion as core strategies. We built our pipelines around Best-of-$N$ selection and Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) strategies to handle different submission tasks. Results show that reranking and fusion improve robustness while revealing trade-offs between effectiveness and efficiency across both tasks.</description>

      <title>Chunk Knowledge Generation Model for Enhanced Information Retrieval: A Multi-task Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional query expansion techniques for addressing vocabulary mismatch problems in information retrieval are context-sensitive and may lead to performance degradation. As an alternative, document expansion research has gained attention, but existing methods such as Doc2Query have limitations including excessive preprocessing costs, increased index size, and reliability issues with generated content. To mitigate these problems and seek more structured and efficient alternatives, this study proposes a method that divides documents into chunk units and generates textual data for each chunk to simultaneously improve retrieval efficiency and accuracy. The proposed "Chunk Knowledge Generation Model" adopts a T5-based multi-task learning structure that simultaneously generates titles and candidate questions from each document chunk while extracting keywords from user queries. This approach maximizes computational efficiency by generating and extracting three types of semantic information in parallel through a single encoding and two decoding processes. The generated data is utilized as additional information in the retrieval system. GPT-based evaluation on 305 query-document pairs showed that retrieval using the proposed model achieved 95.41% accuracy at Top@10, demonstrating superior performance compared to document chunk-level retrieval. This study contributes by proposing an approach that simultaneously generates titles and candidate questions from document chunks for application in retrieval pipelines, and provides empirical evidence applicable to large-scale information retrieval systems by demonstrating improved retrieval accuracy through qualitative evaluation.</description>

      <title>Understanding Embedding Scaling in Collaborative Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling recommendation models into large recommendation models has become one of the most widely discussed topics. Recent efforts focus on components beyond the scaling embedding dimension, as it is believed that scaling embedding may lead to performance degradation. Although there have been some initial observations on embedding, the root cause of their non-scalability remains unclear. Moreover, whether performance degradation occurs across different types of models and datasets is still an unexplored area. Regarding the effect of embedding dimensions on performance, we conduct large-scale experiments across 10 datasets with varying sparsity levels and scales, using 4 representative classical architectures. We surprisingly observe two novel phenomenon: double-peak and logarithmic. For the former, as the embedding dimension increases, performance first improves, then declines, rises again, and eventually drops. For the latter, it exhibits a perfect logarithmic curve. Our contributions are threefold. First, we discover two novel phenomena when scaling collaborative filtering models. Second, we gain an understanding of the underlying causes of the double-peak phenomenon. Lastly, we theoretically analyze the noise robustness of collaborative filtering models, with results matching empirical observations.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Product Deduplication in E-Commerce with Multimodal Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In large scale e-commerce marketplaces, duplicate product listings frequently cause consumer confusion and operational inefficiencies, degrading trust on the platform and increasing costs. Traditional keyword-based search methodologies falter in accurately identifying duplicates due to their reliance on exact textual matches, neglecting semantic similarities inherent in product titles. To address these challenges, we introduce a scalable, multimodal product deduplication designed specifically for the e-commerce domain. Our approach employs a domain-specific text model grounded in BERT architecture in conjunction with MaskedAutoEncoders for image representations. Both of these architectures are augmented with dimensionality reduction techniques to produce compact 128-dimensional embeddings without significant information loss. Complementing this, we also developed a novel decider model that leverages both text and image vectors. By integrating these feature extraction mechanisms with Milvus, an optimized vector database, our system can facilitate efficient and high-precision similarity searches across extensive product catalogs exceeding 200 million items with just 100GB of system RAM consumption. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our matching system achieves a macro-average F1 score of 0.90, outperforming third-party solutions which attain an F1 score of 0.83. Our findings show the potential of combining domain-specific adaptations with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to mitigate duplicate listings in large-scale e-commerce environments.</description>

      <title>Building Data-Driven Occupation Taxonomies: A Bottom-Up Multi-Stage Approach via Semantic Clustering and Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Creating robust occupation taxonomies, vital for applications ranging from job recommendation to labor market intelligence, is challenging. Manual curation is slow, while existing automated methods are either not adaptive to dynamic regional markets (top-down) or struggle to build coherent hierarchies from noisy data (bottom-up). We introduce CLIMB (CLusterIng-based Multi-agent taxonomy Builder), a framework that fully automates the creation of high-quality, data-driven taxonomies from raw job postings. CLIMB uses global semantic clustering to distill core occupations, then employs a reflection-based multi-agent system to iteratively build a coherent hierarchy. On three diverse, real-world datasets, we show that CLIMB produces taxonomies that are more coherent and scalable than existing methods and successfully capture unique regional characteristics. We release our code and datasets at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CLIMB.</description>

      <title>EHR-MCP: Real-world Evaluation of Clinical Information Retrieval by Large Language Models via Model Context Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in medicine, but their deployment in hospitals is limited by restricted access to electronic health record (EHR) systems. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables integration between LLMs and external tools.
  Objective: To evaluate whether an LLM connected to an EHR database via MCP can autonomously retrieve clinically relevant information in a real hospital setting.
  Methods: We developed EHR-MCP, a framework of custom MCP tools integrated with the hospital EHR database, and used GPT-4.1 through a LangGraph ReAct agent to interact with it. Six tasks were tested, derived from use cases of the infection control team (ICT). Eight patients discussed at ICT conferences were retrospectively analyzed. Agreement with physician-generated gold standards was measured.
  Results: The LLM consistently selected and executed the correct MCP tools. Except for two tasks, all tasks achieved near-perfect accuracy. Performance was lower in the complex task requiring time-dependent calculations. Most errors arose from incorrect arguments or misinterpretation of tool results. Responses from EHR-MCP were reliable, though long and repetitive data risked exceeding the context window.
  Conclusions: LLMs can retrieve clinical data from an EHR via MCP tools in a real hospital setting, achieving near-perfect performance in simple tasks while highlighting challenges in complex ones. EHR-MCP provides an infrastructure for secure, consistent data access and may serve as a foundation for hospital AI agents. Future work should extend beyond retrieval to reasoning, generation, and clinical impact assessment, paving the way for effective integration of generative AI into clinical practice.</description>

      <title>CodeRAG: Finding Relevant and Necessary Knowledge for Retrieval-Augmented Repository-Level Code Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Repository-level code completion automatically predicts the unfinished code based on the broader information from the repository. Recent strides in Code Large Language Models (code LLMs) have spurred the development of repository-level code completion methods, yielding promising results. Nevertheless, they suffer from issues such as inappropriate query construction, single-path code retrieval, and misalignment between code retriever and code LLM. To address these problems, we introduce CodeRAG, a framework tailored to identify relevant and necessary knowledge for retrieval-augmented repository-level code completion. Its core components include log probability guided query construction, multi-path code retrieval, and preference-aligned BestFit reranking. Extensive experiments on benchmarks ReccEval and CCEval demonstrate that CodeRAG significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The implementation of CodeRAG is available at https://github.com/KDEGroup/CodeRAG.</description>

      <title>Stop Playing the Guessing Game! Target-free User Simulation for Evaluating Conversational Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent approaches in Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) have tried to simulate real-world users engaging in conversations with CRSs to create more realistic testing environments that reflect the complexity of human-agent dialogue. Despite the significant advancements, reliably evaluating the capability of CRSs to elicit user preferences still faces a significant challenge. Existing evaluation metrics often rely on target-biased user simulators that assume users have predefined preferences, leading to interactions that devolve into simplistic guessing game. These simulators typically guide the CRS toward specific target items based on fixed attributes, limiting the dynamic exploration of user preferences and struggling to capture the evolving nature of real-user interactions. Additionally, current evaluation metrics are predominantly focused on single-turn recall of target items, neglecting the intermediate processes of preference elicitation. To address this, we introduce PEPPER, a novel CRS evaluation protocol with target-free user simulators constructed from real-user interaction histories and reviews. PEPPER enables realistic user-CRS dialogues without falling into simplistic guessing games, allowing users to gradually discover their preferences through enriched interactions, thereby providing a more accurate and reliable assessment of the CRS's ability to elicit personal preferences. Furthermore, PEPPER presents detailed measures for comprehensively evaluating the preference elicitation capabilities of CRSs, encompassing both quantitative and qualitative measures that capture four distinct aspects of the preference elicitation process. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the validity of PEPPER as a simulation environment and conduct a thorough analysis of how effectively existing CRSs perform in preference elicitation and recommendation.</description>

      <title>RaCT: Ranking-aware Chain-of-Thought Optimization for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14405v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In information retrieval, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in text reranking tasks by leveraging their sophisticated natural language understanding and advanced reasoning capabilities. However, conventional supervised fine-tuning approaches for specializing LLMs in ranking tasks often lead to significant degradation of the models' general-purpose abilities. To address this fundamental challenge, this paper presents a novel methodology that strategically combines Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting techniques with an innovative two-stage training pipeline consisting of Supervised Fine-Tuning followed by Ranking Preference Optimization (SFT-RPO). The Chain-of-Thought prompting component encourages models to explicitly articulate their reasoning process during ranking decisions, creating a transparent pathway from query-document analysis to final ranking scores while maintaining analytical capabilities throughout fine-tuning. Extensive experimental evaluations on the TREC Deep Learning datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art models, including RankZephyr, showing consistent improvements across multiple evaluation metrics such as normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG). Most significantly, comprehensive assessments on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark reveal that our method successfully maintains robust performance across diverse reasoning tasks, providing strong empirical evidence for effective retention of general-purpose capabilities through strategic fine-tuning while achieving specialized performance improvements in text reranking.</description>

Abstract: The ViDoRe Benchmark V1 was approaching saturation with top models exceeding 90% nDCG@5, limiting its ability to discern improvements. ViDoRe Benchmark V2 introduces realistic, challenging retrieval scenarios via blind contextual querying, long and cross-document queries, and a hybrid synthetic and human-in-the-loop query generation process. It comprises four diverse, multilingual datasets and provides clear evaluation instructions. Initial results demonstrate substantial room for advancement and highlight insights on model generalization and multilingual capability. This benchmark is designed as a living resource, inviting community contributions to maintain relevance through future evaluations.</description>

      <title>Reinforce Lifelong Interaction Value of User-Author Pairs for Large-Scale Recommendation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recommendation systems (RS) help users find interested content and connect authors with their target audience. Most research in RS tends to focus either on predicting users' immediate feedback (like click-through rate) accurately or improving users' long-term engagement. However, they ignore the influence for authors and the lifelong interaction value (LIV) of user-author pairs, which is particularly crucial for improving the prosperity of social community in short-video platforms. Currently, reinforcement learning (RL) can optimize long-term benefits and has been widely applied in RS. In this paper, we introduce RL to Reinforce Lifelong Interaction Value of User-Author pairs (RLIV-UA) based on each interaction of UA pairs. To address the long intervals between UA interactions and the large scale of the UA space, we propose a novel Sparse Cross-Request Interaction Markov Decision Process (SCRI-MDP) and introduce an Adjacent State Approximation (ASA) method to construct RL training samples. Additionally, we introduce Multi-Task Critic Learning (MTCL) to capture the progressive nature of UA interactions (click -&gt; follow -&gt; gift), where denser interaction signals are leveraged to compensate for the learning of sparse labels. Finally, an auxiliary supervised learning task is designed to enhance the convergence of the RLIV-UA model. In offline experiments and online A/B tests, the RLIV-UA model achieves both higher user satisfaction and higher platform profits than compared methods.</description>

      <title>REG4Rec: Reasoning-Enhanced Generative Model for Large-Scale Recommendation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation aims to predict a user's next action in large-scale recommender systems. While traditional methods often suffer from insufficient information interaction, recent generative recommendation models partially address this issue by directly generating item predictions. To better capture user intents, recent studies have introduced a reasoning process into generative recommendation, significantly improving recommendation performance. However, these approaches are constrained by the singularity of item semantic representations, facing challenges such as limited diversity in reasoning pathways and insufficient reliability in the reasoning process. To tackle these issues, we introduce REG4Rec, a reasoning-enhanced generative model that constructs multiple dynamic semantic reasoning paths alongside a self-reflection process, ensuring high-confidence recommendations. Specifically, REG4Rec utilizes an MoE-based parallel quantization codebook (MPQ) to generate multiple unordered semantic tokens for each item, thereby constructing a larger-scale diverse reasoning space. Furthermore, to enhance the reliability of reasoning, we propose a training reasoning enhancement stage, which includes Preference Alignment for Reasoning (PARS) and a Multi-Step Reward Augmentation (MSRA) strategy. PARS uses reward functions tailored for recommendation to enhance reasoning and reflection, while MSRA introduces future multi-step actions to improve overall generalization. During inference, Consistency-Oriented Self-Reflection for Pruning (CORP) is proposed to discard inconsistent reasoning paths, preventing the propagation of erroneous reasoning. Lastly, we develop an efficient offline training strategy for large-scale recommendation. Experiments on real-world datasets and online evaluations show that REG4Rec delivers outstanding performance and substantial practical value.</description>

      <title>Modeling Long-term User Behaviors with Diffusion-driven Multi-interest Network for CTR Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CTR (Click-Through Rate) prediction, crucial for recommender systems and online advertising, etc., has been confirmed to benefit from modeling long-term user behaviors. Nonetheless, the vast number of behaviors and complexity of noise interference pose challenges to prediction efficiency and effectiveness. Recent solutions have evolved from single-stage models to two-stage models. However, current two-stage models often filter out significant information, resulting in an inability to capture diverse user interests and build the complete latent space of user interests. Inspired by multi-interest and generative modeling, we propose DiffuMIN (Diffusion-driven Multi-Interest Network) to model long-term user behaviors and thoroughly explore the user interest space. Specifically, we propose a target-oriented multi-interest extraction method that begins by orthogonally decomposing the target to obtain interest channels. This is followed by modeling the relationships between interest channels and user behaviors to disentangle and extract multiple user interests. We then adopt a diffusion module guided by contextual interests and interest channels, which anchor users' personalized and target-oriented interest types, enabling the generation of augmented interests that align with the latent spaces of user interests, thereby further exploring restricted interest space. Finally, we leverage contrastive learning to ensure that the generated augmented interests align with users' genuine preferences. Extensive offline experiments are conducted on two public datasets and one industrial dataset, yielding results that demonstrate the superiority of DiffuMIN. Moreover, DiffuMIN increased CTR by 1.52% and CPM by 1.10% in online A/B testing. Our source code is available at https://github.com/laiweijiang/DiffuMIN.</description>

      <title>Exploring Scaling Laws of CTR Model for Online Performance Improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CTR models play a vital role in improving user experience and boosting business revenue in many online personalized services. However, current CTR models generally encounter bottlenecks in performance improvement. Inspired by the scaling law phenomenon of LLMs, we propose a new paradigm for improving CTR predictions: first, constructing a CTR model with accuracy scalable to the model grade and data size, and then distilling the knowledge implied in this model into its lightweight model that can serve online users. To put it into practice, we construct a CTR model named SUAN (Stacked Unified Attention Network). In SUAN, we propose the UAB as a behavior sequence encoder. A single UAB unifies the modeling of the sequential and non-sequential features and also measures the importance of each user behavior feature from multiple perspectives. Stacked UABs elevate the configuration to a high grade, paving the way for performance improvement. In order to benefit from the high performance of the high-grade SUAN and avoid the disadvantage of its long inference time, we modify the SUAN with sparse self-attention and parallel inference strategies to form LightSUAN, and then adopt online distillation to train the low-grade LightSUAN, taking a high-grade SUAN as a teacher. The distilled LightSUAN has superior performance but the same inference time as the LightSUAN, making it well-suited for online deployment. Experimental results show that SUAN performs exceptionally well and holds the scaling laws spanning three orders of magnitude in model grade and data size, and the distilled LightSUAN outperforms the SUAN configured with one grade higher. More importantly, the distilled LightSUAN has been integrated into an online service, increasing the CTR by 2.81% and CPM by 1.69% while keeping the average inference time acceptable.

      <title>Multi-view-guided Passage Reranking with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in passage reranking tasks. Despite their success, LLM-based methods still face challenges in efficiency and sensitivity to external biases. (1) Existing models rely mostly on autoregressive generation and sliding window strategies to rank passages, which incur heavy computational overhead as the number of passages increases. (2) External biases, such as position or selection bias, hinder the model's ability to accurately represent passages and increase input-order sensitivity. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel passage reranking model, called Multi-View-guided Passage Reranking (MVP). MVP is a non-generative LLM-based reranking method that encodes query-passage information into diverse view embeddings without being influenced by external biases. For each view, it combines query-aware passage embeddings to produce a distinct anchor vector, which is then used to directly compute relevance scores in a single decoding step. In addition, it employs an orthogonal loss to make the views more distinctive. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVP, with just 220M parameters, matches the performance of much larger 7B-scale fine-tuned models while achieving a 100x reduction in inference latency. Notably, the 3B-parameter variant of MVP achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks.

      <title>What Matters in LLM-Based Feature Extractor for Recommender? A Systematic Analysis of Prompts, Models, and Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantic features has been demonstrated as a powerful paradigm for enhancing Sequential Recommender Systems (SRS). This typically involves three stages: processing item text, extracting features with LLMs, and adapting them for downstream models. However, existing methods vary widely in prompting, architecture, and adaptation strategies, making it difficult to fairly compare design choices and identify what truly drives performance. In this work, we propose RecXplore, a modular analytical framework that decomposes the LLM-as-feature-extractor pipeline into four modules: data processing, semantic feature extraction, feature adaptation, and sequential modeling. Instead of proposing new techniques, RecXplore revisits and organizes established methods, enabling systematic exploration of each module in isolation. Experiments on four public datasets show that simply combining the best designs from existing techniques without exhaustive search yields up to 18.7% relative improvement in NDCG@5 and 12.7% in HR@5 over strong baselines. These results underscore the utility of modular benchmarking for identifying effective design patterns and promoting standardized research in LLM-enhanced recommendation.</description>

      <title>Database-Augmented Query Representation for Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16013v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Information retrieval models that aim to search for documents relevant to a query have shown multiple successes, which have been applied to diverse tasks. Yet, the query from the user is oftentimes short, which challenges the retrievers to correctly fetch relevant documents. To tackle this, previous studies have proposed expanding the query with a couple of additional (user-related) features related to it. However, they may be suboptimal to effectively augment the query, and there is plenty of other information available to augment it in a relational database. Motivated by this fact, we present a novel retrieval framework called Database-Augmented Query representation (DAQu), which augments the original query with various (query-related) metadata across multiple tables. In addition, as the number of features in the metadata can be very large and there is no order among them, we encode them with the graph-based set-encoding strategy, which considers hierarchies of features in the database without order. We validate our DAQu in diverse retrieval scenarios, demonstrating that it significantly enhances overall retrieval performance over relevant baselines.</description>

      <title>ConfReady: A RAG based Assistant and Dataset for Conference Checklist Responses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ARR Responsible NLP Research checklist website states that the "checklist is designed to encourage best practices for responsible research, addressing issues of research ethics, societal impact and reproducibility." Answering the questions is an opportunity for authors to reflect on their work and make sure any shared scientific assets follow best practices. Ideally, considering a checklist before submission can favorably impact the writing of a research paper. However, previous research has shown that self-reported checklist responses don't always accurately represent papers. In this work, we introduce ConfReady, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) application that can be used to empower authors to reflect on their work and assist authors with conference checklists. To evaluate checklist assistants, we curate a dataset of 1,975 ACL checklist responses, analyze problems in human answers, and benchmark RAG and Large Language Model (LM) based systems on an evaluation subset. Our code is released under the AGPL-3.0 license on GitHub, with documentation covering the user interface and PyPI package.</description>

      <title>Query Optimization for Parametric Knowledge Refinement in Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07820v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the \textit{Extract-Refine-Retrieve-Read} (ERRR) framework, a novel approach designed to bridge the pre-retrieval information gap in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems through query optimization tailored to meet the specific knowledge requirements of Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike conventional query optimization techniques used in RAG, the ERRR framework begins by extracting parametric knowledge from LLMs, followed by using a specialized query optimizer for refining these queries. This process ensures the retrieval of only the most pertinent information essential for generating accurate responses. Moreover, to enhance flexibility and reduce computational costs, we propose a trainable scheme for our pipeline that utilizes a smaller, tunable model as the query optimizer, which is refined through knowledge distillation from a larger teacher model. Our evaluations on various question-answering (QA) datasets and with different retrieval systems show that ERRR consistently outperforms existing baselines, proving to be a versatile and cost-effective module for improving the utility and accuracy of RAG systems.</description>

      <title>Domain-invariant feature learning in brain MR imaging for content-based image retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When conducting large-scale studies that collect brain MR images from multiple facilities, the impact of differences in imaging equipment and protocols at each site cannot be ignored, and this domain gap has become a significant issue in recent years. In this study, we propose a new low-dimensional representation (LDR) acquisition method called style encoder adversarial domain adaptation (SE-ADA) to realize content-based image retrieval (CBIR) of brain MR images. SE-ADA reduces domain differences while preserving pathological features by separating domain-specific information from LDR and minimizing domain differences using adversarial learning. In evaluation experiments comparing SE-ADA with recent domain harmonization methods on eight public brain MR datasets (ADNI1/2/3, OASIS1/2/3/4, PPMI), SE-ADA effectively removed domain information while preserving key aspects of the original brain structure and demonstrated the highest disease search accuracy.</description>
