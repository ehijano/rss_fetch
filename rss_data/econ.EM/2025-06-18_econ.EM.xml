      <title>On the relationship between prediction intervals, tests of sharp nulls and inference on realized treatment effects in settings with few treated units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how inference methods for settings with few treated units that rely on treatment effect homogeneity extend to alternative inferential targets when treatment effects are heterogeneous -- namely, tests of sharp null hypotheses, inference on realized treatment effects, and prediction intervals. We show that inference methods for these alternative targets are deeply interconnected: they are either equivalent or become equivalent under additional assumptions. Our results show that methods designed under treatment effect homogeneity can remain valid for these alternative targets when treatment effects are stochastic, offering new theoretical justifications and insights on their applicability.</description>

      <title>Fast Learning of Optimal Policy Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop and implement a version of the popular "policytree" method (Athey and Wager, 2021) using discrete optimisation techniques. We test the performance of our algorithm in finite samples and find an improvement in the runtime of optimal policy tree learning by a factor of nearly 50 compared to the original version. We provide an R package, "fastpolicytree", for public use.</description>

      <title>biastest: Testing parameter equality across different models in Stata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The biastest command in Stata is a powerful and user-friendly tool designed to compare the coefficients of different regression models, enabling researchers to assess the robustness and consistency of their empirical findings. This command is particularly valuable for evaluating alternative modeling approaches, such as ordinary least squares versus robust regression, robust regression versus median regression, quantile regression across different quantiles, and fixed effects versus random effects models in panel data analysis. By providing both variable-specific and joint tests, biastest command offers a comprehensive framework for detecting bias or significant differences in model estimates, ensuring that researchers can make informed decisions about model selection and interpretation.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Distributional IVs: KAN-Powered D-IV-LATE &amp; Model Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The double/debiased machine learning (DML) framework has become a cornerstone of modern causal inference, allowing researchers to utilise flexible machine learning models for the estimation of nuisance functions without introducing first-order bias into the final parameter estimate. However, the choice of machine learning model for the nuisance functions is often treated as a minor implementation detail. In this paper, we argue that this choice can have a profound impact on the substantive conclusions of the analysis. We demonstrate this by presenting and comparing two distinct Distributional Instrumental Variable Local Average Treatment Effect (D-IV-LATE) estimators. The first estimator leverages standard machine learning models like Random Forests for nuisance function estimation, while the second is a novel estimator employing Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). We establish the asymptotic properties of these estimators and evaluate their performance through Monte Carlo simulations. An empirical application analysing the distributional effects of 401(k) participation on net financial assets reveals that the choice of machine learning model for nuisance functions can significantly alter substantive conclusions, with the KAN-based estimator suggesting more complex treatment effect heterogeneity. These findings underscore a critical "caveat emptor". The selection of nuisance function estimators is not a mere implementation detail. Instead, it is a pivotal choice that can profoundly impact research outcomes in causal inference.</description>

      <title>Quantile Treatment Effects in High Dimensional Panel Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce novel estimators for quantile causal effects with high dimensional panel data (large $N$ and $T$), where only one or a few units are affected by the intervention or policy. Our method extends the generalized synthetic control method \citep{xu_2017} from average treatment effects on the treated to quantile treatment effects on the treated, allowing the underlying factor structure to change across the quantile of the interested outcome distribution. Our method involves estimating the quantile-dependent factors using the control group, followed by a quantile regression to estimate the quantile treatment effect using the treated units. We establish the asymptotic properties of our estimators and propose a bootstrap procedure for statistical inference, supported by simulation studies. An empirical application of the 2008 China Stimulus Program is provided.</description>
