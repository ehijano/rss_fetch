      <title>Dynamics of Urban Heat Island in Lafia, Nasarawa State of Nigeria: A Remote Sensing Analysis of Land Surface Temperature, Urban Development and Vegetation Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the global climate changes, urban heat island (UHI) is a critical factor in ever expanding urban landscape, studying and mitigating the UHI is important for remediating climate change and providing for the human and ecosystem health within the urban area. This study has aimed to study the UHI in Lafia, a tropical city in Nigeria and its other impacted factors such as the land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), with the aim of mitigating the UHI effect. Landsat 4, 5, 7 and 8 together with Sentinel data has been used for this study, through the public archive of the Google Earth Engine data catalog, used also is the ERA5 data from the same data catalog. The result showed that the expanding city of Lafia is experiencing significant UHI with increase in temperatures in the city and adjoining areas, it was found that the vegetation cover in Lafia city is rapidly disappearing as a result of urbanization leading to more UHI and greater discomfort to the inhabitant of the city. Several remediation steps were suggested to mitigate the UHI effect in Lafia.</description>

      <title>Evaluating near-surface wind speeds simulated by the CRCM6-GEM5 model using AmeriFlux data over North America</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We evaluate the performance of various configurations of the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM6-GEM5) in simulating 10-meter wind speeds using data from 27 AmeriFlux stations across North America. The assessment employs a hierarchy of error metrics, ranging from simple mean bias to advanced metrics that account for the dependence of wind speeds on variables such as friction velocity and stability. The results reveal that (i) the value of roughness length (z0) has a large effect on the simulation of wind speeds, (ii) using a lower limit for the Obhukov length instead of a lower limit for the lowest level wind speed seems to deteriorate the simulation of wind speeds under very stable conditions, (iii) the choice of stability function has a small but noticeable impact on the wind speeds, (iv) the turbulent orographic form drag scheme shows improvement over effective roughness length approach.</description>
