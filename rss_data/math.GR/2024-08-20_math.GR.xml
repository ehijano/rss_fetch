      <title>On the Girth of Groups acting on CAT(0) cube complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a sufficient condition for lattices in the automorphism group of a finite dimensional CAT(0) cube complex to have infinite girth. As a corollary, we get a version of Girth Alternative for groups acting geometrically: any such group is either {locally finite}-by-{virtually abelian} or it has infinite girth. We produce counterexamples to show that the alternative fails in the general class of groups acting cocompactly on finite dimensional CAT(0) cube complexes by obtaining examples of non virtually solvable groups which satisfy a law.</description>

      <title>The Number of Subgroups and Cyclic Subgroups of Finite Group and Its Application by GAP Program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach for calculating the set of subgroups of a finite group, focusing on cyclic subgroups, and using it to establish the quantity of all subgroups in the direct product of two groups. Specifically, we consider the Dicyclic group of order \(4n\) and the Cyclic group of order \(p\). Let \(\tau(n)\) denote the total number of divisors of \(n\), and \(\sigma(n)\) denote the summation of all divisors of \(n\). Using these functions, we derive a formula for the number of subgroups in the group \(T_{4n} \times C_p\). We then use the computer program GAP to find all \(T_{4n} \times C_p\) with exactly \(|T_{4n} \times C_p| - t\) cyclic subgroups for \(t \geq 1\).</description>

      <title>Advertizing finite commutative semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite commutative semigroups $S$ (akin to the better known group case) have a neat structure as well. Apart from a trimmed proof of the general framework, the structural details of many concrete f.c. semigroups $S$ are unraveled. They come in two types. First, the subtle multiplicative semigroups $(Z_n,\bullet)$ (as opposed to their bland siblings $(Z_n,+)$). Second, semigroups defined by generators and relations. Altogether six open questions stimulate further research.</description>

      <title>Quotient of Topological Ternary Semigroup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a quotient structure on topological ternary semigroup by defining a congruence suitably. We have found conditions under which this quotient structure becomes a topological ternary semigroup. We have also obtained conditions that make this quotient a topological ternary group, whenever the base structure is a topological ternary group.</description>

      <title>All hyperbolic cyclically presented groups with positive length three relators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the cyclically presented groups defined by cyclic presentations with $2m$ generators $x_i$ whose relators are the $2m$ positive length three relators $x_ix_{i+1}x_{i+m-1}$. We show that they are hyperbolic if and only if $m\in \{1,2,3,6,9\}$. This completes the classification of the hyperbolic cyclically presented groups with positive length three relators.</description>

      <title>Completing the proof of the Liebeck--Nikolov--Shalev conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liebeck, Nikolov, and Shalev conjectured the existence of an absolute constant $C&gt;0$, such that for every subset $A$ of a finite simple group $G$ with $|A|\ge 2$, there exists $C\log|G|/\log|A|$ conjugates of $A$ whose product is $G$. This paper is a companion to \cite{GLPS}, and together they prove the conjecture.
  To prove the conjecture, we establish the following skew-product theorem. We show that there exists $ c &gt; 0 $ such that for all $ \epsilon &gt; 0 $ and subsets $ A, B \subseteq G $ of finite simple groups of Lie type, if $ |B| &lt; |G|^{1 - \epsilon} $, then $ |A^{\sigma} B| &gt; |B||A|^{c \epsilon} $ for some $ \sigma \in G $. This result, along with its more involved analogue for alternating groups, constitutes the main contribution of this paper.
  Our proof leverages deep results from character theory alongside the probabilistic method.</description>

      <title>Matrix structure of classical ${\mathbb Z}_2 \times {\mathbb Z}_2$ graded Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A ${\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_2$-graded Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ is a ${\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_2$-graded algebra $\mathfrak g$ with a bracket $[|. , . |]$ that satisfies certain graded versions of the symmetry and Jacobi identity. In particular, despite the common terminology, $\mathfrak g$ is not a Lie algebra. We construct classes of ${\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_2$-graded Lie algebras corresponding to the classical Lie algebras, in terms of their defining matrices. For the ${\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_2$-graded Lie algebra of type $A$, the construction coincides with the previously known class. For the ${\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_2$-graded Lie algebra of type $B$, $C$ and $D$ our construction is new and gives rise to interesting defining matrices closely related to the classical ones but undoubtedly different. We also give some examples and possible applications to parastatistics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the space $M_d(G)$ of $M_d$-multipliers of a locally compact group $G$ is isometrically isomorphic to the Banach space of bounded functionals on the $d$-fold Haagerup tensor product of $L^1(G)$ vanishing on the kernel of the convolution map. Consequently, we see that $M_d(G)$ is isometrically isomorphic to the dual space of $X_d(G)$, the completion of $L^1(G)$ in the dual of $M_d(G)$. We also show that $M_d$-type-approximation-properties are inherited to lattices.</description>

      <title>Avoshifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An avoshift is a subshift where for each set $C$ from a suitable family of subsets of the shift group, the set of all possible valid extensions of a globally valid pattern on $C$ to the identity element is determined by a bounded subpattern. This property is shared (for various families of sets $C$) by for example cellwise quasigroup shifts, TEP subshifts, and subshifts of finite type with a safe symbol. In this paper we concentrate on avoshifts on polycyclic groups, when the sets $C$ are what we call ``inductive intervals''. We show that then avoshifts are a recursively enumerable subset of subshifts of finite type. Furthermore, we can effectively compute lower-dimensional projective subdynamics and certain factors (avofactors), and we can decide equality and inclusion for subshifts in this class. These results were previously known for group shifts, but our class also covers many non-algebraic examples as well as many SFTs without dense periodic points. The theory also yields new proofs of decidability of inclusion for SFTs on free groups, and SFTness of subshifts with the topological strong spatial mixing property.</description>

      <title>A q-analogue of graph independence polynomials with a group-theoretic interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define totally-isotropic polynomials of alternating matrix spaces over finite fields, by analogy with independence polynomials of graphs. Our main result shows that totally-isotropic polynomials of graphical alternating matrix spaces give rise to a natural q-analogue of graph independence polynomials.
  For p-groups of class 2 and exponent p, this family of polynomials over fields of order p can be naturally interpreted as enumerating their abelian subgroups containing the commutator subgroup according to the orders. With this interpretation, our main result has implications to graphical groups over finite fields, in the same spirit as the results in (Bull. Lond. Math. Soc., 2022) by Rossmann, who studied enumerating conjugacy classes of graphical groups over finite fields.</description>

      <title>Topological and Dynamic Properties of the Sublinearly Morse Boundary and the Quasi-Redirecting Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sublinearly Morse boundaries of proper geodesic spaces are introduced by Qing, Rafi and Tiozzo. Expanding on this work, Qing and Rafi recently developed the quasi-redirecting boundary, denoted $\partial G$, to include all directions of metric spaces at infinity. Both boundaries are topological spaces that consist of equivalence classes of quasi-geodesic rays and are quasi-isometrically invariant. In this paper, we study these boundaries when the space is equipped with a geometric group action. In particular, we show that $G$ acts minimally on $\partial_\kappa G$ and that contracting elements of G induces a weak north-south dynamic on $\partial_\kappa G$. We also prove, when $\partial G$ exists and $|\partial_\kappa G|\geq3$, $G$ acts minimally on $\partial G$ and $\partial G$ is a second countable topological space. The last section concerns the restriction to proper CAT(0) spaces and finite dimensional \CAT cube complexes. We show that when $G$ acts geometrically on a finite dimensional CAT(0) cube complex (whose QR boundary is assumed to exist), then a nontrivial QR boundary implies the existence of a Morse element in $G$. Lastly, we show that if $X$ is a proper cocompact CAT(0) space, then $\partial G$ is a visibility space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize planar graphs and graph minors among other graph theoretic notions in terms of right-angled Artin groups (RAAGs). For this, we determine all sets of elements in RAAGs with ears as underlying graphs that are exactly the sets of vertex generators. Generalizing ear decompositions of graphs to loose ear decompositions, we characterize both decompositions in terms of RAAGs. The desired results follow as applications of loose ear decompositions of RAAGs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11996v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The weak-cop number of a graph, a variation of the cop number, is an invariant suitable for infinite graphs and is a quasi-isometric invariant. While for any $m\in\mathbb{Z}_+\cup\{\infty\}$ there exist locally finite infinite graphs with weak-cop number $m$, it is an open question whether there exists locally finite vertex transitive graphs whose weak-cop number is different than $1$ and $\infty$. We test this question on Cayley graphs of wreath products, these are objects known for their exotic geometries. We prove that Cayley graphs of wreath products of nontrivial groups by infinite groups have infinite weak-cop number. The result is proved by defining a new pursuit and evasion game and proving the existence of strategies for the evader. We also include a short argument that Cayley graphs of Thompson's group $F$ have infinite weak cop number.</description>

      <title>Characters of $GL_n(\mathbb F_q)$ and vertex operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15330v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a vertex operator approach to construct and compute all complex irreducible characters of the general linear group $\GL_n(\mathbb F_q)$. Green's theory of $\GL_n(\mathbb F_q)$ is recovered and enhanced under the realization of the Grothendieck ring of representations $R_G=\bigoplus_{n\geq 0}R(\GL_n(\mathbb F_q))$ as two isomorphic Fock spaces associated to two infinite-dimensional $F$-equivariant Heisenberg Lie algebras $\widehat{\mathfrak{h}}_{\hat{\overline{\mathbb F}}_q}$ and $\widehat{\mathfrak{h}}_{\overline{\mathbb F}_q}$, where $F$ is the Frobenius automorphism of the algebraically closed field $\overline{\mathbb F}_q$. Under this picture, the irreducible characters are realized by the Bernstein vertex operators for Schur functions, the characteristic functions of the conjugacy classes are realized by the vertex operators for the Hall-Littlewood functions, and the character table is completely given by matrix coefficients of vertex operators of these two types. One of the features of the current approach is a simpler identification of the Fock space $R_G$ as the Hall algebra of symmetric functions via vertex operator calculus, and another is that we are able to compute in general the character table, where Green's degree formula is demonstrated as an example.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the Johnson homomorphisms of basis-conjugating automorphism groups of free groups. We construct obstructions for the surjectivity of the Johnson homomorphisms. By using it, we determine its cokernels of degree up to four, and give further observations for degree greater than four.
  As applications, we give the affirmative answer for the Andreadakis problem for degree four. We show that the cup product map of the first cohomology groups of the basis-conjugating automorphism group of a free group into the second cohomology group is surjective. Finally, we calculate the twisted first cohomology groups of the braid-permutation automorphism groups of a free group.</description>

      <title>Almost 1-1 extensions of Furstenberg-Weiss type and test for amenability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be an infinite residually finite group. We show that for every minimal equicontinuous Cantor system $(Z,G)$ with a free orbit, and for every minimal extension $(Y,G)$ of $(Z,G)$, there exist a minimal almost 1-1 extension $(X,G)$ of $(Z,G)$ and a Borel equivariant map $\psi:Y\to X$ that induces an affine bijection $\psi^*$ between $M(Y,G)$ and $M(X,G)$, the spaces of invariant probability measures of $(Y,G)$ and $(X,G)$, respectively. If $Y$ is a Cantor set, then $(Y,G)$ and $(X,G)$ are Borel isomorphic, i.e., $\psi^*$ is also a homeomorphism. As an application, we show that the family of Toeplitz subshifts is a test for amenability for residually finite groups, i.e., a residually finite group $G$ is amenable if and only if every Toeplitz $G$-subshift has invariant probability measures.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth complex quasi-projective variety and $\Gamma=\pi_1(X)$. Let $\chi \colon \Gamma \to \mathbb{R}$ be an additive character. We prove that the ray $[\chi]$ does not belong to the BNS set $\Sigma(\Gamma)$ if and only if it comes as a pullback along an algebraic fibration $f \colon X \to \mathcal{C}$ over a quasi-projective hyperbolic orbicurve $\mathcal{C}$. We also prove that if $\pi_1(X)$ admits a solvable quotient which is not virtually nilpotent, there exists a finite \'etale cover $X_1 \to X$ and a fibration $f \colon X_1 \to \mathcal{C}$ over a quasi-projective hyperbolic orbicurve $\mathcal{C}$. Both of these results were proved by Delzant in the case when $X$ is a compact K\"ahler manifold. We deduce that $\Gamma$ is virtually solvable if and only if it is virtually nilpotent, generalising the theorems of Delzant and Arapura-Nori. As a byproduct, we prove a version of Simpson's Lefschetz Theorem for the integral leaves of logarithmic $1$-forms that do not extend to any partial compactification. We give two applications of our results. First, we strengthen the recent theorem of Cadorel-Deng-Yamanoi on virtual nilpotency of fundamental groups of quasi-projective $h$-special and weakly special manifolds. Second, we prove the sharpness of Suciu's tropical bound for the fundamental groups of smooth quasi-projective varieties and answer a question of Suciu on the topology of hyperplane arrangements.</description>
