      <title>Computing All Shortest Passenger Routes with a Tropical Dijkstra Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a public transportation network, which and how many passenger routes can potentially be shortest paths, when all possible timetables are taken into account? This question leads to shortest path problems on graphs with interval costs on their arcs and is closely linked to multi-objective optimization. We introduce a Dijkstra algorithm based on polynomials over the tropical semiring that computes complete or minimal sets of efficient paths. We demonstrate that this approach is computationally feasible by employing it on the public transport network of the city of Wuppertal and instances of the benchmarking set TimPassLib, and we evaluate the resulting sets of passenger routes.</description>

      <title>Rainbow Arborescence Conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The famous Ryser--Brualdi--Stein conjecture asserts that every $n \times n$ Latin square contains a partial transversal of size $n-1$. Since its appearance, the conjecture has attracted significant interest, leading to several generalizations. One of the most notable extensions is to matroid intersection given by Aharoni, Kotlar, and Ziv, focusing on the existence of a common independent transversal of the common independent sets of two matroids. In this paper, we study a special case of this setting, the Rainbow Arborescence Conjecture, which states that any graph on $n$ vertices formed by the union of $n-1$ spanning arborescences contains an arborescence using exactly one arc from each. We prove that the computational problem of testing the existence of such an arborescence with a fixed root is NP-complete, verify the conjecture in several cases, and explore relaxed versions of the problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying and mitigating the spread of fake information is a challenging issue that has become dominant with the rise of social media. We consider a generalization of the Domination problem that can be used to detect a set of individuals who, once immunized, can prevent the spreading of fake narratives. The considered problem, named {\em Distance Vector Domination} generalizes both distance and multiple domination, at individual (i.e., vertex) level. We study the parameterized complexity of the problem according to several standard and structural parameters. We prove the W[1]-hardness of the problem with respect to neighborhood diversity, even when all the distances are $1$. We also give fixed-parameter algorithms for some variants of the problem and parameter combinations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Subroutines in Branch-Price-and-Cut for Vehicle Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent progress in quantum hardware and algorithms researchers have developed quantum heuristics for optimization problems, aiming for advantages over classical methods. To date, quantum hardware is still error-prone and limited in size such that quantum heuristics cannot be scaled to relevant problem sizes and are often outperformed by their classical counterparts. Moreover, if provably optimal solutions are desired, one has to resort to classical exact methods. As however quantum technologies may improve considerably in future, we demonstrate in this work how quantum heuristics with limited resources can be integrated in large-scale exact optimization algorithms for NP-hard problems. To this end, we consider vehicle routing as prototypical NP-hard problem. We model the pricing and separation subproblems arising in a branch-price-and-cut algorithm as quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems. This allows to use established quantum heuristics like quantum annealing or the quantum approximate optimization algorithm for their solution. A key feature of our algorithm is that it profits not only from the best solution returned by the quantum heuristic but from all solutions below a certain cost threshold, thereby exploiting the inherent randomness is quantum algorithms. Moreover, we reduce the requirements on quantum hardware since the subproblems, which are solved via quantum heuristics, are smaller than the original problem. We provide an experimental study comparing quantum annealing to simulated annealing and to established classical algorithms in our framework. While our hybrid quantum-classical approach is still outperformed by purely classical methods, our results reveal that both pricing and separation may be well suited for quantum heuristics if quantum hardware improves.</description>

Abstract: With the rise of social media, misinformation has significant negative effects on the decision-making of individuals, organizations and communities within society. Identifying and mitigating the spread of fake information is a challenging issue. We consider a generalization of the Domination problem that can be used to detect a set of individuals who, through an awareness process, can prevent the spreading of fake narratives. The considered problem, named \textsc{$(d,r)$-Domination} generalizes both distance and multiple domination. We study the parameterized complexity of the problem according to standard and structural parameters. We give fixed-parameter algorithms as well as polynomial compressions/kernelizations for some variants of the problem and parameter combinations.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Stability of Threshold Networks over Undirected Signed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01854v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper, we explore the dynamics of threshold networks on undirected signed graphs. Much attention has been dedicated to understanding the convergence and long-term behavior of this model. Yet, an open question persists: How does the underlying graph structure impact network dynamics? Similar studies have been carried out for threshold networks and other types of Boolean networks, but the latter primarily focus on unsigned networks. Here, we address this question in the context of signed threshold networks.
  We introduce the stability index of a signed graph, related to the concepts of antibalance in signed graphs. Our index establishes a connection between the structure and the dynamics of signed threshold networks. We show that signed graphs having a negative stability index on every induced subgraph exhibit stable dynamics, i.e., the dynamics converge to fixed points regardless of their threshold parameters. Conversely, if at least one induced subgraph has a non-negative stability index, oscillations in long-term behavior may appear. Furthermore, we generalize the analysis to network dynamics under periodic update schemes.</description>

      <title>Listing spanning trees of outerplanar graphs by pivot-exchanges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the spanning trees of any outerplanar triangulation $G$ can be listed so that any two consecutive spanning trees differ in an exchange of two edges that share an end vertex. For outerplanar graphs $G$ with faces of arbitrary lengths (not necessarily 3) we establish a similar result, with the condition that the two exchanged edges share an end vertex or lie on a common face. These listings of spanning trees are obtained from a simple greedy algorithm that can be implemented efficiently, i.e., in time $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ per generated spanning tree, where $n$ is the number of vertices of $G$. Furthermore, the listings correspond to Hamilton paths on the 0/1-polytope that is obtained as the convex hull of the characteristic vectors of all spanning trees of $G$.</description>

      <title>The Frank number and nowhere-zero flows on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02133v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An edge $e$ of a graph $G$ is called deletable for some orientation $o$ if the restriction of $o$ to $G-e$ is a strong orientation. Inspired by a problem of Frank, in 2021 H\"orsch and Szigeti proposed a new parameter for $3$-edge-connected graphs, called the Frank number, which refines $k$-edge-connectivity. The Frank number is defined as the minimum number of orientations of $G$ for which every edge of $G$ is deletable in at least one of them. They showed that every $3$-edge-connected graph has Frank number at most $7$ and that in case these graphs are also $3$-edge-colourable the parameter is at most $3$. Here we strengthen both results by showing that every $3$-edge-connected graph has Frank number at most $4$ and that every graph which is $3$-edge-connected and $3$-edge-colourable has Frank number $2$. The latter also confirms a conjecture by Bar\'at and Bl\'azsik. Furthermore, we prove two sufficient conditions for cubic graphs to have Frank number $2$ and use them in an algorithm to computationally show that the Petersen graph is the only cyclically $4$-edge-connected cubic graph up to $36$ vertices having Frank number greater than $2$.</description>

      <title>Parameterised distance to local irregularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04583v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is \emph{locally irregular} if no two of its adjacent vertices have the same degree. In [Fioravantes et al. Complexity of finding maximum locally irregular induced subgraph. {\it SWAT}, 2022], the authors introduced and studied the problem of finding a locally irregular induced subgraph of a given a graph $G$ of maximum order, or, equivalently, computing a subset $S$ of $V(G)$ of minimum order, whose deletion from $G$ results in a locally irregular graph; $S$ is denoted as an \emph{optimal vertex-irregulator of $G$}. In this work we provide an in-depth analysis of the parameterised complexity of computing an optimal vertex-irregulator of a given graph $G$. Moreover, we introduce and study a variation of this problem, where $S$ is a substet of the edges of $G$; in this case, $S$ is denoted as an \emph{optimal edge-irregulator of $G$}. In particular, we prove that computing an optimal vertex-irregulator of a graph $G$ is in FPT when parameterised by the vertex integrity, neighborhood diversity or cluster deletion number of $G$, while it is $W[1]$-hard when parameterised by the feedback vertex set number or the treedepth of $G$. In the case of computing an optimal edge-irregulator of a graph $G$, we prove that this problem is in FPT when parameterised by the vertex integrity of $G$, while it is NP-hard even if $G$ is a planar bipartite graph of maximum degree $4$, and $W[1]$-hard when parameterised by the size of the solution, the feedback vertex set or the treedepth of $G$. Our results paint a comprehensive picture of the tractability of both problems studied here, considering most of the standard graph-structural parameters.</description>

      <title>Effective Bounds for Restricted $3$-Arithmetic Progressions in $\mathbb{F}_p^n$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a prime $p$, a restricted arithmetic progression in $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ is a triplet of vectors $x, x+a, x+2a$ in which the common difference $a$ is a non-zero element from $\{0,1,2\}^n$. What is the size of the largest $A\subseteq \mathbb{F}_p^n$ that is free of restricted arithmetic progressions? We show that the density of any such a set is at most $\frac{C}{(\log\log\log n)^c}$, where $c,C&gt;0$ depend only on $p$, giving the first reasonable bounds for the density of such sets. Previously, the best known bound was $O(1/\log^{*} n)$, which follows from the density Hales-Jewett theorem.</description>

      <title>Pathway Realisability in Chemical Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10629v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exploration of pathways and alternative pathways that have a specific function is of interest in numerous chemical contexts. A framework for specifying and searching for pathways has previously been developed, but a focus on which of the many pathway solutions are realisable, or can be made realisable, is missing. Realisable here means that there actually exists some sequencing of the reactions of the pathway that will execute the pathway. We present a method for analysing the realisability of pathways based on the reachability question in Petri nets. For realisable pathways, our method also provides a certificate encoding an order of the reactions which realises the pathway. We present two extended notions of realisability of pathways, one of which is related to the concept of network catalysts. We exemplify our findings on the pentose phosphate pathway. Furthermore, we discuss the relevance of our concepts for elucidating the choices often implicitly made when depicting pathways. Lastly, we lay the foundation for the mathematical theory of realisability.</description>

      <title>Systematic evaluation of the isolated effect of tissue environment on the transcriptome using a single-cell RNA-seq atlas dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Understanding cellular diversity throughout the body is essential for elucidating the complex functions of biological systems. Recently, large-scale single-cell omics datasets, known as omics atlases, have become available. These atlases encompass data from diverse tissues and cell-types, providing insights into the landscape of cell-type-specific gene expression. However, the isolated effect of the tissue environment has not been thoroughly investigated. Evaluating this isolated effect is challenging due to statistical confounding with cell-type effects, arising from significant biases in the combinations of tissues and cell-types within the body. Results: This study introduces a novel data analysis framework, named the Combinatorial Sub-dataset Extraction for Confounding Reduction (COSER), which addresses statistical confounding by using graph theory to enumerate appropriate sub-datasets. COSER enables the assessment of isolated effects of discrete variables in single cells. Applying COSER to the Tabula Muris Senis single-cell transcriptome atlas, we characterized the isolated impact of tissue environments. Our findings demonstrate that some of genes are markedly affected by the tissue environment, particularly in modulating intercellular diversity in immune responses and their age-related changes. Conclusion: COSER provides a robust, general-purpose framework for evaluating the isolated effects of discrete variables from large-scale data mining. This approach reveals critical insights into the interplay between tissue environments and gene expression.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Barrier: A Polynomial-Time Polylogarithmic Approximation for Directed Steiner Tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Directed Steiner Tree (DST) problem is defined on a directed graph $G=(V,E)$, where we are given a designated root vertex $r$ and a set of $k$ terminals $K \subseteq V \setminus {r}$. The goal is to find a minimum-cost subgraph that provides directed $r \rightarrow t$ paths for all terminals $t \in K$.
  The approximability of DST has long been a central open problem in network design. Although there exist polylogarithmic-approximation algorithms with quasi-polynomial running times (Charikar et al. 1998; Grandoni, Laekhanukit, and Li 2019; Ghuge and Nagarajan 2020), the best-known polynomial-time approximation until now has remained at $k^\epsilon$ for any constant $\epsilon &gt; 0$. Whether a polynomial-time algorithm achieving a polylogarithmic approximation exists has been a longstanding mystery.
  In this paper, we resolve this question by presenting a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves an $O(\log^3 k)$-approximation for DST on arbitrary directed graphs. This result nearly matches the state-of-the-art $O(\log^2 k / \log\log k)$ approximations known only via quasi-polynomial-time algorithms. The resulting gap -- $O(\log^3 k)$ versus $O(\log^2 k / \log\log k)$ -- mirrors the known complexity landscape for the Group Steiner Tree problem. This parallel suggests intriguing new directions: Is there a hardness result that provably separates the power of polynomial-time and quasi-polynomial-time algorithms for DST?</description>

      <title>Logic-Constrained Shortest Paths for Flight Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Logic-Constrained Shortest Path Problem (LCSP) combines a one-to-one shortest path problem with satisfiability constraints imposed on the routing graph. This setting arises in flight planning, where air traffic control (ATC) authorities are enforcing a set of traffic flow restrictions (TFRs) on aircraft routes in order to increase safety and throughput. We propose a new branch and bound-based algorithm for the LCSP. The resulting algorithm has three main degrees of freedom: the node selection rule, the branching rule and the conflict. While node selection and branching rules have been long studied in the MIP and SAT communities, most of them cannot be applied out of the box for the LCSP. We review the existing literature and develop tailored variants of the most prominent rules. The conflict, the set of variables to which the branching rule is applied, is unique to the LCSP. We analyze its theoretical impact on the B&amp;B algorithm. In the second part of the paper, we show how to model the Flight Planning Problem with TFRs as an LCSP and solve it using the branch and bound algorithm. We demonstrate the algorithm's efficiency on a dataset consisting of a global flight graph and a set of around 20000 real TFRs obtained from our industry partner Lufthansa Systems GmbH. We make this dataset publicly available. Finally, we conduct an empirical in-depth analysis of node selection rules, branching rules and conflicts. Carefully choosing an appropriate combination yields an improvement of an order of magnitude compared to an uninformed choice.</description>
