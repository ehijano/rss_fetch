      <title>Convergence of Subdivision Schemes and Smoothness of Refinable Functions on p-adic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A systematic and comprehensive study of p-adic refinement equations and subdivision scheme associated with a finitely supported refinement mask are carried out in this paper. The Lq -convergence of the subdivision scheme is characterized in terms of the q-norm joint spectral radii of a collection of operators associated with the refinement mask. Also, the smoothness of complex-valued functions on Qp is investigated.</description>

      <title>On Stewart's Perturbation Theorem for SVD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes a variant of Stewart's theorem (Theorem~6.4 of Stewart, {\em SIAM Rev.}, 15:727--764, 1973) for the singular subspaces associated with the SVD of a matrix subject to perturbations. Stewart's original version uses both the Frobenius and spectral norms, whereas the new variant uses the spectral norm and any unitarily invariant norm that offer choices per convenience of particular applications and lead to sharper bounds than that straightforwardly derived from Stewart's original theorem with the help of the well-known equivalence inequalities between matrix norms. Of interest in their own right, bounds on the solution to two couple Sylvester equations are established for a few different circumstances.</description>

      <title>Optimal Matrix-Mimetic Tensor Algebras via Variable Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in {matrix-mimetic} tensor frameworks have made it possible to preserve linear algebraic properties for multilinear data analysis and, as a result, to obtain optimal representations of multiway data. Matrix mimeticity arises from interpreting tensors as operators that can be multiplied, factorized, and analyzed analogous to matrices. Underlying the tensor operation is an algebraic framework parameterized by an invertible linear transformation. The choice of linear mapping is crucial to representation quality and, in practice, is made heuristically based on expected correlations in the data. However, in many cases, these correlations are unknown and common heuristics lead to suboptimal performance. In this work, we simultaneously learn optimal linear mappings and corresponding tensor representations without relying on prior knowledge of the data. Our new framework explicitly captures the coupling between the transformation and representation using variable projection. We preserve the invertibility of the linear mapping by learning orthogonal transformations with Riemannian optimization. We provide original theory of uniqueness of the transformation and convergence analysis of our variable-projection-based algorithm. We demonstrate the generality of our framework through numerical experiments on a wide range of applications, including financial index tracking, image compression, and reduced order modeling. We have published all the code related to this work at https://github.com/elizabethnewman/star-M-opt.</description>

      <title>On inertial Levenberg-Marquardt type methods for solving nonlinear ill-posed operator equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In these notes we propose and analyze an inertial type method for obtaining stable approximate solutions to nonlinear ill-posed operator equations. The method is based on the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) iteration. The main obtained results are: monotonicity and convergence for exact data, stability and semi-convergence for noisy data. Regarding numerical experiments we consider: i) a parameter identification problem in elliptic PDEs, ii) a parameter identification problem in machine learning; the computational efficiency of the proposed method is compared with canonical implementations of the LM method.</description>

      <title>Research on High-precision Detection Technology for Un-derground Space Information Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quality of underground space information data has become a major problem endangering the safety of underground space. After research and analysis, we found that the current high accuracy information data remote detection methods are limited to the detection of overground spaces objects, and are not applicable to the detection of various information data in underground space. In this paper, we analyze the spectral properties of the fractional-order differential (FDO) operator, and establish mathematical model of remote transmission and high-precision detection of information data, which realizes the functions of high-precision and remote detection of information data. By fusing the information data to detect the mathematical model in a long distance and with high accuracy, A mathematical model has been established to improve the quality of underground spatial information data. Through the application in engineering practice, the effectiveness of this method in underground space information data detection is verified.</description>

      <title>An efficient active-stress electromechanical isogeometric shell model for muscular thin film simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an isogeometric approach to model the deformation of active thin films using layered, nonlinear, Kirchhoff Love shells. Isogeometric Collocation and Galerkin formulations are employed to discretize the electrophysiological and mechanical sub-problems, respectively, with the possibility to adopt different element and time-step sizes. Numerical tests illustrate the capabilities of the active stress based approach to effectively simulate the contraction of thin films in both quasi-static and dynamic conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present bounds between different widths of convex subsets of Banach spaces, including Gelfand and Bernstein widths. Using this, and some relations between widths and minimal errors, we obtain bounds on the maximal gain of adaptive and randomized algorithms over non-adaptive, deterministic ones for approximating linear operators on convex sets. Our results also apply to the approximation of embeddings into the space of bounded functions based on function evaluations, i.e., to sampling recovery in the uniform norm. We conclude with a list of open problems.</description>

      <title>Solving singular generalized eigenvalue problems. Part III: structure preservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Parts I and II of this series of papers, three new methods for the computation of eigenvalues of singular pencils were developed: rank-completing perturbations, rank-projections, and augmentation. It was observed that a straightforward structure-preserving adaption for symmetric pencils was not possible and it was left as an open question how to address this challenge. In this Part III, it is shown how the observed issue can be circumvented by using Hermitian perturbations. This leads to structure-preserving analogues of the three techniques from Parts I and II for Hermitian pencils (including real symmetric pencils) as well as for related structures. It is an important feature of these methods that the sign characteristic of the given pencil is preserved. As an application, it is shown that the resulting methods can be used to solve systems of bivariate polynomials.</description>

      <title>A Well-Balanced Method for an Unstaggered Central Scheme, the two-space Dimensional Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a second-order accurate central scheme for the two-dimensional hyperbolic system of in-homogeneous conservation laws. The main idea behind the scheme is that we combine the well-balanced deviation method with the Kurganov-Tadmor (KT) scheme. The approach satisfies the well-balanced property and retains the advantages of KT scheme: Riemann-solver-free and the avoidance of oversampling on the regions between Riemann-fans. The scheme is implemented and applied to a number of numerical experiments for the Euler equations with gravitational source term and the results are non-oscillatory. Based on the same idea, we construct a semi-discrete scheme where we combine the above two methods and illustrate the maximum principle.</description>

      <title>Model order reduction for seismic applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a model order reduction approach to speed up the computation of seismograms, i.e. the solution of the seismic wave equation evaluated at a receiver location, for different model parameters. Our approach achieves a reduction of the unknowns by a factor of approximately 1000 for various numerical experiments for a 2D subsurface model of Groningen, the Netherlands, even if the wave speeds of the subsurface are relatively varied. Moreover, using parallel computing, the reduced model can approximate the (time domain) seismogram in a lower wall clock time than an implicit Newmark-beta method. To realize this reduction, we exploit the fact that seismograms are low-pass filtered for the observed seismic events by considering the Laplace-transformed problem in frequency domain. Therefore, we can avoid the high frequencies that would require many reduced basis functions to reach the desired accuracy and generally make the reduced order approximation of wave problems challenging. Instead, we can prove for our ansatz that for a fixed subsurface model the reduced order approximation converges exponentially fast in the frequency range of interest in the Laplace domain. We build the reduced model from solutions of the Laplace-transformed problem via a (Proper Orthogonal Decomposition-)Greedy algorithm targeting the construction of the reduced model to the time domain seismograms; the latter is achieved by using an a posteriori error estimator that does not require computing any time domain counterparts. Finally, we show that we obtain a stable reduced model thus overcoming the challenge that standard model reduction approaches do not necessarily yield a stable reduced model for wave problems.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic time integration for semi-explicit PDAEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the application of probabilistic time integration methods to semi-explicit partial differential-algebraic equations of parabolic type and its semi-discrete counterparts, namely semi-explicit differential-algebraic equations of index 2. The proposed methods iteratively construct a probability distribution over the solution of deterministic problems, enhancing the information obtained from the numerical simulation. Within this paper, we examine the efficacy of the randomized versions of the implicit Euler method, the midpoint scheme, and exponential integrators of first and second order. By demonstrating the consistency and convergence properties of these solvers, we illustrate their utility in capturing the sensitivity of the solution to numerical errors. Our analysis establishes the theoretical validity of randomized time integration for constrained systems and offers insights into the calibration of probabilistic integrators for practical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fredholm integral equations of the first kind is a typical ill-posed problem, so that it is usually difficult to obtain its analytical minimal-norm solution. This paper gives a closed-form minimal-norm solution for the degenerate kernel equations based on the H-HK formulation. Furthermore, it has been shown that the structure of solutions to degenerate kernel equations and matrix equations are consistent. Subsequently, the obtained results are extended to non-degenerate integral equations. Finally, the validity and applicability of the proposed method are demonstrated by some examples.</description>

      <title>Discovery of differential equations using sparse state and parameter regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a sparse regression strategy for discovery of ordinary and partial differential equations from incomplete and noisy data. Inference is performed over both equation parameters and state variables using a statistically motivated likelihood function. Sparsity is enforced by a selection algorithm which iteratively removes terms and compares models using statistical information criteria. Large scale optimization is performed using a second-order variant of the Levenberg-Marquardt method, where the gradient and Hessian are computed via automatic differentiation. Illustrations involving canonical systems of ordinary and partial differential equations are used to demonstrate the flexibility and robustness of the approach. Accurate reconstruction of systems is found to be possible even in extreme cases of limited data and large observation noise.</description>

      <title>On Learning what to Learn: heterogeneous observations of dynamics and establishing (possibly causal) relations among them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Before we attempt to learn a function between two (sets of) observables of a physical process, we must first decide what the inputs and what the outputs of the desired function are going to be. Here we demonstrate two distinct, data-driven ways of initially deciding ``the right quantities'' to relate through such a function, and then proceed to learn it. This is accomplished by processing multiple simultaneous heterogeneous data streams (ensembles of time series) from observations of a physical system: multiple observation processes of the system. We thus determine (a) what subsets of observables are common between the observation processes (and therefore observable from each other, relatable through a function); and (b) what information is unrelated to these common observables, and therefore particular to each observation process, and not contributing to the desired function. Any data-driven function approximation technique can subsequently be used to learn the input-output relation, from k-nearest neighbors and Geometric Harmonics to Gaussian Processes and Neural Networks. Two particular ``twists'' of the approach are discussed. The first has to do with the identifiability of particular quantities of interest from the measurements. We now construct mappings from a single set of observations of one process to entire level sets of measurements of the process, consistent with this single set. The second attempts to relate our framework to a form of causality: if one of the observation processes measures ``now'', while the second observation process measures ``in the future'', the function to be learned among what is common across observation processes constitutes a dynamical model for the system evolution.</description>

      <title>GPU Accelerated Implicit Kinetic Meshfree Method based on Modified LU-SGS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report presents the GPU acceleration of implicit kinetic meshfree methods using modified LU-SGS algorithms. The meshfree scheme is based on the least squares kinetic upwind method (LSKUM). In the existing matrix-free LU-SGS approaches for kinetic meshfree methods, the products of split flux Jacobians and increments in conserved vectors are approximated by increments in the split fluxes. In our modified LU-SGS approach, the Jacobian vector products are computed exactly using algorithmic differentiation (AD). The implicit GPU solvers with exact and approximate computation of the Jacobian vector products are applied to the standard test cases for two-dimensional inviscid flows. Numerical results have shown that the GPU solvers with the exact computation of the Jacobian vector products are computationally more efficient and yield better convergence rates than the solvers with approximations to the Jacobian vector products. Benchmarks are presented to assess the performance of implicit GPU solvers compared to the explicit GPU solver and the implicit serial LSKUM solver.</description>

      <title>fKAN: Fractional Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with trainable Jacobi basis functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in neural network design have given rise to the development of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), which enhance speed, interpretability, and precision. This paper presents the Fractional Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (fKAN), a novel neural network architecture that incorporates the distinctive attributes of KANs with a trainable adaptive fractional-orthogonal Jacobi function as its basis function. By leveraging the unique mathematical properties of fractional Jacobi functions, including simple derivative formulas, non-polynomial behavior, and activity for both positive and negative input values, this approach ensures efficient learning and enhanced accuracy. The proposed architecture is evaluated across a range of tasks in deep learning and physics-informed deep learning. Precision is tested on synthetic regression data, image classification, image denoising, and sentiment analysis. Additionally, the performance is measured on various differential equations, including ordinary, partial, and fractional delay differential equations. The results demonstrate that integrating fractional Jacobi functions into KANs significantly improves training speed and performance across diverse fields and applications.</description>

      <title>A sparse spectral method for fractional differential equations in one-spatial dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.08247v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a sparse spectral method for a class of fractional differential equations, posed on $\mathbb{R}$, in one dimension. These equations can include sqrt-Laplacian, Hilbert, derivative and identity terms. The numerical method utilizes a basis consisting of weighted Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind in conjunction with their Hilbert transforms. The former functions are supported on $[-1,1]$ whereas the latter have global support. The global approximation space can contain different affine transformations of the basis, mapping $[-1,1]$ to other intervals. Remarkably, not only are the induced linear systems sparse, but the operator decouples across the different affine transformations. Hence, the solve reduces to solving $K$ independent sparse linear systems of size $\mathcal{O}(n)\times \mathcal{O}(n)$, with $\mathcal{O}(n)$ nonzero entries, where $K$ is the number of different intervals and $n$ is the highest polynomial degree contained in the sum space. This results in an $\mathcal{O}(n)$ complexity solve. Applications to fractional heat and wave equations are considered.</description>

      <title>A Nystr\"{o}m Method for Scattering by a Two-layered Medium with a Rough Boundary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02339v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the problems of scattering of time-harmonic acoustic waves by a two-layered medium with a non-locally perturbed boundary (called a rough boundary in this paper) in two dimensions, where a Dirichlet or impedance boundary condition is imposed on the boundary. The two-layered medium is composed of two unbounded media with different physical properties and the interface between the two media is considered to be a planar surface. We formulate the considered scattering problems as the boundary value problems and prove that each boundary value problem has a unique solution by utilizing the integral equation method associated with the two-layered Green function. Moreover, we develop the Nystr\"{o}m method for numerically solving the considered boundary value problems, based on the proposed integral equation formulations. We establish the convergence results of the Nystr\"{o}m method with the convergence rates depending on the smoothness of the rough boundary. It is worth noting that in establishing the well-posedness of the boundary value problems as well as the convergence results of the Nystr\"{o}m method, an essential role is played by the investigation of the asymptotic properties of the two-layered Green function for small and large arguments. Finally, numerical experiments are carried out to show the effectiveness of the Nystr\"{o}m method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.09676v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work deals with the numerical solution of systems of oscillatory second-order differential equations which often arise from the semi-discretization in space of partial differential equations. Since these differential equations exhibit (pronounced or highly) oscillatory behavior, standard numerical methods are known to perform poorly. Our approach consists in directly discretizing the problem by means of Gautschi-type integrators based on $\operatorname{sinc}$ matrix functions. The novelty contained here is that of using a suitable rational approximation formula for the $\operatorname{sinc}$ matrix function to apply a rational Krylov-like approximation method with suitable choices of poles. In particular, we discuss the application of the whole strategy to a finite element discretization of the wave equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a posteriori error estimates for a discontinuous Galerkin scheme for the parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel system in 2 or 3 space dimensions. The estimates are conditional, in the sense that an a posteriori computable quantity needs to be small enough - which can be ensured by mesh refinement - and optimal in the sense that the error estimator decays with the same order as the error under mesh refinement. A specific feature of our error estimator is that it can be used to prove existence of a weak solution up to a certain time based on numerical results.</description>

      <title>On full linear convergence and optimal complexity of adaptive FEM with inexact solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15738v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ultimate goal of any numerical scheme for partial differential equations (PDEs) is to compute an approximation of user-prescribed accuracy at quasi-minimal computational time. To this end, algorithmically, the standard adaptive finite element method (AFEM) integrates an inexact solver and nested iterations with discerning stopping criteria balancing the different error components. The analysis ensuring optimal convergence order of AFEM with respect to the overall computational cost critically hinges on the concept of R-linear convergence of a suitable quasi-error quantity. This work tackles several shortcomings of previous approaches by introducing a new proof strategy. First, the algorithm requires several fine-tuned parameters in order to make the underlying analysis work. A redesign of the standard line of reasoning and the introduction of a summability criterion for R-linear convergence allows us to remove restrictions on those parameters. Second, the usual assumption of a (quasi-)Pythagorean identity is replaced by the generalized notion of quasi-orthogonality from [Feischl, Math. Comp., 91 (2022)]. Importantly, this paves the way towards extending the analysis to general inf-sup stable problems beyond the energy minimization setting. Numerical experiments investigate the choice of the adaptivity parameters.</description>

      <title>Sketched and Truncated Polynomial Krylov Subspace Methods: Matrix Sylvester Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thanks to its great potential in reducing both computational cost and memory requirements, combining sketching and Krylov subspace techniques has attracted a lot of attention in the recent literature on projection methods for linear systems, matrix function approximations, and eigenvalue problems. Applying this appealing strategy in the context of linear matrix equations turns out to be far more involved than a straightforward generalization. These difficulties include analyzing well-posedness of the projected problem and deriving possible error estimates depending on the sketching properties. Further computational complications include the lack of a natural residual norm estimate and of an explicit basis for the generated subspace. In this paper we propose a new sketched-and-truncated polynomial Krylov subspace method for Sylvester equations that aims to address all these issues. The potential of our novel approach, in terms of both computational time and storage demand, is illustrated with numerical experiments. Comparisons with a state-of-the-art projection scheme based on rational Krylov subspaces are also included.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimal experimental design (OED) aims to choose the observations in an experiment to be as informative as possible, according to certain statistical criteria. In the linear case (when the observations depend linearly on the unknown parameters), it seeks the optimal weights over rows of the design matrix A under certain criteria. Classical OED assumes a discrete design space and thus a design matrix with finite dimensions. In many practical situations, however, the design space is continuous-valued, so that the OED problem is one of optimizing over a continuous-valued design space. The objective becomes a functional over the probability measure, instead of over a finite dimensional vector. This change of perspective requires a new set of techniques that can handle optimizing over probability measures, and Wasserstein gradient flow becomes a natural candidate. Both the first-order criticality and the convexity properties of the OED objective are presented. Computationally Monte Carlo particle simulation is deployed to formulate the main algorithm. This algorithm is applied to two elliptic inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Shape uncertainty quantification of Maxwell eigenvalues and -modes with application to TESLA cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Maxwell eigenvalue problems on uncertain shapes with perfectly conducting TESLA cavities being the driving example. Due to the shape uncertainty the resulting eigenvalues and eigenmodes are also uncertain and it is well known that the eigenvalues may exhibit crossings or bifurcations under perturbation. We discuss how the shape uncertainties can be modelled using the domain mapping approach and how the deformation mapping can be expressed as coefficients in Maxwell's equations. Using derivatives of these coefficients and derivatives of the eigenpairs, we follow a perturbation approach to compute approximations of mean and covariance of the eigenpairs. For small perturbations these approximations are faster and more accurate than sampling or surrogate model strategies. For the implementation we use an approach based on isogeometric analysis, which allows for straightforward modelling of the domain deformations and computation of the required derivatives. Numerical experiments for a three-dimensional 9-cell TESLA cavity are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06429v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A posteriori error estimates are an important tool to bound discretization errors in terms of computable quantities avoiding regularity conditions that are often difficult to establish. For non-linear and non-differentiable problems, problems involving jumping coefficients, and finite element methods using anisotropic triangulations, such estimates often involve large factors, leading to sub-optimal error estimates. By making use of convex duality arguments, exact and explicit error representations are derived that avoid such effects.</description>

      <title>Black-Box $k$-to-$1$-PCA Reductions: Theory and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03905v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $k$-principal component analysis ($k$-PCA) problem is a fundamental algorithmic primitive that is widely-used in data analysis and dimensionality reduction applications. In statistical settings, the goal of $k$-PCA is to identify a top eigenspace of the covariance matrix of a distribution, which we only have black-box access to via samples. Motivated by these settings, we analyze black-box deflation methods as a framework for designing $k$-PCA algorithms, where we model access to the unknown target matrix via a black-box $1$-PCA oracle which returns an approximate top eigenvector, under two popular notions of approximation. Despite being arguably the most natural reduction-based approach to $k$-PCA algorithm design, such black-box methods, which recursively call a $1$-PCA oracle $k$ times, were previously poorly-understood.
  Our main contribution is significantly sharper bounds on the approximation parameter degradation of deflation methods for $k$-PCA. For a quadratic form notion of approximation we term ePCA (energy PCA), we show deflation methods suffer no parameter loss. For an alternative well-studied approximation notion we term cPCA (correlation PCA), we tightly characterize the parameter regimes where deflation methods are feasible. Moreover, we show that in all feasible regimes, $k$-cPCA deflation algorithms suffer no asymptotic parameter loss for any constant $k$. We apply our framework to obtain state-of-the-art $k$-PCA algorithms robust to dataset contamination, improving prior work in sample complexity by a $\mathsf{poly}(k)$ factor.</description>

      <title>Cross Interpolation for Solving High-Dimensional Dynamical Systems on Low-Rank Tucker and Tensor Train Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel tensor interpolation algorithm for the time integration of nonlinear tensor differential equations (TDEs) on the tensor train and Tucker tensor low-rank manifolds, which are the building blocks of many tensor network decompositions. This paper builds upon our previous work (Donello et al., Proceedings of the Royal Society A, Vol. 479, 2023) on solving nonlinear matrix differential equations on low-rank matrix manifolds using CUR decompositions. The methodology we present offers multiple advantages: (i) It delivers near-optimal computational savings both in terms of memory and floating-point operations by leveraging cross algorithms based on the discrete empirical interpolation method to strategically sample sparse entries of the time-discrete TDEs to advance the solution in low-rank form. (ii) Numerical demonstrations show that the time integration is robust in the presence of small singular values. (iii) High-order explicit Runge-Kutta time integration schemes are developed. (iv) The algorithm is easy to implement, as it requires the evaluation of the full-order model at strategically selected entries and does not use tangent space projections, whose efficient implementation is intrusive. We demonstrate the efficiency of the presented algorithm for several test cases, including a nonlinear 100-dimensional TDE for the evolution of a tensor of size $70^{100} \approx 3.2 \times 10^{184}$ and a stochastic advection-diffusion-reaction equation with a tensor of size $4.7 \times 10^9$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19433v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In MCM/ICM 2023, we proposed a new result prediction model for the popular game Wordle launched by The New York Times. We first preprocessed the raw data and then established a prediction model based on ARIMA to predict the number of report results as of March 1, 2023. We selected word usage frequency, word information entropy, and the number of repeated letters contained in the word as the attributes of the word, and conducted a correlation analysis between these three attributes and the percentage of seven attempts. We also established a regression model based on the XGBoost algorithm, predicted the distribution of reported results, and predicted the correlation percentage of "EERIE". In addition, we also constructed a word classification model that classified words into "simple", "moderate", and "difficult", and explored the relationship between the three attributes and the classification results. Finally, we calculated the percentage of players in the dataset who needed 3 or more attempts for each word. The appendix provides relevant information and problems to be solved for the mathematical modeling competition.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a monotone approximation scheme for a class of fully nonlinear degenerate partial integro-differential equations (PIDEs) which characterize the nonlinear $\alpha$-stable L\'{e}vy processes under sublinear expectation space with $\alpha \in(1,2)$. We further establish the error bounds for the monotone approximation scheme. This in turn yields an explicit Berry-Esseen bound and convergence rate for the $\alpha$-stable central limit theorem under sublinear expectation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a solution for the problem of training physics-informed networks under partial integro-differential equations. These equations require an infinite or a large number of neural evaluations to construct a single residual for training. As a result, accurate evaluation may be impractical, and we show that naive approximations at replacing these integrals with unbiased estimates lead to biased loss functions and solutions. To overcome this bias, we investigate three types of potential solutions: the deterministic sampling approaches, the double-sampling trick, and the delayed target method. We consider three classes of PDEs for benchmarking; one defining Poisson problems with singular charges and weak solutions of up to 10 dimensions, another involving weak solutions on electro-magnetic fields and a Maxwell equation, and a third one defining a Smoluchowski coagulation problem. Our numerical results confirm the existence of the aforementioned bias in practice and also show that our proposed delayed target approach can lead to accurate solutions with comparable quality to ones estimated with a large sample size integral. Our implementation is open-source and available at https://github.com/ehsansaleh/btspinn.</description>

      <title>A mesh-constrained discrete point method for incompressible flows with moving boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle-based methods are a practical tool in computational fluid dynamics, and novel types of methods have been proposed. However, widely developed Lagrangian-type formulations suffer from the nonuniform distribution of particles, which is enhanced over time and result in problems in computational efficiency and parallel computations. To mitigate these problems, a mesh-constrained discrete point (MCD) method was developed for stationary boundary problems (Matsuda et al., 2022). Although the MCD method is a meshless method that uses moving least-squares approximation, the arrangement of particles (or discrete points (DPs)) is specialized so that their positions are constrained in background meshes to obtain a closely uniform distribution. This achieves a reasonable approximation for spatial derivatives with compact stencils without encountering any ill-posed condition and leads to good performance in terms of computational efficiency. In this study, a novel meshless method based on the MCD method for incompressible flows with moving boundaries is proposed. To ensure the mesh constraint of each DP in moving boundary problems, a novel updating algorithm for the DP arrangement is developed so that the position of DPs is not only rearranged but the DPs are also reassigned the role of being on the boundary or not. The proposed method achieved reasonable results in numerical experiments for well-known moving boundary problems.</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Framework for Partial Differential Equation Constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel variational quantum framework for linear partial differential equation (PDE) constrained optimization problems. Such problems arise in many scientific and engineering domains. For instance, in aerodynamics, the PDE constraints are the conservation laws such as momentum, mass and energy balance, the design variables are vehicle shape parameters and material properties, and the objective could be to minimize the effect of transient heat loads on the vehicle or to maximize the lift-to-drag ratio. The proposed framework utilizes the variational quantum linear system (VQLS) algorithm and a black box optimizer as its two main building blocks. VQLS is used to solve the linear system, arising from the discretization of the PDE constraints for given design parameters, and evaluate the design cost/objective function. The black box optimizer is used to select next set of parameter values based on this evaluated cost, leading to nested bi-level optimization structure within a hybrid classical-quantum setting. We present detailed computational error and complexity analysis to highlight the potential advantages of our proposed framework over classical techniques. We implement our framework using the PennyLane library, apply it to a heat transfer optimization problem, and present simulation results using Bayesian optimization as the black box optimizer.</description>
