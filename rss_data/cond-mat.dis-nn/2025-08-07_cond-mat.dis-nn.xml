      <title>Direct Measurement of the Effective Electronic Temperature in Organic Semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic semiconductors show complex phenomena due to their high energetic disorder. A striking example is the possibility of an increased effective temperature T_eff of the charge carrier distribution relative to the lattice temperature, which results from the slow charge carrier relaxation after excitation, either by high electric field or photon absorption. The increased effective temperature has been linked to conductivity enhancements and performance increases in actual devices, but a direct observation has been lacking. Here, we utilize nanoscopic tree-terminal devices to measure the Seebeck voltage arising in a doped organic polymer semiconductor due to a field-driven enhancement of the effective electronic temperature, providing direct proof of the existence of T_eff. The results agree quantitatively with numerical predictions by a kinetic Monte Carlo model. The findings not only provide fundamental understanding but also indicate an avenue towards low-loss thermoelectric devices.</description>

      <title>On Random Displacements in Critical Rydberg Atom Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg atom arrays promise high-fidelity quantum simulations of critical phenomena with flexible geometries. Yet experimental realizations inevitably suffer from disorder due to random displacements of atoms, leading to departures from the expected behavior. Here, we study how such positional disorder influences the Ising criticality. Since disorder breaks the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, one might expect the system to flow to an infinite-strength disordered fixed point, erasing all nontrivial critical features in low spatial dimensions. Remarkably, we find instead that disorder in Rydberg systems is subjected to nontrivial local constraints, making the physics markedly different from systems with more conventional spatially short-range correlated or long-range correlated disorder. This leads to new classes of criticalities even at dimensions where conventional disorder would destroy criticality altogether. We then demonstrate as a consequence how a novel pseudo-criticality emerges in mesoscopic Rydberg chains, and show that the renormalization group flow is governed by a locally constrained $\mathbb{Z}_2$-breaking perturbation. Our findings uncover new disorder-driven phenomena and underscore the importance of carefully treating disorder effects in quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Universal quantum phase classification on quantum computers from machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classification of quantum phases of matter remains a fundamental challenge in condensed matter physics. We present a novel framework that combines shadow tomography with modern time-series machine learning models to enable efficient and practical quantum phase classification. Our approach leverages the definition of quantum phases based on connectivity through finite-depth local unitary circuits, generating abundant training data by applying Haar random evolution to representative quantum states for a given phase. In this way, the training data can be efficiently obtained from a quantum simulator. Additionally, we demonstrate that advanced time-series models can be used to process the training data and achieve universal quantum phase classification that does not rely on local order parameters. To validate the universality and versatility of our method, we test the model against one-dimensional quantum spin chains such as the Ising model and the axial next-nearest-neighbor Ising (ANNNI) model, showing excellent agreement with known phase boundaries.</description>

      <title>Optimal Qubit Purification and Unitary Schur Sampling via Random SWAP Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of qubit purification is to combine multiple noisy copies of an unknown pure quantum state to obtain one or more copies that are closer to the pure state. We show that a simple protocol based solely on random SWAP tests achieves the same fidelity as the Schur transform, which is optimal. This protocol relies only on elementary two-qubit SWAP tests, which project a pair of qubits onto the singlet or triplet subspaces, to identify and isolate singlet pairs, and then proceeds with the remaining qubits. For a system of $n$ qubits, we show that after approximately $T \approx n \ln n$ random SWAP tests, a sharp transition occurs: the probability of detecting any new singlet decreases exponentially with $T$. Similarly, the fidelity of each remaining qubit approaches the optimal value given by the Schur transform, up to an error that is exponentially small in $T$. More broadly, this protocol achieves what is known as weak Schur sampling and unitary Schur sampling with error $\epsilon$, after only $2n \ln(n \epsilon^{-1})$ SWAP tests. That is, it provides a lossless method for extracting any information invariant under permutations of qubits, making it a powerful subroutine for tasks such as quantum state tomography and metrology.</description>

      <title>Partial projected ensembles and spatiotemporal structure of information scrambling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermalisation and information scrambling in out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body systems are deeply intertwined: local subsystems dynamically approach thermal density matrices while their entropies track information spreading. Projected ensembles--ensembles of pure states conditioned on measurement outcomes of complementary subsystems--provide higher-order probes of thermalisation, converging at late times to universal maximum-entropy ensembles. In this work, we introduce the partial projected ensemble (PPE) as a framework to study how the spatiotemporal structure of scrambling is imprinted on projected ensembles. The PPE consists of an ensemble of mixed states induced on a subsystem by measurements on a spatially separated part of its complement, tracing out the remainder, naturally capturing scenarios involving discarded outcomes or noise-induced losses. We show that statistical fluctuations of the PPE faithfully track the causal lightcone of information spreading, revealing how scrambling dynamics are encoded in ensemble structure. In addition, we demonstrate that the probabilities of bit-string probabilities (PoPs) associated with the PPE exhibit distinct dynamical regimes and provide an experimentally accessible probe of scrambling. Both PPE fluctuations and PoPs display exponential sensitivity to the size of the discarded region, reflecting exponential degradation of quantum correlations under erasure. We substantiate these findings using the non-integrable kicked Ising chain, combining numerics in the ergodic regime with exact results at its self-dual point. We extend our analysis to a many-body localised (MBL) regime numerically, along with analytic results for the $\ell$-bit model. The linear and logarithmic lightcones characteristic of ergodic and MBL regimes emerge naturally from PPE dynamics, establishing it as a powerful tool for probing scrambling and deep thermalisation.</description>

      <title>Reentrant localization transition induced by a composite potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09572v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the localization transition in a one-dimensional system subjected to a composite potential consisting of periodic and quasi-periodic components. For the rational wave vector $\alpha=1/2$, the periodic component reduces to a staggered potential, which has been reported to induce the reentrant localization transition. In addition to $\alpha=1/2$, we find that other rational wave vectors can also lead to the reentrant phenomenon. To investigate the underlying mechanisms of the reentrant localization transition, we vary the parameters of the composite potential and find that the reentrant localization transition is sensitive to the phase factor of the periodic component. By further studying the structure of the periodic component, we confirm that this sensitivity arises from the periodic phase factor modulating the mirror symmetry. Finally, we map out a global phase diagram and reveal that the reentrant localization transition originates from a paradoxical effect: increasing the amplitude of the periodic component enhances localization but simultaneously strengthens the mirror symmetry, which favors the formation of extended states. Our numerical analysis suggests that the interplay between these competing factors drives the reentrant localization transition.</description>

      <title>Statistical mechanics of vector Hopfield network near and above saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study analytically and numerically a Hopfield fully-connected network with $d$-vector spins. These networks are models of associative memory that generalize the standard Hopfield with Ising spins. We study the equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium properties of the system, considering the system in its retrieval phase $\alpha&lt;\alpha_c$ and beyond. We derive the Replica Symmetric solution for the equilibrium thermodynamics of the system, together with its phase diagram: we find that the retrieval phase of the network shrinks with growing spin dimension, having ultimately a vanishing critical capacity $\alpha_c\propto 1/d$ in the large $d$ limit. As a trade-off, we observe that in the same limit vector Hopfield networks are able to denoise corrupted input patterns in the first step of retrieval dynamics, up to very large capacities $\widetilde{\alpha}\propto d$. We also study the static properties of the system at zero temperature, considering the statistical properties of soft modes of the energy Hessian spectrum. We find that local minima of the energy landscape related to memory states have ungapped spectra with rare soft eigenmodes: these excitations are localized, their measure condensating on the noisiest neurons of the memory state.</description>

      <title>Anomalies of global symmetries on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 't Hooft anomalies of global symmetries play a fundamental role in quantum many-body systems and quantum field theory (QFT). In this paper, we make a systematic analysis of lattice anomalies - the analog of 't Hooft anomalies in lattice systems - for which we give a precise definition. Crucially, a lattice anomaly is not a feature of a specific Hamiltonian, but rather is a topological invariant of the symmetry action. The controlled setting of lattice systems allows for a systematic and rigorous treatment of lattice anomalies, shorn of the technical challenges of QFT. We find that lattice anomalies reproduce the expected properties of QFT anomalies in many ways, but also have crucial differences. In particular, lattice anomalies and QFT anomalies are not, contrary to a common expectation, in one-to-one correspondence, and there can be non-trivial anomalies on the lattice that are infrared (IR) trivial: they admit symmetric trivial gapped ground states, and map to trivial QFT anomalies at low energies. Nevertheless, we show that lattice anomalies (including IR-trivial ones) have a number of interesting consequences in their own right, including connections to commuting projector models, phases of many-body localized (MBL) systems, and quantum cellular automata (QCA). We make substantial progress on the classification of lattice anomalies and develop several theoretical tools to characterize their consequences on symmetric Hamiltonians. Our work places symmetries of quantum many-body lattice systems into a unified theoretical framework and may also suggest new perspectives on symmetries in QFT.</description>
