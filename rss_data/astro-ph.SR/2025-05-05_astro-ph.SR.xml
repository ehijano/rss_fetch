      <title>Can planet-planet binaries survive in star-forming regions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant numbers of free-floating planetary-mass objects have been discovered in nearby star-forming regions by the James Webb Space Telescope, including a substantial number (42) of Jupiter Mass Binary Objects ('JuMBOs') in the Orion Nebula Cluster. The JuMBOs have much wider separations than other populations of substellar binaries, and their existence challenges conventional theories of substellar and planetary-mass object formation. Whilst several theories have been proposed to explain their formation, there has yet to be a study that determines whether they could survive the dynamical encounters prevalent within a dense star-forming region. We place a population of planet-planet binaries in N-body simulations of dense star-forming regions and calculate their binary fraction over time. We find that between 50-90 per cent of planet-planet binaries are destroyed on timescales of a few Myr, which implies that many more must form if we are to observe them in their current numbers. Furthermore, if the ONC was much more dense at formation, the initial separation distribution of the JuMBOs must have been even wider (and less similar to other substellar binaries) than the observed distribution.</description>

      <title>The JWST weather report from the nearest brown dwarfs II: Consistent variability mechanisms over 7 months revealed by 1-14 $\mu$m NIRSpec + MIRI monitoring of WISE 1049AB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new epoch of JWST spectroscopic variability monitoring of the benchmark binary brown dwarf WISE 1049AB, the closest, brightest brown dwarfs known. Our 8-hour MIRI low resolution spectroscopy (LRS) and 7-hour NIRSpec prism observations extended variability measurements for any brown dwarfs beyond 11 $\mu$m for the first time, reaching up to 14 $\mu$m. Combined with the previous epoch in 2023, they set the longest JWST weather monitoring baseline to date. We found that both WISE 1049AB show wavelength-dependent light curve behaviours. Using a robust k-means clustering algorithm, we identified several clusters of variability behaviours associated with three distinct pressure levels. By comparing to a general circulation model (GCM), we identified the possible mechanisms that drive the variability at these pressure levels: Patchy clouds rotating in and out of view likely shaped the dramatic light curves in the deepest layers between 1-2.5 $\mu$m, whereas hot spots arising from temperature / chemical variations of molecular species likely dominate the high-altitude levels between 2.5-3.6 $\mu$m and 4.3-8.5 $\mu$m. Small-grain silicates potentially contributed to the variability of WISE 1049A at 8.5-11 $\mu$m. While distinct atmospheric layers are governed by different mechanisms, we confirmed for the first time that each variability mechanism remains consistent within its layer over the long term. Future multi-period observations will further test the stability of variability mechanisms on this binary, and expanded JWST variability surveys across the L-T-Y sequence will allow us to trace and understand variability mechanisms across a wider population of brown dwarfs and planetary-mass objects.</description>

      <title>A High-resolution, Inversion-Based Synoptic Study of Solar Granulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The convectively driven, weakly magnetized regions of the solar photosphere dominate the Sun's surface at any given time, but the temporal variations of these quiet regions of the photosphere throughout the solar cycle are still not well known. To look for cycle-dependent changes in the convective properties of quiet Sun photosphere, we use high spatial and spectral resolution spectropolarimetric observations obtained by the Hinode Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) and apply the Spectropolarimetric Inversions Based on Response Functions (SIR) code to infer physical conditions in the lower solar photosphere. Using a homogeneous set of 49 datasets, all taken at disk center, we analyze the temperature stratification and the line-of-sight velocities of the granules and intergranules over a period of 15 years. We use a k-means clustering technique applied to the spectral profiles to segment the granules and intergranules based on both intensity and velocity. We also examine the profile bisectors of these different structures and compare these to past analyses. Our results show fairly constant properties over this period with no clear dependence on the solar cycle. We do, however, find a slight increase in the photospheric temperature gradient during the declining phase of the solar cycle. Our findings could have significant implications for understanding the coupling between the quiet Sun atmosphere and the global solar dynamo.</description>

      <title>A Survey Of Model Fits to Brown Dwarf Spectra Through the L-T Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We fit archival near-infrared spectra of 305 brown dwarfs with atmosphere models from the Sonora and Phoenix groups. Using the parameters of the best-fit models as estimates for the physical properties of the brown dwarfs in our sample, we have performed a survey of how brown dwarf atmospheres evolve with spectral type and temperature. We present the fit results and observed trends. We find that clouds have a more significant impact on near infrared spectra than disequilibrium chemistry, and that silicate clouds influence the near infrared spectrum through the late T types. We note where current atmosphere models are able to replicate the data and where the models and data conflict. We also categorize objects with similar spectral morphologies into families and discuss possible causes for their unique spectral traits. We identify two spectral families with morphologies that are likely indicative of binarity.</description>

      <title>Forecasting the solar cycle using variational data assimilation: validation on cycles 22 to 25</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecasting future solar activity has become crucial in our modern world, where intense eruptive phenomena mostly occurring during solar maximum are likely to be strongly damaging to satellites and telecommunications. We present a 4D variational assimilation technique applied for the first time to real solar data. Our method is tested against observations of past cycles 22, 23, 24 and on the ongoing cycle 25 for which we give an estimate of the imminent maximum value and timing and also provide a first forecast of the next solar minimum. We use a variational data assimilation technique applied to a solar mean-field Babcock-Leighton flux-transport dynamo model. Ensemble predictions are produced in order to obtain uncertainties on the timing and value of the maximum of cycle $n+1$, when data on cycle $n$ is assimilated. We study in particular the influence of the phase during which data is assimilated in the model and of the weighting of various terms in the objective function. The method is validated on cycles 22, 23 and 24 with very satisfactory results. For cycle 25, predictions vary depending on the extent of the assimilation window but start converging past 2022 to a solar maximum reached between mid-2024 up to the beginning of 2025 with a sunspot number value of $143.1 \pm 15.0$. Relatively close values of the maximum are found in both hemispheres within a time lag of a few months. We also forecast a next minimum around late 2029, with still significant errorbars. The data assimilation technique presented here combining a physics-based model and real solar observations produces promising results for future solar activity forecasting.</description>

      <title>Enhancing MHD model accuracy and CME forecasting by constraining coronal plasma properties with Faraday rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Faraday rotation measurements of extragalactic radio sources occulted by the solar corona serve as a powerful complementary tool for probing the pre-eruption electron density and magnetic field structure. These measurements thereby allow us to refine predictions from global MHD models. In this paper, we discuss our recent study of the morphological evolution of a CME-driven shock event that occurred on August 3, 2012. Our analysis used white-light coronagraphic observations from three different vantage points in space (SOHO and STEREO A and B). Obtaining data from these spacecraft, we derived key parameters such as the radius of curvature of the driving flux rope, the shock speed, and the standoff distance from the CMEs' leading edge. A notable feature of this event was the availability of rare Faraday rotation measurements of a group of extragalactic radio sources occulted by the solar corona, which were obtained a few hours before the eruption. These observations from the VLA radio interferometer provide independent information on the integrated product of the line-of-sight magnetic field component and electron density. By modeling the shock standoff distance and using constraints from the Faraday rotation measurements, we achieve a high level of agreement between the fast-mode Mach number predicted by the Magnetohydrodynamic Algorithm outside a Sphere (MAS) code in its thermodynamic mode and the value deduced from the analysis of the 3D reconstruction of coronagraphic data, provided that appropriate correction factors (f_b = 2.4 and f_n = 0.5) are applied in advance to scale the simulated magnetic field and electron density, respectively. Our results are consistent with previous estimates and provide critical information for fine-tuning future MHD simulations.</description>

      <title>Benchmark stars for mean stellar density and surface gravity estimates of solar-type stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adding an independent estimate of the mean stellar density, $\rho_{\star}$, as a constraint in the analysis of stars that host transiting exoplanets can significantly improve the precision of the planet radius estimate in cases where the light curve is too noisy to yield an accurate value of the transit impact parameter, e.g. the light curves of Earth-size planets orbiting in the habitable zone of Sun-like stars that will be obtained by the PLATO mission. I have compiled a sample of 36 solar-type stars for which analysis of high-quality light curves together with constraints on the orbital eccentricity yield mean stellar density measurements with a median error of 2.3%. Of these, 8 are in transiting exoplanet systems and 28 in eclipsing binary systems with very low mass companions that contribute &lt;0.1% of the total flux in the V band. A re-calibrated empirical relation for stellar mass as a function of T$_{\rm eff}$, $\rho_{\star}$ and [Fe/H] has been used to find mass estimates with a typical precision of 5.2% for the stars in this sample. Examples are given of how this sample can be used to test the accuracy and precision of $\rho_{\star}$ and log(g) estimates from catalogues of stellar parameters for solar-type stars.</description>

      <title>Probing the Cores of Subdwarf B Stars: How do They Compare to Cores in Helium Core-Burning Red Giants?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mixing of material from stellar convective cores into their adjacent radiative layers has been a matter of long-standing debate. Pulsating subdwarf B stars offer excellent conditions to advance our understanding of this problem. In this work we use a model-independent approach to infer information about the cores of three subdwarf B stars and compare it with similar inferences from earlier analysis of red giants in the helium core-burning phase. This is achieved by fitting an analytical description of the gravity-mode pulsation periods to pulsation data collected by the Kepler satellite. From the fits we infer the reduced asymptotic period spacings and the amplitude and position of sharp structural variations associated with chemical discontinuities in the stellar interiors. Our results indicate the presence of sharp structural variations with similar properties in all three stars, located near the edge of the gravity-mode propagation cavity and likely associated with the C-O/He transition. We find that these structural variations differ systematically from those of helium core-burning red giant stars, having larger amplitudes and being located at a larger buoyancy radius. This suggests that chemical mixing beyond the adiabatically stratified core into the radiatively stratified layers may be more extensive in subdwarf B stars than in helium core-burning red giants. Alternatively, the stratification of the mixing region beyond the adiabatically stratified core may differ significantly between the two types of stars. The model-independent constraints set on the structural variations inside these three stars are the first of a kind and will be key to enhance the modelling of layers adjacent to stellar convective cores and to test non-canonical stellar evolution channels leading to the formation of hot subdwarf stars.</description>

      <title>Power Laws Associated with Self-Organized Criticality: A Comparison of Empirical Data with Model Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relevance of {\sl self-organized criticality (SOC)} models in previously published empirical datasets, which includes statistical observations in astrophysics, geophysics, biophysics, sociophysics, and informatics. We study 25 interdisciplinary phenomena with five different event detection and power law fitting methods. The total number of analyzed size distributions amounts to 64 cases, of which 80\% are found to be nearly consistent ($\alpha_s=1.99\pm0.30$) with the SOC model predictions. The fractal-diffusive SOC model predicts power law slopes of $\alpha_F=(9/5)=1.80$ for the flux $F$, $\alpha_E=(5/3)\sim1.67$ for the fluence or energy $E$, and $\alpha_T=2.00$ for the avalanche duration $T$. We find that the phenomena of solar flares, earthquakes, and forest fires are consistent with the theoretical predictions, while the size distributions of other phenomena are not conclusive due to neglected background treatment, inadequacy of power law fitting range, small-number statistics, and finite-system size effects.</description>

      <title>Modeling Metric Gyrosynchrotron Radio Emission From the Quiet Solar Corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The radio emission of the quiet Sun in the metric and decametric bands has not been well studied historically due to limitations of existing instruments. It is nominally dominated by thermal brehmsstrahlung of the solar corona, but may also include significant gyrosynchrotron emission, usually assumed to be weak under quiet conditions. In this work, we investigate the expected gyrosynchrotron contribution to solar radio emission in the lowest radio frequencies observable by ground instruments, for different regions of the low and middle corona. We approximate the coronal conditions by a synoptic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model. The thermal emission is estimated from a forward model based on the simulated corona. We calculate the expected gyrosynchrotron emission with the Fast Gyrosynchrotron Codes framework by Fleishman &amp; Kuznetsov (2010). The model emissions of different coronal regions are compared with quiet-time observations between 20-90 MHz by the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) radio telescope. The contribution of gyrosynchrotron radiation to low frequency solar radio emission may shed light on effects such as the hitherto unexplained brightness variation observed in decametric coronal hole emission, and help constrain measurements of the coronal magnetic fields. It can also improve our understanding of electron populations in the middle corona and their relation to the formation of the solar wind.</description>
