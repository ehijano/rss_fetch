      <title>The strain-stiffening critical exponents in polymer networks and their universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disordered athermal biopolymer materials, such as collagen networks that constitute a major component in extracellular matrices and various connective tissues, are initially soft and compliant but stiffen dramatically under strain. Such network materials are topologically sub-isostatic and feature strong rigidity scale separation between the bending and stretching response of the constituent polymer fibers. Recently, a comprehensive scaling theory of the athermal strain-stiffening phase transition has been developed, providing predictions for all critical exponents characterising the transition in terms of the distance to the critical strain and of the small rigidity scales ratio. Here, we employ large-scale computer simulations, at and away from criticality, to test the analytic predictions. We find that all numerical critical exponents are in quantitative agreement with the analytically-predicted ones. Moreover, we find that all predicted exponents remain valid whether the driving strain is shear, i.e., volume-preserving, or dilation, and independent of the degree of the network's sub-isostaticity, thus establishing the universality of the strain-stiffening phase transition with respect to the symmetry of the driving strain and the network's topology.</description>

      <title>Quantum conditional mutual information as a probe of measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose that the quantum conditional mutual information (QCMI), computed with a suitably chosen partition of the system, serves as a powerful probe for detecting measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions in monitored quantum circuits. To demonstrate this, we investigate monitored variable-range Clifford circuits and identify the phase boundary between volume-law and area-law entanglement phases by performing finite-size scaling analyses of the QCMI. Assuming that the entanglement entropy exhibits a logarithmic dependence on system size at criticality in short-range interacting cases, we further show that the QCMI allows for the simultaneous determination of both the critical point and the universal coefficient of the logarithmic term in the entanglement entropy via a crossing-point analysis. For the shortest-range interacting case studied, we obtain the thermodynamic-limit value of the coefficient as $\tilde{c}=1.519(3)$, which is significantly smaller than values reported in previous studies.</description>

      <title>Towards data analysis with diagrammatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systems with many interacting stochastic constituents are fully characterized by their free energy. Computing this quantity is therefore the objective of various approaches, notably perturbative expansions, which are applied in problems ranging from high-dimensional statistics to complex systems. However, a lot of these techniques are complicated to apply in practice because they lack a sufficient organization of the terms of the perturbative series. In this manuscript, we tackle this problem by using Feynman diagrams, extending a framework introduced earlier to the case of free energies at fixed variances. These diagrammatics do not require the theory to expand around to be Gaussian, which allows its application to the free energy of a spin system studied to derive message-passing algorithms by Maillard et al. 2019. We complete their perturbative derivation of the free energy in the thermodynamic limit. Furthermore, we derive resummations to estimate the entropies of poorly sampled systems requiring only limited statistics and we revisit earlier approaches to compute the free energy of the Ising model, revealing new insights due to the extension of our framework to the free energy at fixed variances. We expect our approach to be useful also for future applications, notably for problems of high-dimensional statistics, like matrix factorization, and the study of complex networks.</description>

      <title>Data assimilation for networks of coupled oscillators: Inferring unknown model parameters from partial observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03545v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inferring the state and unknown parameters of a network of coupled oscillators is of utmost importance. This task is made harder when only partial and noisy observations are available, which is a typical scenario in realistic high-dimensional systems. The general task of inference falls under data assimilation, and a commonly used assimilation method is the Ensemble Kalman Filter. Employing network-specific localization of the forecast covariance, an Ensemble Kalman Filter with state space augmentation is shown to yield highly accurate estimates of both the oscillator phases and unknown model parameters in the case where only a subset of oscillator phases are observed. In contrast, standard data assimilation methods yield poor results. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for Kuramoto oscillators and for networks of theta neurons, using a variety of network topologies.</description>

      <title>A universal approximation theorem for nonlinear resistive networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15063v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resistor networks have recently been studied as analog computing platforms for machine learning, particularly due to their compatibility with the Equilibrium Propagation training framework. In this work, we explore the computational capabilities of these networks. We prove that electrical networks consisting of voltage sources, linear resistors, diodes, and voltage-controlled voltage sources (VCVSs) can approximate any continuous function to arbitrary precision. Central to our proof is a method for translating a neural network with rectified linear units into an approximately equivalent electrical network comprising these four elements. Our proof relies on two assumptions: (a) that circuit elements are ideal, and (b) that variable resistor conductances and VCVS amplification factors can take any value (arbitrarily small or large). Our findings provide insights that could guide the development of universal self-learning electrical networks.</description>

      <title>How Feature Learning Can Improve Neural Scaling Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a solvable model of neural scaling laws beyond the kernel limit. Theoretical analysis of this model shows how performance scales with model size, training time, and the total amount of available data. We identify three scaling regimes corresponding to varying task difficulties: hard, easy, and super easy tasks. For easy and super-easy target functions, which lie in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) defined by the initial infinite-width Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), the scaling exponents remain unchanged between feature learning and kernel regime models. For hard tasks, defined as those outside the RKHS of the initial NTK, we demonstrate both analytically and empirically that feature learning can improve scaling with training time and compute, nearly doubling the exponent for hard tasks. This leads to a different compute optimal strategy to scale parameters and training time in the feature learning regime. We support our finding that feature learning improves the scaling law for hard tasks but not for easy and super-easy tasks with experiments of nonlinear MLPs fitting functions with power-law Fourier spectra on the circle and CNNs learning vision tasks.</description>

      <title>Effects of dissipation in reservoir computing using a spin qubit array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) is one of the hottest research topic as an application of many physical devices because the device characteristics can be used directly in computing sequences. Quantum RC is also a promising candidate for application in small-number qubit systems. Here, we propose a quantum RC based on the spin qubit system that reflects the status of the spin qubits in experiments comprising a one-dimensional qubit array. Spin qubits are coupled via the Heisenberg interaction, and data sequences are inputted to one of the spin qubits via pulsed rotations. By introducing dissipation, we obtained a relatively good performance in the quantum RC.</description>
