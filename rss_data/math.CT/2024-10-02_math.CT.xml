      <title>Equivalences in diagrammatic sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that diagrammatic sets, a topologically sound alternative to polygraphs and strict $\omega$-categories, admit an internal notion of equivalence in the sense of coinductive weak invertibility. We prove that equivalences have the expected properties: they include all degenerate cells, are closed under 2-out-of-3, and satisfy an appropriate version of the "division lemma", which ensures that enwrapping a diagram with equivalences at all sides is an invertible operation up to higher equivalence. On the way to this result, we develop methods, such as an algebraic calculus of natural equivalences, for handling the weak units and unitors which set this framework apart from strict $\omega$-categories.</description>

      <title>Fibrational perspectives on determinization of finite-state automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colcombet and Petri\c{s}an argued that automata may be usefully considered from a functorial perspective, introducing a general notion of "$\mathcal{V}$-automaton" based on functors into $\mathcal{V}$. This enables them to recover different standard notions of automata by choosing $\mathcal{V}$ appropriately, and they further analyzed the determinization for \textbf{Rel}-automata using the Kleisli adjunction between \textbf{Set} and \textbf{Rel}. In this paper, we revisit Colcombet and Petri\c{s}an's analysis from a fibrational perspective, building on Melli\`es and Zeilberger's recent alternative but related definition of categorical automata as functors $p : \mathcal{Q} \to \mathcal{C}$ satisfying the finitary fiber and unique lifting of factorizations property. In doing so, we improve the understanding of determinization in three regards: Firstly, we carefully describe the universal property of determinization in terms of forward-backward simulations. Secondly, we generalize the determinization procedure for \textbf{Rel} automata using a local adjunction between \textbf{SpanSet} and \textbf{Rel}, which provides us with a canonical forward simulation. Finally we also propose an alterative determinization based on the multiset relative adjunction which retains paths, and we leverage this to provide a canonical forward-backward simulation.</description>

      <title>Stratified Toposes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce stratified toposes, which are toposes that are stratified by a suitable hierarchy of universes. The term `stratified topos' recalls the notion of stratified pseudotopos of Moerdijk and Palmgren (2002). However, the details of our proposal are closer to that of Streicher (2005), with the foundational contribution being a strengthening of Streicher's axioms. As such, stratified toposes model the calculus of constructions.
  Key results about toposes can be refined to yield results about stratified toposes. As proof of concept, we construct what we call the stratified topos of coalgebras for a stratified Cartesian comonad on a stratified topos. This construction refines that of the topos of coalgebras for a Cartesian comonad on a topos. Coalgebra constructions in related settings were given by Warren (2007) and Zwanziger (2023).
  This coalgebra construction exposes conditions under which generic monomorphisms and dense subcategories can be lifted to coalgebras, which are extracted in the appendix.</description>

      <title>Formal extension of noncommutative tensor-triangular support varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a support variety theory defined on the compact part of a monoidal triangulated category, we define an extension to the non-compact part following the blueprint of Benson--Carlson--Rickard, Benson--Iyengar--Krause, Balmer--Favi, and Stevenson. We generalize important aspects of the theory of extended support varieties to the noncommutative case, and give characterizations of when an extended support theory detects the zero object, under certain assumptions. In particular, we show that when the original support variety theory is based on a Noetherian topological space, detects the zero object, satisfies a generalized tensor product property, and comes equipped with a comparison map, then the extended support variety also detects the zero object. In the case of stable categories of finite tensor categories, this gives conditions under which the central cohomological support admits an extension that detects the zero object, confirming part of a recent conjecture made by the second author together with Nakano and Yakimov.</description>

      <title>Coloring Trivalent Graphs: A Defect TFT Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the combinatorial matter of graph coloring is, in fact, quantum in the sense of satisfying the sum over all the possible intermediate state properties of a path integral. In our case, the topological field theory (TFT) with defects gives meaning to it. This TFT has the property that when evaluated on a planar trivalent graph, it provides the number of Tait-Coloring of it. Defects can be considered as a generalization of groups. With the Klein-four group as a 1-defect condition, we reinterpret graph coloring as sections of a certain bundle, distinguishing a coloring (global-sections) from a coloring process (local-sections.) These constructions also lead to an interpretation of the word problem, for a finitely presented group, as a cobordism problem and a generalization of (trivial) bundles at the level of higher categories.</description>

      <title>Orbifolds of Pointed Vertex Operator Algebras I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By a pointed vertex operator algebra (VOA) we mean one whose modules are all simple currents (i.e. invertible), e.g. lattice VOAs. This paper systematically explores the interplay between their orbifolds and tensor category theory. We begin by supplying an elementary proof of the Dijkgraaf-Witten conjecture, which predicts the representation theory of holomorphic VOA orbifolds. We then apply that argument more generally to the situation where the automorphism subgroup fixes all VOA modules, and relate the result to recent work of Mason-Ng and Naidu. Here our results are complete. We then turn to the other extreme, where the automorphisms act fixed-point freely on the modules, and realize any possible nilpotent group as lattice VOA automorphisms. This affords a considerable generalization of the Tambara-Yamagami categories. We conclude by considering some hybrid actions. In this way we use tensor category theory to organize and generalize systematically several isolated examples and special cases scattered in the literature. Conversely, we show how VOA orbifolds can be used to construct broad classes of braided crossed fusion categories and modular tensor categories.</description>

      <title>Compatible weak factorization systems and model structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper the concept of compatible weak factorization systems in general categories is introduced as a counterpart of compatible complete cotorsion pairs in abelian categories. We describe a method to construct model structures on general categories via two compatible weak factorization systems satisfying certain conditions, and hence generalize a very useful result by Gillespie for abelian model structures. As particular examples, we show that weak factorizations systems associated to some classical model structures (for example, the Kan-Quillen model structure on $\mathsf{sSet}$) satisfy these conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.17062v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a localization of a smooth proper category along a subcategory preserved by the Serre functor, we show that morphisms in Efimov's algebraizable categorical formal punctured neighborhood of infinity can be computed using the natural cone between right and left adjoints of the localization functor. In particular, this recovers the following result of Ganatra--Gao--Venkatesh: morphisms in categorical formal punctured neighborhoods of wrapped Fukaya categories are computed by Rabinowitz wrapping.</description>

      <title>Singularity categories of rational double points in arbitrary characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02532v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a one-to-one correspondence between the singularity categories of rational double points and the simply-laced Dynkin graphs in arbitrary characteristic. This correspondence is well-known in characteristic zero since the rational double points are quotient singularities in characteristic zero whereas not necessarily in positive characteristic. Considering some rational double points are not taut in characteristic two, three or five, we can see there exist two rational double points which are not analytically isomorphic but whose singularity categories are triangulated equivalent. As an application, we construct a counter-example in positive characteristic of a theorem of Hua and Keller: the dg singularity category of a hypersurface singularity determines its Tyurina algebra.</description>
