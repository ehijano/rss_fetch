      <title>Diagnosing Biases in Tropical Atlantic-Pacific Multi-Decadal Teleconnections Across CMIP6 and E3SM Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decadal-scale interactions between the tropical Atlantic and Pacific Oceans play a crucial role in global climate variability through bidirectional teleconnections. Current climate models show persistent biases in representing these basin interactions, particularly in simulating the Atlantic's influence on Pacific climate. Using historical simulations from 27 CMIP6 models and two configurations of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) during 1950-2015, we systematically evaluate tropical Atlantic-Pacific teleconnections through both Walker circulation and extratropical wave responses. Most models exhibit Pacific-dominated teleconnections, contradicting observational evidence of Atlantic control on Pacific variability during the past 40 years. By developing a performance metric that combines tropical circulation patterns and extratropical wave propagation, we identify two distinct model behaviors: high-skill models capture the bidirectional Atlantic-Pacific teleconnections with a secondary symptom of systematic 20-degree westward shifts in convective centers, while low-skill models display amplified Pacific dominance through reversed Walker circulation responses warming in both tropical basins. Comparative analysis between standard E3SMv2 and its multi-scale modeling framework configuration demonstrates that implementing more sophisticated cloud-scale processes alone, with limited model tuning, cannot resolve these teleconnection biases. Our results identify four CMIP6 models and E3SMv2 that effectively reproduce observed teleconnection pathways, offering a comprehensive diagnostic framework for evaluating decadal Atlantic-Pacific interactions in climate models.</description>

      <title>An ab initio spectroscopic model of the molecular oxygen atmospheric and infrared bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified variational treatment of the magnetic dipole matrix elements, Einstein coefficients and line strength for general open-shell diatomic molecules in the general purpose diatomic code Duo. Building on previous work in which similar expressions for the electric quadrupole transitions were developed, we also present a complete ab initio spectroscopic model for the infrared, electric dipole-forbidden, spectrum of the $^{16}$O$_2$ molecule. The model covers seven states, namely the X $^3\Sigma^-_g$, a $^1\Delta_g$, b $^1\Sigma^+_g$, I $^1\Pi_g$, II $^1\Pi_g$, I $^3\Pi_g$ and II $^3\Pi_g$ states, for which 7 potential energy, 6 electronic angular momentum, 7 spin-orbit, and 14 quadrupole moment curves are calculated using ic-MRCI theory and an aug-cc-pV5Z basis set. These curves are diabatised to remove avoided crossings between the excited $\Pi$ states, and the resultant properties are used to produce a line list for higher-order transitions of astrophysical interest.</description>

      <title>Hybrid machine learning data assimilation for marine biogeochemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Marine biogeochemistry models are critical for forecasting, as well as estimating ecosystem responses to climate change and human activities. Data assimilation (DA) improves these models by aligning them with real-world observations, but marine biogeochemistry DA faces challenges due to model complexity, strong nonlinearity, and sparse, uncertain observations. Existing DA methods applied to marine biogeochemistry struggle to update unobserved variables effectively, while ensemble-based methods are computationally too expensive for high-complexity marine biogeochemistry models. This study demonstrates how machine learning (ML) can improve marine biogeochemistry DA by learning statistical relationships between observed and unobserved variables. We integrate ML-driven balancing schemes into a 1D prototype of a system used to forecast marine biogeochemistry in the North-West European Shelf seas. ML is applied to predict (i) state-dependent correlations from free-run ensembles and (ii), in an ``end-to-end'' fashion, analysis increments from an Ensemble Kalman Filter. Our results show that ML significantly enhances updates for previously not-updated variables when compared to univariate schemes akin to those used operationally. Furthermore, ML models exhibit moderate transferability to new locations, a crucial step toward scaling these methods to 3D operational systems. We conclude that ML offers a clear pathway to overcome current computational bottlenecks in marine biogeochemistry DA and that refining transferability, optimizing training data sampling, and evaluating scalability for large-scale marine forecasting, should be future research priorities.</description>

      <title>Formation of Near-surface Atmospheric Inversion and Surface Inversion in Hothouse Climates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A hothouse climate may develop throughout Earth's history and its warming future and on potentially habitable exoplanets near the inner edge of the habitable zone. Previous studies suggested that near-surface atmospheric inversion (NAIV) with planetary boundary air temperature being higher than the air temperature adjacent to the surface, is a pronounced phenomenon in hothouse climates. However, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here we show that lower-tropospheric radiative heating is necessary but not independently sufficient in forming the NAIV. Instead, the dynamic heating induced by large-scale subsidence is essential. With the prescribed reasonable large-scale subsidence, NAIV appears in small-domain cloud-resolving simulations, which was not observed in previous studies. Surface evaporative cooling also contributes to the formation of the NAIV. Besides NAIV, we find that surface inversion (SIV) with the air adjacent to the surface being warmer than the underlying sea surface is also a distinct phenomenon in hothouse climates. SIV is caused by strong surface evaporative cooling and large atmospheric shortwave absorption. These two types of inversion strongly stabilize the atmosphere, weaken atmospheric circulation, dry the free troposphere, and suppress the hydrological cycle.</description>

      <title>Could NeuralGCM effectively simulate future heatwaves? A case study based on the 2021 Pacific Northwest heatwave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09120v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI-based weather and climate models are emerging as accurate and computationally efficient tools. Beyond weather forecasting, they also show promise to accelerate storyline analyses. We evaluate NeuralGCM's ability to simulate an extreme heatwave against a physics-based climate model. NeuralGCM accurately replicates the targeted event, and generates stable and realistic mid-century projections. However, due to the absence of land feedbacks, NeuralGCM underestimates the projected warming amplitude compared to physics-based model references.</description>

      <title>POD-Galerkin Reduced Order Modeling of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reduced order modeling (ROM) aims to mitigate computational complexity by reducing the size of a high-dimensional state space. In this study, we demonstrate the efficiency, accuracy, and stability of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)-Galerkin ROM when applied to the El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation model, which integrates coupled atmosphere, ocean, and sea surface temperature (SST) mechanisms in the equatorial Pacific. While POD identifies the most energetic modes of a system from simulation data, the Galerkin projection maps the governing equations onto these reduced modes to derive a simplified dynamical system. Leveraging the unique coupling properties of the model, we propose a novel approach to formulate a reduced order model derived from Galerkin projection. Our approach achieves remarkable computational efficiency, requiring only four POD modes. The results provide highly stable and accurate solutions over 95% compared to the high-dimensional full-order model (FOM), highlighting the potential of POD-Galerkin reduction for efficient and accurate climate simulations.</description>

      <title>Slowing Climate Change and Ocean Acidification by Converting Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide to Graphite (CD2G)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere may slow climate change and ocean acidification. My approach converts atmospheric carbon dioxide into graphite (CD2G). The net profit for this conversion is ~$381/ton CO2 removed from the atmosphere. At the gigaton scale, CD2G factories will increase the affordability and availability of graphite. Since graphite can be used to make thermal batteries and electrodes for fuel cells and batteries, CD2G factories will help lower the cost of storing renewable energy, which will accelerate the transition to renewable energy. Replacing fossil fuel energy with renewable energy will slow the release of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, also slowing climate change. Converting atmospheric carbon dioxide into graphite will both generate a profit and slow climate change.</description>
