      <title>A Systematic Approach to Crossing Numbers of Cartesian Products with Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the crossing numbers of Cartesian products of small graphs with arbitrarily large paths has been an ongoing topic of research since the 1970s. Doing so requires the establishment of coincident upper and lower bounds; the former is usually demonstrated by providing a suitable drawing procedure, while the latter often requires substantial theoretical arguments. Many such papers have been published, which typically focus on just one or two small graphs at a time, and use ad hoc arguments specific to those graphs. We propose a general approach which, when successful, establishes the required lower bound. This approach can be applied to the Cartesian product of any graph with arbitrarily large paths, and in each case involves solving a modified version of the crossing number problem on a finite number (typically only two or three) of small graphs. We demonstrate the potency of this approach by applying it to Cartesian products involving all 133 graphs $G$ of orders five or six, and show that it is successful in 128 cases. This includes 60 cases which a recent survey listed as either undetermined, or determined only in journals without adequate peer review.</description>

      <title>On the number of H-free hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two central problems in extremal combinatorics are concerned with estimating the number $ex(n,H)$, the size of the largest $H$-free hypergraph on $n$ vertices, and the number $forb(n,H)$ of $H$-free hypergraph on $n$ vertices. While it is known that $forb(n,H)=2^{(1+o(1))ex(n,H)}$ for $k$-uniform hypergraphs that are not $k$-partite, estimates for hypergraphs that are $k$-partite (or degenerate) are not nearly as tight.
  In a recent breakthrough, Ferber, McKinley, and Samotij proved that for many degenerate hypergraphs $H$, $forb(n, H) = 2^{O(ex(n,H))}$. However, there are few known instances of degenerate hypergraphs $H$ for which $forb(n,H)=2^{(1+o(1))ex(n,H)}$ holds.
  In this paper, we show that $forb(n,H)=2^{(1+o(1))ex(n,H)}$ holds for a wide class of degenerate hypergraphs known as $2$-contractible hypertrees. This is the first known infinite family of degenerate hypergraphs $H$ for which $forb(n,H)=2^{(1+o(1))ex(n,H)}$ holds. As a corollary of our main results, we obtain a surprisingly sharp estimate of $forb(n,C^{(k)}_\ell)=2^{(\lfloor\frac{\ell-1}{2}\rfloor+o(1))\binom{n}{k-1}}$ for the $k$-uniform linear $\ell$-cycle, for all pairs $k\geq 5, \ell\geq 3$, thus settling a question of Balogh, Narayanan, and Skokan affirmatively for all $k\geq 5, \ell\geq 3$. Our methods also lead to some related sharp results on the corresponding random Turan problem.
  As a key ingredient of our proofs, we develop a novel supersaturation variant of the delta systems method for set systems, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>The asymptotic repetition threshold of sequences rich in palindromes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The asymptotic critical exponent measures for a sequence the maximum repetition rate of factors of growing length. The infimum of asymptotic critical exponents of sequences of a certain class is called the asymptotic repetition threshold of that class. On the one hand, if we consider the class of all d-ary sequences with d greater than one, then the asymptotic repetition threshold is equal to one, independently of the alphabet size. On the other hand, for the class of episturmian sequences, the repetition threshold depends on the alphabet size. We focus on rich sequences, i.e., sequences whose factors contain the maximum possible number of distinct palindromes. The class of episturmian sequences forms a subclass of rich sequences. We prove that the asymptotic repetition threshold for the class of rich recurrent d-ary sequences, with d greater than one, is equal to two, independently of the alphabet size.</description>

      <title>Deformed Homogeneous $(s,t)$-Rogers-Szeg\"{o} Polynomials and the Deformed $(s,t)$-Exponential Operator e$_{s,t}(y{\rm T}_a D_{s,t},v)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces the deformed homogeneous $(s,t)$-Rogers-Szeg\"o polynomials h$_{n}(x,y;s,t,u,v)$. These polynomials are a generalization of the Rogers-Szeg\"o polynomials and the $(p,q)$-Rogers-Szeg\"o polynomials defined by Jagannathan. By using the deformed $(s,t)$-exponential operator based on operator T$_{a}D_{s,t}$ we find identities involving the polynomials h$_{n}(x,y;s,t,u,v)$, together with generalizations of the Mehler and Rogers formulas. In addition, a generating function for the polynomials h$_{n}(x,y;s,t,u,v)$ is found employing the deformed $\frac{\varphi}{u}$-commuting operators. A representation of deformed $(s,t)$-exponential function as the limit of a sequence of deformed $(s,t)$-Rogers-Szeg\"o polynomials is obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe all inequalities among generalized diagonals in positive semi-definite matrices. These turn out to be governed by a simple partial order on the symmetric group. This provides an analogue of results of Drake, Gerrish, and Skandera on inequalities among generalized diagonals in totally nonnegative matrices.</description>

      <title>Nearly optimal coloring of some C4-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A class ${\cal G}$ of graphs is $\chi$-{\em polydet} if ${\cal G}$ has a polynomial binding function $f$ and there is a polynomial time algorithm to determine an $f(\omega(G))$-coloring of $G\in {\cal G}$. Let $P_t$ and $C_t$ denote a path and a cycle on $t$ vertices, respectively. A {\em bull} consists of a triangle with two disjoint pendant edges, a {\em hammer} is obtained by identifying an end of $P_3$ with a vertex of a triangle, a {\em fork$^+$} is obtained from $K_{1, 3}$ by subdividing an edge twice. Let $H$ be a bull or a hammer, and $F$ be a $P_7$ or a fork$^+$. We determine all $(C_3, C_4, F)$-free graphs without clique cutsets and universal cliques, and present a close relation between $(C_4, F, H)$-free graphs and the Petersen graph. As a consequence, we show that the classes of $(C_4, F, H)$-free graphs are $\chi$-polydet with nearly optimal linear binding functions.</description>

      <title>Spectral bounds of multi-way Cheeger constants via cyclomatic number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a non-trivial extension of the celebrated Cheeger inequality, the higher-order Cheeger inequalities for graphs due to Lee, Oveis Gharan and Trevisan provide for each $k$ an upper bound for the $k$-way Cheeger constant in forms of $C(k)\sqrt{\lambda_k(G)}$, where $\lambda_k(G)$ is the $k$-th eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian and $C(k)$ is a constant depending only on $k$. In this article, we prove some new bounds for multi-way Cheeger constants. By shifting the index of the eigenvalue via cyclomatic number, we establish upper bound estimates with an absolute constant instead of $C(k)$. This, in particular, gives a more direct proof of Miclo's higher order Cheeger inequalities on trees. We also show a new lower bound of the multi-way Cheeger constants in terms of the spectral radius of the graph. The proofs involve the concept of discrete nodal domains and a probability argument showing generic properties of eigenfunctions.</description>

      <title>New boundes for Sombor index of Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we find some bounds for the Sombor index of the graph G by triangle inequality, arithmetic index, geometric index, forgotten index (F(G)), arithmetic-geometric (AG) index, geometric-arithmetic (GA) index, symmetric division deg index (SDD(G)) and some central and dispersion indices. The bounds could state estimated values and error intervals of the Sombor index to show limits of accuracy. The error intervals are written as inequalities.</description>

      <title>Connected graphs with large multiplicity of $-1$ in the spectrum of the eccentricity matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The eccentricity matrix of a simple connected graph is obtained from the distance matrix by only keeping the largest distances for each row and each column, whereas the remaining entries become zero. This matrix is also called the anti-adjacency matrix, since the adjacency matrix can also be obtained from the distance matrix but this time by keeping only the entries equal to $1$. It is known that, for $\lambda \not\in \{-1,0\}$ and a fixed $i\in \mathbb{N}$, there is only a finite number of graphs with $n$ vertices having $\lambda$ as an eigenvalue of multiplicity $n-i$ on the spectrum of the adjacency matrix. This phenomenon motivates researchers to consider the graphs has a large multiplicity of an eigenvalue in the spectrum of the eccentricity matrix, for example, the eigenvalue $-2$ [X. Gao, Z. Stani\'{c}, J.F. Wang, Grahps with large multiplicity of $-2$ in the spectrum of the eccentricity matrix, Discrete Mathematics, 347 (2024) 114038]. In this paper, we characterize the connected graphs with $n$ vertices having $-1$ as an eigenvalue of multiplicity $n-i$ $(i\leq5)$ in the spectrum of the eccentricity matrix. Our results also become meaningful in the framework of the median eigenvalue problem [B. Mohar, Median eigenvalues and the HOMO-LUMO index of graphs, Journal of Combinatorial Theory Series B, 112 (2015) 78-92].</description>

      <title>Variations on a theme of empty polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a set $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, an empty polytope has vertices in $S$ but contains no other point of $S$. Empty polytopes are closely related to so-called Helly numbers, which extend Helly's theorem to more general point sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We improve bounds on the number of vertices in empty polytopes in exponential lattices, arithmetic congruence sets, and 2-syndetic sets.
  We also study hollow polytopes, which have vertices in $S$ and no points of $S$ in their interior. We obtain bounds on the number of vertices in hollow polytopes under certain conditions, such as the vertices being in general position.
  Finally, we obtain relatively tight asymptotic bounds for polytopes which do not contain lattice segments of large length.</description>

      <title>Non-empty intersection of longest paths in $P_5$-free and claw-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family $\mathcal{F}$ of graphs is a \textit{Gallai family} if for every connected graph $G\in \mathcal{F}$, all longest paths in $G$ have a common vertex. While it is not known whether $P_5$-free graphs are a Gallai family, Long Jr., Milans, and Munaro [The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics, 2023] showed that this is \emph{not} the case for the class of claw-free graphs. We give a complete characterization of the graphs $H$ of size at most five for which $(\text{claw}, H)$-free graphs form a Gallai family. We also show that $(P_5, H)$-free graphs form a Gallai family if $H$ is a triangle, a paw, or a diamond. Both of our results are constructive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A 1971 conjecture of Graham (later repeated by Erd\H{o}s and Graham) asserts that every set $A \subseteq \mathbb{F}_p \setminus \{0\}$ has an ordering whose partial sums are all distinct. We prove this conjecture for sets of size $|A| \leqslant e^{(\log p)^{1/4}}$; our result improves the previous bound of $\log p/\log \log p$. One ingredient in our argument is a structure theorem involving dissociated sets, which may be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: We study the probability distribution of the number of common zeros of a system of $m$ random $n$-variate polynomials over a finite commutative ring $R$. We compute the expected number of common zeros of a system of polynomials over $R$. Then, in the case that $R$ is a field, under a necessary-and-sufficient condition on the sample space, we show that the number of common zeros is binomially distributed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The determinant of an anti-symmetric matrix $g$ is the square of its Pfaffian, which like the determinant is a polynomial in the entries of $g$. Studies of certain super conformal field theories (of class S) suggested a conjectural generalization of this, predicting that each of a series of other polynomials in the entries of $g$ also admit polynomial square roots. Among other consequences, this conjecture led to a characterization of the local Hitchin image for type D. Several important special cases had been established previously. In this paper we prove the conjecture in full.</description>

Abstract: The Holant theorem is a powerful tool for studying the computational complexity of counting problems in the Holant framework. Due to the great expressiveness of the Holant framework, a converse to the Holant theorem would itself be a very powerful counting indistinguishability theorem. The most general converse does not hold, but we prove the following, still highly general, version: if any two sets of real-valued signatures are Holant-indistinguishable, then they are equivalent up to an orthogonal transformation. This resolves a partially open conjecture of Xia (2010). Consequences of this theorem include the well-known result that homomorphism counts from all graphs determine a graph up to isomorphism, the classical sufficient condition for simultaneous orthogonal similarity of sets of real matrices, and a combinatorial characterization of simultaneosly orthogonally decomposable (odeco) sets of tensors.</description>

      <title>Boosting uniformity in quasirandom groups: fast and simple</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the communication complexity of multiplying $k\times t$ elements from the group $H=\text{SL}(2,q)$ in the number-on-forehead model with $k$ parties. We prove a lower bound of $(t\log H)/c^{k}$. This is an exponential improvement over previous work, and matches the state-of-the-art in the area.
  Relatedly, we show that the convolution of $k^{c}$ independent copies of a 3-uniform distribution over $H^{m}$ is close to a $k$-uniform distribution. This is again an exponential improvement over previous work which needed $c^{k}$ copies. The proofs are remarkably simple; the results extend to other quasirandom groups.
  We also show that for any group $H$, any distribution over $H^{m}$ whose weight-$k$ Fourier coefficients are small is close to a $k$-uniform distribution. This generalizes previous work in the abelian setting, and the proof is simpler.</description>

      <title>Approximately counting maximal independent set is equivalent to #SAT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A maximal independent set is an independent set that is not a subset of any other independent set. It is also the key problem of mathematics, computer science, and other fields. A counting problem is a type of computational problem that associated with the number of solutions. Besides, counting problems help us better understand several fields such as algorithm analysis, complexity theory, artificial intelligence, etc. The problem of counting maximal independent sets is #P-complete. So it is natural to think about approximate counting for maximal independent sets problem. In this article, we study the complexity of approximately counting maximal independent sets. Specifically, we are the first to prove that the #MIS problem is AP-interreducible with the #SAT of a given general graph.</description>

      <title>Deterministic approximation for the volume of the truncated fractional matching polytope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a deterministic polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for the volume of the truncated fractional matching polytope for graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$, where the truncation is by restricting each variable to the interval $[0,\frac{1+\delta}{\Delta}]$, and $\delta\le \frac{C}{\Delta}$ for some constant $C&gt;0$. We also generalise our result to the fractional matching polytope for hypergraphs of maximum degree $\Delta$ and maximum hyperedge size $k$, truncated by $[0,\frac{1+\delta}{\Delta}]$ as well, where $\delta\le C\Delta^{-\frac{2k-3}{k-1}}k^{-1}$ for some constant $C&gt;0$. The latter result generalises both the first result for graphs (when $k=2$), and a result by Bencs and Regts (2024) for the truncated independence polytope (when $\Delta=2$). Our approach is based on the cluster expansion technique.</description>

      <title>Additive Bases: Change of Domain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider two questions of Ruzsa on how the minimum size of an additive basis $B$ of a given set $A$ depends on the domain of $B$. To state these questions, for an abelian group $G$ and $A \subseteq D \subseteq G$ we write $\ell_D(A) \colon =\min \{ |B|: B \subseteq D, \ A \subseteq B+B \}$. Ruzsa asked how much larger can $\ell_{\mathbb{Z}}(A)$ be than $\ell_{\mathbb{Q}}(A)$ for $A\subset\mathbb{Z}$, and how much larger can $\ell_{\mathbb{N}}(A)$ be than $\ell_{\mathbb{Z}}(A)$ for $A\subset\mathbb{N}$. For the first question we show that if $\ell_{\mathbb{Q}}(A) = n$ then $\ell_{\mathbb{Z}}(A) \le 2n$, and that this is tight up to an additive error of at most $O(\sqrt{n})$. For the second question, we show that if $\ell_{\mathbb{Z}}(A) = n$ then $\ell_{\mathbb{N}}(A) \le O(n\log n)$, and this is tight up to the constant factor. We also consider these questions for higher order bases. Our proofs use some ideas that are unexpected in this context, including linear algebra and Diophantine approximation.</description>

Abstract: We study a counting version of Cycle Double Cover Conjecture. We discuss why it is more interesting to count circuits (i.e., graphs isomorphic to $C_k$ for some $k$) instead of cycles (graphs with all degrees even). We give an almost-exponential lower-bound for graphs with a surface embedding of representativity at least 4. We also prove an exponential lower-bound for planar graphs. We conjecture that any bridgeless cubic graph has at least $2^{n/2-1}$ circuit double covers and we show an infinite class of graphs for which this bound is tight.</description>

      <title>Partial reflections and globally linked pairs in rigid graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $d$-dimensional framework is a pair $(G,p)$, where $G$ is a graph and $p$ maps the vertices of $G$ to points in $\mathbb{R}^d$. The edges of $G$ are mapped to the corresponding line segments. A graph $G$ is said to be globally rigid in $\mathbb{R}^d$ if every generic $d$-dimensional framework $(G,p)$ is determined, up to congruence, by its edge lengths. A finer property is global linkedness: we say that a vertex pair $\{u,v\}$ of $G$ is globally linked in $G$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ if in every generic $d$-dimensional framework $(G,p)$ the distance of $u$ and $v$ is uniquely determined by the edge lengths.
  In this paper we investigate globally linked pairs in graphs in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We give several characterizations of those rigid graphs $G$ in which a pair $\{u,v\}$ is globally linked if and only if there exist $d+1$ internally disjoint paths from $u$ to $v$ in $G$. We call these graphs $d$-joined. Among others, we show that $G$ is $d$-joined if and only if for each pair of generic frameworks of $G$ with the same edge lengths, one can be obtained from the other by a sequence of partial reflections along hyperplanes determined by $d$-separators of $G$. We also show that the family of $d$-joined graphs is closed under edge addition, as well as under gluing along $d$ or more vertices. As a key ingredient to our main results, we prove that rigid graphs in $\mathbb{R}^d$ contain no crossing $d$-separators.
  Our results give rise to new families of graphs for which global linkedness (and global rigidity) in $\mathbb{R}^d$ can be tested in polynomial time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07785v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The BG-rank BG($\pi$) of an integer partition $\pi$ is defined as $$\text{BG}(\pi) := i-j$$ where $i$ is the number of odd-indexed odd parts and $j$ is the number of even-indexed odd parts of $\pi$. In a recent work, Fu and Tang ask for a direct combinatorial proof of the following identity of Berkovich and Uncu $$B_{2N+\nu}(k,q)=q^{2k^2-k}\left[\begin{matrix}2N+\nu\\N+k\end{matrix}\right]_{q^2}$$ for any integer $k$ and non-negative integer $N$ where $\nu\in \{0,1\}$, $B_N(k,q)$ is the generating function for partitions into distinct parts less than or equal to $N$ with BG-rank equal to $k$ and $\left[\begin{matrix}a+b\\b\end{matrix}\right]_q$ is a Gaussian binomial coefficient. In this paper, we provide a bijective proof of Berkovich and Uncu's identity along the lines of Vandervelde and Fu and Tang's idea.</description>

Abstract: Given a class of (undirected) graphs $\mathcal{C}$, we say that a Feedback Arc Set (FAS for short) $F$ is a $\mathcal{C}$-FAS if the graph induced by the edges of $F$ (forgetting their orientations) belongs to $\mathcal{C}$. We show that deciding if a tournament has a $\mathcal{C}$-FAS is NP-complete when $\mathcal{C}$ is the class of all forests. We are motivated by connections between $\mathcal{C}$-FAS and structural parameters of tournaments, such as the dichromatic number, the clique number of tournaments, and the strong Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05542v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a given graph $G=(V,E)$, we define its \emph{$n$th subdivision} as the graph obtained from $G$ by replacing every edge by a path of length $n$. We also define the \emph{$m$th power} of $G$ as the graph on vertex set $V$ where we connect every pair of vertices at distance at most $m$ in $G$. In this paper, we study the chromatic number of powers of subdivisions of graphs and resolve the case $m=n$ asymptotically. In particular, our result confirms a conjecture of Mozafari-Nia and Iradmusa in the case $m=n=3$ in a strong sense.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08514v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a short and simple proof of the celebrated hypergraph container theorem of Balogh--Morris--Samotij and Saxton--Thomason. On a high level, our argument utilises the idea of iteratively taking vertices of largest degree from an independent set and constructing a hypergraph of lower uniformity which preserves independent sets and inherits edge distribution. The original algorithms for constructing containers also remove in each step vertices of high degree which are not in the independent set. Our modified algorithm postpones this until the end, which surprisingly results in a significantly simplified analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dimer tiling problem asks in how many ways can the edges of a graph be covered by dimers so that each site is covered once. In the special case of a planar graph, this problem has a solution in terms of a free fermionic field theory. We rediscover and explore an expression for the number of coverings of an arbitrary graph by arbitrary objects in terms of an interacting fermionic field theory first proposed by Samuel. Generalizations of the dimer tiling problem, which we call `dimer piling problems,' demand that each site be covered N times by indistinguishable dimers. Our field theory provides a solution of these problems in the large-N limit. We give a similar path integral representation for certain lattice coloring problems.</description>

      <title>Graphons of Line Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating graph limits, known as graphons, from observations of sequences of sparse finite graphs. In this paper we show a simple method that can shed light on a subset of sparse graphs. The method involves mapping the original graphs to their line graphs. We show that graphs satisfying a particular property, which we call the square-degree property are sparse, but give rise to dense line graphs. This enables the use of results on graph limits of dense graphs to derive convergence. In particular, star graphs satisfy the square-degree property resulting in dense line graphs and non-zero graphons of line graphs. We demonstrate empirically that we can distinguish different numbers of stars (which are sparse) by the graphons of their corresponding line graphs. Whereas in the original graphs, the different number of stars all converge to the zero graphon due to sparsity. Similarly, superlinear preferential attachment graphs give rise to dense line graphs almost surely. In contrast, dense graphs, including Erdos-Renyi graphs make the line graphs sparse, resulting in the zero graphon.</description>

Abstract: Standard techniques for treating linear recurrences no longer apply for quadratic recurrences. It is not hard to determine asymptotics for a specific parametrized model over a wide domain of values (all $p \neq 1/2$ here). The gap between theory and experimentation seems insurmountable, however, at a single outlier ($p = 1/2$).</description>
