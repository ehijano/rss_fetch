      <title>What goes around comes around: the fate of stars in stripped tails of gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct high-resolution wind-tunnel simulations to study in-situ star formation in the stripped tails of two massive ($M_\text{star}=10^{11}M_\odot$) galaxies undergoing time-evolving ram-pressure stripping: one is stripped face-on (W0) and the other is subject to an angled wind (W45). We find that the majority of stars in the tail are formed close to the galaxy disc at the beginning of stripping. Most stars have ages that reflect outside-in stripping -- older stars are found at larger radii than younger stars. The velocities and metallicities of stars indicate that ICM mixing both increases the velocity and decreases the metallicity of star-forming gas, leading to faster, lower metallicity stars at larger distances from the galaxies. However, not all stars follow this simple model, even in the case of face-on stripping. Indeed, a considerable number (15--25 per cent) of tail stars are formed with negative velocities, indicating the fallback of star-forming gas on to the galaxy. Almost all of the tail stars formed within 20 kpc from the disc will eventually fall back on to the galaxy, and their contribution to the intracluster light is negligible. The orbits of the stars formed in the tail result in an extended (and asymmetric in the case of W45) stellar distribution around the disc. Mock UV images reveal that the observed vertical distribution of its stars is not significantly broader than in an undisturbed galaxy, indicating that more stars would need to form in the stripped tail than we find in our simulations to observably impact the UV disc width of ram pressure stripped galaxies.</description>

      <title>Oxyster: A Circumgalactic Low-ionization Oxygen Nebula next to a Starburst Galaxy at $z\sim1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended emission line nebulae around galaxies or active galactic nuclei (AGNs) provide a unique window to investigate the galactic ecosystem through the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Using Subaru Hyper-Suprime Cam narrow-band imaging and spectroscopic follow-up, we serendipitously discover "Oxyster" - a large ionized nebula next to an interacting starburst galaxy at $z=0.924$. The nebula is traced by extended [OII]3726,3729 ($\sim 30$ kpc) and [OIII]5007 ($\sim 20$ kpc) emission lines. On the nebula luminosity-size plane, Oxyster surpasses the extended narrow-line regions around low-$z$ AGNs, resembling a higher-$z$ analog of "Hanny's Voorwerp". However, its uniformly low [OIII]/[OII] ratio (O32) sets it apart from typical AGN light echoes. For the host galaxy, HST and JWST images reveal a disturbed red disk galaxy with a single blue spiral "arm". Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting suggests the $2-6\times 10^{10} ~\rm M_{\odot}$ host galaxy sits above the star-forming main sequence with an ongoing starburst, especially in the "arm", and have $&lt;5\%$ luminosity contribution from AGN, consistent with X-ray non-detection and radio continuum. Standard photoionization and shock models struggle to explain simultaneously Oxyster's emission line luminosities, low O32 ratio, and the non-detection of H$\beta$ line. A plausible explanation could involve the combination of a recent ($&lt;10^8$ yrs) starburst and a low-luminosity AGN ($L_{\rm{bol}} \sim 1\times10^{42}$ erg/s). While Oxyster's nature awaits future investigation, its discovery highlights the potential of ground-based narrow-band imaging to uncover extended emission line nebulae around non-AGN systems, opening new avenues for studying the CGM of normal galaxies in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Constraining Lens Masses in Moderately to Highly Magnified Microlensing Events from Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microlensing events provide a unique way to detect and measure the masses of isolated, non-luminous objects, particularly dark stellar remnants. Under certain conditions, it is possible to measure the mass of these objects using photometry alone, specifically when a microlensing light curve displays a finite-source (FS) effect. This effect generally occurs in highly magnified light curves, i.e. when the source and the lens are very well aligned. In this study, we analyse Gaia Alerts and Gaia Data Release 3 datasets, identifying four moderate-to-high-magnification microlensing events without a discernible FS effect. The absence of this effect suggests a large Einstein radius, implying substantial lens masses. In each event, we constrain the FS effect and therefore establish lower limits for angular Einstein radius and lens mass. Additionally, we use the DarkLensCode software to obtain mass, distance, and brightness distribution for the lens based on the Galactic model. Our analysis established lower mass limits of $\sim 0.2$ $M_{\odot}$ for one lens and $\sim 0.3-0.5$ $M_{\odot}$ for two others. DarkLensCode analysis supports these findings, estimating lens masses in the range of$\sim 0.42-1.66$ $M_{\odot}$ and dark lens probabilities exceeding 60\%. These results strongly indicate that the lenses are stellar remnants, such as white dwarfs or neutron stars. While further investigations are required to confirm the nature of these lenses, we demonstrate a straightforward yet effective approach to identifying stellar remnant candidates.</description>

      <title>Tracking the assembly of supermassive black holes: a comparison of diverse models across cosmic time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxies grow alongside their central supermassive black holes (SMBHs), linked through fueling and feedback. However, the origins and details of this co-evolution remain unclear and differ significantly amongst modeling frameworks. Using a suite of semi-analytic models (SAMs), we trace SMBH mass assembly across $M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{6-10}, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. We find significant discrepancies between observations and physics-based models of the local black hole mass function (BHMF), likely due to differences in the underlying stellar mass function and the scaling relations therefrom used to infer the BHMF. However, most physics-based models agree at $z \sim 1-4$ and align reasonably well with broad-line AGN BHMF from JWST observations at $z=4-5$. Most physics-based models reproduce the bolometric AGN luminosity evolution, except {\sc Dark Sage}, which predicts an excess deviating from models and observations. Interestingly, this pronounced ``knee' in the bolometric AGN luminosity function predicted by {\sc Dark Sage} around $L_{\rm bol} \sim 10^{46} \, \mathrm{erg \, s^{-1}}$ is consistent with the inferred luminosity of ``Little Red Dots'' at $z=5-6$, assuming that their entire emission originates from AGN activity. We analyze black hole mass build-up and accretion histories in {\sc Dark Sage}, which, unlike other models, allows for super-Eddington accretion. We report that on average, SMBHs in {\sc Dark Sage} primarily grow through secular disk instabilities and merger-driven cold gas accretion, while black hole mergers contribute 60\% of the total mass budget only for the most massive SMBHs by $z=0$.</description>

      <title>Trials and Tribulations of Chemodynamical Tagging: Investigating the Recovery of Open Clusters in the Gaia DR3-GALAH DR4 Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemodynamical tagging has been suggested as a powerful tool to trace stars back to their birth clusters. However, the efficacy of chemodynamical tagging as a means to recover individual stellar clusters is still under debate. In this study, we present a detailed investigation of chemodynamical tagging of open clusters using both dynamical and chemical data from the \textit{Gaia} DR3 and GALAH DR4 surveys, respectively. Using a sample of open clusters and mock field stars, we conduct a bootstrap analysis to evaluate every unique combination of orbital components ($E, J_R, J_\phi, J_Z$) and chemical abundances ([X/Fe] for O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, Y, and Ba) on how well they recover open clusters when used as parameters in the clustering algorithm, HBDSCAN. We find that using primarily dynamical orbital parameters leads to the highest recovery rate of open cluster stars. Nevertheless, even employing the best performing parameter combinations leads to low open cluster recovery rates. We find that, in most cases, chemodynamical tagging of open clusters using blind clustering algorithms is not efficient, which is in line with previous theoretical and observational work. However, we show that the addition of cuts based on metallicity, age, and birth radii in order to reduce the size of the clustering catalog can marginally improve the recovery rate of open clusters.</description>

      <title>New dwarf galaxy candidates in the M106, NGC3521, and UGCA127 groups with the Hyper Suprime Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The local universe is still full of hidden dwarf galaxies to be discovered using deep imaging campaigns. Here we present the third paper in a series to search for low-surface brightness dwarf galaxies around nearby isolated luminous host galaxies with the Subaru Hyper Suprime Camera. Based on visual inspection, we found 11, 0, 4, and 6 dwarf galaxy candidates around M106, NGC2903, NGC3521, and UGCA127, respectively. This adds to the 40 candidates around M104 and 4 candidates around NGC2683 found in the previous papers. Artificial galaxy experiments show that we are complete down to a mean effective surface brightness of 26 mag/arcsec$^2$. The new dwarf galaxy candidates follow known scaling relation in size, surface brightness and luminosity, making them good candidates based on their morphology and photometric properties. We trace the luminosity function of these galaxies down to magnitude of $\approx-$9 in the V band for all galaxies targeted in our survey footprint so far. While the most massive galaxy (M104) has a significant higher abundance of dwarfs, NGC3521, NGC2903, and NGC2683 have a similar luminosity function as the Milky Way. These latter three galaxies also have a similar stellar mass and might be considered Milky Way analogs. UGCA127 is a low-mass galaxy but almost reaches the same number of dwarfs as the Milky Way at our limiting magnitude. We have searched for hints of lopsidedness in the satellite distributions, but found none to be significant. The next step will be to confirm these members through either distance or velocity measurements.</description>

      <title>Examination of the functional form of the light and mass distribution in spiral arms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiral arms are a common feature of local galaxies, but the exact form of the distribution of mass and light in them is not well known. In this work, we aim to measure this distribution as accurately as possible, focusing on individual spiral arms and using the so-called slicing method. The sample consists of 19 well-resolved, viewed face-on spiral galaxies from the S$^4$G survey. We work primarily with infrared images at 3.6 $\mu$m from the same survey, and, secondarily, with ultraviolet data from the GALEX telescope. We derive the properties of the spiral arms step by step, starting from their overall shape, then measuring their brightness profile and width variation along the arm, and then examining the fine structure of the profile across the arm, namely its skewness and S\'{e}rsic index. We construct a 2D photometric function of the spiral arm that can be used in further decomposition studies, validate it and identify the most and least important parameters. Finally, we show how our results can be used to unravel the nature of the spiral arms, supporting the evidence that NGC 4535 has a density wave in its disc.</description>

      <title>The Cocytos Stream: A Disrupted Globular Cluster from our Last Major Merger?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The census of stellar streams and dwarf galaxies in the Milky Way provides direct constraints on galaxy formation models and the nature of dark matter. The DESI Milky Way survey (with a footprint of 14,000$~deg{^2}$ and a depth of $r&lt;19$ mag) delivers the largest sample of distant metal-poor stars compared to previous optical fiber-fed spectroscopic surveys. This makes DESI an ideal survey to search for previously undetected streams and dwarf galaxies. We present a detailed characterization of the Cocytos stream, which was re-discovered using a clustering analysis with a catalog of giants in the DESI year 3 data, supplemented with Magellan/MagE spectroscopy. Our analysis reveals a relatively metal-rich ([Fe/H]$=-1.3$) and thick stream (width$=1.5^\circ$) at a heliocentric distance of $\approx 25$ kpc, with an internal velocity dispersion of 6.5-9 km s$^{-1}$. The stream's metallicity, radial orbit, and proximity to the Virgo stellar overdensities suggest that it is most likely a disrupted globular cluster that came in with the Gaia-Enceladus merger. We also confirm its association with the Pyxis globular cluster. Our result showcases the ability of wide-field spectroscopic surveys to kinematically discover faint disrupted dwarfs and clusters, enabling constraints on the dark matter distribution in the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>The AstroSat UV Deep Field South. III. Evolution of the UV Luminosity Function and Luminosity Density from z~0.8-0.4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterise the rest-frame 1500 \r{A} UV luminosity Function (UVLF) from deep AstroSat/UVIT F154W and N242W imaging in the Great Observatories Origins Survey South (GOODS-S) deep field. The UVLFs are constructed and subsequently characterised with fitted Schechter function parameters from FUV observations at z$&lt;0.13$ and NUV observations in seven redshift bins in z~0.8-0.4. The UVLF slope ($\alpha$) and characteristic magnitude ($M^*$) are consistent with previous determinations for this redshift range based on AstroSat/UVIT GOODS-North observations, as well as with those from Galaxy evolution Explorer and Hubble Space Telescope observations. However, differences in the normalisation factor ($\phi_{*}$) are present for UVLFs for some redshift bins. We compute the UV luminosity density, $\rho_{\rm UV}$, combining our determined UVLF parameters with literature determinations out to z$\sim10$. The $\rho_{\rm UV}$ trend with redshift implies the rapid increase in cosmic star formation till its peak at z$\sim3$ (cosmic noon) followed by a slow decline till present day. Both the initial increase in cosmic star formation and subsequent decline are found to be more rapid than previous determinations.</description>

      <title>The "Little Dark Dot": Evidence for Self-Interacting Dark Matter in the Strong Lens SDSSJ0946+1006?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous studies, based on precise modeling of a gravitationally lensing image, have identified what may be a extremely compact, dark perturber in the well-known lensing system SDSSJ0946+1006 (the "Jackpot"). Its remarkable compactness challenges the standard cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm. In this paper, we explore whether such a compact perturber could be explained as a core-collapsed halo described by the self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) model. Using the isothermal Jeans method, we compute the density profiles of core-collapsed halos across a range of masses. Our comparison with observations indicates that only a core-collapsed halo with a total mass of approximately $10^{11}~{\rm M_{\odot}}$ could produce an inner density profile and mass enclosed within 1 kpc that is consistent with observational data. However, such a massive dark matter halo should host a galaxy detectable by prior Hubble imaging, which is not observed. Thus, the core-collapsed SIDM halo model struggles to fully account for the exotic nature of the "little dark dot" in the "Jackpot" lens.</description>

      <title>Massive Star Clusters in the Semi-Analytical Galaxy Formation Model L-Galaxies 2020</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is established that there exists a direct link between the formation history of star cluster populations and their host galaxies, however, our lacking understanding of star cluster assembly prohibits us to make full use of their ability to trace galaxy evolution. In this work we introduce a new variation of the 2020 version of the semi-analytical galaxy formation model "L-Galaxies" that includes the formation of star clusters above 10^4 M_Sun and probes different physical assumptions that affect their evolution over cosmic time. We use properties of different galaxy components and localised star formation to determine the bound fraction of star formation in disks. After randomly sampling masses from an environmentally-dependent star cluster initial mass function, we assign to each object a half-mass radius, metallicity, and distance from the galaxy centre. We consider up to 2000 individual star clusters per galaxy and evolve their properties over time taking into account stellar evolution, two-body relaxation, tidal shocks, dynamical friction, and a re-positioning during galaxy mergers. Our simulation successfully reproduces several observational quantities, such as the empirical relationship between the absolute V -band magnitude of the brightest young star clusters and the host galaxy star formation rate, the mass function of young star clusters, or mean metallicities of the star cluster distributions versus galaxy masses. The simulation reveals great complexity in the z = 0 star cluster population resulting from differential destruction channels and origins, including in-situ populations in the disk, a major merger-induced heated component in the halo, and accreted star clusters. Model variations point out the importance of e.g. the shape of the star cluster initial mass function or the relationship between the sound speed of cold gas and the star formation rate.</description>

      <title>Narrowband Imaging of a z=3.24 Protocluster: Insights from [O III] Emitting Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a narrowband imaging on a spectroscopically confirmed protocluster ``D4UD01'' at z=3.24 using CFHT/WIRCam. We identify a sample of 24 [O III] emission line galaxies in the field, which forms a large overdensity in the protocluster region. The protocluster is expected to evolve into a Virgo-like cluster by z=0. Utilizing multiwavelength data, we derive the physical properties of these [O III] emitters and find they are medium mass normal star-forming galaxies ($\sim10^{10}$M$_\odot$) roughly following the star-forming main sequence. The [O III] emitters trace an overdensity spatially offset from that of photometric-redshift and quiescent galaxies, suggesting these distinct galaxy populations may inhabit dark matter halos that formed at different epochs. A comparative analysis of [O III] emitter properties shows similar characteristics in both protocluster and field environments. This protocluster likely represents an evolved structure that has progressed beyond its peak star-formation phase, although our limited sample size may prevent detection of subtle environmental effects.</description>

      <title>How to use Gaia parallaxes for stars with poor astrometric fits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaia parallax measurements for stars with poor astrometric fits -- as evidenced by high renormalized unit weight error (RUWE) -- are often assumed to be unreliable, but the extent and nature of their biases remain poorly quantified. High RUWE is usually a consequence of binarity or higher-order multiplicity, so the parallaxes of sources with high RUWE are often of greatest astrophysical interest. Using realistic simulations of Gaia epoch astrometry, we show that the parallax uncertainties of sources with elevated RUWE are underestimated by a factor that ranges from 1 to 4 and can be robustly predicted from observables. We derive an empirical prescription to inflate reported uncertainties based on a simple analytic function of RUWE, apparent magnitude, and parallax. We validate the correction using (a) single-star solutions for Gaia sources with known orbital solutions and (b) wide binaries containing one component with elevated RUWE. The same uncertainty corrections are expected to perform well in DR4 and DR5. Our results demonstrate that Gaia parallaxes for high-RUWE sources can still yield robust distance estimates if uncertainties are appropriately inflated, enabling distance constraints for triples, binaries with periods too long or too short to be fit astrometrically, and sources blended with neighboring sources.</description>

      <title>ALMASOP. Detection of Turbulence-induced Mass Assembly Shocks in Starless Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Star formation is a series of mass assembly processes and starless cores, those cold and dense condensations in molecular clouds, play a pivotal role as initial seeds of stars. With only a limited sample of known starless cores, however, the origin and growth of such stellar precursors had not been well characterized previously. Meanwhile, the recent discovery of CH$_3$OH emission, which is generally associated with desorbed icy mantle in warm regions, particularly at the periphery of starless cores also remains puzzling. We present sensitive ALMA (Band~3) observations (at 3~mm) toward a sample of newly identified starless cores in the Orion Molecular Cloud. The spatially resolved images distinctly indicate that the observed CH$_3$OH and N$_2$H$^+$ emission associated with these cores are morphologically anti-correlated and kinematically offset from each other. We postulate that the CH$_3$OH emission highlights the desorption of icy mantle by shocks resulting from gas piling onto dense cores in the filaments traced by N$_2$H$^+$. Our magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of star formation in turbulent clouds combined with radiative transfer calculations and imaging simulations successfully reproduced the observed signatures and reaffirmed the above scenario at work. Our result serves as an intriguing and exemplary illustration, a snapshot in time, of the dynamic star-forming processes in turbulent clouds. The results offer compelling insights into the mechanisms governing the growth of starless cores and the presence of gas-phase complex organic molecules associated with these cores.</description>

      <title>Anharmonic infrared spectra of cationic pyrene and superhydrogenated derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying the anharmonicity in the infrared (IR) spectra of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at elevated temperatures is important to understand vibrational features and chemical properties of interstellar dust, especially in the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) era. We take pyrene as an example PAH and investigate how different degrees of superhydrogenation affects the applicability of the harmonic approximation and the role of temperature in IR spectra of PAHs. This is achieved by comparing theoretical IR spectra generated by classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and experimental IR spectra obtained via gas-phase action spectroscopy which utilizes the Infrared Multiple Photon Dissociation (IRMPD). All simulations are accelerated by a machine learning interatomic potential, in order to reach first principle accuracies while keeping low computational costs. We have found that the harmonic approximation with empirical scaling factors is able to reproduce experimental band profile of pristine and partially superhydrogenated pyrene cations. However, a MD-based anharmonic treatment is mandatory in the case of fully superhydrogenated pyrene cation for matching theory and experiment. In addition, band shifts and broadenings as the temperature increases are investigated in detail. Those findings may aid in the interpretation of JWST observations on the variations in band positions and widths of interstellar dust.</description>

      <title>Orbital Parameters of 665 Double-lined Spectroscopic Binaries in the LAMOST Medium-Resolution Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The period, mass ratio, eccentricity, and other orbital parameters are fundamental for investigating binary star evolution. However, the number of binaries with known orbital parameters remains limited. Utilizing the LAMOST-MRS survey, we derived orbital solutions for 665 SB2 binaries by fitting the radial velocities of 1119 SB2 systems with at least six observations, employing a modified version of Thejoker optimized for SB2 binaries. To ensure the reliability of the results, four selection criteria were applied: reduced chi-square, normalized mean absolute error, maximum phase gap, and RV distribution metric. After applying these criteria, 665 reliable orbits were retained. Comparison with Kepler, TESS, and ZTF light curve data shows excellent agreement, with discrepancies in some cases attributed to shorter pulsation periods observed in light curves. Additionally, good consistency is found between our periods and those of SB1 systems in Gaia data. These orbital solutions contribute to understanding binary star evolution and the statistical properties of binary populations.</description>

      <title>Isolated and group environment dependence of stellar mass and different star formation rates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we explored the impact of isolated and group environments on stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and specific star formation rate (SSFR, i.e., the rate of star formation per unit stellar mass) using the galaxy dataset from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 12 (SDSS DR12) for $z\lesssim0.2$. To mitigate the Malmquist bias, we partitioned the entire dataset into fifteen subsamples with a redshift bin size of $\Delta z = 0.01$ and examined the environmental dependencies of these properties within each redshift bin. A strong correlation between environment, stellar mass, SFR, and SSFR was observed across nearly all redshift bins. In the lower redshift bins $(z&lt;0.1)$, the proportion of galaxies within the isolated environment exceeded that within the group environment. On the other hand, in the higher redshift bins $(z\geq 0.12)$, the isolated environment's galaxy fraction is found to be lower than that of the group environment. For the intermediate redshift bins $(0.1 \leq z &lt; 0.12)$, an approximately equal proportion of galaxies is observed in both isolated and group environments.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the role of merger histories in the population of In~situ stars: linking IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation to H3 survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We undertake a comprehensive investigation into the distribution of in~situ stars within Milky Way-like galaxies, leveraging TNG50 simulations and comparing their predictions with data from the H3 survey. Our analysis reveals that 28\% of galaxies demonstrate reasonable agreement with H3, while only 12\% exhibit excellent alignment in their profiles, regardless of the specific spatial cut employed to define in~situ stars. To uncover the underlying factors contributing to deviations between TNG50 and H3 distributions, we scrutinise correlation coefficients among internal drivers(e.g., virial radius, star formation rate [SFR]) and merger-related parameters (such as the effective mass-ratio, mean distance, average redshift, total number of mergers, average spin-ratio and maximum spin alignment between merging galaxies). Notably, we identify significant correlations between deviations from observational data and key parameters such as the median slope of virial radius, mean SFR values, and the rate of SFR change across different redshift scans. Furthermore, positive correlations emerge between deviations from observational data and parameters related to galaxy mergers. We validate these correlations using the Random Forest Regression method. Our findings underscore the invaluable insights provided by the H3 survey in unravelling the cosmic history of galaxies akin to the Milky Way, thereby advancing our understanding of galactic evolution and shedding light on the formation and evolution of Milky Way-like galaxies in cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>On the accuracy of dark matter halo merger trees and the consequences for semi-analytic models of galaxy formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxy formation and evolution models, such as semi-analytic models, are powerful theoretical tools for predicting how galaxies evolve across cosmic time. These models follow the evolution of galaxies based on the halo assembly histories inferred from large $N$-body cosmological simulations. This process requires codes to identify halos ("halo finder") and to track their time evolution ("tree builder"). While these codes generally perform well, they encounter numerical issues when handling dense environments. In this paper, we present how relevant these issues are in state-of-the-art cosmological simulations. We characterize two major numerical artefacts in halo assembly histories: (i) the non-physical swapping of large amounts of mass between subhalos, and (ii) the sudden formation of already massive subhalos at late cosmic times. We quantify these artefacts for different combinations of halo finder (SUBFIND, VELOCIRAPTOR, HBT-HERONS) and tree builder codes (D-TRESS+DHALO, TREEFROG, HBT-HERONS), finding that in general more than $50\%$ ($80\%$) of the more massive subhalos with $&gt;10^{3}$ ($&gt;10^{4}$) particles at $z=0$ inherit them in most cases. However, HBT-HERONS, which explicitly incorporates temporal information, effectively reduces the occurrence of these artefacts to $5\%$ ($10\%$). We then use the semi-analytic models SHARK and GALFORM to explore how these artefacts impact galaxy formation predictions. We demonstrate that the issues above lead to non-physical predictions in galaxies hosted by affected halos, particularly in SHARK where the modelling of baryons relies on subhalo information. Finally, we propose and implement fixes for the numerical artefacts at the semi-analytic model level, and use SHARK to show the improvements, especially at the high-mass end, after applying them.</description>

      <title>Low-Acceleration Gravitational Anomaly from Bayesian 3D Modeling of Wide Binary Orbits: Methodology and Results with Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09373v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Isolated wide binary stars provide natural laboratories to directly probe gravity for Newtonian acceleration $g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m s$^{-2}$. Recent statistical analyses of wide binaries have been performed only with sky-projected relative velocities $v_p$ in the pairs. A new method of Bayesian orbit modeling exploiting three relative velocity components including the radial (line-of-sight) component $v_r$ is developed to measure a gravitational anomaly parameter $\Gamma\equiv\log_{10}\sqrt{\gamma_g}\equiv\log_{10}\sqrt{G_{\rm{eff}}/G_{\rm{N}}}$ where $G_{\rm{eff}}$ is the effective gravitational constant for pseudo-Newtonian elliptical orbits, while $G_{\rm{N}}$ is Newton's constant. The method infers individual probability distributions of $\Gamma$ and then combines the independent distributions to obtain a consolidated distribution in a specific range of $g_{\rm{N}}$. Here the method is described and applied to a sample of 312 wide binaries in a broad dynamic range $10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-6.7}$ m s$^{-2}$ with $v_r$ uncertainties in the range $168&lt;\sigma_{v_r}&lt;380$ m s$^{-1}$ selected from the Gaia DR3 database. The following results are obtained: $\Gamma = 0.000\pm 0.011$ ($N_{\rm{binary}}=125$) for a high acceleration regime ($10^{-7.9} \lesssim g_{\rm{N}} \lesssim 10^{-6.7}$ m s$^{-2}$) agreeing well with Newton, but $\Gamma = 0.085\pm 0.040$ or $\gamma_g=1.48_{-0.23}^{+0.33}$ (35) for a MOND regime ($10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9.5}$ m s$^{-2}$) and $\Gamma = 0.063\pm 0.015$ or $\gamma_g=1.34_{-0.08}^{+0.10}$ (111) for a MOND+transition regime ($10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-8.5}$ m s$^{-2}$). These results show that gravitational anomaly is evident for $g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m s$^{-2}$ and $\Gamma$ in the MOND regime ($\lesssim 10^{-9.5}$ m s$^{-2}$) agrees with the prediction ($\approx 0.07$) of MOND gravity theories.</description>

      <title>The Thousand-Pulsar-Array programme on MeerKAT -- XVI. Mapping the Galactic magnetic field with pulsar observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measuring the magnetic field of the Milky Way reveals the structure and evolution of the galaxy. Pulsar rotation measures (RMs) provide a means to probe this Galactic magnetic field (GMF) in three dimensions. We use the largest single-origin data set of pulsar measurements, from the MeerKAT Thousand-Pulsar-Array, to map out GMF components parallel to pulsar lines of sight. We also present these measurements for easy integration into the consolidated RM catalogue, RMTable. Focusing on the Galactic disk, we investigate competing theories of how the GMF relates to the spiral arms, comparing our observational map with five analytic models of magnetic field structure. We also analyse RMs to extragalactic radio sources, to help build up a three-dimensional picture of the magnetic structure of the galaxy. In particular, our large number of measurements allows us to investigate differing magnetic field behaviour in the upper and lower halves of the Galactic plane. We find that the GMF is best explained as following the spiral arms in a roughly bisymmetric structure, with antisymmetric parity with respect to the Galactic plane. This picture is complicated by variations in parity on different spiral arms, and the parity change location appears to be shifted by a distance of 0.15 kpc perpendicular to the Galactic plane. This indicates a complex relationship between the large-scale distributions of matter and magnetic fields in our galaxy. Future pulsar discoveries will help reveal the origins of this relationship with greater precision, as well as probing the locations of local magnetic field inhomogenities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new approach for understanding how galaxies lose or retain baryons by utilizing a pipeline of two machine learning methods applied the IllustrisTNG100 simulation. We employed a Random Forest Regressor and Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) model to connect the retained baryon fraction of approximately 10^5 simulated galaxies to their properties. We employed Random Forest models to filter and used the five most significant properties to train an EBM. Interaction functions identified by the EBM highlight the relationship between baryon fraction and three different galactic mass measurements, the location of the rotation curve peak, and the velocity dispersion. This interpretable machine learning-based approach provides a promising pathway for understanding the baryon cycle in galaxies.</description>

      <title>Pixel-level modelling of group-scale strong lens CASSOWARY 19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first high-precision model for the group-scale strong lensing system CASSOWARY 19 (CSWA19), utilising images from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Sixteen member galaxies identified via the red-sequence method, and the main halo, all modelled as the dual Pseudo Isothermal Elliptical profile (dPIE), are incorporated into a parametric lens model alongside an external shear field. To model the system, we adopt the PyAutoLens software package, employing a progressive search chain strategy for realizing the transition of source model from multiple S\'ersic profiles to a brightness-adaptive pixelization, which uses 1000 pixels in the source plane to reconstruct the background source corresponding to 177,144 image pixels in the image plane. Our results indicate that the total mass within the Einstein radius is $M_{\theta_\mathrm{E}}$ $\approx 1.41\times10^{13}$M$_{\odot}$ and the average slope of the total mass density $\rho (r)\propto r^{-\gamma}$ is $\tilde{\gamma}=1.33$ within the effective radius. This slope is shallower than those measured in galaxies and groups but is closer to those of galaxy clusters. In addition, our approach successfully resolves the two merging galaxies in the background source and yields a total magnification of $\mu=103.18^{+0.23}_{-0.19}$, which is significantly higher than the outcomes from previous studies of CSWA19. In summary, our research demonstrates the effectiveness of the brightness-adaptive pixelization source reconstruction technique for modelling group-scale strong lensing systems. It can serve as a technical reference for future investigations into pixel-level modelling of the group- and cluster-scale strong lensing systems.</description>

Abstract: (Abridged) The strong lensing models of galaxy clusters rely on the number and quality of multiple images with spectroscopic redshifts. We present an updated strong lensing model of MACS J0416.1-2403 with the largest sample of multiple images with spectroscopic redshifts in a galaxy cluster field to date. Furthermore, we aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of JWST, particularly its NIRISS camera, for strong lensing studies. We used NIRCam imaging and NIRSpec and NIRISS spectroscopy from the CAnadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS). The cluster mass model was constrained using Lenstool software. Our new dataset, which we used for constraining the lens model, comprises 303 secure multiple images with spectroscopic redshifts from 111 background sources and includes 95 systems with previously known MUSE redshift and 16 systems (with 46 multiple images) for which we obtained spectroscopic redshift for the first time using NIRISS and NIRSpec spectroscopy. Three of the spectroscopic systems were not identified by previous JWST studies. The total number of secure spectroscopic systems is more than 20% higher than in the previous strong lensing studies of this cluster. The model can reproduce multiple images with the root-mean-square distance of ~ 0.52''. We also provide a full catalogue with 415 multiple images, including less reliable candidates. In total, we provide 15 new multiple-image system candidates (with 38 multiple images) not reported in previous studies. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of JWST, particularly NIRISS, for obtaining spectroscopic redshifts of multiple images. As NIRISS F115W, F150W, and F200W grism spectroscopy captures at least two of the [OII], [OIII] and H${\alpha}$ lines at 1 &lt; z &lt; 3 (a redshift range particularly relevant for strong lensing studies) without target pre-selection, it complements MUSE and NIRSpec observations extremely well.</description>

      <title>Precisely Measuring the Cosmic Reionization History from IGM Damping Wings Towards Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12070v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach for analyzing the IGM damping wings imprinted on the proximity zones of quasars in the epoch of reionization (EoR). Whereas past work has typically forgone the additional constraining power afforded by the blue side continuum ($1216\,\r{A} \lesssim \lambda \lesssim 1280\,\r{A}$) and/or opted not to model the large correlated IGM transmission fluctuations in the proximity zone ($\lambda \lesssim 1216\,\r{A}$), we construct a generative probabilistic model for the entire spectrum accounting for all sources of error - the stochasticity induced by patchy reionization, the impact of the quasar's ionizing radiation on the IGM, the unknown intrinsic spectrum of the quasar, and spectral noise. This principled Bayesian method allows us to marginalize out nuisance parameters associated with the quasar's radiation and its unknown intrinsic spectrum to precisely measure the IGM neutral fraction, $\langle x_{\rm HI}\rangle$. A key element of our analysis is the use of dimensionality reduction (DR) to describe the intrinsic quasar spectrum via a small number of nuisance parameters. Using a large sample of $15,559$ SDSS/BOSS quasars at $z \gtrsim 2.15$ we trained and quantified the performance of six distinct DR methods, and find that a six parameter PCA model (five coefficients plus a normalization) performs best, with complex machine learning approaches providing no advantage. By conducting statistical inference on 100 realistic mock EoR quasar spectra, we demonstrate the reliability of the credibility contours that we obtain on $\langle x_{\rm HI}\rangle$ and the quasar lifetime, $t_{\rm Q}$. The new method introduced here will transform IGM damping wings into a precision probe of reionization, on the same solid methodological and statistical footing as other precision cosmological measurements.</description>
