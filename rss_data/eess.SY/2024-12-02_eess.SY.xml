      <title>Kernelized offset-free data-driven predictive control for nonlinear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a kernelized offset-free data-driven predictive control scheme for nonlinear systems. Traditional model-based and data-driven predictive controllers often struggle with inaccurate predictors or persistent disturbances, especially in the case of nonlinear dynamics, leading to tracking offsets and stability issues. To overcome these limitations, we employ kernel methods to parameterize the nonlinear terms of a velocity model, preserving its structure and efficiently learning unknown parameters through a least squares approach. This results in a offset-free data-driven predictive control scheme formulated as a nonlinear program, but solvable via sequential quadratic programming. We provide a framework for analyzing recursive feasibility and stability of the developed method and we demonstrate its effectiveness through simulations on a nonlinear benchmark example.</description>

      <title>Self-Adaptive Active Damping Method for Stability Enhancement of Systems With Black-Box Inverters Considering Operating Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the black-box nature of inverters and the wide variation range of operating points, it is challenging to on-line predict and adaptively enhance the stability of inverter-based systems. To solve this problem, this paper provides a feasible self-adaptive active damping method to eliminate potential small-signal instability of systems with black-box inverters under multiple operating points. First, the framework that includes grid impedance estimation, inverters' admittance identification, and self-adaptive strategy is presented. Second, a widely-applicable and engineering-friendly method for inductive-resistive grid impedance estimation is studied, in which a frequency-integral-based dq-axis aligning method is presented to avoid the inaccuracy resulting from the disturbance theta. Then, to make the system have a sufficient stable margin under different operating points, a self-adaptive active damper (SAD) as well as its control strategy with lag compensator modification is proposed, in which the SAD's damping compensation mechanism for the system's stability enhancement is investigated and revealed. Finally, the mapping between system's parameter variations and SAD's parameters is established based on the artificial neural network (ANN) technique, serving as a computationally light model surrogate that is favorable for on-line parameter-tuning for SAD to compensate the system's damping according to operating points. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by simulations in PSACD/EMTDC and experiments in RT-Lab platforms.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Control Observer-Based Methods for State Estimation of Lithium-Ion Batteries in Practical Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reliability, lower computational complexity, and ease of implementation of control observers make them one of the most promising methods for the state estimation of Li-ion batteries (LIBs) in commercial applications. To pave their way, this study performs a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of four main categories of control observer-based methods in different practical scenarios considering estimation accuracy, computational time convergence speed, stability, and robustness against measurement uncertainties. Observers are designed using a second-order equivalent circuit model whose observability against different scenarios is rigorously investigated to verify the feasibility of the proposed analysis. Established techniques then are validated against driving datasets and their comparative usefulness is evaluated using an experimental setup. The analysis also evaluates the adaptability of different techniques to electric vehicle field data. The results indicate better accuracy, stability, robustness, and faster convergence for the PI and PID, while the estimations of the Luenberger observers find it hard to converge against highly dynamic loadfiles. Moreover, this study also discusses the sensitivity of observer-based techniques to battery ohmic polarization and voltage-related measurement uncertainties. The most remarkable contribution of the proposed study lies in providing guidance for researchers when choosing the control observers for online state estimation of LIBs.</description>

      <title>Occam's Razor in Residential PV-Battery Systems: Theoretical Interpretation, Practical Implications, and Possible Improvements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical interpretation and explores possible improvements of a widely adopted rule-based control for residential solar photovoltaics (PV) paired with battery storage systems (BSS). The method is referred to as Occam's control in this paper, given its simplicity and as a tribute to the 14th-century William of Ockham. Using the self-consumption-maximization application, it is proven that Occam's control is a special case of a larger category of optimization methods called online convex learning. Thus, for the first time, a theoretical upper bound is derived for this control method. Furthermore, based on the theoretical insight, an alternative algorithm is devised on the same complexity level that outperforms Occam's. Practical data is used to evaluate the performance of these learning methods as compared to the classical rolling-horizon linear/quadratic programming. Findings support online learning methods for residential applications given their low complexity and small computation, communication, and data footprint. Consequences include improved economics for residential PV-BSS systems and mitigation of distribution systems' operational challenges associated with high PV penetration.</description>

      <title>Neural Operators for Predictor Feedback Control of Nonlinear Delay Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predictor feedback designs are critical for delay-compensating controllers in nonlinear systems. However, these designs are limited in practical applications as predictors cannot be directly implemented, but require numerical approximation schemes. These numerical schemes, typically combining finite difference and successive approximations, become computationally prohibitive when the dynamics of the system are expensive to compute. To alleviate this issue, we propose approximating the predictor mapping via a neural operator. In particular, we introduce a new perspective on predictor designs by recasting the predictor formulation as an operator learning problem. We then prove the existence of an arbitrarily accurate neural operator approximation of the predictor operator. Under the approximated-predictor, we achieve semiglobal practical stability of the closed-loop nonlinear system. The estimate is semiglobal in a unique sense - namely, one can increase the set of initial states as large as desired but this will naturally increase the difficulty of training a neural operator approximation which appears practically in the stability estimate. Furthermore, we emphasize that our result holds not just for neural operators, but any black-box predictor satisfying a universal approximation error bound. From a computational perspective, the advantage of the neural operator approach is clear as it requires training once, offline and then is deployed with very little computational cost in the feedback controller. We conduct experiments controlling a 5-link robotic manipulator with different state-of-the-art neural operator architectures demonstrating speedups on the magnitude of $10^2$ compared to traditional predictor approximation schemes.</description>

      <title>Using dynamic extensions for the backstepping control of hyperbolic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper systematically introduces dynamic extensions for the boundary control of general heterodirectional hyperbolic PDE systems. These extensions, which are well known in the finite-dimensional setting, constitute the dynamics of state feedback controllers. They make it possible to achieve design goals beyond what can be accomplished by a static state feedback. The design of dynamic state feedback controllers is divided into first introducing an appropriate dynamic extension and then determining a static feedback of the extended state, which includes the system and controller state, to meet some design objective. In the paper, the dynamic extensions are chosen such that all transport velocities are homogenized on the unit spatial interval. Based on the dynamically extended system, a backstepping transformation allows to easily find a static state feedback that assigns a general dynamics to the closed-loop system, with arbitrary in-domain couplings. This new design flexibility is also used to determine a feedback that achieves complete input-output decoupling in the closed loop with ensured internal stability. It is shown that the modularity of this dynamic feedback design allows for a straightforward transfer of all results to hyperbolic PDE-ODE systems. An example demonstrates the new input-output decoupling approach by dynamic extension.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Designing Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions in Epidemics: A Submodular Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of designing non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) strategies, such as masking and social distancing, to slow the spread of a viral epidemic. We formulate the problem of jointly minimizing the infection probabilities of a population and the cost of NPIs based on a Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) propagation model. To mitigate the complexity of the problem, we consider a steady-state approximation based on the quasi-stationary (endemic) distribution of the epidemic, and prove that the problem of selecting a minimum-cost strategy to satisfy a given bound on the quasi-stationary infection probabilities can be cast as a submodular optimization problem, which can be solved in polynomial time using the greedy algorithm. We carry out experiments to examine effects of implementing our NPI strategy on propagation and control of epidemics on a Watts-Strogatz small-world graph network. We find the NPI strategy reduces the steady state of infection probabilities of members of the population below a desired threshold value.</description>

      <title>Conformal Prediction for Distribution-free Optimal Control of Linear Stochastic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address an optimal control problem for linear stochastic systems with unknown noise distributions and joint chance constraints using conformal prediction. Our approach involves designing a feedback controller to maintain an error system within a prediction region (PR). We define PRs as sublevel sets of a nonconformity score over error trajectories, enabling the handling of joint chance constraints. We propose two methods to design feedback control and PRs: one through direct optimization over error trajectory samples, and the other indirectly using the $S$-procedure with a disturbance ellipsoid obtained from data. By tightening constraints with PRs, we solve a relaxed problem to synthesize a feedback policy. Our method ensures reliable probabilistic guarantees based on marginal coverage, independent of data size</description>

      <title>Computationally efficient trajectory design from motion primitives for near time-optimal transitions for systems with oscillating internal dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An efficient approach to compute near time-optimal trajectories for linear kinematic systems with oscillatory internal dynamics is presented. Thereby, kinematic constraints with respect to velocity, acceleration and jerk are taken into account. The trajectories are composed of several motion primitives, the most crucial of which is termed jerk segment. Within this contribution, the focus is put on the composition of the overall trajectories, assuming the required motion primitives to be readily available. Since the scheme considered is not time-optimal, even decreasing particular constraints can reduce the overall transition time, which is analysed in detail. This observation implies that replanning of the underlying jerk segments is required as an integral part of the motion planning scheme, further insight into which has been analysed in a complementary contribution. Although the proposed scheme is not time-optimal, it allows for significantly shorter transition times than established methods, such as zero-vibration shaping, while requiring significantly lower computational power than a fully time-optimal scheme.</description>

      <title>Efficient calculation of time-optimal motion primitives for systems exhibiting oscillatory internal dynamics with multiple applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fast algorithm for planning near time-optimal trajectories for systems with an oscillatory internal dynamics has been developed in previous work. In this algorithm, trajectories are assembled from special motion primitives called jerk segments, which are connected by segments of constant acceleration and velocity respectively. It was shown, that the algorithm achieves a time advantage over established trajectory planning methods. Achieving the fastest transition possible with this algorithm may require a redesign of the jerk segments within the motion planning procedure. This publication presents an efficient numerical algorithm enabling for the fast real-time computation of these segments. This is achieved by explicitly evaluating the optimality conditions arising from the maximum principle for input-constrained systems, and further by reducing the evaluation of these conditions to a line-search problem on a bounded interval. This reduction guarantees, that a valid solution is found within a predictable time. Furthermore, the algorithm further does not rely on complicated optimisation algorithms, which allows it to be implemented on low-power hardware.</description>

      <title>L4acados: Learning-based models for acados, applied to Gaussian process-based predictive control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incorporating learning-based models, such as Gaussian processes (GPs), into model predictive control (MPC) strategies can significantly improve control performance and online adaptation capabilities for real-world applications. Still, despite recent advances in numerical optimization and real-time GP inference, its widespread application is limited by the lack of an efficient and modular open-source implementation. This work aims at filling this gap by providing an efficient implementation of zero-order Gaussian process-based MPC in acados, as well as L4acados, a general framework for incorporating non-CasADi (learning-based) residual models in acados. By providing the required sensitivities via a user-defined Python module, L4acados enables the implementation of MPC controllers with learning-based residual models in acados, while supporting custom Jacobian approximations, as well as parallelization of sensitivity computations when preparing the quadratic subproblems. The computational efficiency of L4acados is benchmarked against available software using a neural network-based control example. Last, it is used demonstrate the performance of the zero-order GP-MPC method applied to two hardware examples: autonomous miniature racing, as well as motion control of a full-scale autonomous vehicle for an ISO lane change maneuver.</description>

      <title>Economic Dispatch and Power Flow Analysis for Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the economic dispatch and optimal power flow (OPF) for microgrids, focusing on two configurations: a single-bus islanded microgrid and a three-bus grid-tied microgrid. The methodologies integrate renewable energy sources (solar PV and wind turbines), battery energy storage systems (BESS), and conventional generators (CHP, diesel, and natural gas), which are connected to the grid to ensure cost-efficient and reliable operation. The economic dispatch analysis evaluates the allocation of generation resources over daily and weekly horizons, highlighting the extensive utilization of renewable energy and the strategic use of BESS to balance system dynamics. The OPF analysis examines the distribution of active and reactive power across buses while ensuring voltage stability and compliance with operational constraints. Results show that the microgrid consistently satisfies load demand with minimal reliance on costly external grid power. Renewable energy sources are maximized for cost reduction, while BESS is employed strategically to address renewable intermittency. For the grid-tied microgrid, optimal power dispatch prioritizes cheaper sources, with Bus 1 contributing the largest share due to its favorable cost profile. Voltage variations remain within acceptable boundaries but indicate potential stability challenges under dynamic load changes, suggesting the need for secondary voltage control. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodologies in achieving sustainable, cost-effective, and stable microgrid operations.</description>

      <title>Fast Switching in Mixed-Integer Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive stability results for finite control set and mixed-integer model predictive control and propose a unified theoretical framework. The presentation rests upon the inherent robustness properties of common model predictive control with stabilizing terminal conditions and techniques for solving mixed-integer optimal control problems by continuous optimization. Partial outer convexification and binary relaxation transform mixed-integer problems into common optimal control problems. We derive nominal asymptotic stability for the resulting relaxed system formulation and implement sum-up rounding to restore efficiently integer feasibility. If fast control switching is technically possible and inexpensive, we can approximate the relaxed system behavior in the state space arbitrarily close. We integrate input perturbed model predictive control with practical asymptotic stability. Numerical experiments support our theoretical findings and illustrate practical relevance of fast and systematic control switching.</description>

      <title>Prying Pedestrian Surveillance-Evasion: Minumum-Time Evasion from an Agile Pursuer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new surveillance-evasion differential game is posed and solved in which an agile pursuer (the prying pedestrian) seeks to remain within a given surveillance range of a less agile evader that aims to escape. In contrast to previous surveillance-evasion games, the pursuer is agile in the sense of being able to instantaneously change the direction of its velocity vector, whilst the evader is constrained to have a finite maximum turn rate. Both the game of kind concerned with conditions under which the evader can escape, and the game of degree concerned with the evader seeking to minimize the escape time whilst the pursuer seeks to maximize it, are considered. The game-of-degree solution is surprisingly complex compared to solutions to analogous pursuit-evasion games with an agile pursuer since it exhibits dependence on the ratio of the pursuer's speed to the evader's speed. It is, however, surprisingly simple compared to solutions to classic surveillance-evasion games with a turn-limited pursuer.</description>

Abstract: A standard (stiff) motion control with output displacement feedback cannot handle unforeseen contact with environment without penetrating into soft, i.e. viscoelastic, materials or even damaging brittle or fragile materials. Robotics and mechatronics with tactile and haptic capabilities, and medical assistance systems in particular, place special demands on the advanced motion control systems that should enable safe and harmless contact transitions. This paper demonstrates how the fundamental principles of loop shaping can easily be used to handle the sufficiently stiff motion control with a sensor-free dynamic extension to reconfigure at contact with environment. Hybrid control scheme is proposed. Remarkable feature of the developed approach is that no measurement of the contact force is required and the input signal and measured output displacement are the only quantities used for control design and operation. Experimental scenarios for 1DOF actuator are shown where the moving tool comes into contact with grape fruits that are soft and penetrable at the same time.</description>

      <title>Mixed-Integer Linear Programming Model for Collision Avoidance Planning in Commercial Aircraft Formations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With advancements in technology, commercial aircraft formation flying is becoming increasingly feasible as an efficient and environmentally friendly flight method. However, gaps remain in practical implementation, particularly in collision avoidance for aircraft formations. Existing avoidance algorithms mainly focus on single aircraft or UAV swarms, lacking comprehensive studies on the complex interactions within commercial aircraft formations. To address this, this paper proposes an optimization model designed to generate safe and effective collision avoidance solutions for commercial aircraft formations. This model demonstrates avoidance paths for formations facing intruders and offers insights for developing formation flight strategies. This study explores response strategies for commercial aircraft formations encountering intruders, considering the difficulty of pilot maneuvers. The findings provide theoretical support for the practical implementation of commercial formation flying and may advance the adoption of this technology.</description>

      <title>On Adaptive Observer-based Control for Nonlinear Multiagent Systems: Event-triggered Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the use of radial basis function neural networks (RBF NNs) and backstepping method to address the consensus tracking control problem in nonlinear semi-strict-feedback multiagent systems (MASs) that are affected by unknown states and perturbations. It introduces three different adaptive event-triggered control strategies, they are designed to compare controller update frequencies, thereby conserving scarce communication resources. To address the issues of unknown states and external perturbations detection while also reducing computational demands, a combined approach involving a state observer, a perturbation observer, and a first-order filter is proposed. In our analysis we establish that demonstrate that this method ensures all follower outputs can consistently track the leader's reference signal, while all error signals remaining uniformly bounded. Finally, we validate the efficiency of this control scheme through an illustrative example.</description>

      <title>Early Versus Late Traffic Management For Autonomous Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intersections pose critical challenges in traffic management, where maintaining operational constraints and ensuring safety are essential for efficient flow. This paper investigates the effect of intervention timing in management strategies on maintaining operational constraints at intersections while ensuring safe separation distance, avoiding collisions, and minimizing delay. We introduce control regions, represented as circles around the intersection, which refers to the timing of interventions by a centralized control system when agents approach the intersection. We use a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) approach to optimize the system's performance. To analyze the effectiveness of early and late control measures, a simulation study is conducted, focusing on the safe, efficient, and robust management of agent movement within the control regions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safe obstacle avoidance and target set stabilization for nonlinear systems using reactive feedback control is under consideration. Based only on local information and by considering virtual dynamics, a safe path is generated online. The control law for the virtual dynamics is combined with a feedback controller for the dynamics of interest, where Lyapunov arguments and forward invariance are used to ensure that the state of the system remains in a vicinity of the path. To allow for discrete decisions in the avoidance controller design, the closed-loop dynamics are formulated using the hybrid systems framework. The results are illustrated by a numerical example for unicycle dynamics.</description>

      <title>Secure Filtering against Spatio-Temporal False Data under Asynchronous Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the state estimation problem in continuous LTI systems under attacks with non-periodic and asynchronous sampled measurements. The non-periodic and asynchronous sampling requires sensors to transmit not only the measurement values but also the sampling time-stamps to the fusion center via unprotected communication channels. This communication scheme leaves the system vulnerable to a variety of malicious activities such as (i) manipulating measurement values, (ii) manipulating time-stamps, (iii) hybrid manipulations such as generating fake measurements or eliminating the measurement. To deal with such more powerful attacks, we propose a decentralized local estimation algorithm where each sensor maintains its local state estimate based on its measurements in an asynchronous fashion. The local states are synchronized by time-prediction and fused in an event-triggered manner. In the absence of attacks, local estimates are proved to recover the optimal Kalman estimation by our carefully designed weighted least square problem, given that the sample time is non-pathological. In the presence of attacks, an $\ell_1$ regularized least square problem is proposed to generate secure estimates with uniformly bounded error as long as the observability redundancy is satisfied. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through a benchmark example of the IEEE 14-bus system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of steering a collection of n particles that obey identical n-dimensional linear dynamics via a common state feedback law towards a rearrangement of their positions, cast as a controllability problem for a dynamical system evolving on the space of matrices with positive determinant. We show that such a task is always feasible and, moreover, that it can be achieved arbitrarily fast. We also show that an optimal feedback control policy to achieve a similar feat, may not exist. Furthermore, we show that there is no universal formula for a linear feedback control law to achieve a rearrangement, optimal or not, that is everywhere continuous with respect to the specifications. We conclude with partial results on the broader question of controllability of dynamics on orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Formal Verification of Digital Twins with TLA and Information Leakage Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Verifying the correctness of a digital twin provides a formal guarantee that the digital twin operates as intended. Digital twin verification is challenging due to the presence of uncertainties in the virtual representation, the physical environment, and the bidirectional flow of information between physical and virtual. A further challenge is that a digital twin of a complex system is composed of distributed components. This paper presents a methodology to specify and verify digital twin behavior, translating uncertain processes into a formally verifiable finite state machine. We use the Temporal Logic of Actions (TLA) to create a specification, an implementation abstraction that defines the properties required for correct system behavior. Our approach includes a novel weakening of formal security properties, allowing controlled information leakage while preserving theoretical guarantees. We demonstrate this approach on a digital twin of an unmanned aerial vehicle, verifying synchronization of physical-to-virtual and virtual-to-digital data flows to detect unintended misalignments.</description>

      <title>One-Step Early Stopping Strategy using Neural Tangent Kernel Theory and Rademacher Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The early stopping strategy consists in stopping the training process of a neural network (NN) on a set $S$ of input data before training error is minimal. The advantage is that the NN then retains good generalization properties, i.e. it gives good predictions on data outside $S$, and a good estimate of the statistical error (``population loss'') is obtained. We give here an analytical estimation of the optimal stopping time involving basically the initial training error vector and the eigenvalues of the ``neural tangent kernel''. This yields an upper bound on the population loss which is well-suited to the underparameterized context (where the number of parameters is moderate compared with the number of data). Our method is illustrated on the example of an NN simulating the MPC control of a Van der Pol oscillator.</description>

      <title>A Unified Platform for At-Home Post-Stroke Rehabilitation Enabled by Wearable Technologies and Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At-home rehabilitation for post-stroke patients presents significant challenges, as continuous, personalized care is often limited outside clinical settings. Additionally, the absence of comprehensive solutions addressing diverse rehabilitation needs in home environments complicates recovery efforts. Here, we introduce a smart home platform that integrates wearable sensors, ambient monitoring, and large language model (LLM)-powered assistance to provide seamless health monitoring and intelligent support. The system leverages machine learning enabled plantar pressure arrays for motor recovery assessment (94% classification accuracy), a wearable eye-tracking module for cognitive evaluation, and ambient sensors for precise smart home control (100% operational success, &lt;1 s latency). Additionally, the LLM-powered agent, Auto-Care, offers real-time interventions, such as health reminders and environmental adjustments, enhancing user satisfaction by 29%. This work establishes a fully integrated platform for long-term, personalized rehabilitation, offering new possibilities for managing chronic conditions and supporting aging populations.</description>

      <title>Connectivity Preserving Decentralized UAV Swarm Navigation in Obstacle-laden Environments without Explicit Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel control method for a group of UAVs in obstacle-laden environments while preserving sensing network connectivity without data transmission between the UAVs. By leveraging constraints rooted in control barrier functions (CBFs), the proposed method aims to overcome the limitations, such as oscillatory behaviors and frequent constraint violations, of the existing method based on artificial potential fields (APFs). More specifically, the proposed method first determines desired control inputs by considering CBF-based constraints rather than repulsive APFs. The desired inputs are then minimally modified by solving a numerical optimization problem with soft constraints. In addition to the optimization-based method, we present an approximate method without numerical optimization. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is evaluated by extensive simulations to compare the performance of the CBF-based methods with an APF-based approach. Experimental results using real quadrotors are also presented.</description>

      <title>Stochastic models for online optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose control-theoretic methods as tools for the design of online optimization algorithms that are able to address dynamic, noisy, and partially uncertain time-varying quadratic objective functions. Our approach introduces two algorithms specifically tailored for scenarios where the cost function follows a stochastic linear model. The first algorithm is based on a Kalman filter-inspired approach, leveraging state estimation techniques to account for the presence of noise in the evolution of the objective function. The second algorithm applies $\mathcal{H}_\infty$-robust control strategies to enhance performance under uncertainty, particularly in cases in which model parameters are characterized by a high variability.
  Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our algorithms offer significant performance advantages over the traditional gradient-based method and also over the optimization strategy proposed in arXiv:2205.13932 based on deterministic models.</description>

      <title>Quality Time: Carbon-Aware Quality Adaptation for Energy-Intensive Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The energy demand of modern cloud services, particularly those related to generative AI, is increasing at an unprecedented pace. While hyperscalers are collectively failing to meet their self-imposed emission reduction targets, they face increasing pressure from environmental sustainability reporting across many jurisdictions. To date, carbon-aware computing strategies have primarily focused on batch process scheduling or geo-distributed load balancing. However, such approaches are not applicable to services that require constant availability at specific locations, due to latency, privacy, data, or infrastructure constraints.
  In this paper, we explore how the carbon footprint of energy-intensive services can be reduced, by adjusting the fraction of requests served by different service quality tiers. We show, that by adapting the the quality of responses with respect to local carbon intensity, we can achieve additional carbon savings beyond resource and energy efficiency. Building on this, we introduce a multi-horizon optimization, that reaches close-to-optimal carbon savings under realistic conditions, and can dynamically adapt the service quality for best-effort users to stay within an annual carbon budget. Our approach can reduce the emissions of large-scale LLM services, which we estimate at multiple 10,000 tons of CO$_2$ annually, by up to 10%.</description>

      <title>Large width penalization for neural network-based prediction interval estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forecasting accuracy in highly uncertain environments is challenging due to the stochastic nature of systems. Deterministic forecasting provides only point estimates and cannot capture potential outcomes. Therefore, probabilistic forecasting has gained significant attention due to its ability to quantify uncertainty, where one of the approaches is to express it as a prediction interval (PI), that explicitly shows upper and lower bounds of predictions associated with a confidence level. High-quality PI is characterized by a high PI coverage probability (PICP) and a narrow PI width. In many real-world applications, the PI width is generally used in risk management to prepare resources that improve reliability and effectively manage uncertainty. A wider PI width results in higher costs for backup resources as decision-making processes often focus on the worst-case scenarios arising with large PI widths under extreme conditions. This study aims to reduce the large PI width from the PI estimation method by proposing a new PI loss function that penalizes the average of the large PI widths more heavily. The proposed formulation is compatible with gradient-based algorithms, the standard approach to training neural networks (NNs), and integrating state-of-the-art NNs and existing deep learning techniques. Experiments with the synthetic dataset reveal that our formulation significantly reduces the large PI width while effectively maintaining the PICP to achieve the desired probability. The practical implementation of our proposed loss function is demonstrated in solar irradiance forecasting, highlighting its effectiveness in minimizing the large PI width in data with high uncertainty and showcasing its compatibility with more complex neural network models. Therefore, reducing large PI widths from our method can lead to significant cost savings by over-allocation of reserve resources.</description>

      <title>Integrating Transit Signal Priority into Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning based Traffic Signal Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study integrates Transit Signal Priority (TSP) into multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) based traffic signal control. The first part of the study develops adaptive signal control based on MARL for a pair of coordinated intersections in a microscopic simulation environment. The two agents, one for each intersection, are centrally trained using a value decomposition network (VDN) architecture. The trained agents show slightly better performance compared to coordinated actuated signal control based on overall intersection delay at v/c of 0.95. In the second part of the study the trained signal control agents are used as background signal controllers while developing event-based TSP agents. In one variation, independent TSP agents are formulated and trained under a decentralized training and decentralized execution (DTDE) framework to implement TSP at each intersection. In the second variation, the two TSP agents are centrally trained under a centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) framework and VDN architecture to select and implement coordinated TSP strategies across the two intersections. In both cases the agents converge to the same bus delay value, but independent agents show high instability throughout the training process. For the test runs, the two independent agents reduce bus delay across the two intersections by 22% compared to the no TSP case while the coordinated TSP agents achieve 27% delay reduction. In both cases, there is only a slight increase in delay for a majority of the side street movements.</description>

      <title>Performance Evaluation of Single-step Explicit Exponential Integration Methods on Stiff Ordinary Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stiff systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) arise in a wide range of scientific and engineering disciplines and are traditionally solved using implicit integration methods due to their stability and efficiency. However, these methods are computationally expensive, particularly for applications requiring repeated integration, such as parameter estimation, Bayesian inference, neural ODEs, physics-informed neural networks, and MeshGraphNets. Explicit exponential integration methods have been proposed as a potential alternative, leveraging the matrix exponential to address stiffness without requiring nonlinear solvers. This study evaluates several state-of-the-art explicit single-step exponential schemes against classical implicit methods on benchmark stiff ODE problems, analyzing their accuracy, stability, and scalability with step size. Despite their initial appeal, our results reveal that explicit exponential methods significantly lag behind implicit schemes in accuracy and scalability for stiff ODEs. The backward Euler method consistently outperformed higher-order exponential methods in accuracy at small step sizes, with none surpassing the accuracy of the first-order integrating factor Euler method. Exponential methods fail to improve upon first-order accuracy, revealing the integrating factor Euler method as the only reliable choice for repeated, inexpensive integration in applications such as neural ODEs and parameter estimation. This study exposes the limitations of explicit exponential methods and calls for the development of improved algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Batch planning is increasingly crucial for the scalability of robotics tasks and dataset generation diversity. This paper presents Global Tensor Motion Planning (GTMP) -- a sampling-based motion planning algorithm comprising only tensor operations. We introduce a novel discretization structure represented as a random multipartite graph, enabling efficient vectorized sampling, collision checking, and search. We provide an early theoretical investigation showing that GTMP exhibits probabilistic completeness while supporting modern GPU/TPU. Additionally, by incorporating smooth structures into the multipartite graph, GTMP directly plans smooth splines without requiring gradient-based optimization. Experiments on lidar-scanned occupancy maps and the MotionBenchMarker dataset demonstrate GTMP's computation efficiency in batch planning compared to baselines, underscoring GTMP's potential as a robust, scalable planner for diverse applications and large-scale robot learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Q-learning-based Model-free Safety Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring safety via safety filters in real-world robotics presents significant challenges, particularly when the system dynamics is complex or unavailable. To handle this issue, learning-based safety filters recently gained popularity, which can be classified as model-based and model-free methods. Existing model-based approaches requires various assumptions on system model (e.g., control-affine), which limits their application in complex systems, and existing model-free approaches need substantial modifications to standard RL algorithms and lack versatility. This paper proposes a simple, plugin-and-play, and effective model-free safety filter learning framework. We introduce a novel reward formulation and use Q-learning to learn Q-value functions to safeguard arbitrary task specific nominal policies via filtering out their potentially unsafe actions. The threshold used in the filtering process is supported by our theoretical analysis. Due to its model-free nature and simplicity, our framework can be seamlessly integrated with various RL algorithms. We validate the proposed approach through simulations on double integrator and Dubin's car systems and demonstrate its effectiveness in real-world experiments with a soft robotic limb.</description>

      <title>Timely and Energy-Efficient Multi-Step Update Processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores systems where source updates require multiple sequential processing steps. We model and analyze the Age of Information (AoI) performance of various system designs under both parallel and series server setups. In parallel setups, each processor executes all computation steps with multiple processors working in parallel, while in series setups, each processor performs a specific step in sequence. In practice, processing faster is better in terms of age but it also consumes more power. We identify the occurrence of wasted power in these setups, which arises when processing efforts do not lead to a reduction in age. This happens when a fresher update finishes first in parallel servers or when a server preempts processing due to a fresher update from preceding server in series setups. To address this age-power trade-off, we formulate and solve an optimization problem to determine the optimal service rates for each processing step under a given power budget. We focus on a special case where updates require two computational steps.</description>

      <title>Scalable Primal Decomposition Schemes for Large-Scale Infrastructure Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The operation of large-scale infrastructure networks requires scalable optimization schemes. To guarantee safe system operation, a high degree of feasibility in a small number of iterations is important. Decomposition schemes can help to achieve scalability. In terms of feasibility, however, classical approaches such as the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) often converge slowly. In this work, we present primal decomposition schemes for hierarchically structured strongly convex QPs. These schemes offer high degrees of feasibility in a small number of iterations in combination with global convergence guarantees. We benchmark their performance against the centralized off-the-shelf interior-point solver Ipopt and ADMM on problems with up to 300,000 decision variables and constraints. We find that the proposed approaches solve problems as fast as Ipopt, but with reduced communication and without requiring a full model exchange. Moreover, the proposed schemes achieve a higher accuracy than ADMM.</description>

      <title>Semi-implicit Continuous Newton Method for Power Flow Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As an effective emulator of ill-conditioned power flow, continuous Newton methods (CNMs) have been extensively investigated using explicit and implicit numerical integration algorithms. Explicit CNMs are prone to non-convergence issues due to their limited stable region, while implicit CNMs introduce additional iteration-loops of nonlinear equations. Faced with this, we propose a semi-implicit version of CNM. We formulate the power flow equations as a set of differential algebraic equations (DAEs), and solve the DAEs with the stiffly accurate Rosenbrock type method (SARM). The proposed method succeeds the numerical robustness from the implicit CNM framework while prevents the iterative solution of nonlinear systems, hence revealing higher convergence speed and computation efficiency. A new 4-stage 3rd-order hyper-stable SARM, together with a 2nd-order embedded formula to control the step size, is constructed to further accelerate convergence by tuning the damping factor. Case studies on ill-conditioned systems verified the alleged performance. An algorithm extension for MATPOWER is made available on Github for benchmarking.</description>

      <title>Moving-Horizon Estimators for Hyperbolic and Parabolic PDEs in 1-D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observers for PDEs are themselves PDEs. Therefore, producing real time estimates with such observers is computationally burdensome. For both finite-dimensional and ODE systems, moving-horizon estimators (MHE) are operators whose output is the state estimate, while their inputs are the initial state estimate at the beginning of the horizon as well as the measured output and input signals over the moving time horizon. In this paper we introduce MHEs for PDEs which remove the need for a numerical solution of an observer PDE in real time. We accomplish this using the PDE backstepping method which, for certain classes of both hyperbolic and parabolic PDEs, produces moving-horizon state estimates explicitly. Precisely, to explicitly produce the state estimates, we employ a backstepping transformation of a hard-to-solve observer PDE into a target observer PDE, which is explicitly solvable. The MHEs we propose are not new observer designs but simply the explicit MHE realizations, over a moving horizon of arbitrary length, of the existing backstepping observers. Our PDE MHEs lack the optimality of the MHEs that arose as duals of MPC, but they are given explicitly, even for PDEs. In the paper we provide explicit formulae for MHEs for both hyperbolic and parabolic PDEs, as well as simulation results that illustrate theoretically guaranteed convergence of the MHEs.</description>

      <title>Non-iterative Optimization of Trajectory and Radio Resource for Aerial Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address a joint trajectory planning, user association, resource allocation, and power control problem to maximize proportional fairness in the aerial IoT network, considering practical end-to-end quality-of-service (QoS) and communication schedules. Though the problem is rather ancient, apart from the fact that the previous approaches have never considered user- and time-specific QoS, we point out a prevalent mistake in coordinate optimization approaches adopted by the majority of the literature. Coordinate optimization approaches, which repetitively optimize radio resources for a fixed trajectory and vice versa, generally converge to local optima when all variables are differentiable. However, these methods often stagnate at a non-stationary point, significantly degrading the network utility in mixed-integer problems such as joint trajectory and radio resource optimization. We detour this problem by converting the formulated problem into the Markov decision process (MDP). Exploiting the beneficial characteristics of the MDP, we design a non-iterative framework that cooperatively optimizes trajectory and radio resources without initial trajectory choice. The proposed framework can incorporate various trajectory-planning algorithms such as the genetic algorithm, tree search, and reinforcement learning. Extensive comparisons with diverse baselines verify that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art method, nearly achieving the global optimum. Our implementation code is available at https://github.com/hslyu/dbspf.{https://github.com/hslyu/dbspf}.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Planning of Ventilation Systems: Optimising for Life-Cycle Costs and Acoustic Comfort</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The European Union's climate targets challenge the building sector to reduce energy use while ensuring comfort. Ventilation systems play an important role in achieving these goals. During system planning, the primary focus tends to lie on reducing life-cycle costs, including energy and investment expenses. Acoustic considerations which contribute significantly to occupant comfort, are either addressed as an afterthought or overlooked. This can result in suboptimal designs, where silencers are added indiscriminately without properly assessing their necessity. This paper introduces a novel method for optimising life-cycle costs through mathematical optimisation while adhering to predefined noise limits. We propose new model equations with reduce non-linearity better suited for integration into the optimisation framework. Further, they present a comprehensive approach to optimising ventilation systems under multiple load scenarios. Our method surpasses the traditional sequential approach by enabling simultaneous consideration of airflow and acoustics in a single, holistic optimisation step. A case study demonstrates the method's practical application, showing that optimal solutions can be computed efficiently. The results reveal that, with appropriate fan selection, many silencers can be eliminated. Additionally, the method supports decision-making by transparently illustrating the trade-offs between life-cycle costs and noise limits. Notably, while optimal solutions from the sequential and holistic approaches align for most noise limits, the holistic method achieves a 12 % reduction in costs under specific noise constraints. These results demonstrate the benefits of integrating airflow and acoustic design while underscoring the need for further application on more diverse building types and more complex ventilation system configurations.</description>

      <title>Adaptive control of reaction-diffusion PDEs via neural operator-approximated gain kernels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural operator approximations of the gain kernels in PDE backstepping has emerged as a viable method for implementing controllers in real time. With such an approach, one approximates the gain kernel, which maps the plant coefficient into the solution of a PDE, with a neural operator. It is in adaptive control that the benefit of the neural operator is realized, as the kernel PDE solution needs to be computed online, for every updated estimate of the plant coefficient. We extend the neural operator methodology from adaptive control of a hyperbolic PDE to adaptive control of a benchmark parabolic PDE (a reaction-diffusion equation with a spatially-varying and unknown reaction coefficient). We prove global stability and asymptotic regulation of the plant state for a Lyapunov design of parameter adaptation. The key technical challenge of the result is handling the 2D nature of the gain kernels and proving that the target system with two distinct sources of perturbation terms, due to the parameter estimation error and due to the neural approximation error, is Lyapunov stable. To verify our theoretical result, we present simulations achieving calculation speedups up to 45x relative to the traditional finite difference solvers for every timestep in the simulation trajectory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06718v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper offers a comprehensive performance analysis of the distributed continuous-time filtering in the presence of modeling errors. First, we introduce two performance indices, namely the nominal performance index and the estimation error covariance. By leveraging the nominal performance index and the Frobenius norm of the modeling deviations, we derive the bounds of the estimation error covariance and the lower bound of the nominal performance index. Specifically, we reveal the effect of the consensus parameter on both bounds. We demonstrate that, under specific conditions, an incorrect process noise covariance can lead to the divergence of the estimation error covariance. Moreover, we investigate the properties of the eigenvalues of the error dynamical matrix. Furthermore, we explore the magnitude relations between the nominal performance index and the estimation error covariance. Finally, we present some numerical simulations to validate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15497v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear observed systems on manifolds are a special class of nonlinear systems whose state spaces are smooth manifolds but possess properties similar to linear systems. Such properties can be characterized by preintegration and exact linearization with Jacobians independent of the linearization point. Non-biased IMU dynamics in navigation can be constructed into linear observed settings, leading to invariant filters with guaranteed behaviors such as local convergence and consistency. In this letter, we establish linear observed property for systems evolving on a smooth manifold through the connection structure endowed upon this space. Our key findings are the existence of linear observed systems on manifolds poses constraints on the curvature of the state space, beyond requiring the dynamics to be compatible with some connection-preserving transformations. Specifically, the flat connection case reproduces the characterization of linear observed systems on Lie groups, showing our theory is a true generalization.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Dynamic Intervention Design in Network Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Targeted interventions in games present a challenging problem due to the asymmetric information available to the regulator and the agents. This note addresses the problem of steering the actions of self-interested agents in quadratic network games towards a target action profile. A common starting point in the literature assumes prior knowledge of utility functions and/or network parameters. The goal of the results presented here is to remove this assumption and address scenarios where such a priori knowledge is unavailable. To this end, we design a data-driven dynamic intervention mechanism that relies solely on historical observations of agent actions and interventions. Additionally, we modify this mechanism to limit the amount of interventions, thereby considering budget constraints. Analytical convergence guarantees are provided for both mechanisms, and a numerical case study further demonstrates their effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Improved Convolution-Based Analysis for Worst-Case Probability Response Time of CAN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controller Area Networks (CANs) are widely adopted in real-time automotive control and are increasingly standard in factory automation. Considering their critical application in safety-critical systems, The error rate of the system must be accurately predicted and guaranteed. Through simulation, it is possible to obtain a low-precision overview of the system's behavior. However, for low-probability events, the required number of samples in simulation increases rapidly, making it difficult to conduct a sufficient number of simulations in practical applications, and the statistical results may deviate from the actual outcomes. Therefore, a formal analysis is needed to evaluate the error rate of the system. This paper improves the worst-case probability response time analysis by using convolution-based busy-window and backlog techniques under the error retransmission protocol of CANs. Empirical analysis shows that the proposed method improves upon existing methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents analytic study and design considerations of flat wire inductors with distributed gaps for high-power and compact DC-DC Converters. The focus is eddy current loss components within the conductors due to fringing and leakage fluxes. A magnetic equivalent circuit (MEC) is proposed in which eddy currents are modeled by MMFs opposing the primary flux as well as frequency dependent reluctances, which finally leads to a frequency dependent inductance describing the behavior of the inductor at high frequencies. Three formulations for DC resistance depending on the required accuracy are developed. Calculations of the AC resistance based on vector potential obtained from FEM are provided. To provide an insight into the optimized design of such inductors, components of the magnetic flux and induced eddy currents along with sensitivity of the main inductor quantities such as DCR, ESR, loss components and inductance values to the design parameters are investigated. Finally, an inductor is prototyped and experimentally tested to verify the design.</description>

      <title>BP-MPC: Optimizing the Closed-Loop Performance of MPC using BackPropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15521v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) is pervasive in research and industry. However, designing the cost function and the constraints of the MPC to maximize closed-loop performance remains an open problem. To achieve optimal tuning, we propose a backpropagation scheme that solves a policy optimization problem with nonlinear system dynamics and MPC policies. We enforce the system dynamics using linearization and allow the MPC problem to contain elements that depend on the current system state and on past MPC solutions. Moreover, we propose a simple extension that can deal with losses of feasibility. Our approach, unlike other methods in the literature, enjoys convergence guarantees.</description>

      <title>Powerformer: A Section-adaptive Transformer for Power Flow Adjustment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02771v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel transformer architecture tailored for learning robust power system state representations, which strives to optimize power dispatch for the power flow adjustment across different transmission sections. Specifically, our proposed approach, named Powerformer, develops a dedicated section-adaptive attention mechanism, separating itself from the self-attention used in conventional transformers. This mechanism effectively integrates power system states with transmission section information, which facilitates the development of robust state representations. Furthermore, by considering the graph topology of power system and the electrical attributes of bus nodes, we introduce two customized strategies to further enhance the expressiveness: graph neural network propagation and multi-factor attention mechanism. Extensive evaluations are conducted on three power system scenarios, including the IEEE 118-bus system, a realistic 300-bus system in China, and a large-scale European system with 9241 buses, where Powerformer demonstrates its superior performance over several baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Learning Local Control Barrier Functions for Hybrid Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hybrid dynamical systems are ubiquitous as practical robotic applications often involve both continuous states and discrete switchings. Safety is a primary concern for hybrid robotic systems. Existing safety-critical control approaches for hybrid systems are either computationally inefficient, detrimental to system performance, or limited to small-scale systems. To amend these drawbacks, in this paper, we propose a learning-enabled approach to construct local Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to guarantee the safety of a wide class of nonlinear hybrid dynamical systems. The end result is a safe neural CBF-based switching controller. Our approach is computationally efficient, minimally invasive to any reference controller, and applicable to large-scale systems. We empirically evaluate our framework and demonstrate its efficacy and flexibility through two robotic examples including a high-dimensional autonomous racing case, against other CBF-based approaches and model predictive control.</description>

      <title>Safe, Out-of-Distribution-Adaptive MPC with Conformalized Neural Network Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present SODA-MPC, a Safe, Out-of-Distribution-Adaptive Model Predictive Control algorithm, which uses an ensemble of learned models for prediction, with a runtime monitor to flag unreliable out-of-distribution (OOD) predictions. When an OOD situation is detected, SODA-MPC triggers a safe fallback control strategy based on reachability, yielding a control framework that achieves the high performance of learning-based models while preserving the safety of reachability-based control. We demonstrate the method in the context of an autonomous vehicle, driving among dynamic pedestrians, where SODA-MPC uses a neural network ensemble for pedestrian prediction. We calibrate the OOD signal using conformal prediction to derive an OOD detector with probabilistic guarantees on the false-positive rate, given a user-specified confidence level. During in-distribution operation, the MPC controller avoids collisions with a pedestrian based on the trajectory predicted by the mean of the ensemble. When OOD conditions are detected, the MPC switches to a reachability-based controller to avoid collisions with the reachable set of the pedestrian assuming a maximum pedestrian speed, to guarantee safety under the worst-case actions of the pedestrian. We verify SODA-MPC in extensive autonomous driving simulations in a pedestrian-crossing scenario. Our model ensemble is trained and calibrated with real pedestrian data, showing that our OOD detector obtains the desired accuracy rate within a theoretically-predicted range. We empirically show improved safety and improved task completion compared with two state-of-the-art MPC methods that also use conformal prediction, but without OOD adaptation. Further, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with the large-scale multi-agent predictor Trajectron++, using large-scale traffic data from the nuScenes dataset for training and calibration.</description>

      <title>Predictive Spliner: Data-Driven Overtaking in Autonomous Racing Using Opponent Trajectory Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Head-to-head racing against opponents is a challenging and emerging topic in the domain of autonomous racing. We propose Predictive Spliner, a data-driven overtaking planner that learns the behavior of opponents through Gaussian Process (GP) regression, which is then leveraged to compute viable overtaking maneuvers in future sections of the racing track. Experimentally validated on a 1:10 scale autonomous racing platform using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) information to perceive the opponent, Predictive Spliner outperforms State-of-the-Art (SotA) algorithms by overtaking opponents at up to 83.1% of its own speed, being on average 8.4% faster than the previous best-performing method. Additionally, it achieves an average success rate of 84.5%, which is 47.6% higher than the previous best-performing method. The method maintains computational efficiency with a Central Processing Unit (CPU) load of 22.79% and a computation time of 8.4 ms, evaluated on a Commercial off-the-Shelf (CotS) Intel i7-1165G7, making it suitable for real-time robotic applications. These results highlight the potential of Predictive Spliner to enhance the performance and safety of autonomous racing vehicles. The code for Predictive Spliner is available at: https://github.com/ForzaETH/predictive-spliner.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Satisfaction of Temporal Logic Constraints in Reinforcement Learning via Adaptive Policy-Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) is a subset of machine learning that introduces constraints into the traditional reinforcement learning (RL) framework. Unlike conventional RL which aims solely to maximize cumulative rewards, CRL incorporates additional constraints that represent specific mission requirements or limitations that the agent must comply with during the learning process. In this paper, we address a type of CRL problem where an agent aims to learn the optimal policy to maximize reward while ensuring a desired level of temporal logic constraint satisfaction throughout the learning process. We propose a novel framework that relies on switching between pure learning (reward maximization) and constraint satisfaction. This framework estimates the probability of constraint satisfaction based on earlier trials and properly adjusts the probability of switching between learning and constraint satisfaction policies. We theoretically validate the correctness of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate its performance through comprehensive simulations.</description>

      <title>Offline Reinforcement Learning and Sequence Modeling for Downlink Link Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Link adaptation (LA) is an essential function in modern wireless communication systems that dynamically adjusts the transmission rate of a communication link to match time- and frequency-varying radio link conditions. However, factors such as user mobility, fast fading, imperfect channel quality information, and aging of measurements make the modeling of LA challenging. To bypass the need for explicit modeling, recent research has introduced online reinforcement learning (RL) approaches as an alternative to the more commonly used rule-based algorithms. Yet, RL-based approaches face deployment challenges, as training in live networks can potentially degrade real-time performance. To address this challenge, this paper considers offline RL as a candidate to learn LA policies with minimal effects on the network operation. We propose three LA designs based on batch-constrained deep Q-learning, conservative Q-learning, and decision transformer. Our results show that offline RL algorithms can match the performance of state-of-the-art online RL methods when data is collected with a proper behavioral policy.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model-based Decision-making for COLREGs and the Control of Autonomous Surface Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs), devising decision-making and obstacle avoidance solutions that address maritime COLREGs (Collision Regulations), primarily defined for human operators, has long been a pressing challenge. Recent advancements in explainable Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning have shown promise in enabling human-like decision-making. Notably, significant developments have occurred in the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to the decision-making of complex systems, such as self-driving cars. The textual and somewhat ambiguous nature of COLREGs (from an algorithmic perspective), however, poses challenges that align well with the capabilities of LLMs, suggesting that LLMs may become increasingly suitable for this application soon. This paper presents and demonstrates the first application of LLM-based decision-making and control for ASVs. The proposed method establishes a high-level decision-maker that uses online collision risk indices and key measurements to make decisions for safe manoeuvres. A tailored design and runtime structure is developed to support training and real-time action generation on a realistic ASV model. Local planning and control algorithms are integrated to execute the commands for waypoint following and collision avoidance at a lower level. To the authors' knowledge, this study represents the first attempt to apply explainable AI to the dynamic control problem of maritime systems recognising the COLREGs rules, opening new avenues for research in this challenging area. Results obtained across multiple test scenarios demonstrate the system's ability to maintain online COLREGs compliance, accurate waypoint tracking, and feasible control, while providing human-interpretable reasoning for each decision.</description>

      <title>Wearable intelligent throat enables natural speech in stroke patients with dysarthria</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wearable silent speech systems hold significant potential for restoring communication in patients with speech impairments. However, seamless, coherent speech remains elusive, and clinical efficacy is still unproven. Here, we present an AI-driven intelligent throat (IT) system that integrates throat muscle vibrations and carotid pulse signal sensors with large language model (LLM) processing to enable fluent, emotionally expressive communication. The system utilizes ultrasensitive textile strain sensors to capture high-quality signals from the neck area and supports token-level processing for real-time, continuous speech decoding, enabling seamless, delay-free communication. In tests with five stroke patients with dysarthria, IT's LLM agents intelligently corrected token errors and enriched sentence-level emotional and logical coherence, achieving low error rates (4.2% word error rate, 2.9% sentence error rate) and a 55% increase in user satisfaction. This work establishes a portable, intuitive communication platform for patients with dysarthria with the potential to be applied broadly across different neurological conditions and in multi-language support systems.</description>
