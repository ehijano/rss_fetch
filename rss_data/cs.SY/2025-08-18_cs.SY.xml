      <title>Overview of Complex System Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter serves as an introduction to systems engineering focused on the broad issues surrounding realizing complex integrated systems. What is a system? We pose a number of possible definitions and perspectives, but leave open the opportunity to consider the system from the target context where it will be used. Once we have a system in mind, we acknowledge the fact that this system needs to integrate a variety of pieces, components, subsystems, in order for it to accomplish its task. Therefore, we concern ourselves at the boundaries and interfaces of different technologies and disciplines to determine how best to achieve that integration. Next we raise the specter that this integrated system is complex. Complexity can be defined in a number of ways. For one, the sheer number of subsystems or components can be a measure of complexity. We could also consider the functions being performed by the system and how those functions interact with one another. Further, we could consider computational aspects such as the time or memory that may be needed to accomplish one or more tasks. The extent to which new behaviors might emerge from the system can also be regarded as an element of complexity. In the end, complexity is that characteristic of a system that defines the associated challenges along the life of the system, so we are concerned with how to manage that complexity. Finally, realization refers to the process by which our complex integrated system moves from concept to deployment and subsequent support. It refers to the entire design, development, manufacture, deployment, operation, and support life cycle. Of particular note here, however, is that we focus on systems that, by their very nature, are complex. In other words, we are interested in large, complicated, interacting beasts that are intended to perform difficult tasks and meet a wide variety of end-user needs.</description>

      <title>Risk-Based Prognostics and Health Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is often the case that risk assessment and prognostics are viewed as related but separate tasks. This chapter describes a risk-based approach to prognostics that seeks to provide a tighter coupling between risk assessment and fault prediction. We show how this can be achieved using the continuous-time Bayesian network as the underlying modeling framework. Furthermore, we provide an overview of the techniques that are available to derive these models from data and show how they might be used in practice to achieve tasks like decision support and performance-based logistics. This work is intended to provide an overview of the recent developments related to risk-based prognostics, and we hope that it will serve as a tutorial of sorts that will assist others in adopting these techniques.</description>

      <title>A Neural Column-and-Constraint Generation Method for Solving Two-Stage Stochastic Unit Commitment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-stage stochastic unit commitment (2S-SUC) problems have been widely adopted to manage the uncertainties introduced by high penetrations of intermittent renewable energy resources. While decomposition-based algorithms such as column-and-constraint generation has been proposed to solve these problems, they remain computationally prohibitive for large-scale, real-time applications. In this paper, we introduce a Neural Column-and-Constraint Generation (Neural CCG) method to significantly accelerate the solution of 2S-SUC problems. The proposed approach integrates a neural network that approximates the second-stage recourse problem by learning from high-level features of operational scenarios and the first-stage commitment decisions. This neural estimator is embedded within the CCG framework, replacing repeated subproblem solving with rapid neural evaluations. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on the IEEE 118-bus system. Compared to the original CCG and a state-of-the-art commercial solver, Neural CCG achieves up to 130.1$\times$ speedup while maintaining a mean optimality gap below 0.096\%, demonstrating its strong potential for scalable stochastic optimization in power system.</description>

      <title>Managing Risks from Large Digital Loads Using Coordinated Grid-Forming Storage Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anticipated rapid growth of large digital load, driven by artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, is poised to increase uncertainty and large fluctuations in consumption, threatening the stability, reliability, and security of the energy infrastructure. Conventional measures taken by grid planners and operators to ensure stable and reliable integration of new resources are either cost-prohibitive (e.g., transmission upgrades) or ill-equipped (e.g., generation control) to resolve the unique challenges brought on by AI Data Centers (e.g., extreme load transients). In this work, we explore the feasibility of coordinating and managing available flexibility in the grid, in terms of grid-forming storage units, to ensure stable and reliable integration of AI Data Centers without the need for costly grid upgrades. Recently developed bi-layered coordinated control strategies -- involving fast-acting, local, autonomous, control at the storage to maintain transient safety in voltage and frequency at the point-of-interconnection, and a slower, coordinated (consensus) control to restore normal operating condition in the grid -- are used in the case studies. A comparison is drawn between broadly two scenarios: a network of coordinated, smaller, distributed storage vs. larger storage installations collocated with large digital loads. IEEE 68-bus network is used for the case studies, with large digital load profiles drawn from the MIT Supercloud Dataset.</description>

      <title>Direct data-driven interpolation and approximation of linear parameter-varying system trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating missing values in trajectories of linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems. We solve this interpolation problem for the class of shifted-affine LPV systems. Conditions for the existence and uniqueness of solutions are given and a direct data-driven algorithm for its computation is presented, i.e., the data-generating system is not given by a parametric model but is implicitly specified by data. We illustrate the applicability of the proposed solution on illustrative examples of a mass-spring-damper system with exogenous and endogenous parameter variation.</description>

      <title>System Synchronization Based on Complex Frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In response to the inertia decline caused by high penetration of renewable generation, traditional synchronization criteria that rely solely on frequency consistency are increasingly inadequate for characterizing the coupled behavior of frequency and voltage dynamics during power-system transients. This paper focuses on the theory of complex-frequency synchronization and develops a theory-simulation analysis framework that offers a new perspective for steady-state and transient analysis of low-inertia power systems. First, the fundamental concepts and theoretical foundations of complex-frequency synchronization are presented in detail. Second, local and global dynamic synchronization criteria are derived and the concept of generalized inertia is introduced, which unifies the conventional inertial support to frequency with the inertia-like support of voltage, thereby providing an accurate measure of region-level coupled support strength for voltage and frequency. Finally, numerical case studies on the IEEE 9-bus system validate the effectiveness of the proposed theoretical methods and criteria, and demonstrate a visualization workflow for key indicators such as disturbance impact zones and generalized-inertia regions.</description>

      <title>Principles of Physiological Closed-Loop Controllers in Neuromodulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As neurostimulation devices increasingly incorporate closed-loop functionality, the greater design complexity brings additional requirements for risk management and special considerations to optimise benefit. This manuscript creates a common framework upon which all current and planned neuromodulation-based physiological closed-loop controllers (PCLCs) can be mapped including integration of the Technical Considerations of Medical Devices with Physiologic Closed-Loop Control Technology guidance published in 2023 by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a classification of feedback (reactive) and feedforward (predictive) biomarkers, and control systems theory. We explain risk management in the context of this framework and illustrate its applications for three exemplary technologies. This manuscript serves as guidance to the emerging field of PCLCs in neuromodulation, mitigating risk through standardized nomenclature and a systematic outline for rigorous device development, testing, and implementation.</description>

      <title>Integrating Uncertainties for Koopman-Based Stabilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decades, the Koopman operator has been widely applied in data-driven control, yet its theoretical foundations remain underexplored. This paper establishes a unified framework to address the robust stabilization problem in data-driven control via the Koopman operator, fully accounting for three uncertainties: projection error, estimation error, and process disturbance. It comprehensively investigates both direct and indirect data-driven control approaches, facilitating flexible methodology selection for analysis and control. For the direct approach, considering process disturbances, the lifted-state feedback controller, designed via a linear matrix inequality (LMI), robustly stabilizes all lifted bilinear systems consistent with noisy data. For the indirect approach requiring system identification, the feedback controller, designed using a nonlinear matrix inequality convertible to an LMI, ensures closed-loop stability under worst-case process disturbances. Numerical simulations via cross-validation validate the effectiveness of both approaches, highlighting their theoretical significance and practical utility.</description>

      <title>Identification of Sub/Super-Synchronous Control Interaction Paths Using Dissipative Energy Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub- and super-synchronous control interactions (SSCIs) are oscillations arising from adverse interactions between inverter-based resource (IBR) controls and the power network. SSCIs often involve multiple frequencies and propagate through complex, interconnected paths, making it difficult for model-based approaches to identify both the sources and the paths of oscillatory energy flow. This paper extends the Dissipative Energy Flow (DEF) method, originally developed for low-frequency electromechanical oscillations, to identify SSCI sources and dynamic interaction paths across multiple frequencies using three-phase voltage and current measurements. The approach operates in the dq frame using dynamic phasors, enabling mode-specific DEF computation from bandpass-filtered signals. An electromagnetic transient (EMT) case study on a meshed network with synchronous generator and type-3 wind farm resources under series-compensated conditions demonstrates the method's capability to distinguish frequency-dependent source and sink roles, including cases where the same resource acts as a source at one frequency and a sink at another. The results show DEF can provide a physics-based and automation-friendly tool for SSCI diagnosis in IBR-rich grids.</description>

      <title>Two-Impulse Trajectory Design in Two-Body Systems With Riemannian Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a new method for generating impulsive trajectories in restricted two-body systems by leveraging Riemannian geometry. The proposed method transforms the standard trajectory optimization problem into a purely geometric one that involves computing a set of geodesics for a suitable Riemannian metric. This transformation is achieved by defining a metric, specifically the Jacobi metric, that embeds the dynamics directly into the metric, so any geodesic of the metric is also a dynamically feasible trajectory. The method finds the fuel-optimal transfer trajectory by sampling candidate energy ($\Delta V$) changes for different points on the current and desired orbit, and efficiently computing and evaluating each candidate geodesic, which are equivalent to candidate orbit transfer trajectories via the Jacobi metric. The method bypasses the known issues of optimization-based methods, e.g., sensitivity to the initial guess, and can be applied to more complex two-body systems. The approach is demonstrated on the minimum-$\Delta V$ two-impulse phase-free orbit transfer problem, first on a Keplerian system and second on a system with a modeled $J_2$ perturbation. The proposed method is shown to meet or exceed the state-of-the-art methods in the minimum-$\Delta V$ problem in the Keplerian system. The generality and versatility of the approach is demonstrated by seamlessly including the $J_2$ perturbation, a case that many existing methods cannot handle. Numerical simulations and performance comparisons showcase the effectiveness of the approach.</description>

      <title>Robust Online Calibration for UWB-Aided Visual-Inertial Navigation with Bias Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel robust online calibration framework for Ultra-Wideband (UWB) anchors in UWB-aided Visual-Inertial Navigation Systems (VINS). Accurate anchor positioning, a process known as calibration, is crucial for integrating UWB ranging measurements into state estimation. While several prior works have demonstrated satisfactory results by using robot-aided systems to autonomously calibrate UWB systems, there are still some limitations: 1) these approaches assume accurate robot localization during the initialization step, ignoring localization errors that can compromise calibration robustness, and 2) the calibration results are highly sensitive to the initial guess of the UWB anchors' positions, reducing the practical applicability of these methods in real-world scenarios. Our approach addresses these challenges by explicitly incorporating the impact of robot localization uncertainties into the calibration process, ensuring robust initialization. To further enhance the robustness of the calibration results against initialization errors, we propose a tightly-coupled Schmidt Kalman Filter (SKF)-based online refinement method, making the system suitable for practical applications. Simulations and real-world experiments validate the improved accuracy and robustness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Zono-Conformal Prediction: Zonotope-Based Uncertainty Quantification for Regression and Classification Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction is a popular uncertainty quantification method that augments a base predictor with prediction sets with statistically valid coverage guarantees. However, current methods are often computationally expensive and data-intensive, as they require constructing an uncertainty model before calibration. Moreover, existing approaches typically represent the prediction sets with intervals, which limits their ability to capture dependencies in multi-dimensional outputs. We address these limitations by introducing zono-conformal prediction, a novel approach inspired by interval predictor models and reachset-conformant identification that constructs prediction zonotopes with assured coverage. By placing zonotopic uncertainty sets directly into the model of the base predictor, zono-conformal predictors can be identified via a single, data-efficient linear program. While we can apply zono-conformal prediction to arbitrary nonlinear base predictors, we focus on feed-forward neural networks in this work. Aside from regression tasks, we also construct optimal zono-conformal predictors in classification settings where the output of an uncertain predictor is a set of possible classes. We provide probabilistic coverage guarantees and present methods for detecting outliers in the identification data. In extensive numerical experiments, we show that zono-conformal predictors are less conservative than interval predictor models and standard conformal prediction methods, while achieving a similar coverage over the test data.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Aware Predictive Safety Filters on Humanoids: From Poisson Safety Functions to CBF Constrained MPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous navigation through unstructured and dynamically-changing environments is a complex task that continues to present many challenges for modern roboticists. In particular, legged robots typically possess manipulable asymmetric geometries which must be considered during safety-critical trajectory planning. This work proposes a predictive safety filter: a nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for online trajectory generation with geometry-aware safety constraints based on control barrier functions (CBFs). Critically, our method leverages Poisson safety functions to numerically synthesize CBF constraints directly from perception data. We extend the theoretical framework for Poisson safety functions to incorporate temporal changes in the domain by reformulating the static Dirichlet problem for Poisson's equation as a parameterized moving boundary value problem. Furthermore, we employ Minkowski set operations to lift the domain into a configuration space that accounts for robot geometry. Finally, we implement our real-time predictive safety filter on humanoid and quadruped robots in various safety-critical scenarios. The results highlight the versatility of Poisson safety functions, as well as the benefit of CBF constrained model predictive safety-critical controllers.</description>

      <title>Robust Convolution Neural ODEs via Contractivity-promoting regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks can be fragile to input noise and adversarial attacks.
  In this work, we consider Convolutional Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs), a family of continuous-depth neural networks represented by dynamical systems, and propose to use contraction theory to improve their robustness.
  For a contractive dynamical system two trajectories starting from different initial conditions converge to each other exponentially fast.
  Contractive Convolutional NODEs can enjoy increased robustness as slight perturbations of the features do not cause a significant change in the output.
  Contractivity can be induced during training by using a regularization term involving the Jacobian of the system dynamics.
  To reduce the computational burden, we show that it can also be promoted using carefully selected weight regularization terms for a class of NODEs with slope-restricted activation functions.
  The performance of the proposed regularizers is illustrated through benchmark image classification tasks on MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets, where images are corrupted by different kinds of noise and attacks.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of Floating-Base Space Parameterizations for Agile Whole-Body Motion Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatically generating agile whole-body motions for legged and humanoid robots remains a fundamental challenge in robotics. While numerous trajectory optimization approaches have been proposed, there is no clear guideline on how the choice of floating-base space parameterization affects performance, especially for agile behaviors involving complex contact dynamics. In this paper, we present a comparative study of different parameterizations for direct transcription-based trajectory optimization of agile motions in legged systems. We systematically evaluate several common choices under identical optimization settings to ensure a fair comparison. Furthermore, we introduce a novel formulation based on the tangent space of SE(3) for representing the robot's floating-base pose, which, to our knowledge, has not received attention from the literature. This approach enables the use of mature off-the-shelf numerical solvers without requiring specialized manifold optimization techniques. We hope that our experiments and analysis will provide meaningful insights for selecting the appropriate floating-based representation for agile whole-body motion generation.</description>

      <title>Towards Fully Onboard State Estimation and Trajectory Tracking for UAVs with Suspended Payloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of tracking the position of a cable-suspended payload carried by an unmanned aerial vehicle, with a focus on real-world deployment and minimal hardware requirements. In contrast to many existing approaches that rely on motion-capture systems, additional onboard cameras, or instrumented payloads, we propose a framework that uses only standard onboard sensors--specifically, real-time kinematic global navigation satellite system measurements and data from the onboard inertial measurement unit--to estimate and control the payload's position. The system models the full coupled dynamics of the aerial vehicle and payload, and integrates a linear Kalman filter for state estimation, a model predictive contouring control planner, and an incremental model predictive controller. The control architecture is designed to remain effective despite sensing limitations and estimation uncertainty. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed system achieves performance comparable to control based on ground-truth measurements, with only minor degradation (&lt; 6%). The system also shows strong robustness to variations in payload parameters. Field experiments further validate the framework, confirming its practical applicability and reliable performance in outdoor environments using only off-the-shelf aerial vehicle hardware.</description>

      <title>A Dynamically Weighted ADMM Framework for Byzantine Resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The alternating direction of multipliers method (ADMM) is a popular method to solve distributed consensus optimization utilizing efficient communication among various nodes in the network. However, in the presence of faulty or attacked nodes, even a small perturbation (or sharing false data) during the communication can lead to divergence of the solution. To address this issue, in this work we consider ADMM under the effect of Byzantine threat, where an unknown subset of nodes is subject to Byzantine attacks or faults. We propose Dynamically Weighted ADMM (DW-ADMM), a novel variant of ADMM that uses dynamic weights on the edges of the network, thus promoting resilient distributed optimization. We establish that the proposed method (i) produces a nearly identical solution to conventional ADMM in the error-free case, and (ii) guarantees a bounded solution with respect to the global minimizer, even under Byzantine threat. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm using an illustrative numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>Nominal Evaluation Of Automatic Multi-Sections Control Potential In Comparison To A Simpler One- Or Two-Sections Alternative With Predictive Spray Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic Section Control (ASC) is a long-standing trend for spraying in agriculture. It promises to minimise spray overlap areas. The core idea is to (i) switch off spray nozzles on areas that have already been sprayed, and (ii) to dynamically adjust nozzle flow rates along the boom bar that holds the spray nozzles when velocities of boom sections vary during turn maneuvers. ASC is not possible without sensors, in particular for accurate positioning data. Spraying and the movement of modern wide boom bars are highly dynamic processes. In addition, many uncertainty factors have an effect such as cross wind drift, boom height, nozzle clogging in open-field conditions, and so forth. In view of this complexity, the natural question arises if a simpler alternative exist. Therefore, an Automatic Multi-Sections Control method is compared to a proposed simpler one- or two-sections alternative that uses predictive spray switching. The comparison is provided under nominal conditions. Agricultural spraying is intrinsically linked to area coverage path planning and spray switching logic. Combinations of two area coverage path planning and switching logics as well as three sections-setups are compared. The three sections-setups differ by controlling 48 sections, 2 sections or controlling all nozzles uniformly with the same control signal as one single section. Methods are evaluated on 10 diverse real-world field examples, including non-convex field contours, freeform mainfield lanes and multiple obstacle areas. A preferred method is suggested that (i) minimises area coverage pathlength, (ii) offers intermediate overlap, (iii) is suitable for manual driving by following a pre-planned predictive spray switching logic for an area coverage path plan, and (iv) and in contrast to ASC can be implemented sensor-free and therefore at low cost.</description>

      <title>A Transferable Physics-Informed Framework for Battery Degradation Diagnosis, Knee-Onset Detection and Knee Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The techno-economic and safety concerns of battery capacity knee occurrence call for developing online knee detection and prediction methods as an advanced battery management system (BMS) function. To address this, a transferable physics-informed framework that consists of a histogram-based feature engineering method, a hybrid physics-informed model, and a fine-tuning strategy, is proposed for online battery degradation diagnosis and knee-onset detection. The hybrid model is first developed and evaluated using a scenario-aware pipeline in protocol cycling scenarios and then fine-tuned to create local models deployed in a dynamic cycling scenario. A 2D histogram-based 17-feature set is found to be the best choice in both source and target scenarios. The fine-tuning strategy is proven to be effective in improving battery degradation mode estimation and degradation phase detection performance in the target scenario. Again, a strong linear correlation was found between the identified knee-onset and knee points. As a result, advanced BMS functions, such as online degradation diagnosis and prognosis, online knee-onset detection and knee prediction, aging-aware battery classification, and second-life repurposing, can be enabled through a battery performance digital twin in the cloud.</description>

      <title>Propeller Motion of a Devil-Stick using Normal Forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of realizing rotary propeller motion of a devil-stick in the vertical plane using forces purely normal to the stick is considered. This problem represents a nonprehensile manipulation task of an underactuated system. In contrast with previous approaches, the devil-stick is manipulated by controlling the normal force and its point of application. Virtual holonomic constraints are used to design the trajectory of the center-of-mass of the devil-stick in terms of its orientation angle, and conditions for stable propeller motion are derived. Intermittent large-amplitude forces are used to asymptotically stabilize a desired propeller motion. Simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the approach in realizing stable propeller motion without loss of contact between the actuator and devil-stick.</description>

      <title>Decentralized State Estimation and Opacity Verification Based on Partially Ordered Observation Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10367v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate state estimation and opacity verification problems within a decentralized observation architecture. Specifically, we consider a discrete event system whose behavior is recorded by a set of observation sites. These sites transmit the partially ordered sequences of observations that they record to a coordinator whenever a synchronization occurs. To properly analyze the system behavior from the coordinator's viewpoint, we first introduce the notion of a Complete Synchronizing Sequence structure (CSS structure), which concisely captures the state evolution of each system state upon different information provided by the observation sites. Based on the CSS structure, we then construct corresponding current-state and initial-state estimators for offline state estimation at the coordinator. When used to verify state-isolation properties under this decentralized architecture, the use of CSS structure demonstrates a significant reduction in complexity compared with existing approaches in the literature. In particular, we discuss how to verify initial-state opacity at the coordinator, as well as a novel opacity notion, namely current-state-at-synchronization opacity.</description>

      <title>Multi-Class Stackelberg Games for the Co-Design of Networked Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03468v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a co-design problem, encompassing simultaneous design of system infrastructure and control, through a game-theoretical framework. To this end, we propose the co-design problem as a two-layer hierarchical strategic interaction. At the upper layer, a leader (or multiple leaders) determines system design parameters, while at the lower layer, a follower (or multiple followers) optimizes the control strategy. To capture this hierarchy, we propose four novel classes of Stackelberg games that integrate diverse strategic behaviors, including combinations of cooperative and non-cooperative interactions across two different layers. Notably, the leaders' interactions are represented using a normal-form game, whereas the followers' interactions are modeled by different games (dynamic games in discrete time). These distinct game structures result in a Stackelberg game that accommodates different game types per layer, and/or supports heterogeneous strategic behaviors involving cooperation and non-cooperation simultaneously. Learning algorithms using the best-response dynamics are used to solve the game problems when considering a discrete strategic space for the leaders. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated through an application to the co-design of the Barcelona drinking water network.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Value of Seismic Structural Health Monitoring for post-earthquake recovery of electric power system in terms of resilience enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Post-earthquake recovery of electric power networks (EPNs) is critical to community resilience. Traditional recovery processes often rely on prolonged and imprecise manual inspections for damage diagnosis, leading to suboptimal repair prioritization and extended service disruptions. Seismic Structural Health Monitoring (SSHM) offers the potential to expedite recovery by enabling more accurate and timely damage assessment. However, SSHM deployment incurs costs, and its system-level resilience benefit remains underexplored. This study proposes a probabilistic simulation framework to quantify the value of SSHM for enhancing EPN resilience. The framework includes seismic damage modeling based on network configuration, hazard intensity, fragility functions, and damage-functionality mappings, combined with recovery simulations incorporating resource constraints, repair and transfer durations. System functionality is evaluated using graph-based island detection and optimal power flow analysis. Resilience is quantified via the Lack of Resilience (LoR) metric derived from the functionality restoration curve. SSHM is incorporated by altering the quality of damage information used in repair scheduling. Different monitoring scenarios (e.g., no-SSHM baseline, partial SSHM, full SSHM with various accuracies) are modeled using confusion matrices to simulate damage misclassification. Results show that improved damage awareness via SSHM significantly accelerates recovery and reduces LoR by up to 21%. This work supports evidence-based decisions for SSHM deployment in critical infrastructure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09479v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses information design in a workhorse model of network games, where agents have linear best responses, the information designer maximizes a quadratic objective, and the payoff-relevant state follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution. We formulate the problem as a semidefinite program and establish strong duality to characterize the optimal information structure. A necessary and sufficient condition for optimality is given by a simple linear relationship between the induced equilibrium strategy profile and the state. Leveraging this characterization, we show that the state is fully revealed in an aggregative form for welfare maximization, while individual agents may remain only partially informed. When agent roles are interchangeable, the optimal information structure inherits the same degree of symmetry, which facilitates computation. In such cases, we show that the optimal amount of information revealed to each agent is closely linked to the network's chromatic number.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02957v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents can solve diverse tasks but often exhibit unsafe behavior. Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) address this by enforcing safety constraints, yet existing methods either sacrifice reward maximization or allow unsafe training. We introduce Constrained Trust Region Policy Optimization (C-TRPO), which reshapes the policy space geometry to ensure trust regions contain only safe policies, guaranteeing constraint satisfaction throughout training. We analyze its theoretical properties and connections to TRPO, Natural Policy Gradient (NPG), and Constrained Policy Optimization (CPO). Experiments show that C-TRPO reduces constraint violations while maintaining competitive returns.</description>

      <title>MARS-FTCP: Robust Fault-Tolerant Control and Agile Trajectory Planning for Modular Aerial Robot Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modular Aerial Robot Systems (MARS) consist of multiple drone units that can self-reconfigure to adapt to various mission requirements and fault conditions. However, existing fault-tolerant control methods exhibit significant oscillations during docking and separation, impacting system stability. To address this issue, we propose a novel fault-tolerant control reallocation method that adapts to an arbitrary number of modular robots and their assembly formations. The algorithm redistributes the expected collective force and torque required for MARS to individual units according to their moment arm relative to the center of MARS mass. Furthermore, we propose an agile trajectory planning method for MARS of arbitrary configurations, which is collision-avoiding and dynamically feasible. Our work represents the first comprehensive approach to enable fault-tolerant and collision avoidance flight for MARS. We validate our method through extensive simulations, demonstrating improved fault tolerance, enhanced trajectory tracking accuracy, and greater robustness in cluttered environments.

      <title>Safe Multi-Robotic Arm Interaction via 3D Convex Shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inter-robot collisions pose a significant safety risk when multiple robotic arms operate in close proximity. We present an online collision avoidance methodology leveraging 3D convex shape-based High-Order Control Barrier Functions (HOCBFs) to address this issue. While prior works focused on using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) for human-robotic arm and single-arm collision avoidance, we explore the problem of collision avoidance between multiple robotic arms operating in a shared space. In our methodology, we utilize the proposed HOCBFs as centralized and decentralized safety filters. These safety filters are compatible with many nominal controllers and ensure safety without significantly restricting the robots' workspace. A key challenge in implementing these filters is the computational overhead caused by the large number of safety constraints and the computation of a Hessian matrix per constraint. We address this challenge by employing numerical differentiation methods to approximate computationally intensive terms. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through extensive simulation studies and real-world experiments with Franka Research 3 robotic arms. The project video is available at this link.</description>

      <title>Transferable Parasitic Estimation via Graph Contrastive Learning and Label Rebalancing in AMS Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06535v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph representation learning on Analog-Mixed Signal (AMS) circuits is crucial for various downstream tasks, e.g., parasitic estimation. However, the scarcity of design data, the unbalanced distribution of labels, and the inherent diversity of circuit implementations pose significant challenges to learning robust and transferable circuit representations. To address these limitations, we propose CircuitGCL, a novel graph contrastive learning framework that integrates representation scattering and label rebalancing to enhance transferability across heterogeneous circuit graphs. CircuitGCL employs a self-supervised strategy to learn topology-invariant node embeddings through hyperspherical representation scattering, eliminating dependency on large-scale data. Simultaneously, balanced mean squared error (BMSE) and balanced softmax cross-entropy (BSCE) losses are introduced to mitigate label distribution disparities between circuits, enabling robust and transferable parasitic estimation. Evaluated on parasitic capacitance estimation (edge-level task) and ground capacitance classification (node-level task) across TSMC 28nm AMS designs, CircuitGCL outperforms all state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, with the $R^2$ improvement of $33.64\% \sim 44.20\%$ for edge regression and F1-score gain of $0.9\times \sim 2.1\times$ for node classification. Our code is available at https://github.com/ShenShan123/CircuitGCL.</description>

      <title>Random Walk Learning and the Pac-Man Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random walk (RW)-based algorithms have long been popular in distributed systems due to low overheads and scalability, with recent growing applications in decentralized learning. However, their reliance on local interactions makes them inherently vulnerable to malicious behavior. In this work, we investigate an adversarial threat that we term the ``Pac-Man'' attack, in which a malicious node probabilistically terminates any RW that visits it. This stealthy behavior gradually eliminates active RWs from the network, effectively halting the learning process without triggering failure alarms. To counter this threat, we propose the Average Crossing (AC) algorithm--a fully decentralized mechanism for duplicating RWs to prevent RW extinction in the presence of Pac-Man. Our theoretical analysis establishes that (i) the RW population remains almost surely bounded under AC and (ii) RW-based stochastic gradient descent remains convergent under AC, even in the presence of Pac-Man, with a quantifiable deviation from the true optimum. Our extensive empirical results on both synthetic and real-world datasets corroborate our theoretical findings. Furthermore, they uncover a phase transition in the extinction probability as a function of the duplication threshold. We offer theoretical insights by analyzing a simplified variant of the AC, which sheds light on the observed phase transition.</description>
