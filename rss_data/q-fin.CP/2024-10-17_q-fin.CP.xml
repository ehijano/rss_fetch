      <title>Quantum Computing for Multi Period Asset Allocation</title>

Abstract: Portfolio construction has been a long-standing topic of research in finance. The computational complexity and the time taken both increase rapidly with the number of investments in the portfolio. It becomes difficult, even impossible for classic computers to solve. Quantum computing is a new way of computing which takes advantage of quantum superposition and entanglement. It changes how such problems are approached and is not constrained by some of the classic computational complexity. Studies have shown that quantum computing can offer significant advantages over classical computing in many fields. The application of quantum computing has been constrained by the unavailability of actual quantum computers. In the past decade, there has been the rapid development of the large-scale quantum computer. However, software development for quantum computing is slow in many fields. In our study, we apply quantum computing to a multi-asset portfolio simulation. The simulation is based on historic data, covariance, and expected returns, all calculated using quantum computing. Although technically a solvable problem for classical computing, we believe the software development is important to the future application of quantum computing in finance. We conducted this study through simulation of a quantum computer and the use of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's IBM quantum computer.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of American option pricing in a two-asset jump-diffusion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04745</link>

Abstract: This paper addresses a significant gap in rigorous numerical treatments for pricing American options under correlated two-asset jump-diffusion models using the viscosity solution approach, with a particular focus on the Merton model. The pricing of these options is governed by complex two-dimensional (2-D) variational inequalities that incorporate cross-derivative terms and nonlocal integro-differential terms due to the presence of jumps. Existing numerical methods, primarily based on finite differences, often struggle with preserving monotonicity in the approximation of cross-derivatives-a key requirement for ensuring convergence to the viscosity solution. In addition, these methods face challenges in accurately discretizing 2-D jump integrals.
  We introduce a novel approach to effectively tackle the aforementioned variational inequalities, seamlessly managing cross-derivative terms and nonlocal integro-differential terms through an efficient and straightforward-to-implement monotone integration scheme. Within each timestep, our approach explicitly tackles the variational inequality constraint, resulting in a 2-D Partial Integro-Differential Equation (PIDE) to solve. Its solution is then expressed as a 2-D convolution integral involving the Green's function of the PIDE. We derive an infinite series representation of this Green's function, where each term is strictly positive and computable. This series facilitates the numerical approximation of the PIDE solution through a monotone integration method, such as the composite quadrature rule.
  The proposed method is demonstrated to be both $\ell_{\infty} $-stable and consistent in the viscosity sense, ensuring its convergence to the viscosity solution of the variational inequality. Extensive numerical results validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, highlighting its practical applicability and theoretical soundness.</description>
