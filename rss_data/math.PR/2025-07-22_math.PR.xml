      <title>Sharp Square Root Bounds for Edge Eigenvector Universality in Sparse Random Regular Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how eigenvectors of random regular graphs behave when projected onto fixed directions. For a random $d$-regular graph with $N$ vertices, where the degree $d$ grows slowly with $N$, we prove that these projections follow approximately normal distributions. Our main result establishes a Berry-Esseen bound showing convergence to the Gaussian with error $O(\sqrt{d} \cdot N^{-1/6+\varepsilon})$ for degrees $d \leq N^{1/4}$. This bound significantly improves upon previous results that had error terms scaling as $d^3$, and we prove our $\sqrt{d}$ scaling is optimal by establishing a matching lower bound. Our proof combines three techniques: (1) refined concentration inequalities that exploit the specific variance structure of regular graphs, (2) a vector-based analysis of the resolvent that avoids iterative procedures, and (3) a framework combining Stein's method with graph-theoretic tools to control higher-order fluctuations. These results provide sharp constants for eigenvector universality in the transition from sparse to moderately dense graphs.</description>

      <title>Neural Brownian Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Neural-Brownian Motion (NBM), a new class of stochastic processes for modeling dynamics under learned uncertainty. The NBM is defined axiomatically by replacing the classical martingale property with respect to linear expectation with one relative to a non-linear Neural Expectation Operator, $\varepsilon^\theta$, generated by a Backward Stochastic Differential Equation (BSDE) whose driver $f_\theta$ is parameterized by a neural network. Our main result is a representation theorem for a canonical NBM, which we define as a continuous $\varepsilon^\theta$-martingale with zero drift under the physical measure. We prove that, under a key structural assumption on the driver, such a canonical NBM exists and is the unique strong solution to a stochastic differential equation of the form ${\rm d} M_t = \nu_\theta(t, M_t) {\rm d} W_t$. Crucially, the volatility function $\nu_\theta$ is not postulated a priori but is implicitly defined by the algebraic constraint $g_\theta(t, M_t, \nu_\theta(t, M_t)) = 0$, where $g_\theta$ is a specialization of the BSDE driver. We develop the stochastic calculus for this process and prove a Girsanov-type theorem for the quadratic case, showing that an NBM acquires a drift under a new, learned measure. The character of this measure, whether pessimistic or optimistic, is endogenously determined by the learned parameters $\theta$, providing a rigorous foundation for models where the attitude towards uncertainty is a discoverable feature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14546v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first establish the existence and uniqueness of strong solutions for multivalued McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (MMVSDEs) driven by Levy noise with non-Lipschitz coefficients. It is important to note that these findings are based upon the well-posedness of strong solutions for MMVSDEs under Lipschitz conditions, which will be stated briefly. Secondly, we study the existence of weak solutions under linear growth condition. Finally, we prove the existence of martingale solutions.</description>

      <title>Elephant random walks with multiple extractions and general reinforcement functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a generalized model of elephant random walks wherein the walker, during the $(n+1)$-st time-stamp, draws from the past (i.e. the set $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$) a sample of $k$ time-stamps, either with replacement or without, where $k$ may either remain fixed as $n$ grows, or $k=k(n)$ may grow with $n$. Letting $\{U_{n,1}, U_{n,2}, \ldots, U_{n,k}\}$ denote the time-stamps sampled, the step taken by the walker during the $(n+1)$-st time-stamp, denoted $X_{n+1}$, is a $\pm 1$-valued random variable whose distribution depends on the proportion of $(+1)$-valued steps out of $X_{U_{n,1}},X_{U_{n,2}},\ldots,X_{U_{n,k}}$ via a reinforcement function $f$. In this paper, we investigate the asymptotic behaviour, i.e. strong and weak convergence, of this random walk model under suitable assumptions made on the function $f$ (as well as on the sequence $\{k(n)\}$ when the sample size varies with $n$).</description>

      <title>On the critical parameters of branching random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a discrete spatial structure $X$, we define continuous-time branching processes that model a population breeding and dying on $X$. These processes are usually called branching random walks. They are characterized by breeding rates $k_{xy}$ between sites (ruling the speed at which individuals at $x$ send children to $y$) and by the multiplicative speed parameter $\lambda$. Two critical parameters of interest are the global critical parameter $\lambda_w$, related to global survival, and the local critical parameter $\lambda_s$, related to survival in finite sets (with $\lambda_w\le\lambda_s)$. Local modifications of the rates of the process can affect the value of both parameters. Using results on the comparison of the probability of extinction of a single branching random walk on different sets, we are able to extend the comparison to extinction probabilities and critical parameters of couples of branching random walks, whose rates coincide outside a fixed set $A\subseteq X$. We say that two branching random walks are equivalent if their rates coincide everywhere but for a finite subset of $X$. Given an equivalence class of branching random walks, we prove that if one process has $\lambda^*_w\neq\lambda^*_s$, then $\lambda_w^*$ is the maximal possible value of this parameter in the class. We describe the possible situations for the critical parameters in these equivalence classes.</description>

      <title>Entropies of Cox-Ingersoll-Ross and Bessel processes as functions of time and of related parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the long-time asymptotic behavior of various entropy measures associated with the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) and squared Bessel processes. As the one-dimensional distributions of both processes follow noncentral chi-squared laws, we first derive sufficient conditions for the existence of these entropy measures for a noncentral chi-squared random variable. We then analyze their limiting behavior as the noncentrality parameter approaches zero and apply these results to the CIR and squared Bessel processes. We prove that, as time tends to infinity, the entropies of the CIR process converge to those of its stationary distribution, while for the squared Bessel process, the Shannon, R\'enyi, and generalized R\'enyi entropies diverge, however, the Tsallis and Sharma-Mittal entropies may diverge or remain finite depending on the entropy parameters. Finally, we demonstrate that, as the CIR process converges to the squared Bessel process, the corresponding entropies also converge.</description>

      <title>Particle detection among Random Walks as a non-reversible Random Interlacements Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the random set composed of particles initially distributed on Zd, d &gt;= 2, according to a Poisson point process of intensity u &gt; 0 and moving as independent simple symmetric random walks, the trap particles. We are interested in the detection by these particles of a target particle, initially at the origin and able to move with finite mean speed. The escape strategy for the target particle is to stay inside the infinite cluster of empty sites, assuming u is in the subcritical site percolation regime of particle occupation. By translating the problem to the framework of percolation of Random Interlacements we also prove that for u large enough the target doesn't escape. In doing this we extend the random interlacements formalism in order to allow non reversible random walks. As far a we know this is the first example of Random Interlacements for non-reversible Markov chains.</description>

      <title>Affine AP-frames and Stationary Random Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that, in general, an affine or Gabor AP-frame is an $L^2(\mathbb{R})$-frame and conversely. In part as a consequence of the Ergodic Theorem, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition for an affine (wavelet) system $\mathcal{A}=\{a^{j/2} \psi_{j,k}(t):=a^{-j/2} \psi (a^{-j} t -k) :j\in\mathbb{Z}, k\in\mathbb{K}:=b\mathbb{Z}\}$ to be an affine AP-Frame in terms of Gaussian stationary random processes expanding in this way what we have done recently for Gabor systems. Likewise, we study a connection between the decay of the associated stationary sequences $\{\langle{X,\psi_{j,k}}\rangle : k\in\mathbb{K}\}$ for each $j\in\mathbb{Z}$, and a smoothness condition on a Gaussian stationary random process $X=(X(t))_{t\in\mathbb{R}}$.</description>

      <title>On Algorithmic Robustness of Corrupted Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the algorithmic robustness of general finite Markov chains in terms of their stationary distributions to general, adversarial corruptions of the transition matrix. We show that for Markov chains admitting a spectral gap, variants of the \emph{PageRank} chain are robust in the sense that, given an \emph{arbitrary} corruption of the edges emanating from an $\epsilon$-measure of the nodes, the PageRank distribution of the corrupted chain will be $\mathsf{poly}(\varepsilon)$ close in total variation to the original distribution under mild conditions on the restart distribution. Our work thus shows that PageRank serves as a simple regularizer against broad, realistic corruptions with algorithmic guarantees that are dimension-free and scale gracefully in terms of necessary and natural parameters.</description>

      <title>Functional Laplace Transform of a Multivariate Hawkes Process, Subsequent Characteristics, and Numerical Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous studies grounded on Hawkes processes have been carried out in many fields including finance, biology and social network. Hawkes processes form a class of selfexciting simple point processes. In this article, we consider a general class of multivariate Hawkes processes envisioned to model dynamics of spatio-temporal epidemics. For this class, the igniting baseline intensity is time dependent and the exciting matrix function is a general one, making the model non-Markovian in most of the cases. In this article, we first provide the closed-form expression of the multivariate multi-temporal characteristic function of these Hawkes processes, extending in a natural way the classical single-time formula found in the Hawkes literature. Then, we use the infinitely divisible property of the Hawkes process to derive the equation system related to the probability distribution of counts at each single time, adapted to the general formulation of the Hawkes model considered in this article. Next, we provide closed-form formulas for the temporal structure of the two first moments of the process, which allows us to deduce an original expression of the multivariate covariance function at two distinct times, thereby extending existing results established for more restricted classes of Hawkes processes. Based on this expression, we analytically decompose the covariance at two distinct times into singular and continuous parts. We finish with brief numerical elements: We present a simple scheme for numerical approximations of the Laplace transform and the first two moments, and give examples of solutions of the different related integral equations. We also provides illustrative simulations of the multivariate Hawkes process for different model specifications.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Expansion of passage probability for finite-range random walk on Free Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite-range random walk on a finitely generated free group , what is the asymptotic behaviour, as the number of steps goes to infinity, of the sequence of probabilities that the random walk is at a given element of the group? In this article, we answer this question by providing an asymptotic expansion to any order for the sequence of probabilities that an irreducible finite-range random walk on an infinite tree with bounded valence is at a given vertex (See the Theorem 6.10). We will work under the assumption that each vertex of the tree has valence greater than or equal to three, and we will assume that the tree is endowed with a cofinite action of an automorphism group preserving the step distribution. The answer to the above question will appear as an immediate Corollary of the previously mentioned Theorem. This article is part of a triptych with [Che25a] and [Che25c]. It relies on Tauberian results from [Che25a], used throughout the text to derive asymptotic expansions. The careful study of the objects introduced in this text is done in [Che25c]</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $n\in\mathbb{N}$, let $\{X^n_i\}$ be an infinite collection of Brownian particles on the real line where the leftmost particle $\min_iX^n_i(t)$ is given a drift $n$, and let $\mu^n_t=n^{-1}\sum_i\delta_{X^n_i(t)}$, $t\ge0$ denote the normalized configuration measure. The case where the initial particle positions follow a Poisson point process on $[0,\infty)$ of intensity $n\lambda$, $\lambda&gt;0$ was studied where it was shown that $\mu^n_t$ converge, as $n\to\infty$, to a limit characterized by a Stefan problem of melting solid (respectively, freezing supercooled liquid) type when $\lambda\ge 2$ (respectively, $0&lt;\lambda&lt;2$). In this paper it is assumed that $\mu^n_0\to\mu_0$ in probability, where $\mu_0$ is supported on $[0,\infty)$ and satisfies a polynomial growth condition. Because $(y-x)^{-1}\mu_0((x,y])$, $0&lt;x&lt;y$ need not be bounded below or above by $2$, the model does not give rise to a Stefan problem of either of the above types. Under mild assumptions, it is shown that $\mu^n_t$ converge to a limit characterized by a free boundary problem involving measures. Under the additional assumption that $\mu_0(dx)\ge\lambda_0\,{\rm leb}_{[0,\infty)}(dx)$ for some $\lambda_0&gt;0$, the free boundary exists as a continuous trajectory, and the process determined by the leftmost particle converges to it.</description>

      <title>Thin-shell bounds via parallel coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for any log-concave random vector $X$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with mean zero and identity covariance, $$ \mathbb{E} (|X| - \sqrt{n})^2 \leq C $$ where $C &gt; 0$ is a universal constant. Thus, most of the mass of the random vector $X$ is concentrated in a thin spherical shell, whose width is only $C / \sqrt{n}$ times its radius. This confirms the thin-shell conjecture in high dimensional convex geometry. Our method relies on the construction of a certain coupling between log-affine perturbations of the law of $X$ related to Eldan's stochastic localization and to the theory of non-linear filtering. A crucial ingredient is a recent breakthrough technique by Guan that was previously used in our proof of Bourgain's slicing conjecture, which is known to be implied by the thin-shell conjecture.</description>

      <title>Tightness of approximations to metrics on non-simple conformal loop ensemble gaskets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of approximation schemes aimed at constructing conformally covariant metrics defined in the gasket of a conformal loop ensemble (CLE$_\kappa$) for $\kappa \in (4,8)$. This is the range of parameter values so that the loops of a CLE$_\kappa$ intersect themselves, each other, and the domain boundary. Its gasket is the closure of the union of the set of points not surrounded by a loop. The class of approximation schemes includes approximations to the geodesic metric and to the resistance metric. We show that the laws of these approximations are tight, and that every subsequential limit is a non-trivial metric on the CLE$_\kappa$ gasket satisfying a natural list of properties. Subsequent work of the second two authors will show that the limits exist and are conformally covariant both in the setting of the geodesic and resistance metrics. We conjecture that the geodesic (resp. resistance) metric describes the scaling limit of the chemical distance (resp. resistance) metric associated with discrete models that converge in the limit to CLE$_\kappa$ for $\kappa \in (4,8)$ (e.g., critical percolation for $\kappa=6$).</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inversion via Probabilistic Cellular Automata: an application to image denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose using Probabilistic Cellular Automata (PCA) to address inverse problems with the Bayesian approach. In particular, we use PCA to sample from an approximation of the posterior distribution. The peculiar feature of PCA is their intrinsic parallel nature, which allows for a straightforward parallel implementation that allows the exploitation of parallel computing architecture in a natural and efficient manner. We compare the performance of the PCA method with the standard Gibbs sampler on an image denoising task in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity (SSIM). The numerical results obtained with this approach suggest that PCA-based algorithms are a promising alternative for Bayesian inference in high-dimensional inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Optimality in Data-driven Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given data generated by an abstract stochastic process, we study how to construct statistically optimal decisions for general stochastic optimization problems. Our setting encompasses non-standard data structures, including data originating from heterogeneous sources or from processes with randomly evolving data-generating mechanisms. We propose a decision-making approach that identifies optimal decisions for which a specific notion of shifted regret risk, evaluated with respect to the underlying stochastic process, decays to zero at a prescribed exponential rate under a minimal model perturbation. This optimal decision arises as the solution to a multi-objective optimization problem, where the trade-offs are governed by the statistical properties of the data-generating process. Central to our framework is a rate function, generalizing the classical concept from large deviation theory. Our general formulation recovers classical results in decision-making under uncertainty, such as those from distributionally robust optimization, as special cases. However, it goes beyond them: it enables decision-makers to systematically balance a desired rate of asymptotic risk decay against a potential loss in statistical consistency of the resulting data-driven decision. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through two illustrative examples from operations research: the classical newsvendor problem and a portfolio optimization problem under aleatoric uncertainty induced by heterogeneous data sources.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue distribution of some random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the eigenvalue distribution of a class of kernel random matrices whose $(i,j)$-th entry is $f(X_i,X_j)$ where $f$ is a symmetric function belonging to the Paley-Wiener space $\mathcal{B}_c$ and $(X_i)_{1\leq i \leq N}$ are i.i.d. random variables.
  We rigorously prove that, with high probability, the eigenvalues of these random matrices are well approximated by those of an underlying estimator.
  A particularly notable case is when $f=sinc$ , which has been widely studied due to its relevance in various scientific fields, including machine learning and telecommunications.
  In this case, we push forward the general approach by computing the eigenvalues of the estimator. More precisely, we have proved that the eigenvalues are concentrated around zero and one. In particular, we address the case of large values of $c$ with respect to the matrix size $N$, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been studied in the literature. Furthermore, we establish that the frequency of eigenvalues close to one is proportional to $c$. Numerical results are provided in order to illustrate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a probability measure on a finitely generated group, the local limit problem consists in finding asymptotics of $p_n(e,e)$, the probability that the random walk at time $n$ is at the origin. We give the classification of all possible local limit theorems, up to bounded error, for finitely supported, symmetric, admissible probability measures on a relatively hyperbolic group with respect to virtually nilpotent subgroups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the distribution of a two-dimensional (complex) random walk in which the angle of each step is restricted to a subset of the circle. This setting appears in various domains, such as in over-the-air computation in signal processing. In particular, we derive the exact joint and marginal distributions for two steps, numerical solutions for a general number of steps, and approximations for a large number of steps. Furthermore, we provide an exact characterization of the support for an arbitrary number of steps. The results in this work provide a reference for future work involving such problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin glasses are fundamental probability distributions at the core of statistical physics, the theory of average-case computational complexity, and modern high-dimensional statistical inference. In the mean-field setting, we design deterministic quasipolynomial-time algorithms for estimating the partition function to arbitrarily high accuracy for nearly all inverse temperatures in the second moment regime. In particular, for the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model, our algorithms succeed for almost the entire replica-symmetric phase. To achieve this, we study the locations of the zeros of the partition function. Notably, our methods are conceptually simple, and apply equally well to the spherical case and the case of Ising spins.</description>

      <title>Assessing continuous common-shock risk through matrix distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of continuous-time bivariate phase-type distributions for modeling dependencies from common shocks. The construction uses continuous-time Markov processes that evolve identically until an internal common-shock event, after which they diverge into independent processes. We derive and analyze key risk measures for this new class, including joint cumulative distribution functions, dependence measures, and conditional risk measures. Theoretical results establish analytically tractable properties of the model. For parameter estimation, we employ efficient gradient-based methods. Applications to both simulated and real-world data illustrate the ability to capture common-shock dependencies effectively. Our analysis also demonstrates that CSPH distributions may capture dependencies that extend beyond those explicitly triggered by common shocks.</description>

      <title>Using stochastic thermodynamics with internal variables to capture orientational spreading in cell populations undergoing cyclic stretch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the modeling framework introduced in [N. Loy and L. Preziosi: Bull. Math. Bio., 85, 2023] to describe the dynamics of cell orientation under cyclic stretch. We propose a reformulation based on the principles of Stochastic Thermodynamics with Internal Variables introduced in [T. Leadbetter, P. Purohit, and C. Reina: PNAS Nexus, 2, 2023]. This approach allows us to describe not only the evolution of the orientation distribution, but also the observed spreading phenomenon. The insight provided by our model reveals an interesting phenomenon, which we call two-stage reorientation: when cells begin aligned with an energy maximum, their orientations spread before concentrating at the energy minimum. This theoretical prediction suggests a new experiment to test this modeling framework.</description>

Abstract: We study the long-range one-dimensional Riesz gas on the circle, a continuous system of particles interacting through a Riesz kernel. We establish near-optimal rigidity estimates on gaps valid at any scale. Leveraging these local laws together with Stein's method, we prove a quantitative Central Limit Theorem for linear statistics. The proof is based on a mean-field transport and a fine analysis of the fluctuations of local error terms using various convexity and monotonicity arguments. Using a comparison principle for the Helffer-Sj\"ostrand equation, the method can handle very singular test functions, including characteristic functions of intervals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.05791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the large deviations associated with the empirical mean of independent and identically distributed random variables under a subexponential moment condition. We show that non-trivial deviations are observable at a subexponential scale in the number of variables, and we provide the associated rate function, which is non-convex and is not derived from a Legendre-Fenchel transform. The proof adapts the one of Cramer's theorem to the case where the fluctuation is generated by a single variable. In particular, we develop a new tilting strategy for the lower bound, which leads us to introduce a condition on the second derivative of the moment generating function. Our results are illustrated by a couple of simple examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08289v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We regard options on VIX and Realised Variance as solutions to path-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) in a continuous stochastic volatility model. The modeling assumption specifies that the instantaneous variance is a $C^3$ function of a multidimensional Gaussian Volterra process; this includes a large class of models suggested for the purpose of VIX option pricing, either rough, or not, or mixed. We unveil the path-dependence of those volatility derivatives and, under a regularity hypothesis on the payoff function, we prove the well-posedness of the associated PDE. The latter is of heat type, because of the Gaussian assumption, and the terminal condition is also path-dependent. Furthermore, formulae for the greeks are provided, the implied volatility is shown to satisfy a quasi-linear path-dependent PDE and, in Markovian models, finite-dimensional pricing PDEs are obtained for VIX options.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the analytic continuation of Liouville eigenstates and shows that they assemble into irreducible highest-weight representations of the Virasoro algebra, for all values of the conformal weights. This builds on previous results from the first author and Guillarmou, Kupiainen, Rhodes &amp; Vargas, where such representations were constructed except for the conformal weight on the Kac table. In order to extend these results to the degenerate weights, we find explicit analytic expressions for the Virasoro descendants and uncover the probabilistic meaning of the Kac table.
  In the algebraic approach to conformal field theory, the irreducibility is a crucial property that must be satisfied by the representations in the spectrum, and is usually taken as an axiom. Computationally, it leads to the celebrated null-vector (or BPZ) equations for correlation functions and conformal blocks, which are the cornerstone of the integrability of the theory.</description>

Abstract: Let $B=(B_t)_{t\geq 0}$ be a standard Brownian motion. The main objective is to find a uniform (in time) control of the modulus of continuity of $B$ in the spirit of what appears in (Kurtz, 1978). More precisely, it involves the control of the exponential moments of the random variable $\sup_{0\leq s\leq t} |B_t-B_s|/w(t,|t-s|)$ for a suitable function $w$. A stability inequality for diffusion processes is then derived and applied to two simple frameworks.</description>

Abstract: We study large deviations for the time average of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process raised to an arbitrary power. We prove that beyond a critical value, large deviations are subexponential in time, with a non-convex rate function whose main coefficient is given by the solution to a Hamilton-Jacobi problem. Although a similar problem was addressed in a recent work, the originality of the paper is to provide a short, self-contained proof of this result through a couple of standard large deviations arguments.</description>

      <title>Comparison Theorems for the Mixing Times of Systematic and Random Scan Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A popular method for sampling from high-dimensional distributions is the \emph{Gibbs sampler}, which iteratively resamples sites from the conditional distribution of the desired measure given the values of the other coordinates. It is natural to ask to what extent does the order of site updates matter in the mixing time? Two natural choices are (i) standard, or \emph{random scan}, Glauber dynamics where the updated variable is chosen uniformly at random, and (ii) the \emph{systematic scan} dynamics where variables are updated in a fixed, cyclic order. We first show that for systems of dimension $n$, one round of the systematic scan dynamics has spectral gap at most a factor of order $n$ worse than the corresponding spectral gap of a single step of Glauber dynamics, tightening existing bounds in the literature by He, et al. [NeurIPS '16] and Chlebicka, {\L}atuszy\'nski, and Miasodejow [Ann. Appl. Probab. '25]. The corresponding bound on mixing times is sharp even for simple spin systems by an explicit example of Roberts and Rosenthal [Int. J. Statist. Prob. '15]. We complement this with a converse statement: if all, or even just one scan order rapidly mixes, the Glauber dynamics has a polynomially related mixing time, resolving a question of Chlebicka, {\L}atuszy\'nski, and Miasodejow.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics in Wasserstein Distance for Empirical Measures of Markov Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce some recent progresses on the convergence rate in Wasserstein distance for empirical measures of Markov processes. For diffusion processes on compact manifolds possibly with reflecting or killing boundary conditions, the sharp convergence rate as well as renormalization limits are presented in terms of the dimension of the manifold and the spectrum of the generator. For general ergodic Markov processes, explicit estimates are presented for the convergence rate by using a nice reference diffusion process, which are illustrated by some typical examples. Finally, some techniques are introduced to estimate the Wasserstein distance of empirical measures.</description>

      <title>Metastability in the stochastic nearest-neighbor Kuramoto model of coupled phase oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kuramoto model (KM) of $n$ coupled phase-oscillators is analyzed in this work. The KM on a Cayley graph possesses a family of steady state solutions called twisted states. Topologically distinct twisted states are distinguished by the winding number $q\in\mathbb{Z}$. These states are known to be stable for small enough $q$. In the presence of small noise, the KM exhibits metastable transitions between $q$-twisted states: A typical trajectory remains in the basin of attraction of a given $q$-twisted state for an exponentially long time, but eventually transitions to the vicinity of another such state. In the course of this transition, it passes in close proximity of a saddle of Morse index $1$, called a relevant saddle. In this work, we provide an exhaustive analysis of metastable transitions in the stochastic KM with nearest-neighbor coupling. We start by analyzing the equilibria and their stability. First, we identify all equilibria in this model. Using the discrete Fourier transform and eigenvalue estimates for rank-1 perturbations of symmetric matrices, we classify the equilibria by their Morse indices. In particular, we identify all stable equilibria and all relevant saddles involved in the metastable transitions. Further, we use Freidlin-Wentzell theory and the potential-theoretic approach to metastability to establish the metastable hierarchy and sharp estimates of Eyring-Kramers type for the transition times. The former determines the precise order, in which the metastable transitions occur, while the latter characterizes the times between successive transitions. The theoretical estimates are complemented by numerical simulations and a careful numerical verification of the transition times. Finally, we discuss the implications of this work for the KM with other coupling types including nonlocal coupling and the continuum limit as $n$ tends to infinity.</description>

Abstract: In a recent paper, Aldous, Blanc and Curien asked which distributions can be expressed as the distance between two independent random variables on some separable measured metric space. We show that every nonnegative discrete distribution whose support contains $0$ arises in this way, as well as a class of finitely supported distributions with density.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define multichordal CLE$_\kappa$ for $\kappa \in (4,8)$ as the conditional law of the remainder of a partially explored CLE$_\kappa$. The strands of a multichordal CLE$_\kappa$ have a random link pattern, and their law conditionally on the linking pattern is a (global) multichordal SLE$_\kappa$. The multichordal CLE$_\kappa$ are the conjectural scaling limits of FK and loop $O(n)$ models with some wiring patterns of the boundary arcs.
  We also explain how CLE$_\kappa$ configurations can be locally resampled, and show that the partially explored strands can be relinked in any possible way with positive probability. We will also establish several other estimates for partially explored CLE$_\kappa$. Altogether, these relationships and results serve to provide a toolbox for studying CLE$_\kappa$ and global multiple SLE$_\kappa$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the two-species totally asymmetric simple exclusion process on $\mathbb{Z}$ with a translation-invariant stationary measure as the initial condition. We establish the asymptotic decoupling of the marginal height profiles along characteristic lines and prove the decay of the two-point functions in the large-time limit, thus confirming predictions of the nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics theory. Our approach builds on the queueing construction of the stationary measure introduced in [Angel'06, Ferrari-Martin'07] and extends the theory of backwards paths for height functions developed in [Bufetov-Ferrari'22, Ferrari-Nejjar'24]. The arguments for asymptotic decoupling also apply to further homogeneous initial data, and the decay of the two-point functions is proven for the stationary two-species asymmetric simple exclusion process, beyond the totally asymmetric case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17363v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish sample-path large deviation principles for the centered cumulative functional of marked Poisson cluster processes in the Skorokhod space equipped with the M1 topology, under joint regular variation assumptions on the marks and the offspring distributions governing the propagation mechanism. These findings can also be interpreted as hidden regular variation of the cluster processes' functionals, extending the results in Dombry et al. (2022) to cluster processes with heavy-tailed characteristics, including mixed Binomial Poisson cluster processes and Hawkes processes. Notably, by restricting to the adequate subspace of measures on D([0, 1], R+), and applying the correct normalization and scaling to the paths of the centered cumulative functional, the limit measure concentrates on paths with multiple large jumps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic space filling (DSF) is a stochastic process defined on any connected graph. Each vertex can host an arbitrary number of particles forming a pile, with every arriving particle landing on the top of the pile. Particles in a pile, except for the particle at the bottom, can hop to neighboring vertices. Eligible particles hop independently and stochastically, with the overall hopping rate set to unity. When the number of vertices in a graph is equal to the total number of particles, the evolution stops when a single particle occupies every vertex. We determine the halting time distribution on complete graphs. Using the mapping of the DSF into a two-species annihilation process, we argue that on $ d$-dimensional tori with $N\gg 1$ vertices, the average halting time scales with the number of vertices as $N^{4/d}$ when $d\leq 4$ and as $N$ when $d&gt;4$.</description>

      <title>Central limit theory for Peaks-over-Threshold partial sums of long memory linear time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the last 30 years, extensive work has been devoted to developing central limit theory for partial sums of subordinated long memory linear time series. A much less studied problem, motivated by questions that are ubiquitous in extreme value theory, is the asymptotic behavior of such partial sums when the subordination mechanism has a threshold depending on sample size, so as to focus on the right tail of the time series. This article substantially extends longstanding asymptotic techniques by allowing the subordination mechanism to depend on the sample size in this way and to grow at a polynomial rate, while permitting the innovation process to have infinite variance. The cornerstone of our theoretical approach is a tailored $L^r(\mathbf{P})$ reduction principle, which enables the use of classical results on partial sums of long memory linear processes. In this way we obtain asymptotic theory for certain Peaks-over-Threshold estimators with deterministic or random thresholds. Applications comprise both the heavy- and light-tailed regimes -- yielding unexpected results which, to the best of our knowledge, are new to the literature. A simulation study illustrates the relevance of our findings in finite samples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we first study the large deviation principle (LDP) for non-degenerate McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (MVSDEs) with H\"{o}lder continuous drifts by using Zvonkin's transformation. When the drift only satisfies H\"{o}lder condition, the skeleton equation may have multiple solutions. Among these solutions, we find one that ensures the MVSDEs satisfy the LDP. Moreover, we introduce a new definition for the rate function that reduces to traditional rate function if the drift satisfies the Lipschitz condition. Secondly, we study the LDP for degenerate MVSDEs with H\"{o}lder continuous drifts.</description>

Abstract: We establish the scaling limit of a class of boundary random walks to Brownian-type processes on the half-line. By solving the associated martingale problem and employing weak convergence techniques, we prove that under appropriate scaling, the process converges to the general Brownian motion in the $J_1$-Skorokhod topology. The limiting process exhibits both diffusion and boundary behavior characterized by parameters $(\alpha, \beta, A, B)$, which govern the transition rates at the origin. Our results provide a discrete approximation to generalized Brownian motions with mixed boundary conditions.</description>

In particular, we manage to attain some critical thresholds allowing to revisit/address in a stable noise setting some concrete physical and biological models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05911v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Approximate message passing (AMP) has emerged both as a popular class of iterative algorithms and as a powerful analytic tool in a wide range of statistical estimation problems and statistical physics models. A well established line of AMP theory proves Gaussian approximations for the empirical distributions of the AMP iterate in the high dimensional limit, under the GOE random matrix model and its variants.
  This paper provides a non-asymptotic, leave-one-out representation for the AMP iterate that holds under a broad class of Gaussian random matrix models with general variance profiles. In contrast to the typical AMP theory that describes the empirical distributions of the AMP iterate via a low dimensional state evolution, our leave-one-out representation yields an intrinsically high dimensional state evolution formula which provides non-asymptotic characterizations for the possibly heterogeneous, entrywise behavior of the AMP iterate under the prescribed random matrix models.
  To exemplify some distinct features of our AMP theory in applications, we analyze, in the context of regularized linear estimation, the precise stochastic behavior of the Ridge estimator for independent and non-identically distributed observations whose covariates exhibit general variance profiles. We find that its finite-sample distribution is characterized via a weighted Ridge estimator in a heterogeneous Gaussian sequence model. Notably, in contrast to the i.i.d. sampling scenario, the effective noise and regularization are now full dimensional vectors determined via a high dimensional system of equations.
  Our leave-one-out method of proof differs significantly from the widely adopted conditioning approach for rotational invariant ensembles, and relies instead on an inductive method that utilizes almost solely integration-by-parts and concentration techniques.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Computing Convergence Rates of Markov Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Convergence rate analysis for general state-space Markov chains is fundamentally important in areas such as Markov chain Monte Carlo and algorithmic analysis (for computing explicit convergence bounds). This problem, however, is notoriously difficult because traditional analytical methods often do not generate practically useful convergence bounds for realistic Markov chains. We propose the Deep Contractive Drift Calculator (DCDC), the first general-purpose sample-based algorithm for bounding the convergence of Markov chains to stationarity in Wasserstein distance. The DCDC has two components. First, inspired by the new convergence analysis framework in Qu, Blanchet and Glynn (2023), we introduce the Contractive Drift Equation (CDE), the solution of which leads to an explicit convergence bound. Second, we develop an efficient neural-network-based CDE solver. Equipped with these two components, DCDC solves the CDE and converts the solution into a convergence bound. We analyze the sample complexity of the algorithm and further demonstrate the effectiveness of the DCDC by generating convergence bounds for realistic Markov chains arising from stochastic processing networks as well as constant step-size stochastic optimization.</description>

      <title>Mixed Steklov-Neumann problem: asymptotic analysis and applications to diffusion-controlled reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the mixed Steklov-Neumann spectral problem for the modified Helmholtz equation in a bounded domain when the Steklov condition is imposed on a connected subset of the smooth boundary. In order to deduce the asymptotic behavior in the limit when the size of the subset goes to zero, we reformulate the original problem in terms of an integral operator whose kernel is the restriction of a suitable Green's function (or pseudo-Green's function) to the subset. Its singular behavior on the boundary yields the asymptotic formulas for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Steklov-Neumann problem. While this analysis remains at a formal level, it is supported by extensive numerical results for two basic examples: an arc on the boundary of a disk and a spherical cap on the boundary of a ball. Solving the original Steklov-Neumann problem numerically in these domains, we validate the asymptotic formulas and reveal their high accuracy, even when the subset is not small. A straightforward application of these spectral results to first-passage processes and diffusion-controlled reactions is presented. We revisit the small-target limit of the mean first-reaction time on perfectly or partially reactive targets. The effect of multiple failed reaction attempts is quantified by a universal function for the whole range of reactivities. Moreover, we extend these results to more sophisticated surface reactions that go beyond the conventional narrow escape problem.</description>

      <title>Convergence of non-reversible Markov processes via lifting and flow Poincar{\'e} inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04238v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a general approach for quantitative convergence analysis of non-reversible Markov processes, based on the concept of second-order lifts and a variational approach to hypocoercivity. To this end, we introduce the flow Poincar{\'e} inequality, a space-time Poincar{\'e} inequality along trajectories of the semigroup, and a general divergence lemma based only on the Dirichlet form of an underlying reversible diffusion. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach by applying it to a pair of run-and-tumble particles with jamming, a model from non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, and several piecewise deterministic Markov processes used in sampling applications, in particular including general stochastic jump kernels.</description>

      <title>A two-player zero-sum probabilistic game that approximates the mean curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a new two-player zero-sum game whose value function approximates the level set formulation for the geometric evolution by mean curvature of a hypersurface. In our approach the game is played with symmetric rules for the two players and probability theory is involved (the game is not deterministic).</description>

      <title>Telegrapher's Generative Model via Kac Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We break the mold in flow-based generative modeling by proposing a new model based on the damped wave equation, also known as telegrapher's equation. Similar to the diffusion equation and Brownian motion, there is a Feynman-Kac type relation between the telegrapher's equation and the stochastic Kac process in 1D. The Kac flow evolves stepwise linearly in time, so that the probability flow is Lipschitz continuous in the Wasserstein distance and, in contrast to diffusion flows, the norm of the velocity is globally bounded. Furthermore, the Kac model has the diffusion model as its asymptotic limit. We extend these considerations to a multi-dimensional stochastic process which consists of independent 1D Kac processes in each spatial component. We show that this process gives rise to an absolutely continuous curve in the Wasserstein space and compute the conditional velocity field starting in a Dirac point analytically. Using the framework of flow matching, we train a neural network that approximates the velocity field and use it for sample generation. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the scalability of our approach, and show its advantages over diffusion models.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Formula for Vertex Enumeration in the CUT(n) Polytope via Probabilistic Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an explicit closed-form formula for the vertices of the classical cut polytope $\operatorname{CUT}(n)$, defined as the convex hull of cut vectors of the complete graph $K_n$. Our derivation proceeds via a related polytope, denoted $\mathbf{1}$-$\operatorname{CUT}(n)$, whose vertices are obtained by flipping all bits of the $\operatorname{CUT}(n)$ vertices. This polytope arises naturally in a probabilistic context involving agreement probabilities among symmetric Bernoulli random variables which serves as the starting point of this work.
  Our approach constructs the vertex set recursively via a binary encoding that stems from this probabilistic perspective. We prove that the resulting sequence of encoded integers, when appropriately scaled, exhibits an almost-linear behavior closely approximating the line $y = x - \frac{1}{2}$. This structure motivates the introduction of the alternating cycle function, an integer-valued map whose key property is power-of-two composition invariance. The function serves as the foundation for our closed-form enumeration formula.
  The result provides a rare instance of explicit vertex characterization for a $0$/$1$-polytope and offers a transparent combinatorial construction independent of enumeration algorithms.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Temporal Point Process Modeling of Aggressive Behavior Onset in Psychiatric Inpatient Youth with Autism for Branching Factor Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aggressive behavior in autistic inpatient youth often arises in temporally clustered bursts complicating efforts to distinguish external triggers from internal escalation. The sample population branching factor-the expected number of new onsets triggered by a given event-is a key summary of self-excitation in behavior dynamics. Prior pooled models overestimate this quantity by ignoring patient-specific variability. We addressed this using a hierarchical Hawkes process with an exponential kernel and edge-effect correction allowing partial pooling across patients. This approach reduces bias from high-frequency individuals and stabilizes estimates for those with sparse data. Bayesian inference was performed using the No U-Turn Sampler with model evaluation via convergence diagnostics, power-scaling sensitivity analysis, and multiple Goodness-of-Fit (GOF) metrics: PSIS-LOO the Lewis test with Durbin's modification and residual analysis based on the Random Time Change Theorem (RTCT). The hierarchical model yielded a significantly lower and more precise branching factor estimate mean (0.742 +- 0.026) than the pooled model (0.899 +- 0.015) and narrower intervals than the unpooled model (0.717 +- 0.139). This led to a threefold smaller cascade of events per onset under the hierarchical model. Sensitivity analyses confirmed robustness to prior and likelihood perturbations while the unpooled model showed instability for sparse individuals. GOF measures consistently favored or on par to the hierarchical model. Hierarchical Hawkes modeling with edge-effect correction provides robust estimation of branching dynamics by capturing both within- and between-patient variability. This enables clearer separation of endogenous from exogenous events supports linkage to physiological signals and enhances early warning systems individualized treatment and resource allocation in inpatient care.</description>
