      <title>Pairwise XOR and XNOR Gates in Squeezed Instantaneous Noise Based Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instantaneous noise-based logic (INBL) is a novel computing approach that encodes binary information using stochastic processes. It uses 2M orthogonal stochastic reference noises for M noise-bits to construct an exponentially large Hilbert space (hyperspace) of dimension 2^M. INBL offers a classical alternative to quantum-style parallelism for specific problems with exponential speedup compared to classical algorithms. Building on recent work that introduced pairwise XOR and XNOR operations defined for a symmetric INBL scheme, this paper implements these gates for a squeezed INBL scheme. Hyperspace vectors are product strings corresponding to M-bit long binary numbers. The proposed operations can apply pairwise on hyperspace vectors and their superpositions, while remaining compatible with the squeezed reference system. We validate that the squeezed-scheme XOR/XNOR gate operations have correct Boolean behavior over both bitwise and targeted M-bit strings and demonstrate that the operations preserve instantaneous evaluation. The results show that the XOR/XNOR toolkit, previously developed for symmetric INBL, can be tailored for the squeezed scheme. This development is a key part of the gate set needed for more complex INBL algorithms in the squeezed INBL scheme and advances the objective of gate universality in INBL. It further strengthens the case for INBL as a flexible, classical computing framework that can emulate some structural advantages of quantum computation.</description>

      <title>High Convergence Rates of CMOS Invertible Logic Circuits Based on Many-Body Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces CMOS invertible-logic (CIL) circuits based on many-body Hamiltonians. CIL can realize probabilistic forward and backward operations of a function by annealing a corresponding Hamiltonian using stochastic computing. We have created a Hamiltonian that includes three-body interaction of spins (probabilistic nodes). It provides some degrees of freedom to design a simpler landscape of Hamiltonian (energy) than that of the conventional two-body Hamiltonian. The simpler landscape makes it easier to reach the global minimum energy. The proposed three-body CIL circuits are designed and evaluated with the conventional two-body CIL circuits, resulting in few-times higher convergence rates with negligible area overhead on FPGA.</description>

      <title>Full-Field Damage Monitoring in Architected Lattices Using In situ Electrical Impedance Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) enables non-invasive, spatially continuous reconstruction of internal conductivity distributions, providing full field sensing beyond conventional point measurements. Here, we report the first in situ implementation of EIT within a tunable architected lattice materials framework, enabling systematic exploration across a broad lattice design space while achieving real time monitoring of damage evolution, including early stage, prefracture events, in 3D printed multifunctional lattice composites. Lattices are designed via Voronoi based branch trunk branch motifs inspired by 2D wallpaper symmetries and fabricated using CNT infused photocurable resins, with nanoscale filler dispersion confirmed by field emission scanning electron microscopy. Sixteen electrodes distributed along the lattice periphery enable EIT measurements during quasi static tensile loading. Conductivity maps reconstructed using adjacent and across current injection schemes resolve sequential ligament fracture with high temporal resolution, with localised conductivity loss quantitatively coinciding with fracture sites, including regions remote from electrodes. Architectural tunability allows systematic control of EIT imaging sensitivity to early stage damage, while pronounced resistance discontinuities at failure further corroborate spatial localisation; global end to end resistance measurements complement macroscopic stress strain responses. Collectively, these results establish in situ EIT as a scalable, full field sensing modality for architected multifunctional materials, providing an experimentally validated pathway toward autonomous, intelligent materials and data rich material states that can inform digital twin frameworks for structural, biomedical, and energy related applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum Optimization for Access Point Selection Under Budget Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal Access Point (AP) selection is crucial for accurate indoor localization, yet it is constrained by budget, creating a trade-off between localization accuracy and deployment cost. Classical approaches to AP selection are often computationally expensive, hindering their application in large-scale 3D indoor environments.
  In this paper, we introduce a quantum APs selection algorithm under a budget constraint. The proposed algorithm leverages quantum annealing to identify the most effective subset of APs allowed within a given budget. We formulate the APs selection problem as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem, making it suitable for quantum annealing solvers. The proposed technique can drastically reduce infrastructure requirements with a negligible impact on performance.
  We implement the proposed quantum algorithm and deploy it in a realistic 3D testbed. Our results show that the proposed approach can reduce the number of required APs by 96.1% while maintaining a comparable 3D localization accuracy. Furthermore, the proposed quantum approach outperforms classical AP selection algorithms in both accuracy and computational speed. Specifically, our technique achieves a time of 0.20 seconds, representing a speedup of 61 times over its classical counterpart, while reducing the mean localization error by 10% compared to the classical counterpart. For floor localization, the quantum approach achieves 73% floor accuracy, outperforming both the classical AP selection (58.6%) and even using the complete set of APs (70.4%). This highlights the promise of the proposed quantum APs selection algorithm for large-scale 3D localization.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing for Healthcare Digital Twin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing complexity of healthcare systems requires advanced computational models for real-time monitoring, secure data exchange, and intelligent decision-making. Digital Twins (DTs) provide virtual representations of physical healthcare entities, enabling continuous patient monitoring and personalized care. However, classical DT frameworks face limitations in scalability, computational efficiency, and security. Recent studies have introduced Quantum Digital Twins (QDTs) to enhance performance through quantum computing, addressing challenges such as quantum-resistant security and efficient task offloading in healthcare environments. Despite these advances, most existing QDT models remain constrained by fundamental challenges related to quantum hardware limitations, hybrid classical-quantum system integration, cloud-based quantum access, scalability, and clinical trust. This paper provides a comprehensive review of QDTs for healthcare, with a particular focus on identifying and analyzing the key challenges that currently hinder their real-world adoption. Furthermore, it outlines critical research directions and enabling strategies aimed at advancing the development of secure, reliable, and clinically viable quantum digital twin systems for next-generation healthcare applications.</description>

      <title>PRISM: Photonics-Informed Inverse Lithography for Manufacturable Inverse-Designed Photonic Integrated Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in photonic inverse design have demonstrated the ability to automatically synthesize compact, high-performance photonic components that surpass conventional, hand-designed structures, offering a promising path toward scalable and functionality-rich photonic hardware. However, the practical deployment of inverse-designed PICs is bottlenecked by manufacturability: their irregular, subwavelength geometries are highly sensitive to fabrication variations, leading to large performance degradation, low yield, and a persistent gap between simulated optimality and fabricated performance. Unlike electronics, photonics lacks a systematic, flexible mask optimization flow. Fabrication deviations in photonic components cause large optical response drift and compounding error in cascaded circuits, while calibrating fabrication models remains costly and expertise-heavy, often requiring repeated fabrication cycles that are inaccessible to most designers. To bridge this gap, we introduce PRISM, a photonics-informed inverse lithography workflow that makes photonic mask optimization data-efficient, reliable, and optics-informed. PRISM (i) synthesizes compact, informative calibration patterns to minimize required fabrication data, (ii) trains a physics-grounded differentiable fabrication model, enabling gradient-based optimization, and (iii) performs photonics-informed inverse mask optimization that prioritizes performance-critical features beyond geometry matching. Across multiple inverse-designed components with both electron-beam lithography and deep ultra-violet photolithography processes, PRISM significantly boosts post-fabrication performance and yield while reducing calibration area and turnaround time, enabling and democratizing manufacturable and high-yield inverse-designed photonic hardware at scale.</description>

      <title>Service Orchestration in the Computing Continuum: Structural Challenges and Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Computing Continuum (CC) integrates different layers of processing infrastructure, from Edge to Cloud, to optimize service quality through ubiquitous and reliable computation. Compared to central architectures, however, heterogeneous and dynamic infrastructure increases the complexity for service orchestration. To guide research, this article first summarizes structural problems of the CC, and then, envisions an ideal solution for autonomous service orchestration across the CC. As one instantiation, we show how Active Inference, a concept from neuroscience, can support self-organizing services in continuously interpreting their environment to optimize service quality. Still, we conclude that no existing solution achieves our vision, but that research on service orchestration faces several structural challenges. Most notably: provide standardized simulation and evaluation environments for comparing the performance of orchestration mechanisms. Together, the challenges outline a research roadmap toward resilient and scalable service orchestration in the CC.</description>

      <title>NeuroChat: A Neuroadaptive AI Chatbot for Customizing Learning Experiences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative AI is transforming education by enabling personalized, on-demand learning experiences. However, current AI systems lack awareness of the learner's cognitive state, limiting their adaptability. Meanwhile, electroencephalography (EEG)-based neuroadaptive systems have shown promise in enhancing engagement through real-time physiological feedback. This paper presents NeuroChat, a neuroadaptive AI tutor that integrates real-time EEG-based engagement tracking with generative AI to adapt its responses. NeuroChat continuously monitors a learner's cognitive engagement and dynamically adjusts content complexity, tone, and response style in a closed-loop interaction. In a within-subjects study (n=24), NeuroChat significantly increased both EEG-measured and self-reported engagement compared to a non-adaptive chatbot. However, no significant differences in short-term learning outcomes were observed. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of real-time cognitive feedback in LLMs, highlighting new directions for adaptive learning, AI tutoring, and deeper personalization in human-AI interaction.</description>

      <title>TQml Simulator: optimized simulation of quantum machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04891v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hardware-efficient circuits employed in Quantum Machine Learning are typically composed of alternating layers of uniformly applied gates. High-speed numerical simulators for such circuits are crucial for advancing research in this field. In this work, we numerically benchmark universal and gate-specific techniques for simulating the action of layers of gates on quantum state vectors, aiming to accelerate the overall simulation of Quantum Machine Learning algorithms. Our analysis shows that the optimal simulation method for a given layer of gates depends on the number of qubits involved, and that a tailored combination of techniques can yield substantial performance gains in the forward and backward passes for a given circuit. Building on these insights, we developed a numerical simulator, named TQml Simulator, that employs the most efficient simulation method for each layer in a given circuit. We evaluated TQml Simulator on circuits constructed from standard gate sets, such as rotations and CNOTs, as well as on native gates from IonQ and IBM quantum processing units. In most cases, our simulator outperforms equivalent Pennylane's default.qubit simulator by up to a factor of 10, depending on the circuit, the number of qubits, the batch size of the input data, and the hardware used.</description>

      <title>Lattice Random Walk Discretisations of Stochastic Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a lattice random walk discretisation scheme for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that samples binary or ternary increments at each step, suppressing complex drift and diffusion computations to simple 1 or 2 bit random values. This approach is a significant departure from traditional floating point discretisations and offers several advantages; including compatibility with stochastic computing architectures that avoid floating-point arithmetic in place of directly manipulating the underlying probability distribution of a bitstream, elimination of Gaussian sampling requirements, robustness to quantisation errors, and handling of non-Lipschitz drifts. We prove weak convergence and demonstrate the advantages through experiments on various SDEs, including state-of-the-art diffusion models.</description>

      <title>OpenAIs HealthBench in Action: Evaluating an LLM-Based Medical Assistant on Realistic Clinical Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on their ability to generate high-quality, accurate, situationally aware answers to clinical questions requires going beyond conventional benchmarks to assess how these systems behave in complex, high-stakes clinical scenarios. Traditional evaluations are often limited to multiple-choice questions that fail to capture essential competencies such as contextual reasoning, contextual awareness, and uncertainty handling.
  To address these limitations, we evaluate our agentic RAG-based clinical support assistant, DR. INFO, using HealthBench, a rubric-driven benchmark composed of open-ended, expert-annotated health conversations. On the Hard subset of 1,000 challenging examples, DR. INFO achieves a HealthBench Hard score of 0.68, outperforming leading frontier LLMs including the GPT-5 model family (GPT-5: 0.46, GPT-5.2: 0.42, GPT-5.1: 0.40), Grok 3 (0.23), Gemini 2.5 Pro (0.19), and Claude 3.7 Sonnet (0.02) across all behavioral axes (accuracy, completeness, instruction following, etc.). In a separate 100-sample evaluation against similar agentic RAG assistants (OpenEvidence and Pathway.md, now DoxGPT by Doximity), it maintains a performance lead with a HealthBench Hard score of 0.72.
  These results highlight the strengths of DR. INFO in communication, instruction following, and accuracy, while also revealing areas for improvement in context awareness and response completeness. Overall, the findings underscore the utility of behavior-level, rubric-based evaluation for building reliable and trustworthy AI-enabled clinical support systems.</description>
