      <title>Nonlinear refrigerator with a finite-sized cold heat bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the refrigerator working between a finite-sized cold heat bath and an infinite-sized hot heat bath (environment) in the nonlinear response regime. We assume that the initial temperature $T_i$ of the finite-sized cold heat bath satisfies $T_i\leq T_h$, where $T_h$ is the temperature of the hot heat bath. By consuming the input power, the refrigerator transfers the heat from a finite-sized cold heat bath to the hot heat bath. Hence, the temperature of the finite-sized cold heat bath decreases until it reaches the desired low-temperature $T_f$. By minimizing the input work for the heat transport process, we derive the optimal path for temperature change. We calculate the coefficient of performance as a function of average input power. We also obtain the bounds for the coefficient of performance by applying the asymmetric dissipation limits.</description>

      <title>Critical and quasicritical behavior in a three-species dynamical model of semi-directed percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a three-species dynamical model whose dynamics naturally generate the semi-directed percolation cluster and show a non-equilibrium absorbing state phase transition from an active to inactive state. The critical threshold and exponents associated with the dynamic process are determined using Monte Carlo simulations. Critical behavior observed shows that the model belongs to the directed percolation (DP) universality class. Further, we consider the effect of spontaneous activity generation in the dynamical model. While this destroys the usual critical behaviour, we find that the dynamic susceptibility shows a maximum at a specific value of the control parameter, indicating a quasi-critical behaviour, similar to the findings in the case of DP models and DP-inspired models of neuronal activity with spontaneous activity generation. Interestingly, in the presence of spontaneous activity, we find that spatial and temporal correlations exhibit power-law decays at a value of the control parameter different from the quasi-critical threshold indicating that there are two effective thresholds in such a case, one where the response function is maximum and another where the spatial and temporal correlations show scale free behaviour.</description>

      <title>Approximate calculation of multidimensional first passage times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The general, multidimensional barrier crossing problem for diffusive processes under the action of conservative forces is studied with the goal of developing tractable approximations. Particular attention is given to the effect of different statistical interpretations of the stochastic differential equation and to the relation between the approximations and the known, exact solutions to the one-dimensional problem. Beginning with a reasonable, but heuristic, simplifying assumption, a one-dimensional solution to the problem is developed. This is then simplified by introducing further approximations resulting in a sequence of increasingly simple expressions culminating in the classic result of Langer(Ann. Phys. 54, 258 (1969)) and others. The various approximations are tested on two dimensional problems by comparison to simulation results and it is found that the one-dimensional approximations capture most of the non-Arrhenius dependence on the energy barrier which is lost in the Langer approximation while still converging to the latter in the large-barrier limit.</description>

      <title>Two-Step Bose-Einstein Condensation of an ideal Magnetized Charged Bosonic gas under neutron star-like conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamic properties of a non-interacting, relativistic gas of charged scalar bosons in a uniform magnetic field, including both statistical and vacuum contributions at arbitrary field strengths. Focusing on the low-temperature regime and separating the Lowest Landau Level (LLL) from excited states provides a clearer view of the magnetic field's impact on thermodynamic quantities. We revisit Bose Einstein condensation (BEC), specific heat, magnetization, and the equation of state (EoS). A central result is the diffuse character of BEC induced by the magnetic field, reflected in the specific heat, which exhibits two plateaus: the first appears when the system becomes effectively one-dimensional through magnetic confinement, while the second-associated with the true one-particle ground state-is suppressed by the field. Consequently, no critical condensation temperature arises. For magnetization, the LLL contribution shifts from diamagnetic to paramagnetic As the field strengthen with the inclusion of the excited states, the statistical magnetization remains negative. In contrast, the vacuum contribution dominates at strong fields, driving paramagnetic. We also show that antiparticles enhance specific heat, magnetization, and total pressure. These effects are illustrated for a pion gas under neutron star conditions and compared with previous results for a neutral vector boson system.</description>

      <title>Traffic State Estimation in Congestion to Extend Applicability of DFOS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a traffic state estimation (TSE) method in congestion for distributed fiber-optic sensing (DFOS). DFOS detects vehicle driving vibrations along the optical fiber and obtains their trajectories in the spatiotemporal plane. From these trajectories, DFOS provides mean velocities for real-time spatially continuous traffic monitoring without dead zones. However, when vehicle vibration intensities are insufficiently low due to slow speed, trajectories cannot be obtained, leading to missing values in mean velocity data. It restricts DFOS applicability in severe congestion. Therefore, this paper proposes a missing value imputation method based on data assimilation. Our proposed method is validated on two expressways in Japan with the reference data. The results show that the mean absolute error (MAE) of the imputed mean velocities to the reference increases only by 1.5 km/h as compared with the MAE of non-missing values. This study enhances the wide-range applicability of DFOS in practical cases.</description>

      <title>Quantum Physics using Weighted Model Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weighted model counting (WMC) has proven effective at a range of tasks within computer science, physics, and beyond. However, existing approaches for using WMC in quantum physics only target specific problem instances, lacking a general framework for expressing problems using WMC. This limits the reusability of these approaches in other applications and risks a lack of mathematical rigor on a per-instance basis. We present an approach for expressing linear algebraic problems, specifically those present in physics and quantum computing, as WMC instances. We do this by introducing a framework that converts Dirac notation to WMC problems. We build up this framework theoretically, using a type system and denotational semantics, and provide an implementation in Python. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in calculating the partition functions of several physical models: The transverse-field Ising model (quantum) and the Potts model (classical). The results suggest that heuristics developed in automated reasoning can be systematically applied to a wide class of problems in quantum physics through our framework.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation theorem and optimal control of an active tracking particle with information processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Living systems often function with regulatory interactions, but the question of how activity, stochasticity and regulations work together for achieving different goals still remains puzzling.We propose the model of an active tracking particle with information processing, based on which the entropy production, information flow, and generalised fluctuation theorem are derived.Moreover, the system performance, in terms of the first passage steps and the total energy consumption, are analysed in the variable space of (measurement error, control field), leading to discussions on the optimal control of the system.Not only elucidating the basic concepts involved in a stochastic active system with information processing, this prototypical model could also inspire more elaborated modelings of natural smart organisms and industrial designs of controllable active systems with desired physical performances in the future.</description>

      <title>Universal Precision Limits in General Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intuition that the precision of observables is constrained by thermodynamic costs has recently been formalized through thermodynamic and kinetic uncertainty relations. While such trade-offs have been extensively studied in Markovian systems, corresponding constraints in the non-Markovian regime remain largely unexplored. In this Letter, we derive universal bounds on the precision of generic observables in open quantum systems coupled to environments of arbitrary strength and subjected to two-point measurements. By introducing an asymmetry term that quantifies the disparity between forward and backward processes, we show that the relative fluctuation of any time-antisymmetric current is constrained by both entropy production and this forward-backward asymmetry. For general observables, we prove that their relative fluctuation is always bounded from below by a generalized activity term. These results establish a comprehensive framework for understanding precision limits in broad classes of general open quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a replicated liquid theory for structural glasses which exhibit spatial variation of physical quantities along one axis, say $z$-axis. The theory becomes exact with infinite transverse dimension $d-1 \to \infty$. It provides an exact free-energy functional with space-dependent glass order parameter $\Delta_{ab}(z)$. As a first application of the scheme, we study diverging lengths associated with dynamic/static glass transitions of hardspheres with/without confining cavity. The exponents agree with those obtained in previous studies on related mean-field models. Moreover, it predicts a non-trivial spatial profile of the glass order parameter $\Delta_{ab}(z)$ within the cavity which exhibits a scaling feature approaching the dynamical glass transition.</description>

      <title>Geometrically Frustrated Assembly at Finite Temperature: Phase Transitions from Self-Limiting to Bulk States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometric frustration is recognized to generate complex morphologies in self-assembling particulate and molecular systems. In bulk states, frustrated drives structured arrays of topological defects. In the dilute limit, these systems have been shown to form a novel state of self-limiting assembly, in which the equilibrium size of multi-particle domains are finite and well-defined. In this article, we employ Monte Carlo simulations of a recently developed 2D lattice model of geometrically frustrated assembly~\cite{HackneyPhysRevX.13.041010} to study the phase transitions between the self-limiting and defect bulk phase driven by two distinct mechanisms: (i) increasing concentration and (ii) decreasing temperature or frustration. The first transition is mediated by a concentration-driven percolation transition of self-limiting, worm-like domains into an intermediate heterogeneous network mesophase, which gradually fills in at high concentration to form a quasi-uniform defect bulk state. We find that the percolation threshold is weakly dependent on frustration and shifts to higher concentration as frustration is increased, but depends strongly on the ratio of cohesion to elastic stiffness in the model. The second transition takes place between self-limiting assembly at high-temperature/frustration and phase separation into a condensed bulk state at low temperature/frustration. We consider the competing influences that translational and conformational entropy have on the critical temperature/frustration and show that the self-limiting phase is stabilized at higher frustrations and temperatures than previously expected. Taken together, this understanding of the transition pathways from self-limiting to bulk defect phases of frustrated assembly allows us to map the phase behavior of this 2D minimal model over the full range of concentration.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Anyon-Otto thermal machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a four-stroke quantum thermal machine based on the 1D anyon Hubbard model, which is capable of extracting the excess energy arising from anyon exclusion statistics at low temperature into finite work. Defining a hybrid anyon-Otto (HAO) cycle, we find that the low temperature work, in the absence of any interactions, is maximised in the pseudo fermionic limit, where the anyons most closely resemble free fermions. However, when weak interactions are introduced, the work output is no longer maximized at the bosonic or pseudo-fermionic extremes, but instead peaks at intermediate statistical angles. This clearly demonstrates that interactions and anyonic statistics conspire non-trivially to enhance performance, with interacting anyons offering greater quantum thermodynamic advantage than either bosons or pseudo-fermions, in this regime. Furthermore, we also identify different modes of operation of the HAO cycle, one of which emerges as a direct consequence of the finite anyon energy at low temperature.</description>

      <title>Suppression of errors in collectively coded information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern life largely transmits genetic information from mother to daughter through the duplication of single physically intact molecules that encode information. However, copying an extended molecule requires highly processive copying machinery and high fidelity that scales with the genome size to avoid the error catastrophe. Here, we explore these fidelity requirements in an alternative architecture, the virtual circular genome, in which no one physical molecule encodes the full genetic information. Instead, information is encoded and transmitted in a collective of overlapping and interacting segments. Using a model experimental system of a complex mixture of DNA oligos that can partly anneal and extend off each other, we find that mutant oligomers are suppressed relative to a model without collective encoding. Through simulations and theory, we show that this suppression of mutants can be explained by competition for productive binding partners. As a consequence, information can be propagated robustly in a virtual circular genome even if the mutation rate is above the error catastrophe for a physically intact genome.</description>

      <title>Langevin equations and a geometric integration scheme for the overdamped limit of rotational Brownian motion of axisymmetric particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04501v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The translational motion of anisotropic or self-propelled colloidal particles is closely linked with the particle's orientation and its rotational Brownian motion. In the overdamped limit, the stochastic evolution of the orientation vector follows a diffusion process on the unit sphere and is characterized by an orientation-dependent (``multiplicative'') noise. As a consequence, the corresponding Langevin equation attains different forms depending on whether It\=o's or Stratonovich's stochastic calculus is used. We clarify that both forms are equivalent and derive them in a top-down appraoch from a geometric construction of Brownian motion on the unit sphere, based on infinitesimal random rotations. Our approach suggests further a geometric integration scheme for rotational Brownian motion, which preserves the normalization constraint of the orientation vector exactly. We show that a simple implementation of the scheme, based on Gaussian random rotations, converges weakly at order 1 of the integration time step, and we outline an advanced variant of the scheme that is weakly exact for an arbitrarily large time step. Due to a favorable prefactor of the discretization error, already the Gaussian scheme allows for integration time steps that are one order of magnitude larger compared to a commonly used algorithm for rotational Brownian dynamics simulations based on projection on the constraining manifold. For torques originating from constant external fields, we prove by virtue of the Fokker-Planck equation that the constructed diffusion process satisfies detailed balance and converges to the correct equilibrium distribution. The analysis is restricted to time-homogeneous rotational Brownian motion (i.e., a single rotational diffusion constant), which is relevant for axisymmetric particles and also chemically anisotropic spheres, such as self-propelled Janus particles.</description>

      <title>Optimal control of levitated nanoparticles through finite-stiffness confinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimal control of levitated nanoparticles subjected to thermal fluctuations is a challenging problem, both theoretically and experimentally. In this Letter, we compute the time-dependent harmonic confining potential that steers, in a prescribed time and with the minimum energetic cost, a Brownian particle between two assigned equilibrium states. We take full account of inertial effects, thus addressing the general underdamped dynamics, and, to address actual experimental conditions, the stiffness of the confining potential is required to be bounded. We carry out an experiment realizing the described protocol for an optically confined nanoparticle, which is shown to reach the target state within accuracy -- while spending less energy than other protocols with the same duration, significantly shorter than the characteristic relaxation time. The results presented here are expected to have relevant applications in the design of optimal devices, such as engines at the nanoscale.</description>

Abstract: We introduce magic-augmented Clifford circuits -- architectures in which Clifford circuits are preceded and/or followed by constant-depth circuits of non-Clifford (``magic") gates -- as a resource-efficient way to realize approximate $k$-designs, with reduced circuit depth and usage of magic. We prove that shallow Clifford circuits, when augmented with constant-depth circuits of magic gates, can generate approximate unitary and state $k$-designs with $\epsilon$ relative error. The total circuit depth for these constructions on $N$ qubits is $O(\log (N/\epsilon)) +2^{O(k\log k)}$ in one dimension and $O(\log\log(N/\epsilon))+2^{O(k\log k)}$ in all-to-all circuits using ancillas, which improves upon previous results for small $k \geq 4$. Furthermore, our construction of relative-error state $k$-designs only involves states with strictly local magic. The required number of magic gates is parametrically reduced when considering $k$-designs with bounded additive error. As an example, we show that shallow Clifford circuits followed by $O(k^2)$ single-qubit magic gates, independent of system size, can generate an additive-error state $k$-design. We develop a classical statistical mechanics description of our random circuit architectures, which provides a quantitative understanding of the required depth and number of magic gates for additive-error state $k$-designs. We also prove no-go theorems for various architectures to generate designs with bounded relative error.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Induced Entanglement in Conformal Field Theory</title>

Abstract: Local measurements can radically reshape patterns of many-body entanglement, especially in long-range entangled quantum-critical states. Yet, analytical results addressing the effects of measurements on many-body states remain scarce, and measurements are often approximated as forcing specific measurement outcomes. We study measurement-induced entanglement (MIE) in Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids, a broad family of 1+1d quantum critical states described at low energies by compact free boson conformal field theories (CFT). Measuring the local charge operator, we show that the MIE is entirely universal, conformally invariant, and depends on the operator content of the CFT. Using a replica-trick to address the randomness of the measurement outcomes, we compute the MIE exactly for Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids, in very good agreement with matrix-product state calculations. We show that the MIE for physical quantum measurements is fundamentally different from the entanglement induced by forcing measurement outcomes, and has a natural interpretation in terms of Born averaging over conformally-invariant boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>A Replica Stoner Theory for Dirty Ferromagnets</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates the effect of disorder on a ferromagnetic metal with repulsive interactions. We assume that, in the clean limit, the ferromagnetic state can be described by Stoner mean-field theory and study how disorder affects the the system by using a combined replica + Stoner mean-field approach. At zero temperature, we find that a replica-symmetric ferromagnetic mean-field solution exists in the presence of disorder with a modified Stoner criteria where the ferromagnetism is enhanced by disorder. At finite temperature, a Landau theory is employed to construct the phase diagram, revealing that beyond a critical disorder strength, a spin-glass phase may exist between the high-temperature paramagnetic phase and the low-temperature ferromagnetic phase. For weak (repulsive) interaction where the system is non-ferromagnetic in the clean limit, the possibility of a disordered-induced ferromagnetic ground state is observed both at zero temperature and finite temperature. The potential applicability of this framework to realistic materials is briefly discussed.</description>
