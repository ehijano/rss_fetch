      <title>Habit learning is associated with efficiently controlled network dynamics in naive macaque monkeys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primates utilize distributed neural circuits to learn habits in uncertain environments, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We propose a formal theory of network energetics explaining how brain states influence sequential behavior. We test our theory on multi-unit recordings from the caudate nucleus and cortical regions of macaques performing a motor habit task. The theory predicts the energy required to transition between brain states represented by trial-specific firing rates across channels, assuming activity spreads through effective connections. We hypothesized that habit formation would correlate with lower control energy. Consistent with this, we observed smaller energy requirements for transitions between similar saccade patterns and those of intermediate complexity, and sessions exploiting fewer patterns. Simulations ruled out confounds from neurons' directional tuning. Finally, virtual lesioning demonstrated robustness of observed relationships between control energy and behavior. This work paves the way for examining how behavior arises from changing activity in distributed circuitry.</description>

      <title>A universal theorem of sensory information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A universal theorem of sensory information, analogous to the second law of thermodynamics, is derived. Beginning from a minimal description of a sensory neuron, a state-space representation of firing rate emerges naturally from Shannon's measure of information. A special case of this formulation predicts a previously unknown inequality governing sensory adaptation, which was confirmed across different modalities, species, and experimental conditions. Further analysis shows that the firing rate behaves like a state function in thermodynamics, leading to an entropy production equation from which a general law follows: any closed cycle of stimulation yields a non-negative net gain of sensory information.</description>

      <title>Inferring response times of perceptual decisions with Poisson variational autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many properties of perceptual decision making are well-modeled by deep neural networks. However, such architectures typically treat decisions as instantaneous readouts, overlooking the temporal dynamics of the decision process. We present an image-computable model of perceptual decision making in which choices and response times arise from efficient sensory encoding and Bayesian decoding of neural spiking activity. We use a Poisson variational autoencoder to learn unsupervised representations of visual stimuli in a population of rate-coded neurons, modeled as independent homogeneous Poisson processes. A task-optimized decoder then continually infers an approximate posterior over actions conditioned on incoming spiking activity. Combining these components with an entropy-based stopping rule yields a principled and image-computable model of perceptual decisions capable of generating trial-by-trial patterns of choices and response times. Applied to MNIST digit classification, the model reproduces key empirical signatures of perceptual decision making, including stochastic variability, right-skewed response time distributions, logarithmic scaling of response times with the number of alternatives (Hick's law), and speed-accuracy trade-offs.</description>

      <title>What the flock knows that the birds do not: exploring the emergence of joint agency in multi-agent active inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective behavior pervades biological systems, from flocks of birds to neural assemblies and human societies. Yet, how such collectives acquire functional properties -- such as joint agency or knowledge -- that transcend those of their individual components remains an open question. Here, we combine active inference and information-theoretic analyses to explore how a minimal system of interacting agents can give rise to joint agency and collective knowledge. We model flocking dynamics using multiple active inference agents, each minimizing its own free energy while coupling reciprocally with its neighbors. We show that as agents self-organize, their interactions define higher-order statistical boundaries (Markov blankets) enclosing a ``flock'' that can be treated as an emergent agent with its own sensory, active, and internal states. When exposed to external perturbations (a ``predator''), the flock exhibits faster, coordinated responses than individual agents, reflecting collective sensitivity to environmental change. Crucially, analyses of synergistic information reveal that the flock encodes information about the predator's location that is not accessible to every individual bird, demonstrating implicit collective knowledge. Together, these results show how informational coupling among active inference agents can generate new levels of autonomy and inference, providing a framework for understanding the emergence of (implicit) collective knowledge and joint agency.</description>

      <title>CAT-Net: A Cross-Attention Tone Network for Cross-Subject EEG-EMG Fusion Tone Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) speech decoding has emerged as a promising tool for assisting individuals with speech impairments. In this context, the integration of electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) signals offers strong potential for enhancing decoding performance. Mandarin tone classification presents particular challenges, as tonal variations convey distinct meanings even when phonemes remain identical. In this study, we propose a novel cross-subject multimodal BCI decoding framework that fuses EEG and EMG signals to classify four Mandarin tones under both audible and silent speech conditions. Inspired by the cooperative mechanisms of neural and muscular systems in speech production, our neural decoding architecture combines spatial-temporal feature extraction branches with a cross-attention fusion mechanism, enabling informative interaction between modalities. We further incorporate domain-adversarial training to improve cross-subject generalization. We collected 4,800 EEG trials and 4,800 EMG trials from 10 participants using only twenty EEG and five EMG channels, demonstrating the feasibility of minimal-channel decoding. Despite employing lightweight modules, our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across all conditions, achieving average classification accuracies of 87.83% for audible speech and 88.08% for silent speech. In cross-subject evaluations, it still maintains strong performance with accuracies of 83.27% and 85.10% for audible and silent speech, respectively. We further conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of each component. Our findings suggest that tone-level decoding with minimal EEG-EMG channels is feasible and potentially generalizable across subjects, contributing to the development of practical BCI applications.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms for anesthesia, unawareness, respiratory depression, memory replay and sleep: MHb &gt; IPN &gt; PAG + DRN + MRN &gt; claustrum &gt; cortical slow-waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: My findings show what causes loss of awareness, anesthesia, memory replay, opioid induced respiratory depression (OIRD), and slow-wave sleep (SWS). Opiates are fast pain relievers and anesthetics that can cause respiratory arrest. I found how mu-opioids and anesthetics by activating medial habenula (MHb) and/or interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) induce unawareness and slowdown respiration. MHb projects to IPN and both increase their glucose intake during anesthesia (Herkenham, 1981). The question is: What is the MHb-IPN circuit doing? I found that it promotes SWS, memory replay, sharp-wave ripples, spindles, hippocampo-cortical replay, synaptogenesis, rest and recovery, by activating median raphe (MRN) serotonin, and by inhibiting the theta state circuit, new memories encoding, awareness, arousal, alert wakefulness, and REM sleep. It causes also natural slowdown of respiration and heart rate, while it inhibits locomotion and arousal. This extended model adds role of the dentate gyrus&gt;posterior septum&gt;MHb&gt;IPN&gt;MRN&gt;hippocampus + BF + claustrum&gt;cortical slow-waves in memory replay, ripples, loss of awareness, SWS, and anesthesia. It proposes new neural mechanism for anesthetic ketamine, nitrous oxide, and phencyclidine effects: activation of the IPN&gt;MRN&gt;claustrum&gt;cortical SWA circuit by the 5-HT2a receptors in the IPN and claustrum. My model shows why are ketamine and psychedelics anxiolytic and antidepressant. How they by activating the 5-HT2a receptors in vACC/infralimbic cortex increase safety, well-being signal, socializing, and cognitive flexibility, and attenuate fear, worries, anger, impulsivity, self-defence, and wanting. This model claims that mu-opioids, acetylcholine, nicotine, endocannabinoids, adenosine, GLP-1RA, and substance P activate the MHb-IPN-MRN circuit which promotes rest, recovery, repair, serotonin-BDNF-protein production, spines growth, and anti-inflammatory state.</description>
