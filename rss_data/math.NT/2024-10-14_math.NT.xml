      <title>Gan--Gross--Prasad cycles and derivatives of $p$-adic $L$-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the p-adic analogue of the arithmetic Gan-Gross-Prasad (GGP) conjectures for unitary groups. Let $\Pi$ be a hermitian cuspidal automorphic representation of GL_{n} x GL_{n+1} over a CM field, which is algebraic of minimal regular weight at infinity. We first show the rationality of twists of the ratio of L-values of $\Pi$ appearing in the GGP conjectures. Then, when $\Pi$ is p-ordinary at a prime p, we construct a cyclotomic p-adic L-function $L_p(M_\Pi)$ interpolating those twists. Finally, under some local assumptions, we prove a precise formula relating the first derivative of $L_p(M_\Pi)$ to the p-adic heights of Selmer classes arising from arithmetic diagonal cycles on unitary Shimura varieties. We deduce applications to the p-adic Beilinson-Bloch-Kato conjecture for the motive attached to $\Pi$. All proofs are based on some relative-trace formulas in p-adic coefficients.</description>

      <title>Euler systems for conjugate-symplectic motives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\rho$ be a conjugate-symplectic, geometric representation of the Galois group of a CM field. Under the assumption that $\rho$ is automorphic, even-dimensional, and of minimal regular Hodge--Tate type, we construct an Euler system for $\rho$ in the sense of forthcoming work of Jetchev--Nekovar--Skinner. The construction is based on Theta cycles as introduced in a previous paper, following works of Kudla and Liu on arithmetic theta series on unitary Shimura varieties; it relies on a certain modularity hypothesis for those theta series.
  Under some ordinariness assumptions, one can attach to $\rho$ a p-adic L-function. By recent results of Liu and the author, and the theory of Jetchev--Nekovar--Skinner, we deduce the following (unconditional) result under mild assumptions: if the p-adic L-function of $\rho$ vanishes to order 1 at the centre, then the Selmer group of $\rho$ has rank 1, generated by the class of an algebraic cycle. This confirms a case of the p-adic Beilinson--Bloch--Kato conjecture.</description>

Abstract: We improve recent results of D. Gomez and A. Winterhof (2010) and of A. Ostafe and I. E. Shparlinski (2011) on the Waring problem with Dickson polynomials in the case of prime finite fields. Our approach is based on recent bounds of Kloosterman and Gauss sums due to A. Ostafe, I. E. Shparlinski and J. F. Voloch (2021).</description>

      <title>Mod $\ell$ multiplicities in certain $U(4)$ Shimura varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the Taylor-Wiles-Kisin patching method to investigate the multiplicities with which Hecke eigensystems appear in the mod-$\ell$ cohomology of unitary Shimura sets, associated to central simple algebras of the form $B=M_2(D)$, for $D$ a nonsplit quaternion algebra over a $CM$ field. We follow a similar strategy to the one used in our prior work for Shimura curves, exploiting the natural self-duality in this setting. Our method requires a careful analysis of certain irreducible components of local deformation rings. We introduce and analyze a new local model for local deformation rings specific to the case of a banal prime, which is significantly better behaved than the standard local models for local deformation rings.
  Our main result is a "multiplicity $2^a$ result", in the case where quaternion algebra $D$ ramifies only at banal primes, where $a$ is the number of places in the discriminant of $D$ which satisfy a certain Galois theoretic condition. We also prove an additional statement about the endomorphism ring of the cohomology of the Shimura set, which has an application to the study of congruence modules.</description>

      <title>On the total number of ones associated with cranks of partitions modulo 11</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2021, Andrews mentioned that George Beck introduced partition statistics $M_w(r,m,n)$, which denote the total number of ones in the partition of $n$ with crank congruent to $r$ modulo $m$. Recently, a number of congruences and identities involving $M_w(r,m,n)$ for some small $m$ have been developed. We establish the 11-dissection of the generating functions for $M_{\omega}(r,11,n)-M_{\omega}(11-r,11,n)$, where $r=1,2,3,4,5$. In particular, we discover a beautiful identity involving $M_{\omega}(r,11,11n+6)$.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Steklov problem on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map encodes the voltage-to-current measurements under the influence of a magnetic field. In the case of surfaces, we provide precise spectral asymptotics expansion (up to arbitrary polynomial power) for the eigenvalues of this map. Moreover, we consider the inverse spectral problem and from the expansion we show that the spectrum of the magnetic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map, in favourable situations, uniquely determines the number and the length of boundary components, the parallel transport and the magnetic flux along boundary components. In general, we show that the situation complicates compared to the case when there is no magnetic field. For instance, there are plenty of examples where the expansion does $\textit{not}$ detect the number of boundary components, and this phenomenon is thoroughly studied in the paper.</description>

      <title>Quasipolynomial inverse theorem for the $\mathsf{U}^4(\mathbb{F}_p^n)$ norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inverse theory for Gowers uniformity norms is one of the central topics in additive combinatorics and one of the most important aspects of the theory is the question of bounds. In this paper, we prove a quasipolynomial inverse theorem for the $\mathsf{U}^4$ norm in finite vector spaces. The proof follows a different strategy compared to the existing quantitative inverse theorems. In particular, the argument relies on a novel argument, which we call the abstract Balog-Szemer\'edi-Gowers theorem, and combines several other ingredients such as algebraic regularity method, bilinear Bogolyubov argument and algebraic dependent random choice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.15252v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a certain random variable closely related to the value-distribution of the Hurwitz zeta-function with algebraic parameter. We prove a version of the limit theorem, where the limit measure is presented by the law of this random variable. Then we apply it to show that any complex number can be approximated by values of the Hurwitz zeta-function for arbitrary quadratic irrational parameters but with finite exceptions.</description>

      <title>On the functional equations of Siegel Eisenstein series of an odd prime level $p$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.10696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $p$ be an odd prime. In this paper we write down the functional equations of Siegel Eisenstein series of degree $n$, level $p$ with quadratic or trivial characters. First we study the $U(p)$ action in the space of Siegel Eisenstein series to get $U(p)$-eigen functions. Secondly we show that the functional equations for $U(p)$-eigen Eisenstein series are quite simple and easy to write down. Consequently the matrix that represents functional equations of Siegel Eisenstein series are given by the products of simple matrices.</description>

      <title>Corresponding Abelian Extensions of Integrally Equivalent Number Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09666v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extensive work has been done to determine necessary and sufficient conditions for a bijective correspondence of abelian extensions of number fields to force an isomorphism of the base fields. However, explicit examples of correspondences over non-isomorphic fields are rare. Integrally equivalent number fields admit an induced correspondence of abelian extensions. Studying this correspondence using idelic class field theory and linear algebra, we show that the corresponding extensions share features similar to those of arithmetically equivalent fields, and yet they are not generally weakly Kronecker equivalent. We also extend a group cohomological result of Arapura et. al. and present geometric and arithmetic applications.</description>

      <title>An algorithm to recognize regular singular Mahler systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.10842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of the analytic properties of Mahler systems at 0. We give an effective characterisation of Mahler systems that are regular singular at 0, that is, systems which are equivalent to constant ones. Similar characterisations already exist for differential and (q-)difference systems but they do not apply in the Mahler case. This work fills in the gap by giving an algorithm which decides whether or not a Mahler system is regular singular at 0. In particular, it gives an effective characterisation of Mahler systems to which an analog of Schlesinger's density theorem applies.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the geometry and the arithmetic of a family of polytopal sphere packings induced by regular polytopes in any dimension. We prove that every integral polytope is crystallographic, and we show that there are 11 crystallographic regular polytopes in any dimension. After introducing the notion of Apollonian section, we determine which Platonic crystallographic packings emerge as cross-sections of the Apollonian arrangements of the regular 4-polytopes. Additionally, we compute the M\"obius spectrum of every regular polytope.</description>

      <title>Topological twists of massive SQCD, Part II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the second and final part of ``Topological twists of massive SQCD''. Part I is available at arXiv:2206.08943. In this second part, we evaluate the contribution of the Coulomb branch to topological path integrals for $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric QCD with $N_f\leq 3$ massive hypermultiplets on compact four-manifolds. Our analysis includes the decoupling of hypermultiplets, the massless limit and the merging of mutually non-local singularities at the Argyres-Douglas points. We give explicit mass expansions for the four-manifolds $\mathbb{P}^2$ and $K3$. For $\mathbb{P}^2$, we find that the correlation functions are polynomial as function of the masses, while infinite series and (potential) singularities occur for $K3$. The mass dependence corresponds mathematically to the integration of the equivariant Chern class of the matter bundle over the moduli space of $Q$-fixed equations. We demonstrate that the physical partition functions agree with mathematical results on Segre numbers of instanton moduli spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16326v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quadratic residue patterns modulo a prime are studied since 19th century. In the first part we extend existing results on the number of consecutive $\ell$-tuples of quadratic residues, studying corresponding algebraic curves and their jacobians, which happen to be products of jacobians of hyperelliptic curves. In the second part we state the last unpublished result of Lydia Goncharova on squares such that their differences are also squares, reformulate it in terms of algebraic geometry of a K3 surface, and prove it. The core of this theorem is an unexpected relation between the number of points on the K3 surface and that on a CM elliptic curve.</description>

      <title>Two-point polynomial patterns in subsets of positive density in $\mathbb{R}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\gamma(t)=(P_1(t),\ldots,P_n(t))$ where $P_i$ is a real polynomial with zero constant term for each $1\leq i\leq n$. We will show the existence of the configuration $\{x,x+\gamma(t)\}$ in sets of positive density $\epsilon$ in $[0,1]^n$ with a gap estimate $t\geq \delta(\epsilon)$ when $P_i$'s are arbitrary, and in $[0,N]^n$ with a gap estimate $t\geq \delta(\epsilon)N^n$ when $P_i$'s are of distinct degrees where $\delta(\epsilon)=\exp\left(-\exp\left(c\epsilon^{-4}\right)\right)$ and $c$ only depends on $\gamma$. To prove these two results, decay estimates of certain oscillatory integral operators and Bourgain's reduction are primarily utilised. For the first result, dimension-reducing arguments are also required to handle the linear dependency. For the second one, we will prove a stronger result instead, since then an anisotropic rescaling is allowed in the proof to eliminate the dependence of the decay estimate on $N$. And as a byproduct, using the strategy token to prove the latter case, we extend the corner-type Roth theorem previously proven by the first author and Guo.</description>

Abstract: We present new expressions for the $k$-generalized Fibonacci numbers, say $F_k(n)$.
  They satisfy the recurrence $F_k(n) = F_k(n-1) +\dots+F_k(n-k)$.
  Explicit expressions for the roots of the auxiliary (or characteristic) polynomial are presented, using Fuss-Catalan numbers.
  Properties of the roots are enumerated.
  We quantify the accuracy of asymptotic approximations for $F_k(n)$ for $n\gg1$.
  Our results subsume and extend some results published by previous authors.
  We also comment on the use of multinomial sums for the $k$-generalized Fibonacci numbers and related sequences.
  We also employ the generating function to express $F_k(n)$ as a concise (non-nested) sum of binomial coefficients for arbitrary $k$.
  Finally, we present a basis (or `fundamental solutions') to solve the above recurrence for arbitrary initial conditions.</description>
