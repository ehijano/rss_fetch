      <title>Exponential Lower Bounds for 2-query Relaxed Locally Decodable Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Locally Decodable Codes (LDCs) are error-correcting codes $C\colon\Sigma^n\rightarrow \Sigma^m,$ encoding \emph{messages} in $\Sigma^n$ to \emph{codewords} in $\Sigma^m$, with super-fast decoding algorithms. They are important mathematical objects in many areas of theoretical computer science, yet the best constructions so far have codeword length $m$ that is super-polynomial in $n$, for codes with constant query complexity and constant alphabet size.
  In a very surprising result, Ben-Sasson, Goldreich, Harsha, Sudan, and Vadhan (SICOMP 2006) show how to construct a relaxed version of LDCs (RLDCs) with constant query complexity and almost linear codeword length over the binary alphabet, and used them to obtain significantly-improved constructions of Probabilistically Checkable Proofs.
  In this work, we study RLDCs in the standard Hamming-error setting. We prove an exponential lower bound on the length of Hamming RLDCs making $2$ queries (even adaptively) over the binary alphabet. This answers a question explicitly raised by Gur and Lachish (SICOMP 2021) and is the first exponential lower bound for RLDCs. Combined with the results of Ben-Sasson et al., our result exhibits a ``phase-transition''-type behavior on the codeword length for some constant-query complexity. We achieve these lower bounds via a transformation of RLDCs to standard Hamming LDCs, using a careful analysis of restrictions of message bits that fix codeword bits.</description>

      <title>Learning During Detection: Continual Learning for Neural OFDM Receivers via DMRS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been increasingly explored for receiver design because they can handle complex environments without relying on explicit channel models. Nevertheless, because communication channels change rapidly, their distributions can shift over time, often making periodic retraining necessary. This paper proposes a zero-overhead online and continual learning framework for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) neural receivers that directly detect the soft bits of received signals. Unlike conventional fine-tuning methods that rely on dedicated training intervals or full resource grids, our approach leverages existing demodulation reference signals (DMRS) to simultaneously enable signal demodulation and model adaptation. We introduce three pilot designs: fully randomized, hybrid, and additional pilots that flexibly support joint demodulation and learning. To accommodate these pilot designs, we develop two receiver architectures: (i) a parallel design that separates inference and fine-tuning for uninterrupted operation, and (ii) a forward-pass reusing design that reduces computational complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed method effectively tracks both slow and fast channel distribution variations without additional overhead, service interruption, or catastrophic performance degradation under distribution shift.</description>

      <title>On the Height Profile of Analog Error-Correcting Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent work, it has been shown that maintaining reliability in analog vector--matrix multipliers can be modeled as the following coding problem. Vectors in $\mathbb{R}^k$ are encoded into codewords of a linear $[n,k,d]$ code $C$ over $\mathbb{R}$. For prescribed positive reals $\delta &lt; \Delta$, additive errors of magnitude at most $\delta$ are tolerable and need no handling, yet outlying errors of magnitude greater than $\Delta$ are to be located or detected. The trade-off between the ratio $\Delta/\delta$ and the number of outlying errors that can be handled is determined by the height profile of $C$; as such, the height profile provides a finer description of the error handling capability of $C$, compared to the minimum distance $d$, which only determines the number of correctable errors. This work contains a further study of the notion of the height profile. Several characterizations of the height profile are presented, thereby yielding methods for computing it. The starting point is formulating this computation as an optimization problem that is solved by a set of linear programs. This, in turn, leads to a combinatorial characterization of the height profile as a maximum (or max--min) over a certain finite set of codewords of $C$. Moreover, this characterization is shown to have a simple geometric interpretation when the columns of the generator matrix of $C$ all have the same $L_2$ norm. Through examples of several code families, it is demonstrated how the results herein can be used to compute the height profile explicitly.</description>

      <title>Permutation decoding of algebraic geometry codes from Hermitian and norm-trace curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Permutation decoding is a process that utilizes the permutation automorphism group of a linear code to correct errors in received words. Given a received word, a set of automorphisms, called a PD set, moves errors out of the information positions so that the original message can be determined. In this paper, we investigate permutation decoding for certain families of algebraic geometry codes. Automorphisms of the underlying curve are used to specify permutation automorphisms of the code. Specifically, we describe permutation decoding sets that correct specific burst errors for one-point codes on Hermitian and norm-trace curves.</description>

      <title>On the Optimal Integer-Forcing Precoding: A Geometric Perspective and a Polynomial-Time Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The joint optimization of the integer matrix $\mathbf{A}$ and the power scaling matrix $\mathbf{D}$ is central to achieving the capacity-approaching performance of Integer-Forcing (IF) precoding. This problem, however, is known to be NP-hard, presenting a fundamental computational bottleneck. In this paper, we reveal that the solution space of this problem admits a intrinsic geometric structure: it can be partitioned into a finite number of conical regions, each associated with a distinct full-rank integer matrix $\mathbf{A}$. Leveraging this decomposition, we transform the NP-hard problem into a search over these regions and propose the Multi-Cone Nested Stochastic Pattern Search (MCN-SPS) algorithm. Our main theoretical result is that MCN-SPS finds a near-optimal solution with a computational complexity of $\mathcal{O}\left(K^4\log K\log_2(r_0)\right)$, which is polynomial in the number of users $K$. Numerical simulations corroborate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the algorithm's efficacy.</description>

      <title>Efficient Solvers for Coupling-Aware Beamforming in Continuous Aperture Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In continuous aperture arrays (CAPAs), careful consideration of the underlying physics is essential, among which electromagnetic (EM) mutual coupling plays a critical role in beamforming performance. Building on a physically consistent mutual coupling model, the beamforming design is formulated as a functional optimization whose optimality condition leads to a Fredholm integral equation. The incorporation of the coupling model, however, substantially increases computational complexity, necessitating efficient and accurate integral equation solvers. In this letter, we propose two efficient solvers: 1) a coordinate-transformation-based kernel approximation that preserves the operator structure while alleviating discretization demands, and 2) a direct lower-upper (LU)-based solver that stably handles the Nystr\"om-discretized system. Numerical results demonstrate improved accuracy and reduced computational overhead compared to conventional methods, with the LU-based solver emerging as an efficient and scalable solution for large-scale CAPA optimization via offline factorization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proves that any quantum t-deletion-correcting codes also correct a total of t insertion and deletion errors under a certain condition. Here, this condition is that a set of quantum states is defined as a quantum error-correcting code if the error spheres of its states are disjoint, as classical coding theory. In addition, this paper proposes the quantum indel distance and describes insertion and deletion errors correcting capability of quantum codes by this distance.</description>

      <title>Topology-Aware Integrated Communication, Sensing, and Power Transfer for SAGIN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its capability to extend communication networks from terrestrial environments to near-ground and space contexts. The application of SAGIN enables to achieve a high-quality, multi-functional, and complex communication requirements, which are essential for sixth-generation communication systems. This paper presents a topology aware (TA) framework to leverage the topological structure in SAGIN to address the multi-functional communication challenge, particularly the integrated sensing, communication, and power transfer (ISCPT) problem. To take advantage of the topological structure, we initially establish the topology according to the criteria of visibility and channel strength. The ISCPT problem can be reformulated into a topological structure as a mixed integer linear program, providing valuable insights from the objectives and constraints. Results demonstrate the superior performance of our solution compared to the benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Topology-Aware Coordination for Multi-Functional Low-Altitude Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) are expected to consist of multi-tier, heterogeneous terrestrial and non-terrestrial devices, where effective coordination is essential to fully unlock the complementary capabilities of diverse systems from different vendors. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-functional coordination framework that enables seamless cooperation within the LAWN while supporting efficient execution of diverse network functions. In the proposed architecture, each device or infrastructure element is assigned to a specific functional role, namely, edge mobile terminal (E-MT), distributed MT (D-MT), or computing center. E-MTs are equipped with lightweight, independent signal processing and computing capabilities, while D-MTs and the computing center handle regional and global coordination, respectively. To enhance the overall network efficiency, we model the LAWN as a sparse graph, where nodes represent network nodes and edges are defined according to a set of controllable connection rules. This topology-aware (TA) representation allows for efficiently solving various coordination tasks across the network. Numerical results show that the proposed TA coordination framework outperforms baseline approaches that lack topological insights, achieving higher efficiency in multi-task coordination. Finally, we discuss key technical challenges and outline potential solutions for future deployment.</description>

      <title>Delay Alignment Modulation for Secure ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces delay-alignment modulation (DAM) for secure integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). Due to the broadcast nature of multi-user downlinks, communications are vulnerable to eavesdropping. DAM applies controlled per-path symbol delays at the transmitter to coherently align the multipath components at the intended user, enhancing the received signal power, while simultaneously creating delay misalignment at the eavesdropper (Eve). To mitigate sensing degradation caused by multipath propagation, we propose a two-stage protocol that first estimates the angle and then the delay of the line-of-sight (LoS) path after suppressing multipath interference. We derive the secrecy spectral efficiency (SSE) and the Cramer-Rao (CRB) of the target delay. Finally, we develop a path-based zero-forcing (ZF) precoding framework and formulate a max-min SSE design under CRB and power constraints. Simulation results show DAM significantly outperforms the strongest-path (SP) benchmark in terms of SSE, while meeting sensing requirements, since intentional delay alignment at legitimate users degrades reception at Eve.</description>

      <title>TCDA: Robust 2D-DOA Estimation for Defective L-Shaped Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While tensor-based methods excel at Direction-of-Arrival (DOA) estimation, their performance degrades severely with faulty or sparse arrays that violate the required manifold structure. To address this challenge, we propose Tensor Completion for Defective Arrays (TCDA), a robust algorithm that reformulates the physical imperfection problem as a data recovery task within a virtual tensor space. We present a detailed derivation for constructing an incomplete third-order Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) tensor from the faulty array signals via subarray partitioning, cross-correlation, and dimensional reshaping. Leveraging the tensor's inherent low-rank structure, an Alternating Least Squares (ALS)-based algorithm directly recovers the factor matrices embedding the DOA parameters from the incomplete observations. This approach provides a software-defined 'self-healing' capability, demonstrating exceptional robustness against random element failures without requiring additional processing steps for DOA estimation.</description>

      <title>Phase-Aware Localization in Pinching Antenna Systems: CRLB Analysis and ML Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pinching antenna systems (PASS) have recently emerged as a promising architecture for high-frequency wireless communications. In this letter, we investigate localization in PASS by jointly exploiting the received signal amplitude and phase information, unlike recent works that consider only the amplitude information. A complex baseband signal model is formulated to capture free-space path loss, waveguide attenuation, and distance-dependent phase rotation between the user and each pinching antenna. Using this model, we derive the Fisher information matrix (FIM) with respect to the user location and obtain closed-form expressions for the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and the position error bound (PEB). A maximum likelihood (ML) estimator that jointly considers the received signal amplitude and phase is developed to estimate the unknown user location. Given the non-convexity of the estimation problem, a two-stage solution combining coarse grid search and Levenberg-Marquardt refinement is proposed. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed phase-aware estimator outperforms existing amplitude-only method in terms of positioning accuracy.</description>

      <title>Wireless-Fed Pinching-Antenna Systems with Horn Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pinching-antenna systems have recently emerged as a promising solution for enhancing coverage in high-frequency wireless communications by guiding signals through dielectric waveguides and radiating them via position-adjustable antennas. However, their practical deployment is fundamentally constrained by waveguide attenuation and line-installation requirements, which limit the achievable coverage range. To address this challenge, this paper investigates a wireless-fed pinching-antenna architecture that employs highly directional horn antennas to enable efficient coverage extension. Specifically, a full-duplex amplify-and-forward relay equipped with horn antennas is introduced between the base station and the waveguide input, which significantly improves the link budget in high-frequency bands while effectively eliminating self-interference. On this basis, we formulate a total power minimization problem subject to a quality-of-service constraint at the user equipment, involving the joint optimization of the pinching-antenna position, the relay amplification gain, and the base station transmit power. By exploiting the structure of the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio, the optimal pinching-antenna position is first obtained in closed form by balancing waveguide attenuation and free-space path loss. Subsequently, closed-form expressions for the optimal relay gain and transmit power are derived. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme substantially outperforms conventional systems without relaying and relay-assisted transmission with fixed antennas in terms of total power consumption.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Deep MIMO Detection:Network Architectures and Generalization Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In practical Multiuser Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MU-MIMO) systems, symbol detection remains challenging due to severe inter-user interference and sensitivity to Channel State Information (CSI) uncertainty. In contrast to the mostly studied belief propagation-type model-driven methods, which incur high computational complexity, Soft Interference Cancellation (SIC) strikes a good balance between performance and complexity. To further address CSI mismatch and nonlinear effects, the recently proposed data-driven deep neural receivers, such as DeepSIC, leverage the advantages of deep neural networks for interference cancellation and symbol detection, demonstrating strong empirical performance. However, there is still a lack of theoretical underpinning for why and to what extent DeepSIC could generalize with the number of training samples. This paper proposes inspecting the fully data-driven DeepSIC detection within a Network-of-MLPs architecture, which is composed of multiple interconnected MLPs via outer and inner Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). Within such an architecture, DeepSIC can be upgraded as a graph-based message-passing process using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), termed GNNSIC, with shared model parameters across users and iterations. Notably, GNNSIC achieves excellent expressivity comparable to DeepSIC with substantially fewer trainable parameters, resulting in improved sample efficiency and enhanced user generalization. By conducting a norm-based generalization analysis using Rademacher complexity, we reveal that an exponential dependence on the number of iterations for DeepSIC can be eliminated in GNNSIC due to parameter sharing. Simulation results demonstrate that GNNSIC attains comparable or improved Symbol Error Rate (SER) performance to DeepSIC with significantly fewer parameters and training samples.</description>

      <title>A Symplectic Proof of the Quantum Singleton Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a symplectic linear-algebraic proof of the Quantum Singleton Bound for stabiliser quantum error-correcting codes together with a Lean4 formalisation of the linear-algebraic argument. The proof is formulated in the language of finite-dimensional symplectic vector spaces modelling Pauli operators and relies on distance-based erasure correctability and the cleaning lemma. Using a dimension-counting argument within the symplectic stabiliser framework, we derive the bound \( k + 2(d - 1) \le n \) for any [[n, k, d]] stabiliser code. This approach isolates the algebraic structure underlying the bound and avoids the heavier analytic machinery that appears in entropy-based proofs, while remaining well-suited to formal verification.</description>

      <title>Sharp isoperimetric inequalities on the Hamming cube II: The critical exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A sharp isoperimetric inequality for the Hamming cube is proved at the critical exponent $\beta=\frac12$. This follows up on previous work, where such bounds were established for $\beta$ near $\frac12$. As a consequence, this result settles a conjecture of Kahn and Park on cube partitions and yields a sharp $L^1$ Poincar\'e inequality for Boolean-valued functions. It also confirms a low-noise limit for balanced functions predicted by the Hellinger conjecture on noisy Boolean channels in information theory.</description>

      <title>Standard Transformers Achieve the Minimax Rate in Nonparametric Regression with $C^{s,\lambda}$ Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tremendous success of Transformer models in fields such as large language models and computer vision necessitates a rigorous theoretical investigation. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first work proving that standard Transformers can approximate H\"older functions $ C^{s,\lambda}\left([0,1]^{d\times n}\right) $$ (s\in\mathbb{N}_{\geq0},0&lt;\lambda\leq1) $ under the $L^t$ distance ($t \in [1, \infty]$) with arbitrary precision. Building upon this approximation result, we demonstrate that standard Transformers achieve the minimax optimal rate in nonparametric regression for H\"older target functions. It is worth mentioning that, by introducing two metrics: the size tuple and the dimension vector, we provide a fine-grained characterization of Transformer structures, which facilitates future research on the generalization and optimization errors of Transformers with different structures. As intermediate results, we also derive the upper bounds for the Lipschitz constant of standard Transformers and their memorization capacity, which may be of independent interest. These findings provide theoretical justification for the powerful capabilities of Transformer models.</description>

      <title>On Channel Estimation for Group-Connected Beyond Diagonal RIS Assisted Multi-User MIMO Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) architectures offer superior beamforming gain over conventional diagonal RISs. However, the channel estimation overhead is the main hurdle for reaping the above gain in practice. This letter addresses this issue for group-connected BDRIS aided uplink communication from multiple multi-antenna users to one multi-antenna base station (BS). We first reveal that within each BD-RIS group, the cascaded channel associated with one user antenna and one BD-RIS element is a scaled version of that associated with any other user antenna and BD-RIS element due to the common RIS-BS channel. This insight drastically reduces the dimensionality of the channel estimation problem. Building on this property, we propose an efficient two-phase channel estimation protocol. In the first phase, the reference cascaded channels for all groups are estimated in parallel based on common received signals while determining the scaling coefficients for a single reference antenna. In the second phase, the scaling coefficients for all remaining user antennas are estimated. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves substantially lower estimation error with fewer pilot signals compared to state-of-the-art benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Block Coordinate Descent for Downlink Weighted Sum-rate Maximization on AI-Native Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a deep reinforcement learning-based block coordinate descent (DRL-based BCD) algorithm to address the nonconvex weighted sum-rate maximization (WSRM) problem with a total power constraint. Firstly, we present an efficient block coordinate descent (BCD) method to solve the problem. We then integrate deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques into the BCD method and propose the DRL-based BCD algorithm. This approach combines the data-driven learning capability of machine learning techniques with the navigational and decision-making characteristics of the optimization-theoretic-based BCD method. This combination significantly improves the algorithm's performance by reducing its sensitivity to initial points and mitigating the risk of entrapment in local optima. The primary advantages of the proposed DRL-based BCD algorithm lie in its ability to adhere to the constraints of the WSRM problem and significantly enhance accuracy, potentially achieving the exact optimal solution. Moreover, unlike many pure machine-learning approaches, the DRL-based BCD algorithm capitalizes on the underlying theoretical analysis of the WSRM problem's structure. This enables it to be easily trained and computationally efficient while maintaining a level of interpretability. Through numerical experiments, the DRL-based BCD algorithm demonstrates substantial advantages in effectiveness, efficiency, robustness, and interpretability for maximizing sum rates, which also provides valuable potential for designing resource-constrained AI-native wireless optimization strategies in next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Maximum entropy based testing in network models: ERGMs and constrained optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic network models play a central role across a wide range of scientific disciplines, and questions of statistical inference arise naturally in this context. In this paper we investigate goodness-of-fit and two-sample testing procedures for statistical networks based on the principle of maximum entropy (MaxEnt). Our approach formulates a constrained entropy-maximization problem on the space of networks, subject to prescribed structural constraints. The resulting test statistics are defined through the Lagrange multipliers associated with the constrained optimization problem, which, to our knowledge, is novel in the statistical networks literature.
  We establish consistency in the classical regime where the number of vertices is fixed. We then consider asymptotic regimes in which the graph size grows with the sample size, developing tests for both dense and sparse settings. In the dense case, we analyze exponential random graph models (ERGM) (including the Erd\"os-R\`enyi models), while in the sparse regime our theory applies to Erd{\"o}s-R{\`e}nyi graphs.
  Our analysis leverages recent advances in nonlinear large deviation theory for random graphs. We further show that the proposed Lagrange-multiplier framework connects naturally to classical score tests for constrained maximum likelihood estimation. The results provide a unified entropy-based framework for network model assessment across diverse growth regimes.</description>

      <title>Symbol-Aware Precoder Design for Physical-Layer Anonymous Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical-layer characteristics, such as channel state information (CSI) and transmitter noise induced by hardware impairments, are often uniquely associated with a transmitter. This paper investigates transmitter anonymity at the physical layer from a signal design perspective. We consider an anonymous communication problem where the receiver should reliably decode the signal from the transmitter but should not make use of the signal to infer the transmitter's identity.Transmitter anonymity is quantified using a Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD)-based metric, which enables the formulation of explicit anonymity constraints in the precoder design.We then propose an anonymous symbol-level precoding strategy that preserves reliable communication under spatial multiplexing while preventing transmitter identification. The proposed framework employs a partitioned equal-gain combining (P-EGC) scheme that leverages receiver diversity without requiring transmitter-specific CSI. Simulation results demonstrate anonymity-reliability tradeoffs across different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and numbers of data streams. Moreover, the results reveal opposite trends of anonymity with respect to transmitter-dependent noise variations in the low-SNR and high-SNR regimes.</description>

      <title>Cell-Free Massive MIMO-Assisted SWIPT Using Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores a next-generation multiple access (NGMA) framework for cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) systems enhanced by stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs), aiming to improve simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) performance. A fundamental challenge lies in optimally selecting the operating modes of access points (APs) to jointly maximize the received energy and satisfy spectral efficiency (SE) quality-of-service constraints. Practical system impairments, including a non-linear harvested energy model, pilot contamination (PC), channel estimation errors, and reliance on long-term statistical channel state information (CSI), are considered. We derive closed-form expressions for both the achievable SE and the average sum harvested energy (sum-HE). A mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem is formulated to jointly optimize the SIM phase shifts, APs mode selection, and power allocation to maximize average sum-HE under SE and average harvested energy constraints. To solve this problem, we propose a centralized training, decentralized execution (CTDE) framework based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which efficiently handles high-dimensional decision spaces. A Markovian environment and a normalized joint reward function are introduced to enhance the training stability across on-policy and off-policy DRL algorithms. Additionally, we provide a two-phase convex-based solution as a theoretical robust performance. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed DRL-based CTDE framework achieves SWIPT performance comparable to convexification-based solution, while significantly outperforming baselines.</description>

      <title>Optimal QAM Constellation for Over-the-Air Computation in the Presence of Heavy-Tailed Channel Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over-the-air computation (OAC) enables low-latency aggregation over multiple-access channels (MACs) by exploiting the superposition property of the wireless medium to compute functions efficiently in distributed networks. A critical but often overlooked challenge is that electromagnetic interference in practical radio channels frequently exhibits heavy-tailed behavior, causing strong impulsive noise that severely degrades computation performance. This work studies digital OAC with QAM-based signaling under heavy-tailed interference modeled by a Cauchy distribution (lacking a finite second moment). We seek QAM-like constellations that minimize the mean-squared error (MSE) of sum aggregation subject to an average-power constraint. The problem is formulated as a constrained optimization, whose solution yields unique optimality conditions. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed design. Notably, the framework extends naturally to nomographic functions, broader constellation families, and alternative noise models.</description>

      <title>On Linear Power Control Policies for Energy Harvesting Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.10230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies optimal linear power control for battery-limited energy harvesting communications. It provides a systematic analysis of linear power control policies, covering the greedy and fixed-fraction policies as special cases. Three optimality notions are introduced: the maximin optimal linear policy for a given battery capacity and mean-to-capacity ratio (MCR), and two capacity-agnostic policies that minimize the nominal additive gap and maximize the nominal multiplicative factor, respectively. Except the capacity-agnostic additive-gap optimal linear policy, which coincides with the fixed-fraction policy, the other two optimal linear policies are novel and constitute the main contributions of this paper. It is shown, among others, that the worst nominal multiplicative factor for both novel policies is approximately 0.6530, a substantial improvement over the fixed-fraction policy's value of 0.5. Simulations show that under quasi-static fading, the maximin optimal linear policy performs comparable to the maximin optimal policy (the top-performing policy), while the capacity-agnostic multiplicative-factor optimal linear policy performs slightly worse; nevertheless, both novel policies significantly outperform the fixed-fraction policy in the low-to-medium signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Moreover, this paper also investigates the optimality of the greedy policy for certain families of energy-arrival distributions, and establishes the tightest semi-universal bounds on the battery-capacity threshold for greedy optimality.</description>

      <title>Dual Domain Expurgated Error Exponents for Source Coding with Side Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an expurgation method for source coding with side information that enables direct dual-domain derivations of expurgated error exponents. Dual-domain methods yield optimization problems over few parameters, with any sub-optimal choice resulting in an achievable exponent, as opposed to primal-domain optimization over distributions. In addition, dual-domain methods naturally allow for general alphabets and/or memory. We derive two such expurgated error exponents for different random-coding ensembles in the case where the decoder is possibly mismatched with respect to the source and side information joint distribution. We show the better of the exponents coincides with the Csisz\'ar-K\"orner exponent obtained via a graph decomposition lemma. We show some numerical examples that illustrate the differences between the two exponents and show that in the case of source coding without side information, the expurgated exponent coincides with the error exponent of the source optimal code.</description>

      <title>Secure Semantic Communication over Wiretap Channels: Rate-Distortion-Equivocation Tradeoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates an information-theoretic model of secure semantic-aware communication. For this purpose, we consider the lossy joint source-channel coding (JSCC) of a memoryless semantic source transmitted over a memoryless wiretap channel. The source consists of two correlated parts that represent semantic and observed aspects of the information. Our model assumes separate fidelity and secrecy constraints on each source component and, in addition, encompasses two cases for the source output, in order to evaluate the performance gains if the encoder has an extended access to the source. Specifically, in Case 1, the encoder has direct access only to the samples from a single (observed) source component, while in Case 2 it has additional direct access to the samples of the underlaying semantic information. We derive single-letter converse and achievability bounds on the rate-distortion-equivocation region. The converse bound explicitly contains rate-distortion functions, making it easy to evaluate, especially for some common distributions. The proposed achievability coding scheme involves novel stochastic superposition coding with two private parts to enable analysis of the equivocation for each source component, separately. Our results generalise some of the previously established source and source-channel coding problems. The general results are further specialised to Gaussian and Bernoulli sources transmitted over Gaussian and binary wiretap channels, respectively. The numerical evaluations illustrate the derived bounds for these distributions.</description>

Abstract: We consider image transmission via deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) over multi-hop additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels by training a DeepJSCC encoder-decoder pair with a pre-trained deep hash distillation (DHD) module to semantically cluster images, facilitating security-oriented applications through enhanced semantic consistency and improving the perceptual reconstruction quality. We train the DeepJSCC module to both reduce mean square error (MSE) and minimize cosine distance between DHD hashes of source and reconstructed images. Significantly improved perceptual quality as a result of semantic alignment is illustrated for different multi-hop settings, for which classical DeepJSCC may suffer from noise accumulation, measured by the learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) metric.</description>

      <title>L2T-Hyena: Enhancing State-Space Models with an Adaptive Learn-to-Teach Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05926v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) have recently emerged as efficient alternatives to computationally intensive architectures such as Transformers for sequence modeling. However, their training typically relies on static loss functions, which may be suboptimal at different stages of learning. In this work, we introduce a hybrid model that integrates the Hyena architecture with a Dynamic Loss Network (DLN) under a Learning-to-Teach (L2T) paradigm, referred to as L2T-DLN. In this framework, the Hyena model serves as a student whose loss function is adapted online, while a teacher model, equipped with a memory of the student's past performance, guides the DLN to dynamically trade off the primary cross-entropy objective and a regularization term. We evaluate the proposed L2T-Hyena model on the Penn Treebank (PTB) and WikiText-103 language modeling benchmarks and compare it against both a vanilla Hyena SSM and a Transformer baseline. On PTB, our model achieves a validation perplexity of 102.6, representing a substantial improvement over the 110.5 obtained by the vanilla Hyena trained with a static loss function and 121.28 achieved by the Transformer baseline. Similar gains are observed on WikiText-103, where L2T-Hyena reaches a validation perplexity of 68.3, outperforming vanilla Hyena (73.7) and Transformer (89.8). These results indicate that coupling SSMs with adaptive loss functions can significantly enhance both the quality and efficiency of deep learning models for sequential data and hold strong promise for applications in natural language processing, time-series analysis, and biological signal processing.</description>

Abstract: Semantic communication can significantly improve bandwidth utilization in wireless systems by exploiting the meaning behind raw data. However, the advancements achieved through semantic communication are closely dependent on the development of deep learning (DL) models for joint source-channel coding (JSCC) encoder/decoder techniques, which require a large amount of data for training. To address this data-intensive nature of DL models, federated learning (FL) has been proposed to train a model in a distributed manner, where the server broadcasts the DL model to clients in the network for training with their local data. However, the conventional FL approaches suffer from catastrophic degradation when client data are from different domains. In contrast, in this paper, a novel FL framework is proposed to address this domain shift by constructing the global representation, which aligns with the local features of the clients to preserve the semantics of different data domains. In addition, the dominance problem of client domains with a large number of samples is identified and, then, addressed with a domain-aware aggregation approach. This work is the first to consider the domain shift in training the semantic communication system for the image reconstruction task. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the model-contrastive FL (MOON) framework by 0.5 for PSNR values under three domains at an SNR of 1 dB, and this gap continues to widen as the channel quality improves.</description>

      <title>Nacrith: Neural Lossless Compression via Ensemble Context Modeling and High-Precision CDF Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19626</link>

Abstract: We present Nacrith, a lossless compression system that combines a 135M-parameter transformer language model (SmolLM2-135M) with an ensemble of lightweight online predictors and a 32-bit arithmetic coder, achieving the best compression results among the systems evaluated in this study on natural language text. Beyond the base LLM-plus-arithmetic-coding paradigm, Nacrith introduces several contributions: (1) a CDF precision upgrade from 2^16 to 2^24 that eliminates ~75% of quantization overhead caused by minimum-probability floors in large vocabularies; (2) a token-level N-gram model for fast local predictions; (3) an adaptive log-space bias head correcting per-document LLM errors via online gradient descent; (4) confidence-based LLM skip for accelerating highly predictable tokens; (5) a hybrid binary format (NC06) extending neural compression to arbitrary binary files--to our knowledge a first among LLM-based compressors; (6) a llama cpp inference backend achieving ~7x faster single-token decode than PyTorch; (7) parallel multi-GPU compression across up to 8 workers; and (8) native KV cache sliding window reducing per-slide cost by ~37x. The system requires only ~500 MB of GGUF weights and ~1.2 GB VRAM per worker, running on consumer GPUs.
  On alice29 (Canterbury Corpus, 152 KB), Nacrith achieves 0.918 bits per byte (bpb)--outperforming gzip by 3.1x, bzip2 by 2.5x, CMIX v21 by 44%, and ts_zip by 20%, while compressing below the 0th-, 1st-, and 2nd-order byte-level Shannon entropy bounds. On enwik8 (100 MB), Nacrith achieves 0.9389 bpb (11.74%), surpassing ts_zip (~1.11 bpb) by 15% and FineZip (1.024 bpb) by 8% despite using a 60x smaller model with no fine-tuning. An out-of-distribution (OOD) evaluation on a document published after the model's training cutoff confirms these gains are not memorization artifacts, achieving 0.723 bpb on unseen text.</description>

      <title>Self-restricting Noise and Exponential Relative Entropy Decay Under Unital Quantum Markov Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.03745v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: States of open quantum systems often decay continuously under environmental interactions. Quantum Markov semigroups model such processes in dissipative environments. It is known that finite-dimensional quantum Markov semigroups with GNS detailed balance universally obey complete modified logarithmic Sobolev inequalities (CMLSIs), yielding exponential decay of relative entropy to a subspace of fixed point states. We analyze continuous processes that combine dissipative with Hamiltonian time-evolution, precluding this notion of detailed balance. First, we find counterexamples to CMLSI-like decay for these processes and determine conditions under which it fails. In contrast, we prove that despite its absence at early times, exponential decay re-appears for unital, finite-dimensional quantum Markov semigroups at finite timescales. Finally, we show that when dissipation is much stronger than Hamiltonian time-evolution, the rate of eventual, exponential decay toward the semigroup's decoherence-free subspace is bounded inversely in the decay rate of the dissipative part alone. Dubbed self-restricting noise, this inverse relationship arises when strong damping suppresses effects that would otherwise spread noise beyond its initial subspace.</description>

      <title>Query complexities of quantum channel discrimination and estimation: A unified approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of quantum channel discrimination and estimation is to determine the identity of an unknown channel from a discrete or continuous set, respectively. The query complexity of these tasks is equal to the minimum number of times one must call an unknown channel to identify it within a desired threshold on the error probability. In this paper, we establish lower bounds on the query complexities of channel discrimination and estimation, in both the parallel and adaptive access models. We do so by establishing new or applying known upper bounds on the squared Bures distance and symmetric logarithmic derivative Fisher information of channels. Phrasing our statements and proofs in terms of isometric extensions of quantum channels allows us to give conceptually simple proofs for both novel and known bounds. We also provide alternative proofs for several established results in an effort to present a consistent and unified framework for quantum channel discrimination and estimation, which we believe will be helpful in addressing future questions in the field.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Shuffling Beyond Pure Local Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19154v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shuffling is a powerful way to amplify privacy of a local randomizer in private distributed data analysis. Most existing analyses of how shuffling amplifies privacy are based on the pure local differential privacy (DP) parameter $\varepsilon_0$. This paper raises the question of whether $\varepsilon_0$ adequately captures the privacy amplification. For example, since the Gaussian mechanism does not satisfy pure local DP for any finite $\varepsilon_0$, does it follow that shuffling yields weak amplification? To solve this problem, we revisit the privacy blanket bound of Balle et al. (the blanket divergence) and develop a direct asymptotic analysis that bypasses $\varepsilon_0$. Our key finding is that, asymptotically, the blanket divergence depends on the local mechanism only through a single scalar parameter $\chi$ and that this dependence is monotonic. Therefore, this parameter serves as a proxy for shuffling efficiency, which we call the shuffle index. By applying this analysis to both upper and lower bounds of the shuffled mechanism's privacy profile, we obtain a band for its privacy guarantee through shuffle indices. Furthermore, we derive a simple structural, necessary and sufficient condition on the local randomizer under which this band collapses asymptotically. $k$-RR families with $k\ge3$ satisfy this condition, while for generalized Gaussian mechanisms the condition may not hold but the resulting band remains tight. Finally, we complement the asymptotic theory with an FFT-based algorithm for computing the blanket divergence at finite $n$, which offers rigorously controlled relative error and near-linear running time in $n$, providing a practical numerical analysis for shuffle DP.</description>
