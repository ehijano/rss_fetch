      <title>Synthetic areas spread in two-dimensional Superconducting Quantum Interference Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs), formed by incorporating Josephson junctions into loops of superconducting material, are the backbone of many modern quantum sensing systems. It has been demonstrated that, by combining multiple SQUID loops into a two-dimensional (2D) array, it is possible to fabricate ultra-high-performing Radio frequency sensors. However, to function as absolute magnetometers, current-in-use arrays require the area of each SQUID loop in the array to be incommensurate and, in turn, forbid the achievement of their full potential in terms of quantum-limited performances. This is because imposing incommensurability in the areas contrasts with optimised performance in each single SQUID loop. In this work, we report that by selectively inserting bare sections of a superconducting circuit with no Josephson junctions, 2D SQUID arrays can operate as an absolute magnetometer even when no physical area spread is applied. Based on a generalisation of current available theories, a complete analytical formulation for the one-to-one correspondence between the distribution of these bare loops and what we call a synthetic area spread is unveiled. This synthetic spread represents the equivalent physical spread of incommensurate SQUID loops that you will use to obtain the absolute Voltage-Magnetic Flux response if no bare loops were in use. Our work opens the way to a broader use of this technology for the fabrication of ultra-high-performance absolute quantum sensors. Our approach is also experimentally verified by fabricating several 2D SQUID arrays incorporating bare superconducting loops and by demonstrating that they behave in alignment with what is suggested by our theory.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Investigation of rf Vortex Nucleation in Nb3Sn Films Using a Near-Field Magnetic Microwave Microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a near-field magnetic microwave microscope to investigate and compare rf vortex nucleation in two superconducting radio-frequency (SRF)-quality Nb3Sn films fabricated by different methods: a conventional vapor-diffused film and an electrochemically plated film followed by thermal annealing, both of which are deposited on Nb substrates. The microscope applies a localized rf magnetic field to the sample surface and measures the resulting third-harmonic response P3f, which is particularly sensitive to rf vortex nucleation triggered by surface defects. Both Nb3Sn films exhibit nontrivial P3f(T) structures below 7 K that display the key signatures associated with rf vortex nucleation at local defects. The electrochemical film additionally shows multiple P3f(T) structures between 14 K and 16 K that are absent in the vapor-diffused sample. Our results highlight the influence of fabrication method on rf vortex penetration properties and demonstrate the utility of third-harmonic response as a local diagnostic tool for surface defects in Nb3Sn films.</description>

      <title>Identifying the structure of La3Ni2O7 in the pressurized superconducting state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise crystal structure of La3Ni2O7 in its high-pressure superconducting state has been a subject of intense debate, with proposed models including both orthorhombic and tetragonal symmetries. Using high-pressure Raman spectroscopy combined with frst-principles calculations, we unravel the structural evolution of La3Ni2O7 under pressure up to 32.7 GPa. We identify a clear structural transition sequence: from the orthorhombic Amam phase to a mixed Amam+Fmmm phase at 4 GPa, followed by a complete transition to the tetragonal I4/mmm phase at 14.5 GPa, which is signaled by a pronounced phonon renormalization. The emergence of bulk superconductivity is found to coincide precisely with this transition to the I4/mmm phase. Our results de nitively establish the tetragonal I4/mmm structure as the host of superconductivity in La3Ni2O7, resolving a central controversy and providing a critical foundation for understanding the superconducting mechanism in nickelates.</description>

      <title>Tuning Bound States of Symmetry-Breaking Vortices via Unidirectional Charge Density Wave in a Transition-Metal Dichalcogenide Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between charge density wave (CDW) and superconducting vortex bound states are crucial for fundamental physics of superconductivity and advancing quantum nanotechnologies. However, the CDW-mediated modulation of vortex bound states, which opens up a new platform for vortex engineering, remains unexplored. Here, we report spatially anisotropic vortex states modulated by the unidirectional CDWs in a transition-metal dichalcogenide superconductor 1T''-NbTe2 using ultra-low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy. The stripe-like 3x1x3 CDW order exhibits a robust three-dimensional character across step edges and coexists with superconductivity below a critical temperature of 0.4 K. Under out-of-plane magnetic fields, we observe elliptical vortices whose elongation aligns with the CDW stripes, indicating strong coupling between vortex morphology and underlying electronic order. Remarkably, CDW domain boundaries induce abrupt changes in vortex orientation and vortex bound states, enabling controllable vortex states across CDW nanodomains. These findings establish a new pathway for manipulating superconducting vortex bound states via CDW coupling.</description>

      <title>Interplay of spin-orbit coupling and trigonal crystal field enhances superconductivity in $LaAlO_3/KTaO_3$ (111)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In conventional superconductors, bulk physical properties typically degrade as the film thickness approaches the two-dimensional (2D) limit. Here in the (111) oriented LaAlO3/KTaO3 (LAO/KTO) heterostructure, we demonstrate experimental evidence that reducing the conducting layer thickness at the interface significantly enhances superconducting transition temperature Tc, in direct contrast to conventional wisdom. From the sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy and superconducting upper-critical field measurements, both the trigonal symmetry and spin orbit scattering are enhanced with the increased Tc. We attribute the enhanced superconductivity (SC) to the synergic interplay between spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and trigonal crystal field, resulting in an enhanced electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, we show the existence of unconventional SC: the approaching linear temperature dependence of normal state resistance with increasing Tc and the existence of a quantum critical point (QCP) near the superconducting phase. Our findings provide important insight into the underlying mechanism of the strong orientation-dependent KTO interface SC.</description>

      <title>Atomic Visualization of Bulk and Surface Superconductivity in Weyl Semimetal {\gamma}-PtBi2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A bulk superconductor hosting intrinsic surface superconductivity provides a unique platform to study Majorana bound states. The superconductor, trigonal {\gamma}-PtBi2, is a promising candidate, as surface superconducting gaps and topological surface states have been observed. However, the simultaneous presence of bulk and surface superconductivity has not been resolved. Here, we directly visualize coexisting bulk and surface superconducting gaps in trigonal PtBi2 by using ultra-low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy. The bulk gap is {\Delta} ~ 0.053 meV with a critical temperature (Tc) ~ 0.5 K and a critical field below 0.01 T, accompanied by a vortex lattice and bound states, yielding a coherence length of ~200 nm. Remarkably, certain surface regions show a much larger gap of {\Delta} ~ 0.42 meV, persisting up to Tc ~ 3 K and surviving magnetic fields up to 2 T, yet lacking a static vortex lattice. This coexistence of robust surface and bulk superconductivity establishes {\gamma}-PtBi2 as a unique platform for investigating the interplay between bulk and surface Cooper pairings in superconducting topological materials.</description>

      <title>Recent progress of scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy study of pair density wave in superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A pair density wave (PDW) is a superconducting state characterized by an order parameter with finite center-of-mass momentum in the absence of an external magnetic field, thereby breaking the conventional translational symmetry in homogeneous superconductors. It is proposed that PDW emerges from magnetic interactions, strong electron-electron correlations, and their interplay with competing orders. In this review, we highlight recent advances in the detection and study of PDWs using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS). We focus on how the signatures of PDW have been experimentally visualized across a variety of extraordinary superconductors, including iron-based superconductors, cuprate superconductors, spin-triplet superconductors, kagome-lattice superconductors, and transition metal dichalcogenides. Beginning with an introduction to the fundamental concept of PDWs and the unique capabilities of STM/STS, particularly its atomic-scale spatial resolution and advanced data analysis techniques, we discuss key experimental findings, including the direct visualization of charge density modulations associated with PDWs. Finally, we discuss emerging challenges and future directions, aiming to inspire future research into the nature of PDWs in superconductors.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e-induced gapped phases in twisted nodal superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the emergence of gapped phases driven by the moir\'{e} superlattice that trivialize the topological states in twisted nodal superconductors. The effect arises from umklapp tunneling between non-adjacent Dirac points in momentum space close to specific twist angles or chemical potentials, determined by the Fermi surface geometry. We confirm the robustness of the non-topological phase against interactions with self-consistent calculations and show that this gap competes with the previously predicted topological gapped phases, leading to topological phase transitions. These transitions were overlooked in prior literature, signifying the necessity of modifying the phase diagrams of topological phases exhibited in twisted nodal superconductors with and without an interlayer current. We also estimate the relevant twist angles and discuss experimental signatures, focusing on twisted Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$</description>

      <title>Origin of metal-insulator transition in rare-earth Nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare-earth nickelates RNiO3 (R=rare-earth element) exhibit three kinds of phase transitions with decreasing temperature: a structural transition from a pseudo-cubic to a monoclinic phase, a metal- insulator transition (MIT), and a magnetic transition from a paramagnetic state to an ordered one. The first two occur at the same temperature, which has led to a consensus that the MIT is driven by lattice distortions. We show here that the primary driving force for the MIT is magnetic; however because of the unusual d7 configuration of Ni, additional flexibility in spin configurations are also needed which symmetry-lowing structural deformations make possible. The latter enable Ni to disproportionate into two kinds: a high-spin and a low-spin configuration, which allow the system to reduce its unfavorable orbital moment and also open a gap.</description>

      <title>Evolution of correlated electronic states of La2NiO4 under hydrostatic pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We elucidate the electronic structure and quantum many-body instabilities of the monolayer nickelate La2NiO4 under hydrostatic pressure using a combination of density functional theory, dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT), and random phase approximation (RPA). Our DFT+DMFT calculations reveal non-Fermi-liquid behavior and coherence loss near the Fermi level at low pressures, driven by strong electron correlations within the Ni-e_g orbital manifold, which is analogous to the low-energy electronic properties observed in La3Ni2O7. However, multi-orbital spin susceptibility analysis demonstrates an exceptionally suppressed critical Stoner parameter U_c (about 0.4~0.7 eV), indicating robust magnetic order that dominates the ground state and precludes superconductivity in the pristine system. Below U_c, superconducting instabilities exhibit a pressure-driven symmetry transition: the d_(x2-y2)-wave pairing prevails at ambient and low pressure, while the s+g-wave symmetry occurs above 75 GPa. This transition is attributed to pressure-induced self-doping effect. The high-angular-momentum g-wave component incurs significant energetic penalties, rendering high-Tc superconductivity unlikely. We conclude that the absence of superconductivity in La2NiO4 arises from its robust intrinsic magnetism and the unfavorable pairing symmetry under pressure, suggesting that alternative routes-such as chemical doping or epitaxial strain-are necessary to suppress magnetism and unlock superconducting states.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of non-local magic in a superconducting quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magic is a non-classical resource whose efficient manipulation is fundamental to advancing efficient and scalable fault-tolerant quantum computing. Quantum advantage is possible only if both magic and entanglement are present. Of particular interest is non-local magic- the fraction of the resource that cannot be distilled (or erased) by local unitary operations - which is a necessary feature for quantum complex behavior. We perform the first experimental demonstration of non-local magic in a superconducting Quantum Processing Unit (QPU). Direct access to the QPU device enables us to identify and characterize the dominant noise mechanisms intrinsic to the quantum hardware. We observe excellent agreement between theory and experiment without the need for any free parameter in the noise modeling of our system and shows the experimental capability of harnessing both local and non-local magic resources separately, thereby offering a promising path towards more reliable pre-fault-tolerant quantum devices and to advance hardware-aware research in quantum information in the near term. Finally, the methods and tools developed in this work are conducive to the experimental realization of efficient purity estimation (featuring exponential speedup) and the decoding of Hawking radiation from a toy-model of a Black Hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a numerical strategy to efficiently solve the out-of-equilibrium Dyson equation in the transient regime. By discretizing the equation into a compact matrix form and applying state-of-the-art matrix compression techniques, we achieve significant improvements in computational efficiency, which result in quasi-linear scaling of both time and space complexity with propagation time. This enables to compute accurate solutions even for systems with multiple and disparate time scales. We benchmark our solver by simulating a voltage-biased Josephson junction formed by a quantum dot connected to two superconducting leads.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous $\pi$ flux trapping in granular rings of unconventional superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Josephson couplings in unconventional superconductors and generalize the Sigrist-Rice formula by incorporating symmetry constraints and interface orientation disorder. Applying this framework to granular superconducting rings, we establish a no-go result that single-band chiral superconductors cannot spontaneously trap a magnetic flux. This rules out chiral $p$-wave pairing in $\beta$-Bi$_2$Pd, in light of the half-quantum flux observed in recent Little-Parks experiments. Incorporating the full crystalline and time-reversal symmetries, we show that a fully gapped helical equal-spin pairing state, naturally stabilized by spin-orbit coupling arising from local inversion-symmetry breaking, is instead favored. We further find that granular rings of such superconductors can trap a spontaneous $\pi$ flux in a manner robust against interface disorder.</description>
