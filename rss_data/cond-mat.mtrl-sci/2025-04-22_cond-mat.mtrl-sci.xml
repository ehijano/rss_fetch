      <title>Strain engineering of doped hydrogen passivated silicon quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon quantum dots are nanomaterials that are attractive candidates for photovoltaic applications. Doping of these materials creates p-n junctions and is important for solar cells. In this work, we present a first-principles study of the coupled influence of doping and strain on the stability, energy gap, Fermi level, electronic density, and density of states of hydrogen-passivated silicon quantum dots. We find that the cohesive energy and the energy gap decrease with increasing quantum dot size and are strongly influenced by strain. Furthermore, the response to strain also depends on the size of the quantum dot and dopant type. We present expressions of cohesive energy and energy gap as power-law of size and polynomial dependence on strain. We also show that the Fermi energy increases with size for pristine and p-type doping but decreases with size for n-type doping. We also discuss the influence of strain and dopant type on the density of states and electron density of the quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Nernst power factor and figure of merit in compensated semimetal ScSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, topological semimetals have emerged as strong candidates for solid state thermomagnetic refrigerators due to their enhanced Nernst effect. This enhancement arises from the combined contributions of the Berry curvature induced anomalous Nernst coefficient associated with topological bands and the normal Nernst effect resulting from synergistic electron-hole compensation. Generally, these two effects are intertwined in topological semimetals, making it challenging to evaluate them independently. Here, we report the observation of high Nernst effect in the electron hole compensated semimetal ScSb with topologically trivial electronic band structures. Remarkably, we find a high maximum Nernst power factor of $PF_N \sim 35 \times 10^{-4}$ W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-2}$ in ScSb. The Nernst thermopower ($S_{xy}$) exhibits a peak of $\sim$ 47 $\mu$V/K at 12 K and 14 T, yielding a Nernst figure of merit ($z_N$) of $\sim 28 \times 10^{-4}$ K$^{-1}$. Notably, despite its trivial electronic band structure, both the $PF_N$ and $z_N$ values of ScSb are comparable to those observed in topological semimetals with Dirac band dispersions. The origin of the large Nernst signal in ScSb is explained by well compensated electron and hole carriers, through Hall resistivity measurements, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.</description>

      <title>The case of the missing gallium vacancy in gallium arsenide: A multiscale explanation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Irradiation of gallium arsenide (GaAs) produces immobile vacancies and mobile interstitials. However, after decades of experimental investigation, the immobile Ga vacancy eludes observation, raising the question: Where is the Ga vacancy? Static first-principles calculations predict a Ga vacancy should be readily observed. We find that short-time dynamical evolution of primary defects is key to explaining this conundrum. Introducing a multiscale Atomistically Informed Device Engineering (AIDE) method, we discover that during the initial displacement damage, the Fermi level shifts to mid-gap producing oppositely charged vacancies and interstitials. Driven by Coulomb attraction, fast As interstitials preferentially annihilate Ga vacancies, causing their population to plummet below detectable limits before being experimentally observed. This innovative model solves the mystery of the missing Ga vacancy and reveals the importance of a multiscale approach to explore the dynamical chemical behavior in experimentally inaccessible short-time regimes.</description>

      <title>Orientation-Adaptive Virtual Imaging of Defects using EBSD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: EBSD is a foundational technique for characterizing crystallographic orientation, phase distribution, and lattice strain. Embedded within EBSD patterns lies latent information on dislocation structures, subtly encoded due to their deviation from perfect crystallinity - a feature often underutilized. Here, a novel framework termed orientation-adaptive virtual apertures (OAVA) is introduced. OAVAs enable the generation of virtual images tied to specific diffraction conditions, allowing the direct visualization of individual dislocations from a single EBSD map. By dynamically aligning virtual apertures in reciprocal space with the local crystallographic orientation, the method enhances contrast from defect-related strain fields, mirroring the principles of diffraction-contrast imaging in TEM, but without sample tilting. The approach capitalizes on the extensive diffraction space captured in a single high-quality EBSD scan, with its effectiveness enhanced by modern direct electron detectors that offer high-sensitivity at low accelerating voltages, reducing interaction volume and improving spatial resolution. We demonstrate that using OAVAs, identical imaging conditions can be applied across a polycrystalline field-of-view, enabling uniform contrast in differently oriented grains. Furthermore, in single-crystal GaN, threading dislocations are consistently resolved. Algorithms for the automated detection of dislocation contrast are presented, advancing defect characterization. By using OAVAs across a wide range of diffraction conditions in GaN, the visibility/invisibility of defects, owing to the anisotropy of the elastic strain field, is assessed and linked to candidate Burgers vectors. Altogether, OAVA offers a new and high-throughput pathway for orientation-specific defect characterization with the potential for automated, large-area defect analysis in single and polycrystalline materials.</description>

      <title>Transition from positive to negative photoconductivity in AlGaN/GaN quantum-well heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The AlGaN/GaN quantum-well heterostructures typically exhibit a positive photoconductivity (PPC) during the light illumination. Surprisingly, we found that introducing the GaN/AlN superlattice (SL) back barrier into N-polar AlGaN/GaN quantum-well heterostructures induces a transition in these heterostructures from PPC to negativie photoconductivity (NPC) as the SL period number increased at room temperature. This transition occurred under an infrared light illumination and can be well explained in terms of the excitation of hot electrons from the two-dimensional electron gas and subsequent trapping them in a SL structure. The NPC effect observed in N-polar AlGaN/GaN heterostructures with SL back barrier exhibits photoconductivity yield exceeding 85 % and thus is the largest ones reported so far for semiconductors. In addition, NPC signal remains relatively stable at high temperatures up to 400 K. The obtained results can be interesting for the development of NPC related devices such as photoelectric logic gates, photoelectronic memory and infrared photodetectors.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Ultrashort Orbital Transport in Heavy Metals Revealed by Terahertz Emission Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orbital angular momentum of electrons offers a promising, yet largely unexplored, degree of freedom for ultrafast, energy-efficient information processing. As the foundation of orbitronics, understanding how orbital currents propagate and convert into charge currents is essential - but remains elusive due to the challenge in disentangling orbital and spin dynamics in ultrathin films. Although orbital currents have been predicted to propagate over long distances in materials, recent theoretical studies argue that lattice symmetry may constrain their mean free paths (MFPs) to the scale of a single atomic layer. In this work, we provide the first direct experimental evidence for ultrashort orbital MFPs in heavy metals (HMs) - W, Ta, Pt - revealed by femtosecond terahertz emission spectroscopy. This is enabled by sub-nanometer-precision control of thin-film thickness using wedge-shaped HM|Ni heterostructures. By employing a multi-component terahertz-emission model, we quantitatively extract the orbital MFPs, consistently finding them shorter than their spin counterparts. Furthermore, control experiments rule out interfacial orbital-to-charge conversion as the dominant mechanism, confirming that the process is governed by the bulk inverse orbital Hall effect. Our findings resolve a central controversy in orbitronics and provide key insights into orbital transport and conversion mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Designing Optimal Distorted-Octahedra Superlattices for Strong Topological Hall Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topologically protected spin states hold great promise for applications in next generation of memory circuits and spintronic devices. These intriguing textures typically emerge in bulk materials or heterostructures with broken inversion symmetry, accompanied by an enhanced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). In this study, we successfully induced the topological Hall effect (THE) in atomically designed (DyScO3)n/(SrRuO3)n (DnSn) superlattices over a significant range of temperatures (10~120K) and thicknesses (16~40nm). Using magnetic force microscopy (MFM), we observed the formation and stability of magnetic domains, such as topological skyrmions. By precisely controlling the interlayer thickness (n) and biaxial strain, we elucidated the mechanisms underlying the modulation and induction of magnetic topological states. Supporting evidence was provided by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), thereby lending further credence to our conclusions. These heterostructures offer a universal method for exploring topological phenomena driven by distorted octahedra, while enhancing the integrability and addressability of topologically protected functional devices.</description>

      <title>Spin-dependent electronic transport in NiMnSb/MoS2(001)/NiMnSb magnetic tunnel junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Half-metallic Heusler alloy compounds with Curie temperatures above room temperature are suitable candidate electrode materials for injecting large spin-polarised charge carriers into the semiconducting barriers at the ferromagnet semiconductor junction to obtain highly spin-polarised current. Combining the density functional theory and non-equilibrium Green's function method, the electronic structure, spin dependent electron transport in NiMnSb/MoS2(001)/NiMnSb is studied. The possibilities of injecting 100% spin-polarised electron into MoS2 using half metallic NiMnSb as an electrode, the layer dependent, and the effect of the type of interface on electronic structure and spin-transport properties in magnetic tunnel junction devices are studied. We show that the half-metallicity of NiMnSb(111) is preserved at the interface between the half-Heusler alloy NiMnSb and MoS2. NiMnSb keeps a fully spin-polarised state in the majority spin channel at the interface between NiMnSb and MoS2, injecting fully spin-polarised electrons into the semiconductor. The device based on NiMnSb/MoS2(single layer)/NiMnSb has a metallic interface. Metal-induced states in the spin-majority channel of MoS2 are seen after making an interface with half metallic NiMnSb. In contrast, the NiMnSb/MoS2(three layers)/NiMnSb interface with a multilayer of MoS2 has a band gap region, and electrons can tunnel through the junction. The Mn-S interface is more conducting than the Sb-S interface due to the strong bonding of Mn and S atoms at the Mn-S interface.</description>

      <title>Designing cobalt-free face-centered cubic high-entropy alloys: A strategy using d-orbital energy level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are promising materials for high-temperature structural applications such as nuclear reactors due to their outstanding mechanical properties and thermal stability. Instead of the trial-and-error method, it is efficient to design and prepare single-phase face-centered cubic (FCC) structured HEAs using semi-empirical phase formation rules. However, almost all of phase formation rules were proposed without taking into account the cobalt-free situation. The HEAs containing cobalt are unsuitable for nuclear applications because of the long-term activation of cobalt. Here, six parameters, d-orbital energy level, valance electron concentration, entropy of mixing, enthalpy of mixing, atom size differences, and parameter of the entropy of mixing ({\Omega}) were calculated to determine the solid solution phase, especially the FCC phase formation rules in cobalt-free HEAs. HEAs of 4 components were arc melted to verify the newly developed phase formation rules. The nanomechanical properties of produced HEAs were evaluated using nanoindentation. Among the six parameters, the d-orbital energy level and valance electron concentration are the critical factors that determine the FCC phase stability in cobalt-free alloys. Interestingly, the d-orbital energy level can be alone used as a benchmark for developing mechanical properties.</description>

      <title>Original mechanism of transformation from soft metallic (sp2/sp3) C12 to ultra-dense and ultra-hard (sp3) semi-conducting C12: Crystal chemistry and DFT characterizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An original mechanism is proposed for a pressure-induced transformation of orthorhombic C12 from ground state normal pressure (NP) sp2/sp3 allotrope to ultra-dense and ultra-hard HP sp3 form. Upon volume decrease, the trigonal C=C parallel segments characterizing glitter-like tfi topology of NP C12 change to crossing C-C segments with the loss of sp2 character accompanied by a large densification with density=3.64 g/cm3, larger than diamond, defining a novel orthorhombic HP C12 with 44T39 topology. The crystal chemistry engineering backed with quantum density functional theory DFT-based calculations let determine the ground state structures and energy derived physical properties. Furthering on that, the E(V) equations of states (EOS) let define the equilibrium NP(E0,V0) allotrope at lower energy and higher volume versus HP(E0, V0) allotrope at higher energy and smaller volume. A potential pressure induced transformation NP to HP was estimated at ~100 GPa, reachable with a diamond anvil cell DAC. Both allotropes were found cohesive and mechanically stable with low and large Vickers hardness magnitudes: HV(tfi C12) =24 GPa and HV(44T39 C12) =90 GPa; the latter being close to diamond hardness (HV ~95 GPa). Besides, both allotropes were found dynamically stable with positive phonon frequencies and a spectroscopic signature of C=C high frequency bands in tfi C12. The electronic band structures show metallic behavior for NP tfi C12 and a small band gap for HP 44T39 C12 letting assign semiconducting properties. The work is meant to open further the scope of C(sp2)and C(sp3) transformation mechanisms that are fundamental in solid state physics and chemistry.</description>

      <title>Domain-wall driven suppression of thermal conductivity in a ferroelectric polycrystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common strategy for reducing thermal conductivity of polycrystalline systems is to increase the number of grain boundaries. Indeed, grain boundaries enhance the probability of phonon scattering events, which has been applied to control the thermal transport in a wide range of materials, including hard metals, diamond, oxides and 2D systems such as graphene. Here, we report the opposite behavior in improper ferroelectric ErMnO3 polycrystals, where the thermal conductivity decreases with increasing grain size. We attribute this unusual relationship between heat transport and microstructure to phonon scattering at ferroelectric domain walls. The domain walls are more densely packed in larger grains, leading to an inversion of the classical grain-boundary-dominated transport behavior. Our findings open additional avenues for microstructural engineering of materials for thermoelectric and thermal management applications, enabling simultaneous control over mechanical, electronic, and thermal properties.</description>

      <title>Entropy Stabilized ZrHfCoNiSnSb Half-Heusler Alloy for Thermoelectric Applications: A Theoretical Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Half-Heusler (HH) alloys are potential thermoelectric materials for use at elevated temperatures due to their high Seebeck coefficient and superior mechanical and thermal stability. However, their enhanced lattice thermal conductivity is detrimental to thermoelectric applications. One way to circumvent this problem is to introduce mass disorder at lattice sites by mixing the components of two or more alloys. Such systems are typically stabilized by the entropy of mixing. In this work, using computational tools, we propose a mixed HH, namely, ZrHfCoNiSnSb, which can be formed by the elemental compositions of the parent half-Heuslers ZrNiSn/HfNiSn and HfCoSb/ZrCoSb. We propose that this new compound can be synthesized at elevated temperatures, as its Gibbs free energy is reduced due to higher configurational entropy, making it more thermodynamically stable than the parent compounds under such conditions. Our calculations indicate that it is a dynamically stable semiconductor with a band gap of 0.61 eV. Its lattice thermal conductivity at room temperature is $5.39~\text{Wm}^{-1}\text{K}^{-1}$, which is significantly lower than those of the parent compounds. The peak value of this alloy's figure of merit (ZT) is 1.00 for the n-type carriers at 1100 K, which is 27% more than the best figure of merit obtained for the parent compounds.</description>

      <title>From Spin Waves to Monte Carlo Simulations: Compiling an Experimental Exchange Interaction Dataset for Magnetic Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inelastic neutron scattering data on magnetic crystals are highly valuable in materials science, as they provide direct insight into microscopic magnetic interactions. Using spin wave theory, these interactions can be extracted from magnetic excitations observed in such experiments. However, these datasets are often scattered across the literature and lack standardization, limiting their accessibility and usability. In this paper, we compile and standardize Heisenberg exchange interaction data for magnetic materials obtained from inelastic neutron scattering experiments. Through an extensive literature review, we identify experimental data for approximately 100 magnetic materials. The standardized dataset includes mapping the results of various Heisenberg Hamiltonians into a unified standard form, visualizations of crystal structures with annotated exchange interactions, and input and output files from Monte Carlo simulations performed for each compound using the ESpinS code. Using experimentally determined exchange interactions, we calculate transition temperatures $T_c$ via classical Monte Carlo simulations. Additionally, we assess the effectiveness of the $S+1)/S$ correction within classical Monte Carlo simulations, finding that it produces transition temperatures in excellent agreement with experimental values in most cases. The complete dataset, along with supporting resources, is publicly available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Instability of oxide perovskite surfaces induced by vacancy formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a first principles study of the (001) surface energetics of nine oxide perovskites, with a focus on the role of surface vacancies in determining termination stability. Additionally, investigation into the behaviour of vacancies as a function of depth from the surface in these perovskites, ABO$_{3}$ (A=Ca, Sr, Ba; B=Ti, Zr, Sn), is carried out, and results are compared to formation of the vacancies in bulk. Combining results from these investigations reveals a general trend for all nine perovskites - the undefected AO surface is more energetically favourable to form than the BO2 surface. This dominance of the AO over the BO2 surface is further enforced by the phase diagrams of perovskite surfaces. However, A-site vacancies at the AO surface are far more favourable (1-2 eV lower in energy) than B-site vacancies at the BO2 surface. Charged vacancies only drive this further under oxygen-rich conditions, showing a smaller range of stability for the AO than the BO2 surface. These results indicates that, whilst the AO surface is easier to form, the BO2 surface will display better long term stability, making it more suitable for use in potential applications. This study furthers the understanding of oxide perovskite (001)-terminated surface stability, which will aid in surface growth and manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Improving robustness and training efficiency of machine-learned potentials by incorporating short-range empirical potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) are powerful tools for materials modeling, but their performance is often limited by training dataset quality, particularly the lack of rare event configurations. This limitation undermines their accuracy and robustness in long-time and large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. In this work, we present a hybrid MLFF framework that integrates an empirical short-range repulsive potential and demonstrates improved robustness and training efficiency. Using solid electrolyte Li$_7$La$_3$Zr$_2$O$_{12}$ (LLZO) as a model system, we show that purely data-driven MLFFs fail to prevent unphysical atomistic clustering in extended simulations due to inadequate short-range repulsion. In contrast, the hybrid force field eliminates these artifacts, enabling stable long-time simulations, which are critical for studying various properties of LLZO. The hybrid framework also reduces the need for extensive active learning and performs well with just 25 training configurations. By combining physics-driven constraints with data-driven flexibility, this approach is compatible with most existing MLFF architectures and establishes a universal paradigm for developing robust, training-efficient force fields for complex material systems.</description>

      <title>ErMn$_6$Sn$_6$: A Promising Kagome Antiferromagnetic Candidate for Room-Temperature Nernst Effect-based thermoelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Nernst effect, the generation of a transverse electric voltage in the presence of longitudinal thermal gradient, has garnered significant attention in the realm of magnetic topological materials due to its superior potential for thermoelectric applications. In this work, we investigate electronic and thermoelectric transport properties of a Kagome magnet ErMn$_6$Sn$_6$, a compound showing an incommensurate antiferromagnetic phase followed by a ferrimagnetic phase transition upon cooling. We show that in the antiferromagnetic phase ErMn$_6$Sn$_6$ exhibits both topological Nernst effect and anomalous Nernst effect, analogous to the electric Hall effects, with the Nernst coefficient reaching 1.71 uV/K at 300 K and 3 T. This value surpasses that of most of previously reported state-of-the-art canted antiferromagnetic materials and is comparable to recently reported other members of RMn$_6$Sn$_6$ (R = rare-earth, Y, Lu, Sc) compounds, which makes ErMn$_6$Sn$_6$ a promising candidate for advancing the development of Nernst effect-based thermoelectric devices.</description>

      <title>Full Crystallographic Imaging of Hexagonal Boron Nitride Monolayers with Phonon-Enhanced Sum-Frequency Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is an important 2D material for van der Waals heterostructures, single photon emitters, and infrared nanophotonics. The optical characterization of mono- and few-layer samples of hBN however remains a challenge as the material is almost invisible optically. Here we introduce phase-resolved sum-frequency microscopy as a technique for imaging monolayers of hBN grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and visualize their crystal orientation. A combination of femtosecond mid-infrared (IR) and visible laser pulses is used for sum-frequency generation (SFG), which is imaged in a wide-field optical microscope. The IR laser resonantly excites a phonon of hBN that leads to an ~800-fold enhancement of the SFG intensity, making it possible to image large 100x100 {\mu}m2 sample areas in less than 1 s. Implementing heterodyne detection in combination with azimuthal rotation of the sample further provides full crystallographic information. Through combined knowledge of topography and crystal orientation, we find that triangular domains of CVD-grown monolayer hBN have nitrogen-terminated zigzag edges. Overall, SFG microscopy can be used as an ultra-sensitive tool to image crystal structure, strain, stacking sequences, and twist angles, and is applicable to the wide range of van der Waals structures, where location and identification of monolayer regions and interfaces with broken inversion symmetry is of paramount importance.</description>

      <title>Ge$_{1-x}$Si$_{x}$ single crystals for Ge hole spin qubit integration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin qubits are fundamental building blocks of modern quantum computing devices. The path of Ge-based hole-spin qubits has several advantages over Si-based electron-spin systems, such as the absence of valley band degeneracy, the possibility of efficient field control due to large spin-orbit coupling, and smaller effective masses. Among the possible Ge qubit devices, Ge/GeSi planar heterostructures have proven to be favourable for upscaling and fabrication. The Si concentration of the straining GeSi buffer serves as an important tuning parameter for the electronic structure of Ge/GeSi qubits. A particularly low Si concentration of x = 0.15 of the Ge$_{0.85}$Si$_{0.15}$ crystal should enable minimal lattice strain for spin qubit heterostructures, which is difficult to stabilize as a random alloy. We present a synchrotron-based study to investigate the chemical composition, valence band electronic structure and local atomic structure of a Ge$_{0.85}$Si$_{0.15}$ single crystal using the advanced combination of hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES), hard X-ray momentum microscopy (HarMoMic) and X-ray photoelectron diffraction (XPD). We found that the Ge$_{0.85}$Si$_{0.15}$ crystal has an individual, uniform valence band structure, with no signs of phase separation. The shapes of the valence bands resemble those of pure Ge, as do the low effective masses. XPD experiments and Bloch wave calculations, show the Si atoms located at Ge lattice sites within the crystal, forming a random alloy. This high chemical, electronic and structural quality of Ge$_{0.85}$Si$_{0.15}$ single-crystal substrates is of crucial importance for their implementation to enable long spin lifetimes in Ge-based hole-spin qubits. The results emphasise the power of combined X-ray spectromicroscopy techniques, which provide key insights into the qubit building blocks that form the basis of quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Thermal rectification and phonon properties in partially perforated graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a thermal rectification ratio $\eta$ of 18.5% was observed in partially perforated graphene with the use of Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. In all cases studied here, heat preferentially flows from the porous to the pristine region and both $\kappa$ and $\eta$ increase upon increasing the length of the pristine region and upon decreasing the size of the pores. To interpret the results, the macroscopic "R-Series Model" is applied, attributing rectification to the different temperature dependence of $\kappa$ of perforated and pristine graphene. According to the model, $\eta$ is maximized when the two regions composing the structure have matching thermal resistances and mismatching temperature-dependence of $\kappa$. The model agrees qualitatively with the MD results, indicating that the latter is the principal rectification mechanism, but it can significantly underestimate $\eta$. Phonon analysis further reveals the appearance of new 'defect' modes localized around and between pores, resulting in the emergence of a new prominent peak in the phonon Density of States at 520 $cm^{-1}$. The study considers key geometric factors such as the length of the pristine region, and the pore size, shape, alignment, and orientation. Pore shape and alignment exert minimal influence on $\eta$, although alignment greatly influences $\kappa$. Eventually, arranged pores are deemed more efficient than randomly distributed defects for increasing rectification.</description>

      <title>Locally Machine-Learnability of Density of Electronic States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic density of states (DOS) plays a crucial role in determining the properties of materials. In this study, we investigate the machine learnability of additive atomic contributions to the electronic DOS. Our approach focuses on atom-projected DOS rather than structural DOS. This method for structure-property mapping is both scalable and transferable, achieving high prediction accuracy for pure and compound silicon and carbon structures of varying sizes and configurations. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the complex Sn-S-Se compound structures. By employing locally trained DOS, we significantly enhance the accuracy in predicting secondary material properties, such as band energy, Fermi level, heat capacity, and magnetic susceptibility. Our findings indicate that directly learning atomic DOS, rather than structural DOS, improves the efficiency, accuracy, and interpretability of machine learning in structure-property mapping. This streamlined approach reduces computational complexity, paving the way for the examination of electronic structures in materials without the need for computationally expensive ab initio calculations.</description>

      <title>The Lee-Wick-Chern-Simons pseudo-quantum electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lee-Wick pseudo-quantum electrodynamics in the presence of a Chern-Simons term is studied in this paper. The paper starts with a non-local lagrangian density that sets the Lee-Wick electrodynamics defined on a bidimensional space added to the Chern-Simons topological term. We investigate classical aspects as the potential energy for the interaction of static charges through the gauge propagator. The gauge field of the Lee-Wick-Chern-Simons electrodynamics is minimally coupled to the fermions sector that includes new degree of freedom, as a Lee-Wick heavy fermion partner of the electron. The perturbative approach for the theory is presented via effective action in which we obtain the Ward identities. We study the radiative corrections at one loop for the electron self-energy, the vacuum polarization, and the $3$-vertex through the Ward identity. We show that the Lee-Wick mass has a fundamental role in these results.</description>

      <title>Atomically-Thin Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Nanolasers: Challenges and Opportunities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low energy consumption nanolasers are crucial for advancing on-chip integrated optical interconnects and photonic integrated circuits. Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as an energy-efficient alternative to traditional semiconductor materials for nanolaser optical gain medium, promising ultralow lasing threshold powers. While several studies suggest that TMDs meet the criteria for lasing, whether true lasing has been achieved remains a topic of heavy debate within the scientific community. In this perspective, we offer an overview of the field, outlining the key characteristics of laser light and methods for testing these properties in TMD-based devices. We then conduct a thorough review of recent reports claiming lasing, assessing the findings against established criteria for laser light emission. Finally, we discuss future research directions and applications, highlighting the key challenges that must be addressed to realize practical TMD-based nanolasers.</description>

      <title>A new representation formula for the logarithmic corotational derivative -- a case study in application of commutator based functional calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The logarithmic corotational derivative is a key concept in rate-type constitutive relations in continuum mechanics. The derivative is defined in terms of the logarithmic spin tensor, which is a skew-symmetric tensor/matrix given by a relatively complex formula. Using a newly developed commutator based functional calculus, we derive a new representation formula for the logarithmic spin tensor. In addition to the result on the logarithmic corotational derivative we also use the newly developed functional calculus to answer some problems regarding the matrix logarithm and the monotonicity of stress-strain relations. These results document that the commutator based functional calculus is of general use in tensor/matrix analysis, and that the calculus allows one to seamlessly work with tensor/matrix valued functions and their derivatives.</description>

      <title>DFT exploration of pressure dependent physical properties of the recently discovered La3Ni2O7 superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 under pressure has drawn a lot of interest. La3Ni2O7 is isostructural with cuprates in some respect. Investigation of its properties will undoubtedly provide new insights into high-Tc superconductivity. In the present work, we study structural, mechanical, elastic, optoelectronic, thermophysical properties, and Fermi surface topology of La3Ni2O7 under pressure within the range of 30-40 GPa employing the density functional theory (DFT). The calculated structural parameters agree well with the earlier experimental findings. The structural, mechanical, and thermodynamical stability is justified across the entire pressure range. The computed elastic moduli classify the compound as ductile, and the material's ductility is largely unaffected by pressure. The compound has a high level of machinability index and dry lubricity. The electronic band structure reveals metallic feature of La3Ni2O7. The Debye temperature, thermal conductivity, and melting temperature increase with increasing pressure, but in an anomalous manner. The characteristic peaks in refractive index, reflectivity, and photoconductivity exhibit a small shift towards higher energy for all polarizations of the electric field vector with increasing pressure. The investigated material might be a good ultraviolet radiation absorber and can be used as an anti-reflection system. Moreover, the pressure dependent electronic density of states at the Fermi level, pressure induced negligible variations in the repulsive Coulomb pseudopotential, and the changes in the Debye temperature have been used to explore the effect of pressure on the superconducting transition temperature in this study.</description>

      <title>Positive-tone Nanolithography of Antimony Trisulfide with Femtosecond Laser Wet-etching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antimony trisulfide ($Sb_{2}S_{3}$), as an emerging material for integrated photonic devices, has attracted significant attention due to its high index, low loss, and phase-changing property in the optical regime. However, conventional lithography-based fabrication methods involve complex, time-consuming, multistep processes, rendering the photonic application of $Sb_{2}S_{3}$ challenging. Here, we demonstrate that positive-tone fabrication of $Sb_{2}S_{3}$ nanostructures using wet-etch femtosecond laser processing, a straightforward technique for the engraving of micro- and nanoscale structures, can address major fabrication challenges. The patterning mechanism and factors influencing resolution of $Sb_{2}S_{3}$ thin film structures deposited on quartz (transmissive) and gold (reflective) substrates are experimentally investigated and supported by theoretical modelling. Using this approach, the smallest linewidth fabricated is measured at 178 nm. Consequently, multiple test patterns are demonstrated showing versatile functionalities. Functional Fresnel Zone Plates (FZPs) with varying focal length are fabricated and characterized. This study provides a significantly simplified approach for realizing $Sb_{2}S_{3}$ based integrated photonic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling in thin HgTe quantum wells results in a relativistic-like electron band structure, making it a versatile solid state platform to observe and control non-trivial electrodynamic phenomena. Here we report an observation of universal terahertz (THz) transparency determined by fine-structure constant $\alpha \approx 1/137$ in 6.5 nm-thick HgTe layer, close to the critical thickness separating phases with topologically different electronic band structure. Using THz spectroscopy in magnetic field we obtain direct evidence of asymmetric spin splitting of the Dirac cone. This particle-hole asymmetry facilitates optical control of edge spin currents in the quantum wells.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frustrated magnetic systems arising in geometrically constrained lattices represent rich platforms for exploring unconventional phases of matter, including fractional magnetization plateaus, incommensurate orders, and complex domain dynamics. However, determining the microscopic spin configurations that stabilize such phases is a key challenge, especially when in-plane and out-of-plane spin components coexist and compete. Here, we combine neutron scattering and magnetic susceptibility experiments with simulations to investigate the emergence of field-induced fractional plateaus and the related criticality in a frustrated magnet holmium tetraboride (HoB4) that represents the family of rare earth tetraborides that crystalize in a Shastry-Sutherland lattice in the ab plane. We focus on the interplay between classical and quantum criticality near phase boundaries as well as the role of material defects in the stabilization of the ordered phases. We find that simulations using classical annealing can explain certain observed features in the experimental Laue diffraction and the origin of multiple magnetization plateaus. Our results show that defects and out of plane interactions play an important role and can guide the route towards resolving microscopic spin textures in highly frustrated magnets.</description>

      <title>Non-thermal electrons open the non-equilibrium pathway of the phase transition in FeRh</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18289v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use ultrafast x-ray diffraction to study non-equilibrium pathways of the phase transition in FeRh parametrized by the structural response. By increasing the pump-pulse duration beyond the electron-phonon coupling time, we suppress the electron-phonon non-equilibrium present upon femtosecond laser excitation but still photoexcite electrons to non-thermal states. Irrespective of the pump pulse duration, we find an optically induced nucleation of ferromagnetic domains on an $8\,\text{ps}$ timescale that starts as soon as the successively deposited energy surpasses the site-specific threshold energy. If in contrast, FeRh is only indirectly excited by diffusion of thermalized electrons from an opaque Pt cap layer, the ferromagnetic phase rises on a $50\,\text{ps}$ timescale. These findings unambiguously identify the photo-excitation of non-thermal electrons and not electron-phonon non-equilibria to enable the non-equilibrium pathway of the phase transition in FeRh.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling is a key to realize many novel physical effects in condensed matter physics. Altermagnetic materials possess the duality of real-space antiferromagnetism and reciprocal-space ferromagnetism. It has not been explored that achieving strong spin-orbit coupling effect in light-element altermagnetic materials. In this work, based on symmetry analysis, the first-principles electronic structure calculations plus Dynamical Mean Field Theory, we demonstrate that there is strong spin-orbit coupling effect in light-element altermagnetic materials $\rm NiF_3$ and $\rm FeCO_3$, and then propose a mechanism for realizing such effective spin-orbit coupling. This mechanism reveals the cooperative effect of crystal symmetry, electron occupation, electronegativity, electron correlation, and intrinsic spin-orbit coupling. Our work provides an approach for searching light-element altermagnetic materials with an effective strong spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Radial distribution and its spherical harmonics expansion in liquid CO2 at 250 K and 50 bar based on pressure-constant Monte Carlo simulation using Kihara Potential Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17800v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to compute the radial distribution function of liquid CO2 at 250 K and 50 bar and its expansion coefficients by spherical harmonics as a function of intermolecular distance up to 20 angstroms for all possible combinations of angular indices l, l prime, and m less than or equal to 8, in contrast to past works of limited combinations. The positions and orientations of CO2 molecules were determined by pressure-constant Monte Carlo simulation using a Kihara potential model. It was found that the radial distribution function had an intense peak at 4.05 angstroms and a broad band at around 7.85 angstroms. The expansion coefficients had prominent structures below approximately 7.5 angstroms, showing positive and/or negative peaks, which indicated that the orientational correlations of the central molecule were intense with the molecules present in that region. It was also found that the peaks of some expansion coefficients were not small even when l = 8. Furthermore, molecular orientations had a tendency to orient along one direction presumably because of the linear form of CO2 molecule.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many-body phenomena in quantum materials emerge from the interplay among a broad continuum of electronic states, and controlling these interactions is critical for engineering novel phases. One promising approach exploits fluctuations of the vacuum electromagnetic field confined within optical cavities to tailor electronic properties. Here, we demonstrate that terahertz cavity photons can mediate attractive interactions in a tunable van der Waals material and reorganize a continuum of electron-hole transitions into an exciton-like state. We introduce a broadband, sub-wavelength time-domain microscope that integrates exfoliated, dual-gated two-dimensional quantum materials into a terahertz cavity. This approach enables the first-ever measurement of the field-tunable bandgap of bilayer graphene at terahertz frequencies while revealing ultrastrong coupling with a vacuum Rabi frequency exceeding $\Omega_{Rabi}/\omega\approx 40\%$ of the bare photon energy. Crucially, we identify a novel cavity-induced resonance emerging from the interband continuum that resembles Coulomb-bound excitons and remains stable across a broad temperature range. By uniting longstanding theoretical predictions with advanced experimental techniques, our findings open new avenues for designing and probing unique light-matter states and realizing hybrid correlated phases in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>A single-phase epitaxially grown ferroelectric perovskite nitride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of ferroelectrics with semiconductors is crucial for developing functional devices, such as field-effect transistors, tunnel junctions, and nonvolatile memories. However, the synthesis of high-quality single-crystalline ferroelectric nitride perovskites has been limited, hindering a comprehensive understanding of their switching dynamics and potential applications. Here we report the synthesis and characterizations of epitaxial single-phase ferroelectric cerium tantalum nitride (CeTaN3) on both oxides and semiconductors. The polar symmetry of CeTaN3 was confirmed by observing the atomic displacement of central ions relative to the center of the TaN6 octahedra, as well as through optical second harmonic generation. We observed switchable ferroelectric domains in CeTaN3 films using piezo-response force microscopy, complemented by the characterization of square-like polarization-electric field hysteresis loops. The remanent polarization of CeTaN3 reaches approximately 20 uC/cm2 at room temperature, consistent with theoretical calculations. This work establishes a vital link between ferroelectric nitride perovskites and their practical applications, paving the way for next-generation information and energy-storage devices with enhanced performance, scalability, and manufacturability.</description>

      <title>Deteriorated Interlayer Coupling in Twisted Bilayer Cobaltites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A wealth of remarkable behaviors is observed at the interfaces between magnetic oxides due to the coexistence of Coulomb repulsion and interatomic exchange interactions. While previous research has focused on bonded oxide heterointerfaces, studies on magnetism in van der Waals interfaces remain rare. In this study, we stacked two freestanding cobaltites with precisely controlled twist angles. Scanning transmission electron microscopy revealed clear and ordered moir\'e patterns, which exhibit an inverse relationship with the twist angle. We found that the Curie temperature in the twisted region is reduced by approximately 13 K compared to the single-layer region using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) magnetometry. This phenomenon may be related to the weakening of the orbital hybridization between oxygen ions and transition metal ions in the unbonded interfaces. Our findings suggest a potential avenue for modulating magnetic interactions in correlated systems through twist, providing opportunities for the discovery of unknown quantum states.</description>

      <title>Low damped acoustic modes in polycrystalline nickel cavities fabricated by ps-laser delamination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-shot picosecond (ps) laser induced delamination allows for the direct generation of suspended membranes from a continuous metallic film. It is not known if polycrystalline membranes obtained by local ps-pulsed laser delamination of a continuous film on a substrate would show low damping compared to the film. Here, we report on the dynamics of acoustic waves excited by femtosecond light pulses and confined in a single freestanding nickel layer, acting as an acoustic cavity. By combining Fourier transform analysis of the measured pump-probe signal and numerical multi-physics simulations, we show that high-frequency (&gt; 10 GHz) longitudinal acoustic pulses can resonate inside the cavity and display lower damping compared to a reference nickel film on SiO2 substrate given that the conditions of total internal reflection are nearly met in the cavity, even if these cavities display more defects in terms of crystal structure and surface roughness. This result provides evidence that the ps-laser induced local delamination could be effectively utilized, after further optimization, as a flexible process to design on-demand micro-structured systems for opto-acoustic applications.</description>

      <title>Photodynamics and Performance Metrics in Cavity-Coupled OLEDs: A Unified Quantum Master Equation Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling light-matter interactions is emerging as a powerful strategy to enhance the performance of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). By embedding the emissive layer in planar microcavities or other modified optical environments, excitons can couple to photonic modes, enabling new regimes of device operation. In the weak-coupling regime, Purcell-enhanced emission can accelerate radiative decay, while in the strong-coupling regime, excitons and photons hybridize to form entirely new energy eigenstates with altered dynamics. These effects offer potential solutions to key challenges in OLEDs, such as triplet accumulation and efficiency roll-off, yet demonstrations in the strong-coupling case remain sparse and modest. To systematically understand and optimize photodynamics across the different coupling regimes, we develop a unified quantum master equation model for cavity-coupled (and uncoupled) OLEDs. We apply this model to evaluate device performance and explore how photonic environments can be engineered for triplet harvesting, enhanced emission, and beyond.</description>

Abstract: The underlying symmetry of the crystal, electronic structure, and magnetic structure manifests itself in the anisotropy of materials' properties, which is a central topic of the present condensed matter research. However, it demands such a considerable effort to fill the explorable space that only a small part has been conquered. We report a vector pulse magnet (VPM) as an alternative experimental technique to control the direction of applied magnetic fields, which may complement the conventional methods with its characteristic features. The VPM combines a conventional pulse magnet and a vector magnet. The VPM can create vector pulsed magnetic fields and swiftly rotating pulsed magnetic fields. As a demonstration, the three-dimensional magnetoresistance measurement of a highly oriented pyrolytic graphite is carried out using the AC four-probe method at 4.5 K and 6 T. The two-dimensional electronic structure of graphite is visualized in the three-dimensional magnetoresistance data. One can uncover the rotational and time-reversal symmetry of materials using a VPM and a variety of measurement techniques.</description>

      <title>The Origin of Sound Damping in Amorphous Solids: Defects and Beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Comprehending sound damping is integral to understanding the anomalous low temperature properties of glasses. After decades of theoretical and experimental studies, Rayleigh scattering scaling of the sound attenuation coefficient with frequency, $\Gamma \sim \omega^{d+1}$, became generally accepted when quantum and finite temperature effects can be neglected. Rayleigh scaling invokes a picture of scattering from defects. However, it is unclear how to define glass defects, or even if defects are necessary for Rayleigh scaling. Here we determine a particle level contribution to sound damping in the Rayleigh scaling regime. We find that there are areas in the glass that contribute more to sound damping than other areas over a range of frequencies, which allows us to define defects. We show that over a range of glass stability, sound damping scales linearly with the fraction of particles in the defects. However, sound is still attenuated in ultra-stable glasses where no defects are identified. We show that sound damping in these glasses is due to nearly uniformly distributed non-affine, microscopic forces that arise after macroscopic deformations of non-centrosymetric structures. To fully understand sound attenuation in glasses one has to consider contributions from defects and a defect-free background, which represents a new paradigm of sound damping in glasses.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear planar magnetotransport as a probe of the topology of surface states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been recently established that transport measurements in the nonlinear regime can give direct access to the quantum metric (QM): the real part of the quantum geometric tensor characterizing the geometry of the electronic wavefunctions in a solid. In topological materials, the QM has been so far revealed in thin films of the topological antiferromagnet MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ where it provides a direct contribution to longitudinal currents quadratic in the driving electric field. Here we show that the Dirac surface states of strong three-dimensional topological insulators have a QM that can be accessed from the nonlinear transport characteristics in the presence of an externally applied planar magnetic field. A previously unknown intrinsic part of the longitudinal magnetoconductivity carries the signature of the QM while coexisting with the extrinsic part responsible for the so-called bilinear magnetoelectric resistance. We prove that the QM-induced nonlinear magnetotransport carries specific signatures of single Dirac cones. This allows to use it as an efficient diagnostic tool of the bulk topology of three-dimensional non-magnetic insulators.</description>

      <title>Structure-Adaptive Topology Optimization Framework for Photonic Band Gaps with TM-Polarized Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09165v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a structure-adaptive topology optimization framework for engineering photonic band gaps with TM-polarized sources based on computation of the photonic density of states with a uniform source substituting for the standard Dirac delta function sources in formalisms analogous to $\Gamma$-point integration and to integration over a full Brillouin zone. We generalize the limiting uniform and Dirac delta function sources to more general collections of sources, such that the union of the sources in a given collection is hyperuniform. The uniform-source approach necessarily leads to the fastest computations. We also demonstrate how our approach can be generalized to the treatment of the frequency-dependent optical response of materials. Finally, we show that we can recover known two-dimensional photonic crystals for the TM polarization. A key advantage of our work is its ability to optimize for a specific midgap frequency and band gap in a structure-adaptive manner. Our work leverages the insight that the determination of the minimum supercell size and the minimum precision to which the frequencies within the photonic band gap must be sampled will lead to the observation of photonic-crystal structures when the $\Gamma$-point formalism for the uniform-source approach is employed. Additionally, our $\Gamma$-point and full Brillouin zone formalisms for the uniform-source approach inherently encourage binarized designs even in gradient descent.</description>

Abstract: We study theoretically the neutral and charged excitons in two-dimensional semiconductors with anisotropic dispersion of charge carriers. Such a situation is realized in CrSBr-based van der Waals heterostructures. We calculate the binding energies of excitons and trions and explore their dependence on the mass ratio, dielectric screening, and interlayer distance in bilayer structures. We also address the effects of exciton-light coupling, including the radiative decay and long-range electron-hole exchange interaction, and briefly analyze correlations between the excitons and the Fermi sea of resident electrons. The estimates for CrSBr bilayers are in reasonable agreement with recent experiments.</description>

      <title>Decoding the Competing Effects of Dynamic Solvation Structures on Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Chemical Shifts of Battery Electrolytes via Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the solvation structure of electrolytes is critical for optimizing the electrochemical performance of rechargeable batteries, as it directly influences properties such as ionic conductivity, viscosity, and electrochemical stability. The highly complex structures and strong interactions in high-concentration electrolytes make accurate modeling and interpretation of their ``structure-property" relationships even more challenging with spectroscopic methods. In this study, we present a machine learning-based approach to predict dynamic $^7$Li NMR chemical shifts in LiFSI/DME electrolyte solutions. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive structural analysis to interpret the observed chemical shift behavior in our experiments, particularly the abrupt changes in $^7$Li chemical shifts at high concentrations. Using advanced modeling techniques, we quantitatively establish the relationship between molecular structure and NMR spectra, offering critical insights into solvation structure assignments. Our findings reveal the coexistence of two competing local solvation structures that shift in dominance as electrolyte concentration approaches the concentrated limit, leading to anomalous reverse of $^7$Li NMR chemical shift in our experiment. This work provides a detailed molecular-level understanding of the intricate solvation structures probed by NMR spectroscopy, leading the way for enhanced electrolyte design.</description>

      <title>Strain-induced proximity effect in topological insulator TaSe$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The magnetoresistance of superconductor-topological insulator-superconductor structures, with indium as the superconductor and TaSe$_3$ as the topological insulator, shows steplike features on the resistance under magnetic fields. These resistance steps are resulted from the suppression of superconductivity, induced by the superconducting proximity effect in both the bulk and surface states of the topological insulator. The position and amplitude of the steps, occurring at approximately 0.1 T, show an unusual dependence on the magnitude of the uniaxial strain ($\epsilon$), indicating their connection with surface states. This behavior follows the expected transition sequence: semi-metal $\rightarrow$ strong topological insulator $\rightarrow$ trivial insulator, and supports the presence of surface states at $0.46\% \lesssim \epsilon \lesssim 0.85\%$.</description>

      <title>Flexible radio-frequency transistors exceeding 100 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02485v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of 6G communication demands seamlessly integrated terminals operating above 100 GHz with low power consumption for human-centric applications. In this work, we report high-performance, flexible radio-frequency (RF) metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) based on aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) arrays, achieving, for the first time, as-measured current gain cutoff frequency (fT) and power gain cutoff frequency (fmax) both exceeding 100 GHz. Electro-thermal co-design improves both heat dissipation and RF performance, despite the low thermal conductivity of the flexible substrate. The transistors deliver 0.947 mA/$\mathrm{mu}$m on-state current and 0.728 mS/$\mathrm{mu}$m transconductance. Peak extrinsic $f_{\mathrm{T}}$ and $f_{\mathrm{max}}$ reach 152 GHz and 102 GHz with power consumption &lt; 200 mW/mm, setting new performance records for flexible CNT-based RF transistors by nearly 100$\times$, outperforming all other flexible RF MOSFETs. Additionally, flexible RF amplifiers achieve 64 mW/mm output power and 11 dB power gain in the K-band, marking a significant milestone in flexible RF technologies for next-generation wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Analytical model for balling defects in laser melting using rivulet theory and solidification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the laser welding and additive manufacturing (AM) communities, the balling defect is primarily attributed to the action of fluid instabilities with a few authors suggesting other mechanisms. Without commenting on the validity of the fluid instability driven \textit{mechanism} of balling in AM, this work intends to present the most realistic analytical discussion of the balling defect driven purely by fluid instabilities. Synchrotron-based X-ray radiography of thin samples indicate that fluid instability growth rates and solidification can be comparable in magnitude and thus compete. Neglecting the action of fluid flows and heat transport, this work presents an analytical formalism which accounts for fluid instabilities and solidification competition, giving a continuous transition from balling to non-balling which is lacking in current literature. We adapt a Rivulet instability model from the fluid physics community to account for the stabilizing effects of the substrate which the Plateau-Rayleigh instability model does not account for, and estimate the instability growth rate. Our model predicts instability growth at higher wavelengths and shallower melt pool depths relative to width, as well as strong sensitivity to the solidification front curvature. Deviations between model predictions and our experimental results demonstrate the importance of fluid flows and heat transport in the balling process. Our experiments further demonstrate at least one mechanism by which the melt pool length and balling wavelength are not equivalent, as commonly claimed.</description>

      <title>Phonon fluctuation diagnostics: Origin of charge order in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ kagome metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The microsopic origin of the charge-density wave (CDW) in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb, Cs) kagome metals remains a longstanding question, often revolving around electron-phonon coupling and purely electronic mechanisms involving Van Hove scenarios, nesting, and sublattice interference. To reveal the processes driving the CDW transition, we combine ab-initio calculations analysis of the phonon self-energy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Our momentum-resolved study, supported by ARPES data, reveals that lattice instabilities in the V-135 family of kagome metals appear to also be driven by electronic states far from high-symmetry points, where these states exhibit the strongest coupling with the phonon modes responsible for the CDW distortion. Footing on an interpretation scheme based on phonon fluctuation diagnostics, our work challenges and revises theories that so far have exclusively attributed CDW formation to nesting effects close to the Fermi level.</description>
