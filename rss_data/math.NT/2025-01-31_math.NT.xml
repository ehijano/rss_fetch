      <title>Local fields, iterated extensions, and Julia Sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a field complete with respect to a discrete valuation $v$ of residue characteristic $p$, and let $f(z) = z^\ell - c \in K[z]$ be a separable polynomial. We explore the connection between the valuation $v(c)$ and the Berkovich Julia set of $f$. Additionally, we examine the field extensions generated by the solutions to $f^n(z) = \alpha$ for a root point $\alpha \in K$, highlighting the interplay between the dynamics of $f$ and the ramification in the corresponding extensions.</description>

      <title>Convex Lattice Polygons with $k\ge3$ Interior Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the geometry of convex lattice $n$-gons with $n$ boundary lattice points and $k\geq 3$ collinear interior lattice points. We describe a process to construct a primitive lattice triangle from an edge of a convex lattice $n$-gon, hence adding one edge in a way so that the number of boundary points increases by $1$, while the number of interior points remains unchanged. We also present the necessary conditions to construct such a primitive lattice triangle, as well as an upper bound for the number of times this is possible. Finally, we apply the previous results to fully classify the positive integers for which there exists a convex $n$-gon with $k$ collinear and non-collinear interior points.</description>

      <title>Zeros of symmetric power period polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose that $k$ and $N$ are positive integers. Let $f$ be a newform on $\Gamma_0(N)$ of weight $k$ with $L$-function $L_f(s)$.
  Previous works have studied the zeros of the period polynomial $r_f(z)$, which is a generating function for the critical values of $L_f(s)$ and has a functional equation relating $z$ and $-1/Nz$.
  In particular, $r_f(z)$ satisfies a version of the Riemann hypothesis: all of its zeros are on the circle of symmetry
  $\{z \in \C \ : \ |z|=1/\sqrt{N}\}$.
  In this paper, for a positive integer $m$, we define a natural analogue of $r_f(z)$ for the $m^{\operatorname{th}}$ symmetric power $L$-function of $f$ when $N$ is squarefree. Our analogue also has a functional equation relating $z$ and $-1/Nz$. We prove the corresponding version of the Riemann hypothesis when $k$ is large enough. Moreover, when $k&gt;2(\operatorname{log}_2(13e^{2\pi}/9)+m)+1$, we prove our result when $N$ is large enough.</description>

      <title>Almost primes between all squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for all $n\geq 1$ there exists a number between $n^2$ and $(n+1)^2$ with at most 4 prime factors. This is the first result of this kind that holds for every $n\geq 1$ rather than just sufficiently large $n$. Our approach relies on a recent computation by Sorenson and Webster, along with an explicit version of the linear sieve. As part of our proof, we also prove an explicit version of Kuhn's weighted sieve. This is done for generic sifting sets to enhance the future applicability of our methods.</description>

      <title>On the quasi-uniformity properties of quasi-Monte Carlo digital nets and sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quasi-uniformity properties of digital nets, a class of quasi-Monte Carlo point sets. Quasi-uniformity is a space-filling property used for instance in experimental designs and radial basis function approximation. However, it has not been investigated so far whether common low-discrepancy digital nets are quasi-uniform, with the exception of the two-dimensional Sobol' sequence, which has recently been shown not to be quasi-uniform. In this paper, with the goal of constructing quasi-uniform low-discrepancy digital nets, we introduce the notion of \emph{well-separated} point sets and provide an algebraic criterion to determine whether a given digital net is well-separated. Using this criterion, we present an example of a two-dimensional digital net which has low-discrepancy and is quasi-uniform. Additionally, we provide several counterexamples of low-discrepancy digital nets that are not quasi-uniform. The quasi-uniformity properties of quasi-Monte Carlo lattice point sets and sequences will be studied in a forthcoming paper.</description>

      <title>Finiteness properties of generalized Montr\'eal functors with applications to mod $p$ representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{Q}_p)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The second named author previously constructed a functor $\mathbb{V}^\vee\circ D^\vee_\Delta$ from the category of smooth $p$-power torsion representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ to the category of inductive limits of continuous representations on finite $p$-primary abelian groups of the direct product $G_{\mathbb{Q}_p,\Delta}\times \mathbb{Q}_p^\times$ of $(n-1)$ copies of the absolute Galois group of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ and one copy of the multiplicative group $\mathbb{Q}_p^\times$. In the present work we show that this functor attaches finite dimensional representations on the Galois side to smooth $p$-power torsion representations of finite length on the automorphic side. This has some implications on the finiteness properties of Breuil's functor, too. Moreover, $\mathbb{V}^\vee\circ D^\vee_\Delta$ produces irreducible representations of $G_{\mathbb{Q}_p,\Delta}\times \mathbb{Q}_p^\times$ when applied to irreducible objects on the automorphic side and detects isomorphisms unless it vanishes. Further, we determine the kernel of $D^\vee_\Delta$ when restricted to successive extensions of subquotients of principal series. We use this to characterize representations that are parabolically induced from the product of a torus and $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{Q}_p)$. Finally, we formulate a conjecture and prove partial results on the essential image.</description>

      <title>Inductive methods for counting number fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a new method for counting extensions of a number field asymptotically by discriminant, which we employ to prove many new cases of Malle's Conjecture and counterexamples to Malle's Conjecture. We consider families of extensions whose Galois closure is a fixed permutation group $G$. Our method relies on having asymptotic counts for $T$-extensions for some normal subgroup $T$ of $G$, uniform bounds for the number of such $T$-extensions, and possibly weak bounds on the asymptotic number of $G/T$-extensions. However, we do not require that most $T$-extensions of a $G/T$-extension are $G$-extensions. Our new results use $T$ either abelian or $S_3^m$, though our framework is general.</description>

      <title>Finite subgroups of maximal order of the Cremona group over the rationals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Cr_\Q(2)$ be the Cremona group of rank $2$ over rational numbers. We give a classification of large finite subgroups $G$ of $\Cr_\Q(2)$ and give a new sharp bound smaller (but not multiplicative) than $M(\Q)=120960 = 2^7\cdot3^3\cdot5\cdot7$; the one given in \cite{MR2567402}. In particular, we prove that any finite subgroup $G \subset\Cr_\Q(2)$ has order $\mid G\mid \le 432$ and Lemma \ref{lemm-25} provides a group of order $432$. We use the modern approach of minimal $G-$surfaces, given a (smooth) rational surface $S\subset\p^2$ defined over $\Q$, we study the finite subgroups $G \subset \Aut_{\Q}(S)$ of automorphisms of $S$. We give the best bound for the order of $G\subset\Aut(S)$ for surfaces with a conic bundle structure invariant by $G$. We also give the best bound for the order of $G\subset \Aut_\Q(S)$ for all rational Del Pezzo surfaces of some given degree. In addition, we give descriptions of the finite subgroups of automorphisms of conic bundles and Del Pezzo surfaces of maximal size.</description>

      <title>Construction of tame supercuspidal representations in arbitrary residue characteristic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let F be a non-archimedean local field whose residue field has at least four elements. Let G be a connected reductive group over F that splits over a tamely ramified extension of F. We provide a construction of supercuspidal representations of G(F) that contains all the supercuspidal representations constructed by Yu in 2001, but that also works in residual characteristic two. The input for our construction is described uniformly for all residual characteristics and is analogous to Yu's input except that we do not require our characters to satisfy the genericity condition (GE2) that Yu imposes.</description>

      <title>On Sequence Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.00450v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear second order recursive sequences with arbitrary initial conditions are studied. For sequences with the same parameters a ring and a group is attached, and isomorphisms and homomorphisms are established for related parameters. In the group, called the {\it sequence group}, sequences are identified if they differ by a scalar factor, but not if they differ by a shift, which is the case for the Laxton group. Prime divisors of sequences are studied with the help of the sequence group $\mod p$, which is always cyclic of order $p\pm 1$. Even and odd numbered subsequences are given independent status through the introduction of one rational parameter in place of two integer parameters. This step brings significant simplifications in the algebra. All elements of finite order in Laxton groups and sequence groups are described effectively. A necessary condition is established for a prime $p$ to be a divisor of a sequence: {\it the norm (determinant) of the respective element of the ring must be a quadratic residue $\mod p$}. This leads to an uppers estimate of the set of divisors by a set of prime density $1/2$. Numerical experiments show that the actual density is typically close to $0.35$. A conjecture is formulated that the sets of prime divisors of the even and odd numbered elements are independent for a large family of parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.13961v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we use the regularized Siegel-Weil formula of Gan-Qiu-Takeda to obtain an expression of the integral of the theta function over the truncated modular curve. We apply this result to express the integral over the truncated modular curve of the logarithm of the Borcherds form and we describe explicitly its asymptotic behaviour, and in particular the convergent and divergent contributions. The result provides a complement to the work of Kudla on integrals of Borcherds forms in a limiting case which falls out the range of applications.</description>

      <title>Small improvements on the Ball-Rivoal theorem and its $p$-adic variant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the dimension of the $\mathbb{Q}$-linear span of $1,\zeta(3),\zeta(5),\ldots,\zeta(s-1)$ is at least $(1.119 \cdot \log s)/(1+\log 2)$ for any sufficiently large even integer $s$. This slightly refines a well-known result of Rivoal (2000) or Ball-Rivoal (2001). Quite unexpectedly, the proof only involves inserting the arithmetic observation of Zudilin (2001) into the original proof of Ball-Rivoal. Although this result is covered by a recent development of Fischler (2021+), our proof has the advantages of being simple and providing explicit non-vanishing small linear forms in $1$ and odd zeta values.
  Moreover, we establish the $p$-adic variant: for any prime number $p$, the dimension of the $\mathbb{Q}$-linear span of $1,\zeta_p(3),\zeta_p(5),\ldots,\zeta_p(s-1)$ is at least $(1.119 \cdot \log s)/(1+\log 2)$ for any sufficiently large even integer $s$. This is new, it slightly refines a result of Sprang (2020).</description>

      <title>The index and its prime divisors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new interpretation of the classical index of appearance for second order linear recursive sequences. It stems from the formula \[ C_{n}(t)-2 =\frac{\Delta}{Q^{n}}\ L_n^2,\ \ \ \text{where} \ \ t= (T^2-2Q)/Q, \ \Delta = T^2-4Q, \] connecting the Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind $C_n(x)$ with the Lucas sequence defined for integer $T,Q\neq 0$ by the recursion $L_{n+1}= TL_n-QL_{n-1}, L_0=0, L_1 = 1$. We build on the results of \cite{L-W}. We prove that for any prime $r\geq 2$ the sets $\Pi_j(t,r), j=1,2,\dots$, of primes $p$ such that $j$ is the highest power of $r$ dividing the index of appearance, have prime density equal to $\frac{1}{(r+1)r^{j-1}}$, for $r$-generic values of $t$. We give also complete enumeration of non-generic cases and the appropriate density formulas. It improves on the work of Lagarias, \cite{L}, and Ballot, \cite{B1},\cite{B2},\cite{B3}, on the sets of prime divisors of sequences of "finite order". Our methods are sufficient to prove that for any linear recursive sequence of second order (with some trivial exceptions) the set of primes not dividing any element contains a subset of positive density. We consider also some applications in arithmetic dynamics.</description>

      <title>New bounds in R.S. Lehman's estimates for the difference $\pi\left( x\right) -li\left( x\right) $</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We denote by $\pi\left( x\right) $ the usual prime counting function and let $li\left( x\right) $ the logarithmic integral of $x$. In 1966, R.S. Lehman came up with a new approach and an effective method for finding an upper bound where it is assured that a sign change occurs for $\pi\left( x\right) -li\left( x\right) $ for some value $x$ not higher than this given bound. In this paper we provide further improvements on the error terms including an improvement upon Lehman's famous error term $S_{3}$ in his original paper. We are now able to eliminate the lower condition for the size-length $\eta$ completely. For further numerical computations this enables us to establish sharper results on the positions for the sign changes. We illustrate with some numerical computations on the lowest known crossover regions near $10^{316}$ and we discuss numerically on potential crossover regions below this value.</description>

      <title>Seminorm estimates and joint ergodicity for pairwise independent Hardy sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a robust structure theory for multiple ergodic averages of commuting transformations along Hardy sequences of polynomial growth. We then apply it to derive a number of novel results on joint ergodicity, recurrence and convergence. In particular, we prove joint ergodicity for (a) pairwise independent Hardy sequences and weakly mixing transformations, (b) strongly independent Hardy sequences and ergodic transformations, (c) strongly irrationally independent Hardy sequences and totally ergodic transformations.
  We use these joint ergodicity results to provide new recurrence results for multidimensional patterns along strongly independent Hardy sequences, showing for instance that all subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ of positive upper density contain patterns
  \[ (m_1, m_2),\; (m_1 + \lfloor{n^{3/2}}\rfloor, m_2),\; (m_1, m_2 + \lfloor{n^{3/2} + n^{1/2}}\rfloor).\]
  Last but not least, we positively resolve the joint ergodicity classification problem for pairwise independent Hardy sequences, of which the aforementioned families are special cases.
  While building on recent technical advances (e.g. PET coefficient tracking schemes and joint ergodicity criteria), our work introduces a number of technical developments of its own. We construct a suitable generalization of Host-Kra and box seminorms that quantitatively control ergodic averages along Hardy sequences. We subsequently use them to obtain Host-Kra seminorm estimates for averages along all pairwise independent Hardy sequences. Furthermore, we develop an ergodic version of the quantitative concatenation argument that has recently found extensive use in combinatorics, number theory and harmonic analysis. Lastly, we improve simultaneous Taylor approximations for Hardy sequences.</description>
