      <title>Quasielastic Lepton-Nucleus Scattering and the Correlated Fermi Gas Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The neutrino research program in the coming decades will require improved precision. A major source of uncertainty is the interaction of neutrinos with nuclei that serve as targets for such experiments. Broadly speaking, this interaction often depends, e.g., for charge-current quasi-elastic scattering, on the combination of ``nucleon physics", expressed by form factors, and ``nuclear physics", expressed by a nuclear model. It is important to get a good handle on both. We present a fully analytic implementation of the Correlated Fermi Gas Model for electron-nucleus and charge-current quasi-elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering. The implementation is used to compare separately form factors and nuclear model effects for both electron-carbon and neutrino-carbon scattering data.</description>

      <title>Chiral Magnetic Effect in Heavy Ion Collisions: The Present and Future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chiral magnetic effect (CME) is a collective quantum phenomenon that arises from the interplay between gauge field topology and fermion chiral anomaly, encompassing a wide range of physical systems from semimetals to quark-gluon plasma. This review, with a focus on CME and related effects in heavy ion collisions, aims to provide an introductory discussion on its conceptual foundation and measurement methodology, a timely update on the present status in terms of experimental findings and theoretical progress, as well as an outlook into the open problems and future developments.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic observables of open-shell nuclei from coupled-cluster theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a new method to describe electromagnetic observables of open-shell nuclei with two nucleons outside a closed shell. This approach combines the equation-of-motion coupled-cluster method for such systems and the Lorentz integral transform technique, expanding the applicability of coupled-cluster theory for these properties beyond closed-shell nuclei. To validate this new approach, we compute the non-energy-weighted dipole sum rule and the dipole polarizability of $^{16,24}$O in both the closed-shell and the new equation-of-motion coupled-cluster frameworks, finding agreement within error bars. We then analyze the evolution of the dipole polarizability along the oxygen and calcium isotopic chains. Our predictions agree well with available experimental data and other available theoretical calculations for the closed-shell $^{16,22}$O and the open-shell $^{18}$O. In the calcium isotopes, we observe that our dipole polarizability predictions for open-shell nuclei are lower than those of closed-shell nuclei. Our predictions for $^{24}$O and $^{54,56}$Ca will motivate future experimental studies at the dripline.</description>

      <title>In-medium changes of nucleon cross sections tested in neutrino-induced reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Historically studied in the context of heavy-ion collisions, the extent to which free nucleon-nucleon forces are modified in-medium remains undetermined by these data sets. Therefore, we investigate the impact of NN in-medium modifications on neutrino-nucleus cross section predictions using the GiBUU transport model. We find that including an in-medium lowering of the NN cross section and density dependence on $\Delta$ excitation improves agreement with MicroBooNE neutrino-argon scattering data. This is observed for both proton and neutral pion spectra in charged-current muon neutrino and neutral-current single pion production datasets. The impact of collision broadening of the $\Delta$ resonance is also investigated.</description>

      <title>Prospects to study hyperon-nucleon interactions at BESIII</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.12601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The prospects to study hyperon-nuclei/nucleon interactions at BESIII and similar $e^+ e^-$ colliders are proposed in this work. Utilizing the large quantity of hyperons produced by the decay of 10 billion $J/\psi$ and 2.7 billion $\psi(3686)$ collected at BESIII, the cross sections of several specific elastic or inelastic hyperon-nuclei reactions can be measured via the scattering between the hyperons and the nucleus in the dense objects of BESIII detector. Subsequently, the cross sections of corresponding hyperon-nucleon interactions are able to be extracted with further phenomenological calculation. Furthermore, the interactions between antihyperon and nuclei/nucleon, including scattering and annihilation, can also be studied via the method proposed in this paper. The results will definitely benefit a lot the precise probe of the hyperon-nuclei/nucleon interactions and provide constraints for the studies of the potential of strong interaction, the origin of color confinement, the unified model for baryon-baryon interactions, and the internal structure of neutron stars. In addition, the desirable prospects of corresponding studies in the future Super Tau-Charm Factory (STCF) are discussed and estimated in this work.</description>

      <title>Effects of incompressibility $K_{0}$ in heavy-ion collisions at intermediate energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the possible least uncertainty on the nuclear incompressibility $K_{0}$, we examine effects of $K_{0}$ in heavy-ion collisions at intermediate energies. Based on simulations of Au + Au collision at 400 MeV/nucleon using an isospin- and momentum-dependent transport model, we find that the incompressibility $K_{0}$ indeed affects significantly the attainable density in central regions, and thus the particle productions and/or distributions at final states, e.g., nucleon rapidity distributions and yields of charged pions. Nevertheless, through examining the free neutron over proton ratios $n/p$, the neutron-proton differential transverse and directed flows as well as the charged pion ratio $\pi^{-}/\pi^{+}$ and its kinetic energy distribution, we find that these observables are less affected by the uncertainty of $K_{0}$, but mainly sensitive to the slope of symmetry energy at the saturation density. We also compare and discuss our results with the corresponding data.</description>
