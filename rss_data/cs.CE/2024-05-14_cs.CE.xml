      <title>Interactive Lab Notebooks for Robotics Researchers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactive notebooks, such as Jupyter, have revolutionized the field of data science by providing an integrated environment for data, code, and documentation. However, their adoption by robotics researchers and model developers has been limited. This study investigates the logging and record-keeping practices of robotics researchers, drawing parallels to the pre-interactive notebook era of data science. Through interviews with robotics researchers, we identified the reliance on diverse and often incompatible tools for managing experimental data, leading to challenges in reproducibility and data traceability. Our findings reveal that robotics researchers can benefit from a specialized version of interactive notebooks that supports comprehensive data entry, continuous context capture, and agile data staging. We propose extending interactive notebooks to better serve the needs of robotics researchers by integrating features akin to traditional lab notebooks. This adaptation aims to enhance the organization, analysis, and reproducibility of experimental data in robotics, fostering a more streamlined and efficient research workflow.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Aggregation of Electric Vehicle Flexibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of characterising the aggregate flexibility in populations of electric vehicles (EVs) with uncertain charging requirements. Building on previous results that provide exact characterisations of the aggregate flexibility in populations with known charging requirements, in this paper we extend the aggregation methods so that charging requirements are uncertain, but sampled from a given distribution. In particular, we construct \textit{distributionally robust aggregate flexibility sets}, sets of aggregate charging profiles over which we can provide probabilistic guarantees that actual realised populations will be able to track. By leveraging measure concentration results that establish powerful finite sample guarantees, we are able to give tight bounds on these robust flexibility sets, even in low sample regimes that are well suited for aggregating small populations of EVs. We detail explicit methods of calculating these sets and provide numerical results that validate the theory developed here.</description>

      <title>Towards a Hybrid Digital Twin: Physics-Informed Neural Networks as Surrogate Model of a Reinforced Concrete Beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the potential of fast-to-evaluate surrogate modeling techniques for developing a hybrid digital twin of a steel-reinforced concrete beam, serving as a representative example of a civil engineering structure. As surrogates, two distinct models are developed utilizing physics-informed neural networks, which integrate experimental data with given governing laws of physics. The experimental data (sensor data) is obtained from a previously conducted four-point bending test. The first surrogate model predicts strains at fixed locations along the center line of the beam for various time instances. This time-dependent surrogate model is inspired by the motion of a harmonic oscillator. For this study, we further compare the physics-based approach with a purely data-driven method, revealing the significance of physical laws for the extrapolation capabilities of models in scenarios with limited access to experimental data. Furthermore, we identify the natural frequency of the system by utilizing the physics-based model as an inverse solver. For the second surrogate model, we then focus on a fixed instance in time and combine the sensor data with the equations of linear elasticity to predict the strain distribution within the beam. This example reveals the importance of balancing different loss components through the selection of suitable loss weights.</description>

      <title>Industrial Metaverse: Enabling Technologies, Open Problems, and Future Trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an emerging technology that enables seamless integration between the physical and virtual worlds, the Metaverse has great potential to be deployed in the industrial production field with the development of extended reality (XR) and next-generation communication networks. This deployment, called the Industrial Metaverse, is used for product design, production operations, industrial quality inspection, and product testing. However, there lacks of in-depth understanding of the enabling technologies associated with the Industrial Metaverse. This encompasses both the precise industrial scenarios targeted by each technology and the potential migration of technologies developed in other domains to the industrial sector. Driven by this issue, in this article, we conduct a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art literature on the Industrial Metaverse. Specifically, we first analyze the advantages of the Metaverse for industrial production. Then, we review a collection of key enabling technologies of the Industrial Metaverse, including blockchain (BC), digital twin (DT), 6G, XR, and artificial intelligence (AI), and analyze how these technologies can support different aspects of industrial production. Subsequently, we present numerous formidable challenges encountered within the Industrial Metaverse, including confidentiality and security concerns, resource limitations, and interoperability constraints. Furthermore, we investigate the extant solutions devised to address them. Finally, we briefly outline several open issues and future research directions of the Industrial Metaverse.</description>

      <title>Space-time stochastic Galerkin boundary elements for acoustic scattering problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acoustic emission or scattering problems naturally involve uncertainties about the sound sources or boundary conditions. This article initiates the study of time domain boundary elements for such stochastic boundary problems for the acoustic wave equation. We present a space-time stochastic Galerkin boundary element method which is applied to sound-hard, sound-soft and absorbing scatterers. Uncertainties in both the sources and the boundary conditions are considered using a polynomial chaos expansion. The numerical experiments illustrate the performance and convergence of the proposed method in model problems and present an application to a problem from traffic noise.</description>

      <title>Space-time boundary elements for frictional contact in elastodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article studies a boundary element method for dynamic frictional contact between linearly elastic bodies. We formulate these problems as a variational inequality on the boundary, involving the elastodynamic Poincar\'{e}-Steklov operator. The variational inequality is solved in a mixed formulation using boundary elements in space and time. In the model problem of unilateral Tresca friction contact with a rigid obstacle we obtain an a priori estimate for the resulting Galerkin approximations. Numerical experiments in two space dimensions demonstrate the stability, energy conservation and convergence of the proposed method for contact problems involving concrete and steel in the linearly elastic regime. They address both unilateral and two-sided dynamic contact with Tresca or Coulomb friction.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Deep Reinforcement Learning for American Put Option Hedging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper contributes to the existing literature on hedging American options with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). The study first investigates hyperparameter impact on hedging performance, considering learning rates, training episodes, neural network architectures, training steps, and transaction cost penalty functions. Results highlight the importance of avoiding certain combinations, such as high learning rates with a high number of training episodes or low learning rates with few training episodes and emphasize the significance of utilizing moderate values for optimal outcomes. Additionally, the paper warns against excessive training steps to prevent instability and demonstrates the superiority of a quadratic transaction cost penalty function over a linear version. This study then expands upon the work of Pickard et al. (2024), who utilize a Chebyshev interpolation option pricing method to train DRL agents with market calibrated stochastic volatility models. While the results of Pickard et al. (2024) showed that these DRL agents achieve satisfactory performance on empirical asset paths, this study introduces a novel approach where new agents at weekly intervals to newly calibrated stochastic volatility models. Results show DRL agents re-trained using weekly market data surpass the performance of those trained solely on the sale date. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates that both single-train and weekly-train DRL agents outperform the Black-Scholes Delta method at transaction costs of 1% and 3%. This practical relevance suggests that practitioners can leverage readily available market data to train DRL agents for effective hedging of options in their portfolios.</description>

      <title>An Efficient PGD Solver for Structural Dynamics Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose in this paper a Proper Generalized Decomposition (PGD) solver for reduced-order modeling of linear elastodynamic problems. It primarily focuses on enhancing the computational efficiency of a previously introduced PGD solver based on the Hamiltonian formalism. The novelty of this work lies in the implementation of a solver that is halfway between Modal Decomposition and the conventional PGD framework, so as to accelerate the fixed-point iteration algorithm. Additional procedures such that Aitken's delta-squared process and mode-orthogonalization are incorporated to ensure convergence and stability of the algorithm. Numerical results regarding the ROM accuracy, time complexity, and scalability are provided to demonstrate the performance of the new solver when applied to dynamic simulation of a three-dimensional structure.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Strategic Discovery of Credible Neural Network Surrogate Models under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08901v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The widespread integration of deep neural networks in developing data-driven surrogate models for high-fidelity simulations of complex physical systems highlights the critical necessity for robust uncertainty quantification techniques and credibility assessment methodologies, ensuring the reliable deployment of surrogate models in consequential decision-making. This study presents the Occam Plausibility Algorithm for surrogate models (OPAL-surrogate), providing a systematic framework to uncover predictive neural network-based surrogate models within the large space of potential models, including various neural network classes and choices of architecture and hyperparameters. The framework is grounded in hierarchical Bayesian inferences and employs model validation tests to evaluate the credibility and prediction reliability of the surrogate models under uncertainty. Leveraging these principles, OPAL-surrogate introduces a systematic and efficient strategy for balancing the trade-off between model complexity, accuracy, and prediction uncertainty. The effectiveness of OPAL-surrogate is demonstrated through two modeling problems, including the deformation of porous materials for building insulation and turbulent combustion flow for the ablation of solid fuels within hybrid rocket motors.</description>

      <title>ReeSPOT: Reeb Graph Models Semantic Patterns of Normalcy in Human Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces ReeSPOT, a novel Reeb graph-based method to model patterns of life in human trajectories (akin to a fingerprint). Human behavior typically follows a pattern of normalcy in day-to-day activities. This is marked by recurring activities within specific time periods. In this paper, we model this behavior using Reeb graphs where any deviation from usual day-to-day activities is encoded as nodes in the Reeb graph. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is linear with respect to the number of time points in a given trajectory. We demonstrate the usage of ReeSPOT and how it captures the critically significant spatial and temporal deviations using the nodes of the Reeb graph. Our case study presented in this paper includes realistic human movement scenarios: visiting uncommon locations, taking odd routes at infrequent times, uncommon time visits, and uncommon stay durations. We analyze the Reeb graph to interpret the topological structure of the GPS trajectories. Potential applications of ReeSPOT include urban planning, security surveillance, and behavioral research.</description>
