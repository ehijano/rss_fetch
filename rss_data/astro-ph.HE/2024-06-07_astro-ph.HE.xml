      <title>GWnext 2024: Meeting Summary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GWnext 2024 was a meeting held in the Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics at Peking University in March $4^\text{th} - 8^\text{th}$, 2024. In the meeting researchers at different career stages -- with a particular focus on early career scientists -- working on the different aspects of gravitational wave (GW) astronomy gathered to discuss the current status as well as prospects of the field. The meeting was divided into three core sessions: Astrophysics, GW Theory, and Detection. Each session consisted of introductory talks and extended discussion sessions. Moreover, there was a poster session where students could present their results. In this paper, we summarize the results presented during the meeting and present the most important outcomes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Magnetars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the emission of gravitational waves produced by the magnetosphere of magnetars. We argue that several features in the spectrum could facilitate the identification of that source. In addition, in cases of extremely large magnetic fields we demonstrate that this emission can make the braking index of such stars to be well over 3, which is the standard prediction of the magnetic dipole radiation and aligned rotator mechanisms. A similar picture arises if one focuses on the second braking index. Moreover the braking index depends on both the rotational frequency and the strength of the magnetic field in striking difference from the other mechanisms. We also show that gravitational waves can be produced by polar gap regions due to their rapid charge-discharge process that takes place in timescales from nanosec to microsec. This can provide an alternative way to probe magnetars and test the polar gap model.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric Response for MeV $\mathrm{\gamma}$ Rays Observed with Balloon-Borne Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The atmospheric response for MeV $\gamma$ rays ($\sim$ 0.1 $-$ 10 MeV) can be characterized in terms of two observed components. The first component is due to photons that reach the detector without scattering. The second component is due to photons that reach the detector after scattering one or more times. While the former can be determined in a straightforward manner, the latter is much more complex to quantify, as it requires tracking the transport of all source photons that are incident on Earth's atmosphere. The scattered component can cause a significant energy-dependent distortion in the measured spectrum, which is important to account for when making balloon-borne observations. In this work we simulate the full response for $\gamma$-ray transport in the atmosphere. We find that the scattered component becomes increasingly more significant towards lower energies, and at 0.1 MeV it may increase the measured flux by as much as a factor of $\sim2-4$, depending on the photon index and off-axis angle of the source. This is particularly important for diffuse sources, whereas the effect from scattering can be significantly reduced for point sources observed with an imaging telescope.</description>

      <title>Cosmic ray diffusion in magnetic fields amplified by nonlinear turbulent dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diffusion of cosmic rays (CRs) in turbulent magnetic fields is fundamental to understand various astrophysical processes. We explore the CR diffusion in the magnetic luctuations amplified by the nonlinear turbulent dynamo, in the absence of a strong mean magnetic field. Using test particle simulations, we identify three distinct CR diffusion regimes: mirroring, wandering, and magnetic moment scattering (MMS). With highly inhomogeneous distribution of the dynamo-amplified magnetic fields, we find that the diffusion of CRs is also spatially inhomogeneous. Our results reveal that lower-energy CRs preferentially undergo the mirror and wandering diffusion in the strong-field regions, and the MMS diffusion in the weak-field regions. The former two diffusion mechanisms play a more important role toward lower CR energies, resulting in a relatively weak energy dependence of the overall CR mean free path. In contrast, higher-energy CRs predominantly undergo the MMS diffusion, for which the incomplete particle gyration in strong fields has a more significant effect than the nonresonant scattering by small-scale field tangling/reversal. Compared with lower-energy CRs, they are more poorly confined in space, and their mean free paths have a stronger energy dependence. We stress the fundamental role of magnetic field inhomogeneity of nonlinear turbulent dynamo in causing the different diffusion behavior of CRs compared to that in sub-Alfv\'enic MHD turbulence.</description>

      <title>Superbubbles as Galactic PeVatrons: The Potential Role of Rapid Second-Order Fermi Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of Galactic cosmic rays is still a mystery, in particular the sources and acceleration mechanism for cosmic rays with energies up to or beyond a PeV. Recently LHAASO has and H.E.S.S have shown that two gamma-ray sources associated with superbubbles created by young massive stellar clusters are likely PeVatrons. This has renewed the interest in the cosmic-ray acceleration processes in superbubbles.
  To study the possibility and conditions under which second-order Fermi acceleration can accelerate particles beyond PeV energies in superbubbles. An analytical equation is derived for the maximum energy a cosmic-ray particle can obtain as a function of acceleration duration. The maximum energy depends critically on the diffusion coefficient D and the Alfv\'en velocity, $V_A$. The analytical solutions for the acceleration time scale shows that second-order Fermi acceleration can be just as efficient as diffusive shock acceleration, when comparable relevant velocities are used-i.e. the Alfv\'en velocity or shock velocity. The probable values for the diffusion coefficient and Alv\'en speed are studied for two likely PeVatron regions, HESS J1646-458 associated with Westerlund 1, and the Cygnus Cocoon, associated Cyg OB2.
  It is shown that within a typical stellar cluster time scale of 1-5 Myr cosmic-rays can be accelerated to $&gt; 10^{15}$ eV, provided that $V_{\rm A} &gt; 300$ km/s, and the diffusion coefficient is $D \sim 10^{26}$ cm$^2$/s at 100 TeV. This suggests that second-order Fermi acceleration in superbubbles should be considered as a possible source of Galactic cosmic rays up to, or beyond a PeV.</description>

      <title>Prompt GRB recognition through waterfalls and deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) are one of the most energetic phenomena in the cosmos, whose study probes physics extremes beyond the reach of laboratories on Earth. Our quest to unravel the origin of these events and understand their underlying physics is far from complete. Central to this pursuit is the rapid classification of GRBs to guide follow-up observations and analysis across the electromagnetic spectrum and beyond. Here, we introduce a compelling approach for a new and robust GRB prompt classification. Leveraging self-supervised deep learning, we pioneer a previously unexplored data product to approach this task: the GRB waterfalls.</description>

      <title>Impact of nuclear matter properties on the nucleosynthesis and the kilonova from binary neutron star merger ejecta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Material expelled from binary neutron star (BNS) mergers can harbor r-process nucleosynthesis and power a Kilonova (KN), both intimately related to the astrophysical conditions of the ejection. In turn such conditions indirectly depend on the equation of state (EOS) describing matter inside the neutron star. Therefore, in principle the above observables can hold valuable information on nuclear matter, as the merger gravitational wave signal already does. In this work, we consider the outcome of a set of BNS merger simulations employing different finite-temperature nuclear EOSs. The latter are obtained from a Skyrme-type interaction model where nuclear properties, such as the incompressibility and the nucleon effective mass at saturation density, are systematically varied. We post-process the ejecta using a reaction network coupled with a semi-analytic KN model, to asses the sensitivity on the input EOS of the final yields and the KN light curves. Both of them are found to be non-trivially influenced by the EOS, with the overall outcome being dominated by the heterogeneous outflows from the remnant disk, hosting a variable degree of neutron-rich material. The dynamical ejecta can be more directly related to the EOS parameters considered, however, we find its role in the yields production and the KN emission too entangled with the other ejecta components, in order to infer solid correlations. This result highlights the strong degeneracy that intervenes between the merger outcome and the behaviour of the intrinsic nuclear matter, and places itself as a limit to the employment of EOS-constraining approaches of such kind.</description>

      <title>A $\gamma$-Ray Emitting Blazar at Redshift 3.64: Fermi-LAT and OVRO Observations of PKS 0201+113</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-redshift ($z &gt;3$) $\gamma$-ray blazars are rare, but they are crucial for our understanding of jet evolution, $\gamma$-ray production and propagation, and the growth of supermassive black holes in the early universe. A new analysis of Fermi-LAT data reveals a significant (5$\sigma$), spectrally soft ($\Gamma \simeq$ 3.0) $\gamma$-ray source in a specific 4-month epoch, cospatial with PKS 0201+113 ($z$ = 3.64). Monitoring of PKS 0201+113 at 15 GHz by the Owens Valley Radio Observatory 40 m Telescope from 2008 to 2023 shows a prominent flare that dominates the radio light curve. The maximum of the radio flare coincides with the $\gamma$-ray flare, strongly suggesting an association ($\textrm{p-value}=0.023$) between the $\gamma$-ray and the radio sources. PKS 0201+113 is only the third $\gamma$-ray blazar to be identified with $z&gt; 3.5$, and it is the first such object to be identified by the detection of quasi-simultaneous $\gamma$-ray and radio flares. The jet properties of this peculiar blazar have been investigated. A detailed study of a two-zone leptonic model is presented that fits the broadband spectral energy distribution. An alternative scenario is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>The formation rate and luminosity function of fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration flashes with unknown origins. Its formation rate is crucial for unveiling physical origins. However, the luminosity and formation rate are degenerated when directly fitting the redshift distribution of FRBs. In contrast to previous forward-fitting methods, we use the Lynden-Bell's $c^{-}$ method to derive luminosity function and formation rate of FRBs without any assumptions. Using the non-repeating FRBs from the first CHIME/FRB catalog, we find a relatively strong luminosity evolution, and luminosity function can be fitted by a broken power-law model with a break at $1.33\times10^{41}\ \mathrm{erg}\ \mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The formation rate declines rapidly as $(1+z)^{-4.9\pm0.3}$ with a local rate $1.13\times10^4\ \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. This monotonic decrease is similar to the rate of short gamma-ray bursts. After comparing it with star formation rate and stellar mass density, we conclude that the old populations including neutron stars and black holes, are closely related to the origins of FRBs. Monte Carlo simulations are used to test our results. The distributions of mock sample are consistent with the observational data.</description>

      <title>Repeating nuclear transients from repeating partial tidal disruption events: reproducing ASASSN-14ko and AT2020vdq</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some electromagnetic outbursts from the nuclei of distant galaxies have been found to repeat on months-to-years timescales, and each of these sources can putatively arise from the accretion flares generated through the repeated tidal stripping of a star on a bound orbit about a supermassive black hole (SMBH), i.e., a repeating partial tidal disruption event (rpTDE). Here we test the rpTDE model through analytical estimates and hydrodynamical simulations of the interaction between a range of stars, which differ from one another in mass and age, and an SMBH. We show that higher-mass ($\gtrsim 1 M_{\odot}$), evolved stars can survive many ($\gtrsim 10-100$) encounters with an SMBH while simultaneously losing $few \times 0.01 M_{\odot}$, resulting in accretion flares that are approximately evenly spaced in time with nearly the same amplitude, quantitatively reproducing ASASSN-14ko. We also show that the energy imparted to the star via tides can lead to a change in its orbital period that is comparable to the observed decay in the recurrence time of ASASSN-14ko's flares, $\dot{P}\simeq-0.0016$. Contrarily, lower-mass and less-evolved stars lose progressively more mass and produce brighter accretion flares on subsequent encounters for the same pericenter distances, leading to the rapid destruction of the star and cessation of flares. Such systems cannot reproduce ASASSN-14ko-like transients, but are promising candidates for recreating events such as AT2020vdq, which displayed a second and much brighter outburst compared to the first. Our results imply that the lightcurves of repeating transients are tightly coupled with stellar type.</description>

      <title>Precise measurement of pion-bump structure using future MeV gamma-ray detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pion-bump structure in the gamma-ray spectrum is a direct proof for the hadronic origin of the gamma rays, and thus the decisive evidence for the acceleration of hadronic cosmic rays in astrophysical objects. However, the identification of such a spectral feature is limited by the resolution and energy coverage of current gamma-ray instruments. Furthermore, there are unavoidable bremsstrahlung emissions from secondary and primary electrons, which may dominate the gamma-ray emission below the pion-bump. Thus, the study of this gamma-ray emission component can provide unique information on the acceleration and confinement of high-energy particles. In this paper, we studied the predicted gamma-ray spectrum assuming both hadronic or leptonic origin in mid-aged supernova remnants W44, we discuss the detection potential of future MeV missions on these emissions and possible implications.</description>

      <title>Gamma Ray AGNs: Estimating Redshifts and Blazar Classification using traditional Neural Networks with smart initialization and self-supervised learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Redshift estimation and the classification of gamma-ray AGNs represent crucial challenges in the field of gamma-ray astronomy. Recent efforts have been made to tackle these problems using traditional machine learning methods. However, the simplicity of existing algorithms, combined with their basic implementations, underscores an opportunity and a need for further advancement in this area. Our approach begins by implementing a Bayesian model for redshift estimation, which can account for uncertainty while providing predictions with the desired confidence level. Subsequently, we address the classification problem by leveraging intelligent initialization techniques and employing soft voting. Additionally, we explore several potential self-supervised algorithms in their conventional form. Lastly, in addition to generating predictions for data with missing outputs, we ensure that the theoretical assertions put forth by both algorithms mutually reinforce each other.</description>

      <title>Increasing the detectability of long-period and nulling pulsars in next-generation pulsar surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent discoveries of multiple long-period pulsars (periods ${\sim}10\,$s or larger) are starting to challenge the conventional notion that coherent radio emission cannot be produced by objects that are below the many theorised death lines. Many of the past pulsar surveys and software have been prone to selection effects that restricted their sensitivities towards long-period and sporadically-emitting objects. Pulsar surveys using new-generation low-frequency facilities are starting to employ longer dwell times, which makes them significantly more sensitive in detecting long-period or nulling pulsars. There have also been software advancements to aid more sensitive searches towards long-period objects. Furthermore, recent discoveries suggest that nulling may be a key aspect of the long-period pulsar population. We simulate both long-period and nulling pulsar signals, using the Southern-sky MWA Rapid Two-meter (SMART) survey data as reference, and explore the detection efficacy of popular search methods such as the fast Fourier transform (FFT), fast-folding algorithm (FFA) and single pulse search (SPS). For FFT-based search and SPS, we make use of the PRESTO implementation, and for FFA we use RIPTIDE. We find RIPTIDE's FFA to be more sensitive; however, it is also the slowest algorithm. PRESTO's FFT, although faster than others, also shows some unexpected inaccuracies in detection properties. SPS is highly sensitive to long-period and nulling signals, but only for pulses with high intrinsic signal-to-noise ratios. We use these findings to inform current and future pulsar surveys that aim to uncover a large population of long-period or nulling objects and comment on how to make optimal use of these methods in unison.</description>

      <title>Time delay of fast radio burst population with respect to the star formation history</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In spite of significant progress in the research of fast radio bursts (FRBs) in recent decade, their origin is still under extensive debate. Investigation on the population of FRBs can provide new insight into this interesting problem. In this paper, based on the first CHIME/FRB catalog, we construct a Bayesian framework to analyze the FRB population, with the selection effect of the CHIME telescope being properly taken into account. The energy function is modeled as the power-law with an exponential cutoff. Four redshift distribution models are considered, i.e., the star formation history (SFH) model, and three time-delayed models (Gaussian delay, log-normal delay, and power-law delay). The free parameters are simultaneously constrained using Bayesian inference method, and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) is used in model comparison. According to BIC, the log-normal delay model fits the data best. The power-law delay model and Gaussian delay model can also give reasonable fits, although they are not as good as the log-normal delay model. However, the SFH model is strongly disfavored compared with the three time-delayed models. The energy function is tightly constrained and is almost independent of the redshift models, with the best-fitting power-law index $\alpha\approx 1.8$, and cut-off energy $\log(E_c/{\rm erg})\approx 42$. The FRB population shows on average $3\sim 5$ billion years time delay with respect to the SFH. Therefore, the hypothesis that the FRB population traces the SFH is conclusively ruled out.</description>

Abstract: We report data analysis results about the outburst evolution and spectral properties during the hard state of the recently discovered X-ray transient Swift J1727.8-163 as observed by \emph{Insight}-HXMT and NuSTAR. We find that the broadband X-ray spectrum of Swift J1727.8-163 is more complex than the most typical spectral patterns of black hole X-ray binary systems, with not only a comparatively weaker reflection component but also an additional spectral continuum component, manifesting itself as a hard X-ray tail beyond the thermal Comptonization description detectable below 100 keV. This additional component can be phenomenologically well fitted by adding an extra power-law model with high energy exponential cutoff in the 2-120 keV energy band. We made an attempt to explain the broadband X-ray spectral continuum with a thermal/non-thermal hybrid plasma corona scenario , and find an ultra high compactness parameter ($l_{\rm s}\sim2000$) and a steep non-thermal electron distribution ($\Gamma_{\rm inj}&gt;4$), suggesting the source was accreting with high Eddington rates and that the electron acceleration mechanism is not very efficient. We also present a detailed multi-epoch analysis of spectral properties using \emph{Insight}-HXMT data to investigate the evolution of the key physical properties regarding the disk and corona during the hard states. No significant variation is found with the inner disk radius and the coronal temperature during this time period, and the weak reflection and hard X-ray tail features are persistent. We discuss the physical implications of our spectral analysis results in the context of disk-corona relation, particle acceleration, and jet contribution, during the rise of a black hole X-ray binary in outburst.</description>

      <title>Gamma-ray burst interaction with the circumburst medium: The CBM phase of GRBs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Progenitor stars of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) could be surrounded by a significant and complex nebula structure lying at a parsec scale distance. After the initial release of energy from the GRB jet, the jet will interact with this nebula environment. We show here that for a large, plausible parameter space region, the interaction between the jet blastwave and the wind termination (reverse) shock is expected to be weak, and may be associated with a precursor emission. As the jet blast wave encounters the contact discontinuity separating the shocked wind and the shocked interstellar medium, we find that a bright flash of synchrotron emission from the newly-formed reverse shock is produced. This flash is expected to be observed at around ~100 s after the initial explosion and precursor. Such a delayed emission thus constitutes a circumburst medium (CBM) phase in a GRB, having a physically distinct origin from the preceding prompt phase and the succeeding afterglow phase. The CBM phase emission may thus provide a natural explanation to bursts observed to have a precursor followed by an intense, synchrotron-dominated main episode that is found in a substantial minority, ~10% of GRBs. A correct identification of the emission phase is thus required to infer the properties of the flow and of the immediate environment around GRB progenitors.</description>

      <title>Flux-density stability and temporal changes in spectra of millisecond pulsars using GMRT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an investigation of spectral properties of 10 millisecond pulsars (MSPs) discovered by the uGMRT, observed from 2017-2023 using band 3 (300-500 MHz) and 4 (550-750 MHz) of uGMRT. For these MSPs, we have reported a range of spectral indices from ~0 to -4.8, while averaging the full observing band and all the observing epochs. For every MSP, we calculated the mean flux densities across 7-8 sub-bands each with approximately 25 MHz bandwidth spanning band 3 and band 4. We computed their modulation indices as well as average and maximum-to-median flux densities within each subband. Using a temporal variation of flux density we calculated the refractive scintillation time scales and estimated structure function with time lag for 8 MSPs in the sample. We note a significant temporal evolution of the in-band spectra, classified into three categories based on the nature of the best-fit power-law spectra, having single positive spectral indices, multiple broken power law, and single negative spectral indices. Additionally, indications of low-frequency turnover and a temporal variation of the turnover frequency (to the extent that turnover was observed for some of the epochs while not seen for the rest) were noted for all the MSPs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic investigation probing temporal changes in the MSP spectra as well as in turnover frequency. Future exploration with dense monitoring combined with modeling of spectra can provide vital insight into the intrinsic emission properties of the MSPs and ISM properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schaefer (2024) has recently published observations of binary period derivatives $\dot P$ for 52 cataclysmic variables, and concluded that these strongly conflict with all proposed evolutionary pictures for these systems. We point out once again that using measurements of $\dot P$ is likely in practice to produce misleading evolutionary constraints in almost every case. The one identified exception to this is probably the recently-born X-ray binary SN 2022jli, because of its extremely high mass transfer rate.</description>

      <title>Numerical Simulation of Radiatively driven Transonic Relativistic Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform the numerical simulations of axisymmetric, relativistic, optically thin jets under the influence of the radiation field of an accretion disk. We show that starting from a very low injection velocity at the base, jets can be accelerated to relativistic terminal speeds when traveling through the radiation field. The jet gains momentum through the interaction with the radiation field. We use a relativistic equation of state for multi-species plasma, which self-consistently calculates the adiabatic index for the jet material. All the jet solutions obtained are transonic in nature. In addition to the acceleration of the jet to relativistic speeds, our results show that the radiation field also acts as a collimating agent. The jets remain well collimated under the effect of radiation pressure. We also show that if the jet starts with a rotational velocity, the radiation field will reduce the angular momentum of the jet beam.</description>

      <title>Galactic center GeV excess and classification of Fermi-LAT sources with machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excess of gamma rays with a spherical morphology around the Galactic center (GC) observed in the Fermi large area telescope (LAT) data is one of the most intriguing features in the gamma-ray sky. The excess has been interpreted by annihilating dark matter as well as emission from a population of unresolved millisecond pulsars (MSPs). We use a multi-class classification of Fermi-LAT sources with machine learning to study the distribution of MSP-like sources among unassociated Fermi-LAT sources near the GC. We find that the source count distribution of MSP-like sources is comparable with the MSP explanation of the GC excess.</description>

      <title>Contribution of young massive star clusters to Galactic diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Young massive stellar clusters (YMSCs) have emerged as potential $\gamma$-ray sources, after the recent association of a dozen YMSCs with extended $\gamma$-ray emission. The large size of the detected halos, comparable to that of the wind-blown bubble expected around YMSCs, makes the $\gamma$-ray detection of individual YMSCs rather challenging. As a result, the emission from most of the Galactic YMSCs could be unresolved, thus contributing to the diffuse $\gamma$-ray radiation observed along the Galactic Plane.
  Aims: In this study, we estimate the possible contribution to the Galactic diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission from a synthetic population of YMSCs, and we compare it with observations obtained with different experiments, from 1 GeV to hundreds of TeV, in two regions of the Galactic Plane.
  Methods: As the population of galactic YMSCs is only known locally, we evaluate the contribution of $\gamma$-ray emission relying on the simulation of synthetic populations of YMSCs based on the observed properties of local clusters. We compute the $\gamma$-ray emission from each cluster assuming that the radiation is purely hadronic in nature and produced by cosmic rays accelerated at the cluster's collective wind termination shock.
  Results: We find that the $\gamma$-ray emission from unresolved YMSCs can significantly contribute to the observed Galactic diffuse flux, especially in the inner part of the Galaxy. The result is independent of the assumed particle transport, but an important role is played by Wolf-Rayet stars. The predicted $\gamma$-ray flux should be considered as a lower limit, given that our calculation neglects the contribution of supernovae exploding in YMSCs.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Rotational Deathline: Radio Emission from Ultra-long Period Magnetars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent detection of ultra-long period radio transients, we investigate new models of coherent radio emission via low-altitude electron-positron pair production in neutron stars beyond rotationally-powered curvature radiation deathlines. We find that plastic motion (akin to 'continental drift') and qualitatively similar thermoelectric action by temperature gradients in the crusts of slowly rotating, highly magnetized neutron stars could impart mild local magnetospheric twists. Regardless of which mechanism drives twists, we find that particle acceleration initiates pair cascades across charge-starved gaps above a mild critical twist. Cascades are initiated via resonant inverse-Compton scattered photons or curvature radiation, and may produce broadband coherent radio emission. We compute the pair luminosity (maximum allowed radio luminosity) for these two channels, and derive deathlines and 'active zones' in $P-\dot{P}$ space from a variety of considerations. We find these twist-initiated pair cascades only occur for magnetar-like field strengths $B \gtrsim 10^{14}$ G and long periods: $P_{\rm RICS} \gtrsim 120 \; (T/10^{6.5} {\rm K})^{-5} \, {\rm sec}$ and $P_{\rm curv} \gtrsim 150 \; ({\rm v_{\rm pl}}/10^{3} {\, \rm cm \, yr^{-1}})^{-7/6} \, {\rm sec}$. Using a simplified geometric model, we find that plastic motion or thermoelectrically driven twists might naturally reproduce the observed luminosities, timescales, and timing signatures. We further derive 'active zones' in which rotationally-powered pair creation occurs via resonantly scattered photons, beyond standard curvature deathlines for pulsars. All cascades are generically accompanied by simultaneous (non-)thermal X-ray/UV counterparts which might be detectable with current instrumentation.</description>

      <title>An explanation for the absence of echoes in black hole light curve autocorrelations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observed radiation from hot gas accreting onto a black hole depends on both the details of the flow and the spacetime geometry. The lensing behavior of a black hole produces a distinctive pattern of autocorrelations within its photon ring that encodes its mass, spin, and inclination. In particular, the time autocorrelation of the light curve is expected to display a series of peaks produced by light echoes of the source, with each peak delayed by the characteristic time lapse $\tau$ between light echoes. However, such peaks are absent from the light curves of observed black holes. Here, we develop an analytical model for such light curves that demonstrates how, even though light echoes always exist in the signal, they do not produce autocorrelation peaks if the characteristic correlation timescale $\lambda_0$ of the source is greater than $\tau$. We validate our model against simulated light curves of a stochastic accretion model ray traced with a general-relativistic code, and then fit the model to an observed light curve for Sgr A*. We infer that $\lambda_0&gt;\tau$, providing an explanation for the absence of light echoes in the time autocorrelations of Sgr A* light curves. Our results highlight the importance for black hole parameter inference of spatially resolving the photon ring via future space-based interferometry.</description>

      <title>Objects May Be Closer Than They Appear: Significant Host Galaxy Dispersion Measures of Fast Radio Bursts in Zoom-in Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the contribution of host galaxies to the overall Dispersion Measures (DMs) for Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) using the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE-2) cosmological zoom-in simulation suite. We calculate DMs from every star particle in the simulated L* galaxies by ray-tracing through their multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM), summing the line-of-sight free thermal electron column for all gas elements within $\pm$20 kpc of the galactic mid-plane. At $z=0$, we find average (median) host-galaxy DMs of 74 (43) and 210 (94) pc cm$^{-3}$ for older ($\gtrsim$10 Myr) and younger ($\lesssim$10 Myr) stellar populations, respectively. Inclination raises the median DM measured for older populations ($\gtrsim$10 Myr) in the simulations by a factor of $\sim$2, but generally does not affect the younger stars deeply embedded in H{\small II} regions except in extreme edge-on cases (inclination $\gtrsim 85^\circ$). In kinematically disturbed snapshots ($z = 1$ in FIRE), the average (median) host-galaxy DMs are higher: 80 (107) and 266 (795) pc cm$^{-3}$ for older ($\gtrsim$10 Myr) and younger ($\lesssim$10 Myr) stellar populations, respectively. FIRE galaxies tend to have higher DM values than cosmological simulations such as IllustrisTNG. As a result, FRB host galaxies may be closer (lower redshift) than previously inferred. Furthermore, constraining host-galaxy DM distributions may help significantly constrain FRB progenitor models.</description>

      <title>Tests of General Relativity with GW230529: a neutron star merging with a lower mass-gap compact object</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On 29 May 2023, the LIGO Livingston observatory detected the gravitational-wave signal GW230529_181500 from the merger of a neutron star with a lower mass-gap compact object. Its long inspiral signal provides a unique opportunity to test General Relativity (GR) in a parameter space previously unexplored by strong-field tests. In this work, we performed parameterized inspiral tests of GR with GW230529_181500. Specifically, we search for deviations in the frequency-domain GW phase by allowing for agnostic corrections to the post-Newtonian coefficients. We performed tests with the Flexible Theory Independent (FTI) and Test Infrastructure for General Relativity (TIGER) frameworks using several quasi-circular waveform models that capture different physical effects (higher modes, spins, tides). We find that the signal is consistent with GR for all deviation parameters. Assuming the primary object is a black hole, we obtain particularly tight constraints on the dipole radiation at $-1$PN order of $|\delta\hat{\varphi}_{-2}| \lesssim 8 \times 10^{-5}$, which is a factor $\sim17$ times more stringent than previous bounds from the neutron star--black hole merger GW200115_042309, as well as on the 0.5PN and 1PN deviation parameters. We discuss some challenges that arise when analyzing this signal, namely biases due to correlations with tidal effects and the degeneracy between the 0PN deviation parameter and the chirp mass. To illustrate the importance of GW230529_181500 for tests of GR, we mapped the agnostic $-1$PN results to a class of Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet (ESGB) theories of gravity. We also conducted an analysis probing the specific phase deviation expected in ESGB theory and obtain an upper bound on the Gauss-Bonnet coupling of $\ell_{\rm GB} \lesssim 0.51~\rm{M}_\odot$ ($\sqrt{\alpha_{\rm GB}} \lesssim 0.28$ km), which is better than any previously reported constraint.</description>

      <title>Does the Sun have a Dark Disk?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sun is not quite a perfect sphere, and its oblateness, thought to be induced through its rotation, has been measured using optical observations of its radius. Its gravitational quadrupole moment can then be deduced using solar models, or through helioseismology, and it can also be determined from measurements of its gravitational effects on Mercury's orbit. The various assessments do not agree, with the most complete and precise orbital assessments being in slight excess of other determinations. This may speak to the existence of a non-luminous disk or ring, where we also note evidence for a circumsolar dust ring within Mercury's orbit from the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) mission. Historically, too, a protoplanetary disk may have been key to reconciling the Sun's metallicity with its neutrino yield.
  The distribution of the non-luminous mass within Mercury's orbit can modify the relative size of the optical and orbital quadrupole moments in different ways. We develop how we can use these findings to limit a dark disk, ring, or halo in the immediate vicinity of the Sun, and we note how future orbital measurements of Mercury and near-Sun asteroids can refine these constraints.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the accretion disc spectra of Dwarf Novae and Novalike variables: implications for the standard disc model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accretion discs are fundamental to much of astronomy. They can occur around stars both young and old, around compact objects they provide a window into the extremes of physics, and around supermassive black holes in galaxy centres they generate spectacular luminosities that can outshine the entire galaxy. However, our understanding of the inner workings of accretion discs remains far from complete. Here we revisit a conundrum in the observations of some of the simplest accreting systems; the Cataclysmic Variables (CVs). The high-accretion-rate states of (non-magnetic) CVs can be divided into the short-lived outbursts ($\sim$ a week) typical of dwarf novae (DNe) and the long-lived (and sometimes perpetual) high states of nova-like (NL) CVs. Since both sorts of high-state occur in approximately steady-state accretion discs with similar properties and accretors, we would expect them to display similar spectral energy distributions. However, previous analyses based on UV spectra from the {\it International Ultraviolet Explorer} have shown that their spectral energy distributions are different. We perform a re-analysis of the data using up to date calibrations and distance (and thus dereddening) estimates to test whether this difference persists and whether it is statistically significant over the sample. We find that it does persist and it is statistically significant. We propose routes to investigating this discrepancy further and discuss the implications this has for other accreting systems, such as X-ray binaries, Active Galactic Nuclei and protoplanetary discs.</description>

      <title>Shockingly Bright Warm Carbon Monoxide Molecular Features in the Supernova Remnant Cassiopeia A Revealed by JWST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present JWST NIRCam (F356W and F444W filters) and MIRI (F770W) images and NIRSpec- IFU spectroscopy of the young supernova remnant Cassiopeia A (Cas A). We obtained the data as part of a JWST survey of Cas A. The NIRCam and MIRI images map the spatial distributions of synchrotron radiation, Ar-rich ejecta, and CO on both large and small scales, revealing remarkably complex structures. The CO emission is stronger at the outer layers than the Ar ejecta, which indicates the reformation of CO molecules behind the reverse shock. NIRSpec-IFU spectra (3 - 5.5 microns) were obtained toward two representative knots in the NE and S fields. Both regions are dominated by the bright fundamental rovibrational band of CO in the two R and P branches, with strong [Ar VI] and relatively weaker, variable strength ejecta lines of [Si IX], [Ca IV], [Ca V] and [Mg IV]. The NIRSpec-IFU data resolve individual ejecta knots and filaments spatially and in velocity space. The fundamental CO band in the JWST spectra reveals unique shapes of CO, showing a few tens of sinusoidal patterns of rovibrational lines with pseudo-continuum underneath, which is attributed to the high-velocity widths of CO lines. The CO also shows high J lines at different vibrational transitions. Our results with LTE modeling of CO emission indicate a temperature of 1080 K and provide unique insight into the correlations between dust, molecules, and highly ionized ejecta in supernovae, and have strong ramifications for modeling dust formation that is led by CO cooling in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Estimate for the neutrino magnetic moment from pulsar kick velocities induced at the birth of strange quark matter neutron stars</title>

Abstract: We estimate the magnetic moment of electron neutrinos by computing the neutrino chirality flip rate that can occur in the core of a strange quark matter neutron star at birth. We show that this process allows neutrinos to anisotropically escape thus inducing the star kick velocity. The process is not subject to the no-go theorem since, although the flip from left- to right-handed neutrinos happens at equilibrium, the reverse process does not take place, given that right-handed neutrinos do not interact with matter and therefore detailed balance is lost. For simplicity, we model the star core as consisting of strange quark matter. We find that even when the energy released in right-handed neutrinos is a small fraction of the total energy released in left-handed neutrinos, the process describes kick velocities for natal conditions which are consistent with the observed ones and span the correct range of radii, temperatures and chemical potentials for typical magnetic field intensities. The neutrino magnetic moment is estimated to be $\mu_\nu \sim 3.6 \times 10^{-18}\mu_B$, where $\mu_B$ is the Bohr magneton. This value is more stringent than the bound found for massive neutrinos in a minimal extension of the standard model.</description>

      <title>PREX and CREX: Evidence for Strong Isovector Spin-Orbit Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent PREX-2 and CREX data on the model-independent extraction of the charge-weak form factor difference $\Delta F_{\rm CW}$ in $^{208}$Pb and $^{48}$Ca challenge modern nuclear energy density functionals (EDFs) as well as our present understanding on the neutron skin and nuclear symmetry energy. Within the Skyrme-like EDFs, we demonstrate that the isovector spin-orbit interaction can strongly change the $\Delta F_{\rm CW}$ in $^{48}$Ca while it has essentially no influence on the $\Delta F_{\rm CW}$ in $^{208}$Pb, mainly due to the eight spin-orbit unpaired $1f_{7/2}$ neutrons in $^{48}$Ca. To simultaneously describe PREX-2 and CREX data in $1\sigma$ error, we find the strength of isovector spin-orbit interaction should be larger than about four times of that in the conventional Skyrme-like EDFs, implying the neutrons and protons have significantly different spin-orbit interaction. To further reconcile the data on electric dipole polarizability in $^{208}$Pb and $^{48}$Ca, we obtain $L \approx 55$ MeV for the slope parameter of the symmetry energy, $\Delta r_{\rm np}(^{208}\rm{Pb}) \approx 0.19$ fm and $\Delta r_{\rm np}(^{48}\rm{Ca}) \approx 0.12$ fm for the neutron skin thickness. The implications of the strong isovector spin-orbit interaction are discussed.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on phenomenological emergent dark energy and barotropic dark matter characterized by a constant equation of state parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new cosmological model that considers dark matter as a barotropic fluid with a constant equation of state parameter and interprets dark energy as the phenomenological emergent dark energy rather than a cosmological constant. This proposal is based on extensive research on the extended properties of dark matter in the context of a cosmological constant and the intriguing findings that have emerged from our exploration of dark matter properties within the context of PEDE in our previous studies. We then place constraints on this model in light of the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies, baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, the Pantheon compilation of Type Ia supernovae, a prior on $H_0$ that based on the latest local measurement by Riess et al., and the combination of KiDS and the VISTA Kilo-Degree Infrared Galaxy Survey (KiDS+VIKING-450). The results indicate a preference for a positive dark matter equation of state parameter at 68\% confidence level for CMB+BAO, CMB+BAO+Pantheon and CMB+BAO+Pantheon+$H_0$ datasets. Furthermore, the Hubble tension between all of the datasets we used with R22 is very close to those of the PEDE, and the $S_8$ tension between Planck 2018 and KiDS+VIKING-450 is reduced from 2.3$\sigma$ in the PEDE model to 0.4$\sigma$ in the new model. However, Bayesian evidence indicates that PEDE favors our new model with very strong evidence from all the datasets considered in this study. Consequently, we conclude that the PEDE+$w_{\rm dm}$ model is not a viable alternative to the PEDE model.</description>

      <title>The Vela Pulsar Progenitor Was Most Likely a Binary Merger</title>

Abstract: Stellar evolution theory restricted to single stars predicts a minimum mass for core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) of around eight solar masses; this minimum mass corresponds to a maximum age of around 45 million years for the progenitor and the coeval population of stars. Binary evolution complicates this prediction. For example, an older stellar population around 100 million years could contain stellar mergers that reach the minimum mass for core collapse. Despite this clear prediction by binary evolution, there are few, if any CCSNe associated with a distinctly older stellar population...until now. The stellar population within 150 pc of the Vela Pulsar is inconsistent with single-star evolution only; instead, the most likely solution is that the stellar population is $\ge$80 Myr old, and the brightest stars are mass gainers and/or mergers, the result of binary evolution. The evidence is as follows. Even though the main sequence is clearly dominated by a $\ge$80-Myr-old population, a large fraction of the corresponding red giants is missing. The best-fitting single-star model expects 51.5 red giants, yet there are only 22; the Poisson probability of this is $1.7 \times 10^{-6}$. In addition, there is an overabundance of bright, young-looking stars (25-30 Myrs old), yet there is not a corresponding young main sequence (MS). Upon closer inspection, the vast majority of the young-looking stars show either past or current signs of binary evolution. These new results are possible due to exquisite Gaia parallaxes and a new age-dating software called {\it Stellar Ages}.</description>

      <title>Unified Rapid Mass Transfer</title>

Abstract: We present a method to obtain rapid mass loss rates in binary systems, specifically at the onset of MT episodes. The method unifies atmospheric (underflow) and $L_1$ stream (overflow) mass rates in a single continuous procedure. The method uses averaged 3D properties of the binaries, such as effective binary potential and effective binary acceleration, to both evolve the donor and obtain properties of the matter at the $L_1$ plane. In the case of underflow, we obtain atmospheric stratification. Our method can be used for binaries with an extensive range of mass ratios, $0.01 \le q \le 100$, and can also be applied to hot donors. The considered examples show that the MT rates obtained with this revised formalism always differ from the optically thin and optically thick MT rates widely used during the computations of binary evolution.</description>

      <title>Non-thermal radiation from dual jet interactions in supermassive black hole binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) are natural by-products of galaxy mergers and are expected to be powerful multi-messenger sources. They can be powered by the accretion of matter and then radiate across the electromagnetic spectrum, much like normal active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Current electromagnetic observatories have a good chance of detecting and identifying these systems in the near future. However, precise observational indicators are needed to distinguish individual AGNs from SMBHBs. In this paper, we propose a novel electromagnetic signature from SMBHBs: non-thermal emission produced by the interaction between the jets ejected by the black holes. We study close SMBHBs, which accrete matter from a circumbinary disc and the mini-discs formed around each hole. Each black hole ejects a magnetically dominated jet in the direction of its spin through the Blandford--Znajeck mechanism. We argue that in such a situation, the interaction between the jets can trigger strong magnetic reconnection events, where particles are accelerated and emit non-thermal radiation. Depending on whether the jets are aligned or misaligned, this radiation can have different periodicities. We model the evolution of the particles accelerated during the dual jet interaction and calculate their radiative output, obtaining spectra and providing estimates for the variability timescales. We finally discuss how this emission compares with that of normal AGNs.</description>

      <title>Accretion Flow Properties of EXO 1846-031 During its Multi-Peaked Outburst After Long Quiescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the recent outburst of the black hole candidate EXO 1846-031 which went into an outburst in 2019 after almost 34 years in quiescence. We use archival data from Swift/XRT, MAXI/GSC, NICER/XTI and NuSTAR/FPM satellites/instruments to study the evolution of the spectral and temporal properties of the source during the outburst. Low energy (2-10 keV) X-ray flux of the outburst shows multiple peaks making it a multipeak outburst. Evolving type-C quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are observed in the NICER data in the hard, hard intermediate and soft intermediate states. We use the physical Two Component Advective Flow (TCAF) model to analyze the combined spectra of multiple satellite instruments. According to the TCAF model, the accreting matter is divided into Keplerian and sub-Keplerian parts, and the variation in the observed spectra in different spectral states arises out of the variable contributions of these two types of accreting matter in the total accretion rate. Studying the evolution of the accretion rates and other properties of the accretion flow obtained from the spectral analysis, we show how the multiple peaks in the outburst flux arises out of variable supply of accreting matter from the pile-up radius. We determine the probable mass of the black hole to be $10.4^{+0.1}_{-0.2}~M_\odot$ from the spectral analysis with the TCAF model. We also estimate viscous time scale of the source in this outburst to be $\sim 8$ days from the peak difference of the Keplerian and sub-Keplerian mass accretion rates.</description>

      <title>Gamma rays from dark matter spikes in EAGLE simulations</title>

Abstract: Intermediate Mass Black Holes (IMBHs) with a mass range between $100 \, \text{M}_\odot$ and $10^6 \, \text{M}_\odot$ are expected to be surrounded by high dark matter densities, so-called dark matter spikes. The high density of self-annihilating Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) in these spikes leads to copious gamma-ray production. Sufficiently nearby IMBHs could therefore appear as unidentified gamma-ray sources. However, the number of IMBHs and their distribution within our own Milky Way is currently unknown. In this work, we provide a mock catalogue of IMBHs and their dark matter spikes obtained from the EAGLE simulations, in which black holes with a mass of $10^5 \, \text{M}_\odot/h$ are seeded into the centre of halos greater than $10^{10} \, \text{M}_\odot/h$ to model black hole feedback influencing the formation of galaxies. The catalogue contains the coordinates and dark matter spike parameters for over 2500 IMBHs present in about 150 Milky Way-like galaxies. We expect about $15^{+9}_{-6}$ IMBHs within our own galaxy, mainly distributed in the Galactic Centre and the Galactic Plane. In the most optimistic scenario, we find that current and future gamma-ray observatories, such as Fermi-LAT, H.E.S.S. and CTA, would be sensitive enough to probe the cross section of dark matter self-annihilation around IMBHs down to many orders of magnitude below the thermal relic cross section for dark matter particles with masses from GeV to TeV. We have made the IMBH mock catalogue and the source code for our analysis publicly available, providing the resources to study dark matter self-annihilation around IMBHs with current and upcoming gamma-ray observatories.</description>

      <title>Extended emission line regions in post-starburst galaxies hosting tidal disruption events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of an extended emission line region (EELR) in MUSE observations of Markarian 950, a nearby ($z=0.01628$) post-starburst (PSB) galaxy that hosted the tidal disruption event (TDE) iPTF-16fnl. The EELR requires a non-stellar ionizing continuum with a luminosity L$_{\rm ion, min} \gtrsim 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, inconsistent with the current weak state (L$_{\rm IR,AGN} &lt; 2.5 \times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$) of the galactic nucleus. The ionized gas has low velocity ($\sim$-50 km s$^{-1}$) and low turbulence ($\sigma_{\rm gas} \lesssim$ 50 km s$^{-1}$), and is kinematically decoupled from the stellar motions, indicating that the gas kinematics are not AGN driven. Markarian 950 is the third post-starburst galaxy to host a weak nuclear ionizing source as well as an EELR and a TDE. The overall properties of these three galaxies, including the kinematics and accretion history, are unusual but strikingly similar. We estimate that the incidence of EELRs in PSB-TDE hosts is a factor of $\sim 10 \times$ higher than in other PSB galaxies. This suggests that a gas-rich post-merger environment is a key ingredient in driving elevated TDE rates. Based on the current observations, we cannot rule out that the EELRs may be powered through an elevated TDE rate in these galaxies. If the EELRs are not TDE-powered, the presence of intermittent AGN activity, and in particular the fading of the AGN, may be associated with an increased TDE rate and/or an increased rate of detecting TDEs.</description>
