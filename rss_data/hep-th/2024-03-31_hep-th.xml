      <title>Vortical waves in a quantum fluid with vector, axial and helical charges. I. Non-dissipative transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the spin-orbit coupling, Dirac fermions, submerged in a thermal bath with finite macroscopic vorticity, exhibit a spin polarisation along the direction parallel to the vorticity vector $\boldsymbol{\Omega}$. Due to the symmetries of the Lagrangian for free massless Dirac particles, there are three independent and classically conserved currents corresponding to the vector, axial, and helical charges. The constitutive relations for the charge currents and the stress-energy tensor at thermal equilibrium, derived in the framework of quantum field theory at finite temperature, reveal vorticity-induced contributions that deviate from the perfect fluid form. In this paper, we consider the mode structure of the corresponding hydrodynamical theory and derive collective excitations associated with coherent fluctuations of all three charges. We show that the chirally imbalanced rotating fluid should possess non-reciprocal gapless waves that propagate with different velocities along and opposite to the vorticity vector. We also uncover a strictly unidirectional mode, which we call the Axial Vortical Wave, propagating in the background of the axial charge density. We point out an unexpected instability in the limit of degenerate matter and discuss possible solutions when helicity and axial charge non-conservation is taken into account.</description>

      <title>Vortical waves in a quantum fluid with vector, axial and helical charges. II. Dissipative effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the effect of interactions on the local, average polarization of a quantum plasma of massless fermion particles characterized by vector, axial, and helical quantum numbers. Due to the helical and axial vortical effects, perturbations in the vector charge in a rotating plasma can lead to chiral and helical charge transfer along the direction of the vorticity vector. At the same time, interactions between the plasma constituents lead to the dissipation of the helical charge through helicity-violating pair annihilation (HVPA) processes and of the axial charge through the axial anomaly. We will discuss separately a QED-like plasma, in which we ignore background electromagnetic fields and thus the axial charge is roughly conserved, as well as a QCD-like plasma, where instanton effects lead to the violation of the axial charge conservation, even in the absence of background chromomagnetic fields. The non-conservation of helicity and chirality leads to a gapping of the Helical, Axial and mixed, Axial-Helical vortical waves that prevents their infrared modes from propagating. On the other hand, usual dissipative effects, such as charge diffusion, lead to significant damping of ultraviolet modes. We end this paper with a discussion of the regimes where these vortical waves may propagate.</description>

      <title>Multivalued (Wess-Zumino-Novikov) Functional in Fluid Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce hydrodynamics derived from the action of a perfect fluid deformed by the Novikov multivalued functional generated by combined actions of gauge transformations and spacetime diffeomorphisms. This deformation is structured analogously to the Wess-Zumino functional, commonly used as an effective description of field theories with the chiral anomaly. The deformation affects the continuity equation giving fluid spin degrees of freedom and is consistent with the kinematics of the chiral anomaly.</description>

      <title>The $g$-theorem from Strong Subadditivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that strong subadditivity provides a simple derivation of the $g$-theorem for the boundary renormalization group flow in two-dimensional conformal field theories. We work out its holographic interpretation and also give a derivation of the $g$-theorem for the case of an interface in two-dimensional conformal field theories. We also geometrically confirm strong subadditivity for holographic duals of conformal field theories on manifolds with boundaries.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible symmetries act locally by quantum operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-invertible symmetries of quantum field theories and many-body systems generalize the concept of symmetries by allowing non-invertible operations in addition to more ordinary invertible ones described by groups. The aim of this paper is to point out that these non-invertible symmetries act on local operators by quantum operations, i.e. completely positive maps between density matrices, which form a natural class of operations containing both unitary evolutions and measurements and play an important role in quantum information theory. This observation will be illustrated by the Kramers--Wannier duality of the one-dimensional quantum Ising chain, which is a prototypical example of non-invertible symmetry operations.</description>

      <title>Phase structure of the de Sitter Spacetime with KR field based on the Lyapunov exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the spontaneously broken of the Lorentz symmetry in the gravity theory with the non-minimally coupling between the Kalb-Ramond (KR) field (that acquires a nonzero vacuum expectation value) and the Einstein gravity, there exists the exactly static and spherically symmetric black holes solutions related with the Lorentz violating parameter. Based on this, we consider the corresponding black hole solution in the de-Sitter (dS) spacetime with the KR field and investigate the thermodynamic properties in the expanded phase space through introducing the interplay entropy between the black hole and cosmological horizons. Especially we analyze the effect of the Lorentz-violating parameter on the thermodynamic properties. Furthermore, the Lyapunov exponent and the shadow of these static and spherically symmetric black holes in this Lorentz-violating gravity theory are also investigated. These study will open a new perspective to probe the thermodynamics of black holes.</description>

      <title>Flowing Between String Vacua for the Critical Non-Abelian Vortex with Deformation of N=2 Liouville theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been shown that non-Abelian solitonic vortex string supported in four-dimensional (4D) N=2 supersymmetric QCD (SQCD) with the U(2) gauge group and $N_f=4$ quark flavors becomes a critical superstring. This string propagates in the ten-dimensional space formed by a product of the flat 4D space and an internal space given by a Calabi-Yau noncompact threefold, namely, the conifold. The spectrum of low lying closed string states was found and interpreted as a spectrum of hadrons in 4D N=2 SQCD. In particular, the lowest string state appears to be a massless BPS baryon associated with the deformation of the complex structure modulus $b$ of the conifold. It was recently shown that the Coulomb branch of the associated string sigma model which opens up at strong coupling can be described by N=2 Liouville theory. Building on these results we switch on quark masses in 4D N=2 SQCD and study the interpolation of the initial U(2) SQCD with $N_f=4$ quarks to the final SQCD with the U(4) gauge group and $N_f=8$ quarks. To find the true string vacuum which arises due to the mass deformation we solve the effective supergravity equations of motion associated with the deformed world sheet Liouville theory. We show that the massless BPS baryon $b$ survives the deformation and that finding of the spectrum of low lying massive hadrons in the final SQCD is linked to the Calogero problem.</description>

      <title>On AdS$_3$/ICFT$_2$ with a dynamical scalar field located on the brane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exploit holographic duality to study the system of a one-dimensional interface contacting two semi-infinite two-dimensional CFTs. Central to our investigation is the introduction of a dynamical scalar field located on the bulk interface brane which breaks the scaling symmetry of the dual interface field theory, along with its consequential backreaction on the system. We define an interface entropy from holographic entanglement entropy. At zero temperature we construct several illustrative examples and observe that the $g$-theorem is always satisfied. These examples also reveal distinct features of the interface entropy that are intricately linked to the scalar potential profiles. At finite temperature we find that the dynamical scalar field enables the bulk theory to have new configurations which would be infeasible solely with a tension term on the interface brane.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger symmetry: a historical review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reviews the history of the conformal extension of Galilean symmetry, now called Schr\"odinger symmetry. In the physics literature, its discovery is commonly attributed to Jackiw, Niederer and Hagen (1972). However, Schr\"odinger symmetry has a much older ancestry: the associated conserved quantities were known to Jacobi in 1842/43 and its euclidean counterpart was discovered by Sophus Lie in 1881 in his studies of the heat equation. A convenient way to study Schr\"odinger symmetry is provided by a non-relativistic Kaluza-Klein-type "Bargmann" framework, first proposed by Eisenhart (1929), but then forgotten and re-discovered by Duval {\it et al.} only in 1984. Representations of Schr\"odinger symmetry differ by the value $z=2$ of the dynamical exponent from the value $z=1$ found in representations of relativistic conformal invariance. For generic values of $z$, whole families of new algebras exist, which for $z=2/\ell$ include the $\ell$-conformal galilean algebras. We also review the non-relativistic limit of conformal algebras and that this limit leads to the $1$-conformal galilean algebra and not to the Schr\"odinger algebra. The latter can be recovered in the Bargmann framework through reduction. A distinctive feature of Galilean and Schr\"odinger symmetries are the Bargmann super-selection rules, algebraically related to a central extension. An empirical consequence of this was known as "mass conservation" already to Lavoisier. As an illustration of these concepts, some applications to physical ageing in simple model systems are reviewed.</description>

      <title>Self Gravitating Spinning String Condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of the black hole/string transition, it is useful to produce Euclidean string backgrounds representing hot and self-gravitating strings. We utilise analytical and numerical methods to find a smooth, stationary rotating solution in the heterotic string theory at high temperatures. The solution describes a spinning winding-momentum condensate living in three non-compact dimensions, and its backreaction on the thermal cycle. At low temperatures, we expect a transition between our solution to an analytical continuation of an axionic Kerr black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11304v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an effective approach for the study of the interaction of gravitational waves (GW) and electromagnetic waves (EMW), showing that quadrirefringence can be produced, a phenomenon consisting in a frequency and polarization dependency of the speed of GWs and EMWs. Quadrirefringence can be due to the GW-EMW interaction in the source or during the propagation from the source to the observer. In the first case the astrophysical properties of the source can induce a unique characteristic imprint on GWs and EMWs for each source, while the effect on the propagation from the source could be used to probe the large scale electromagnetic field using GWs. Numerical general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations can be used to obtain precise theoretical predictions for different bynary systems with large electromagnetic and gravitational fields, such as binary neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Polyadic sigma matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize $\sigma$-matrices to higher arities using the polyadization procedure proposed by the author. We build the nonderived $n$-ary version of $SU\left( 2\right) $ using cyclic shift block matrices. We define a new function, the polyadic trace, which has an additivity property analogous to the ordinary trace for block diagonal matrices and which can be used to build the corresponding invariants. The elementary $\Sigma$-matrices introduced here play a role similar to ordinary matrix units, and their sums are full $\Sigma$-matrices which can be treated as a polyadic analog of $\sigma$-matrices. The presentation of $n$-ary $SU\left( 2\right) $ in terms of full $\Sigma$-matrices is done using the Hadamard product. We then generalize the Pauli group in two ways: for the binary case we introduce the extended phase shifted $\sigma$-matrices with multipliers in cyclic groups of order $4q$ ($q&gt;4$), and for the polyadic case we construct the correspondent finite $n$-ary semigroup of phase-shifted elementary $\Sigma$-matrices of order $4q\left( n-1\right) +1$, and the finite $n$-ary group of phase-shifted full $\Sigma$-matrices of order $4q$. Finally, we introduce the finite $n$-ary group of heterogeneous full $\mathit{\Sigma}^{het}$-matrices of order $\left( 4q\left( n-1\right) \right) ^{4}$. Some examples of the lowest arities are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute three families of two-loop six-point massless Feynman integrals in dimensional regularization, namely the double-box, the pentagon-triangle, and the hegaxon-bubble family. This constitutes the first analytic computation of two-loop master integrals with eight scales. We use the method of canonical differential equations. We describe the corresponding integral basis with uniform transcendentality, the relevant function alphabet, and analytic boundary values at a particular point in the Euclidean region up to the fourth order in the regularization parameter $\epsilon$. The results are expressed as one-fold integrals over classical polylogarithms suitable for fast and high-precision evaluation.</description>

      <title>Twists of superconformal algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the theory of ``conformal twists'' of superconformal field theories in dimensions 3 to 6, extending the well-known analysis of twists for supersymmetric theories. The conformal twists describe all possible inequivalent choices of a nilpotent element in the superconformal algebra. Such twists can give rise to interesting subalgebras and protected sectors of operators, with the Donaldson--Witten topological field theory and the vertex operator algebras of 4-dimensional N=2 SCFTs being prominent examples. We work mostly with the complexified superconformal algebras, unless explicitly stated otherwise; real forms of the superconformal algebra may have important physical implications, but we leave these subtleties to future work. To obtain mathematical precision, we explain how to extract vertex algebras and E_n algebras from a twisted superconformal field theory using factorization algebras.</description>

      <title>Emerging Jordan blocks in the two-dimensional Potts and loop models at generic $Q$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was recently suggested -- based on general self-consistency arguments as well as results from the bootstrap (arXiv:2005.07708, arXiv:2007.11539, arXiv:2007.04190) -- that the CFT describing the $Q$-state Potts model is logarithmic for generic values of $Q$, with rank-two Jordan blocks for $L_0$ and ${\mkern 1.5mu\overline{\mkern-1.5mu L\mkern-1.5mu}\mkern 1.5mu}_0$ in many sectors of the theory. This is despite the well-known fact that the lattice transfer matrix (or Hamiltonian) is diagonalizable in (arbitrary) finite size. While the emergence of Jordan blocks only in the limit $L\to\infty$ is perfectly possible conceptually, diagonalizability in finite size makes the measurement of logarithmic couplings (whose values are analytically predicted in arXiv:2007.11539, arXiv:2007.04190) very challenging. This problem is solved in the present paper (which can be considered a companion to arXiv:2007.11539), and the conjectured logarithmic structure of the CFT confirmed in detail by the study of the lattice model and associated "emerging Jordan blocks."</description>

      <title>Echoes from a long time ago: Chewbacca inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation offers a unique avenue for exploring the early Universe's dynamics and evolution. In this paper, we delve into the fascinating realm of slow-roll inflation, contextualizing the primordial acoustic perturbations as the resonant echoes akin to the iconic sound of Chewbacca from the Star Wars universe. By extrapolating polynomial potentials for these primordial sounds, we illuminate their role in shaping the inflationary landscape. Leveraging this framework, we calculate the scalar spectral index ($n_s$) and tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$), providing insights into the underlying physics governing the inflationary epoch. Employing a rigorous chi-square ($\chi^2$) analysis, we meticulously scrutinize the Planck data combined with that offered by the BICEP/Keck collaboration to identify the Chewbacca sound profile that best aligns with observational constraints. Our findings not only shed light on the intricate interplay between sound and cosmology but also unveil intriguing parallels between the cosmic symphony of the early universe and beloved cultural icons.</description>

      <title>Unruh effect using Doppler shift method in DSR framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Unruh effect in doubly special relativity (DSR) framework by generalising the Doppler-shift method to DSR. For both the scalar and Dirac particles, we observe a deviation in the power spectrum of Unruh radiation from the standard Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac distributions, respectively, due to the presence of the frame independent length scale of DSR. We further show that this deviation results in the modification of Unruh temperature which then depends non-linearly on the proper acceleration in DSR.</description>

      <title>Study on a Quantization Condition and the Solvability of Schr\"{o}dinger-type Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we study a quantization condition in relation to the solvability of Schr\"{o}dinger equations. This quantization condition is called the SWKB (supersymmetric Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) quantization condition and has been known in the context of supersymmetric quantum mechanics for decades. The main contents of this thesis are recapitulated as follows: the foundation and the application of the SWKB quantization condition. The first half of this thesis aims to understand the fundamental implications of this condition based on extensive case studies. It turns out that the exactness of the SWKB quantization condition indicates the exact solvability of a system via the classical orthogonal polynomials. The SWKB quantization condition provides quantizations of energy, which we call the direct problem of the SWKB. We formulate the inverse problem of the SWKB: the problem of determining the superpotential from a given energy spectrum. The formulation successfully reconstructs all conventional shape-invariant potentials from the given energy spectra. We further construct novel solvable potentials, which are classical-orthogonal-polynomially quasi-exactly solvable, by this formulation. We further demonstrate several explicit solutions of the Schr\"{o}dinger equations with the classical-orthogonal-polynomially quasi-exactly solvable potentials, whose family is referred to as a harmonic oscillator with singularity functions in this thesis. In one case, the energy spectra become isospectral, with several additional eigenstates, to the ordinary harmonic oscillator for special choices of a parameter. By virtue of this, we formulate a systematic way of constructing infinitely many potentials that are strictly isospectral to the ordinary harmonic oscillator.</description>

      <title>Deriving Neutron Star Equation of State from AdS/QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars are among the main targets for gravitational wave observatories, however, their equation of state is still not well established. Mainly phenomenological models with many parameters are widely used by far, while theoretical models are not so practical. In arXiv:1902.08477, a theoretical equation of state with only one parameter is derived from Sakai-Sugimoto model, as an application of AdS/QCD, where pointlike instanton case is taken into consideration. When the tidal deformability constraint from gravitational wave event is satisfied, the maximum mass is about 1.7 solar masses. Now we upgrade this model to instanton gas, with one more variable, the instanton width. This is not naively a free parameter, but a function of the chemical potential. Thus we end up with a more complicated and accurate model, but still with only one adjustable parameter. In this case, we find the maximum mass becomes 1.85 solar masses. This is an encouraging and exiting result, as a theoretically derived model.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves on Kerr Black Holes I: Reconstruction of Linearized Metric Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational perturbations of a rotating Kerr black hole are notoriously complicated, even at the linear level. In 1973, Teukolsky showed that their physical degrees of freedom are encoded in two gauge-invariant Weyl curvature scalars that obey a separable wave equation. Determining these scalars is sufficient for many purposes, such as the computation of energy fluxes. However, some applications -- such as second-order perturbation theory -- require the reconstruction of metric perturbations. In principle, this problem was solved long ago, but in practice, the solution has never been worked out explicitly. Here, we do so by writing down the metric perturbation (in either ingoing or outgoing radiation gauge) that corresponds to a given mode of either Weyl scalar. Our formulas make no reference to the Hertz potential (an intermediate quantity that plays no fundamental role) and involve only the radial and angular Kerr modes, but not their derivatives, which can be altogether eliminated using the Teukolsky--Starobinsky identities. We expect these analytic results to prove useful in numerical studies and for extending black hole perturbation theory beyond the linear regime.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement islands play an essential role in the recent breakthrough in addressing the black hole information paradox. Inspired by double holography, it is conjectured that the entanglement islands can exist only in massive gravity. There are many pieces of evidence but also debates for this conjecture. This paper recovers the massless entanglement island in wedge holography with negative DGP gravity on the brane. However, the spectrum of negative DGP gravity includes a massive ghost, implying the model is unstable. Our work supports the view that there is no entanglement island in a well-defined braneworld model of massless gravity if one divides the radiation and black hole regions by minimizing entanglement entropy. However, such a partition results in a zero radiation region containing no information. Whether there are other physical non-trivial partitions of the radiation region is an open question and deserves further study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.09644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct new three-family ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models from intersecting D6-branes with original gauge group ${\rm U}(4)_C \times {\rm USp}(2)_L \times {\rm U}(2)_R$ on a Type IIA $\mathbb{T}^6/(\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2)$ orientifold. We find that replacing a ${\rm U}(2)$ with a ${\rm USp}(2)$ group severely restricts the number of three-generation supersymmetric models such that there are only five inequivalent models. Exchanging the left and right sectors, we obtain five dual models with gauge group ${\rm U}(4)_C \times {\rm U}(2)_L \times {\rm USp}(2)_R$. These ten models have different gauge coupling relations at string scale. The highest wrapping number is 4, and one of the models contains no filler O6-planes. Moreover, we discuss in detail the particle spectra, the composite particles through strong coupling dynamics, and the exotic particle decouplings. Also, we study how to realize the string-scale gauge coupling relations in some models.</description>

      <title>Notes on the type classification of von Neumann algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01958v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: These notes provide an explanation of the type classification of von Neumann algebras, which has made many appearances in recent work on entanglement in quantum field theory and quantum gravity. The goal is to bridge a gap in the literature between resources that are too technical for the non-expert reader, and resources that seek to explain the broad intuition of the theory without giving precise definitions. Reading these notes will provide you with: (i) an argument for why "factors" are the fundamental von Neumann algebras that one needs to study; (ii) an intuitive explanation of the type classification of factors in terms of renormalization schemes that turn unnormalizable positive operators into "effective density matrices;" (iii) a mathematical explanation of the different types of renormalization schemes in terms of the allowed traces on a factor; (iv) an intuitive characterization of type I and II factors in terms of their "standard forms;" and (v) a list of some interesting connections between type classification and modular theory, including the argument for why type III$_1$ factors are believed to be the relevant ones in quantum field theory. None of the material is new, but the pedagogy is different from other sources I have read; it is most similar in spirit to the recent work on gravity and the crossed product by Chandrasekaran, Longo, Penington, and Witten.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our goal is to establish a refined version of the Page curve capable of describing an evaporating black hole in an asymptotically flat spacetime. The Page curve traditionally exhibits a singular point, often interpreted as an indication of the Hawking-Page phase transition which occurs for an evaporating black hole in an asymptotically AdS spacetime. Conversely, an evaporating black hole in an asymptotically flat spacetime is not expected to undergo such a transition. Therefore, we require a smoother, more consistent curve as a better-fitting model. In order to obtain the desired curve, we employ certain holographic assumptions and mathematical identities inherent to the curve's smoothness. Our results indicate that black hole radiation in an asymptotically flat spacetime possesses a notably higher informational content.</description>

Abstract: I am showing how the ideas behind the renormalisation group can be generalised in order to produce the desired reduction in the degrees of freedom other that the ones considered up to now. Instead of looking only at the renormalisation group flow, inspiration from optimisation tools for regulators of truncated theories is used to show that there exists another mathematical structure in the morphisms between various renormalisation groups, characterised by their operations, encoded by means of various regularisation functions. This expands the idea of renormalisation group to a renormalisation category. A group structure exists at the level of those morphisms, leading to new information emerging in the flowing process. Impact on problems like the naturalness and protein folding is being presented briefly.</description>

Abstract: Using Wilsonian renormalization, we calculate the quantum correction to observable quantities, rather than the bare parameters, of the Higgs field. A physical parameter, such as a mass-squared or a quartic coupling, at an energy scale $\mu$ is obtained from that at a reference scale by integrating in the degrees of freedom in between. In this process, heavy modes decouple and the ultraviolet scale dependence is canceled in the observables. An exact renormalization group equation is parametrized by the low-energy scale $\mu$.</description>

      <title>Cone Holography with Neumann Boundary Conditions and Brane-localized Gauge Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cone holography is a codimension-$n$ doubly holographic model, which can be interpreted as the holographic dual of edge modes on defects. The initial model of cone holography is based on mixed boundary conditions. This paper formulates cone holography with Neumann boundary conditions, where the brane-localized gauge fields play an essential role. Firstly, we illustrate the main ideas in an AdS$_4$/CFT$_1$ toy model. We show that the $U(1)$ gauge field on the end-of-the-world brane can make the typical solution consistent with Neumann boundary conditions. Then, we generalize the discussions to general codimension-$n$ cone holography by employing brane-localized $p$-form gauge fields. We also investigate perturbative solutions and prove the mass spectrum of Kaluza-Klein gravitons is non-negative. Furthermore, we prove that cone holography obeys holographic $c$-theorem. Finally, inspired by the recently proposed chiral model in AdS/BCFT, we construct another type of cone holography with Neumann boundary conditions by applying massive vector (Proca) fields on the end-of-the-world brane.</description>

      <title>Exact WKB analysis for ${\cal PT}$ symmetric quantum mechanics: Study of the Ai-Bender-Sarkar conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00574v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider exact WKB analysis to a ${\cal PT}$ symmetric quantum mechanics defined by the potential, $V(x) = \omega^2 x^2 + g x^2(i x)^{\varepsilon=2}$ with $\omega \in {\mathbb R}_{\ge 0}$, $g \in {\mathbb R} _{&gt; 0}$. We in particular aim to verify a conjecture proposed by Ai-Bender-Sarkar (ABS), that pertains to a relation between $D$-dimensional ${\cal PT}$-symmetric theories and analytic continuation (AC) of Hermitian theories concerning the energy spectrum or Euclidean partition function. For the purpose, we construct energy quantization conditions by exact WKB analysis and write down their transseries solution by solving the conditions. By performing alien calculus to the energy solutions, we verify validity of the ABS conjecture and seek a possibility of its alternative form by Borel resummation theory if it is violated. Our results claim that the validity of the ABS conjecture drastically changes depending on whether $\omega &gt; 0$ or $\omega = 0$: If ${\omega}&gt;0$, then the ABS conjecture is violated when exceeding the semi-classical level of the first non-perturbative order, but its alternative form is constructable by Borel resummation theory. The ${\cal PT}$ and the AC energies are related to each other by a one-parameter Stokes automorphism, and a median resummed form, which corresponds to a formal exact solution, of the AC energy (resp. ${\cal PT}$ energy) is directly obtained by acting Borel resummation to a transseries solution of the ${\cal PT}$ energy (resp. AC energy). If $\omega = 0$, then, with respect to the inverse energy level-expansion, not only perturbative/non-perturbative structures of the ${\cal PT}$ and the AC energies but also their perturbative parts do not match with each other. These energies are independent solutions, and no alternative form of the ABS conjecture can be reformulated by Borel resummation theory.</description>

      <title>Localization of $q-$form field on the brane-world by coupling with gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scalar fields, $U(1)$ gauge vector fields, and Kalb-Ramond fields are the $0$-form, 1-form, and 2-form fields, respectively. In four-dimensional space-time, free $q$-form fields are equivalent to scalar or vector fields by a duality, however, in higher-dimensional space-time, $q-$form fields correspond to new types of particles. In this paper, with considering a coupling mechanism between the kinetic term of the $q-$form fields and the background spacetime, we investigate the localization of Kaluza-Klein modes for the $q-$form fields on a $D-$dimensional Randall-Sundrum-like brane model. We demonstrate that the zero mode can be localized on the brane, and the massive Kaluza-Klein modes could be localized or quasi-localized on the brane when with certain value of parameters. Then, we present the localization of the scalar fields, $U(1)$ gauge vector fields, and 2-form Kalb-Ramond fields within a five-dimensional bulk spacetime. For a massless scalar field, an interesting characteristic emerges: When the parameter $t_2$ is negative, the zero mode is localized on both sides of the brane, whereas the massive Kaluza-Klein modes can be quasi-localized at the center of the brane.</description>

      <title>Topological fluids with boundaries and fractional quantum Hall edge dynamics: A fluid dynamics derivation of the chiral boson action</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.06516v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the bulk and boundary dynamics of Laughlin states, which are modeled using composite boson theory within a fluid dynamics framework. In this work, we adopt an alternative starting point based on a hydrodynamic action with topological terms, which fleshes out the fluid aspects of the Laughlin state manifestly. For a particular choice of the velocity field, the fluid equation for this action is akin to first-order hydrodynamic equations, supplemented with an additional constitutive equation known as the Hall constraint. When a hard wall boundary is present, one of the topological terms in the fluid action triggers anomaly inflow, indicating the presence of gauge anomaly at the edge. The first-order hydrodynamic equations require a second boundary condition which, in the absence of dissipation, can be either a no-slip or a no-stress condition. We find that the no-slip condition, where the fluid adheres to the wall is incompatible with the chiral edge dynamics. On the other hand, the no-stress condition, which allows the fluid to move along the wall without friction, is consistent with the expected chiral edge dynamics of the Laughlin state. Furthermore, our work derives this modified no-stress boundary condition within a variational principle. This is accomplished by incorporating a chiral boson action within the boundary action that is non-linearly coupled to the edge density, thus systematically extending the edge chiral Luttinger liquid theory.</description>

Abstract: Magic, or nonstabilizerness, characterizes how far away a state is from the stabilizer states, making it an important resource in quantum computing, under the formalism of the Gotteman-Knill theorem. In this paper, we study the magic of the $1$-dimensional Random Matrix Product States (RMPSs) using the $L_{1}$-norm measure. We firstly relate the $L_{1}$-norm to the $L_{4}$-norm. We then employ a unitary $4$-design to map the $L_{4}$-norm to a $24$-component statistical physics model. By evaluating partition functions of the model, we obtain a lower bound on the expectation values of the $L_{1}$-norm. This bound grows exponentially with respect to the qudit number $n$, indicating that the $1$D RMPS is highly magical.

      <title>Hayden-Preskill Recovery in Hamiltonian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02010v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Information scrambling refers to the unitary dynamics that quickly spreads and encodes localized quantum information over an entire many-body system and makes the information accessible from any small subsystem. While information scrambling is the key to understanding complex quantum many-body dynamics and is well-understood in random unitary models, it has been hardly explored in Hamiltonian systems. In this Letter, we investigate the information recovery in various time-independent Hamiltonian systems, including chaotic spin chains and Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models. We show that information recovery is possible in certain, but not all, chaotic models, which highlights the difference between information recovery and quantum chaos based on the energy spectrum or the out-of-time-ordered correlators. We also show that information recovery probes transitions caused by the change of information-theoretic features of the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing in a space-time with cosmic string within the Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12455v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores the deflection angle of photon rays or light-like geodesics within the framework of Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) gravity background space-time, taking into account the influence of cosmic strings. The primary focus lies in deriving the effective potential of the system applicable to both null and time-like geodesics, as well as determining the angle of deflection for light-like geodesics. Our analysis shows that the presence of cosmic strings induces modifications in these physical quantities, leading to shifts in their respective values.</description>

      <title>On evolution kernels of twist-two operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evolution kernels that govern the scale dependence of the generalized parton distributions are invariant under transformations of the $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathrm R)$ collinear subgroup of the conformal group. Beyond one loop the symmetry generators, due to quantum effects, differ from the canonical ones. We construct the transformation which brings the {\it full} symmetry generators back to their canonical form and show that the eigenvalues (anomalous dimensions) of the new, canonically invariant, evolution kernel coincide with the so-called parity respecting anomalous dimensions. We develop an efficient method that allows one to restore an invariant kernel from the corresponding anomalous dimensions. As an example, the explicit expressions for NNLO invariant kernels for the twist two flavor-nonsinglet operators in QCD and for the planar part of the universal anomalous dimension in $ N=4$ SYM are presented.</description>

      <title>Harmonic Oscillator with a Step and its Isospectral Properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14251v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the one-dimensional Schr\"{o}dinger equation for a harmonic oscillator with a finite jump $a$ at the origin. The solution is constructed by employing the ordinary matching-of-wavefunctions technique. For the special choices of $a$, $a=4\ell$ ($\ell=1,2,\ldots$), the wavefunctions can be expressed by the Hermite polynomials. Moreover, we explore isospectral deformations of the potential via the Darboux transformation. In this context, infinitely many isospectral Hamiltonians to the ordinary harmonic oscillator are obtained.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter in A Mirror Solution to the Strong CP Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00702v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study thermal production of dark matter (DM) in a realization of the minimal models of Ref.~\cite{Bonnefoy:2023afx}, where parity is used to solve the strong CP problem by transforming the entire Standard Model (SM) into a mirror copy. Although the mirror electron $e^{\prime}$ is a good DM candidate, its viability is mired by the presence of the mirror up-quark $u^{\prime}$, whose abundance is intimately related to the $e^{\prime}$ abundance and must be suppressed. This can be achieved through a sequential freeze-in mechanism, where mirror photons are first produced from SM gluons, and then the mirror photons produce $e'$. After computing the details of this double freeze-in, we discuss the allowed parameter space of the model, which lies at the threshold of experimental observations. We find that this origin of $e'$ DM requires a low reheating temperature after inflation and is consistent with the baryon asymmetry arising from leptogenesis, providing mirror neutrinos have a significant degeneracy. Finally, we show that this $e'$ DM is not compatible with Higgs Parity, the simplest scheme with exact parity, unless SM parameters deviate significantly from their central values or the minimal model is extended.</description>

      <title>The crease flow on null hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The crease flow, replacing the Hamiltonian system used for the evolution of crease sets on black hole horizons, is introduced and its bifurcation properties for null hypersurfaces are discussed. We state the conditions of nondegeneracy and typicality for the crease submanifolds, and find their normal forms and versal unfoldings (codimension 3). The allowed boundary singularities are thus prescribed by the Arnold-Kazaryan-Shcherbak theorem for 3-parameter versal families, and hence identified as swallowtails and Whitney umbrellas of particular kinds. We further present the bifurcation diagrams describing crease evolution at the crossings of the bifurcation sets and elsewhere, and a typical example is studied. Some remarks on the connection of these results to the crease evolution on black hole horizons are also given.</description>

      <title>Twisting asymptotic symmetries and algebraically special vacuum solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study asymptotic symmetries and algebraically special exact solutions in the Newman-Penrose formalism. Removing the hypersurface orthogonal condition in the well studied Newman-Unti gauge, we obtain a generic asymptotic solution space which includes all possible origins of propagating degree of freedom. The asymptotic symmetry of the generalized system extends the Weyl-BMS symmetry by two independent local Lorentz transformations with non-trivial boundary charges, which reveals new boundary degrees of freedom. The generalized Newman-Unti gauge includes algebraically special condition in its most convenient form. Remarkably, the generic solutions satisfying the algebraically special condition truncate in the inverse power of radial expansions and the non-radial Newman-Penrose equations are explicitly solved at any order. Hence, we provide the most general algebraically special solution space and the derivation is self-contained in the Newman-Penrose formalism. The asymptotic symmetry with respect to the algebraically special condition is the standard Weyl-BMS symmetry and the symmetry parameters consist only the integration constant order. We present the Kerr solution and Taub-NUT solution in the generalized Newman-Unti gauge in a simple form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define and study the face stratification of the m=2 amplituhedron. We show that the face poset is an upper order ideal in the face poset of the totally nonnegative Grassmannian. Our construction is consistent with earlier work of Lukowski, and we confirm various predictions of Lukowski.</description>
