      <title>Toric gravitational instantons in gauged supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a general class of toric gravitational instantons in $D=4$, $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauged supergravity, namely Euclidean supersymmetric solutions with $U(1)^2$ isometry. Such solutions are specified by a "supergravity labelled polytope", where the labels encode the 4-manifold topology, the choice of magnetic fluxes, and certain signs associated to the Killing spinor. Equivariant localization then allows us to write down the gravitational free energy for such a solution, assuming it exists, and study its properties. These results open the way for a systematic study of holography in this setting, where the dual large $N$ field theories are defined on the boundary 3-manifolds, which are (squashed) lens spaces $L(p,q)$ or generalizations with orbifold singularities.</description>

      <title>A Gapless Phase with Haagerup Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a (1+1)d gapless theory which has Haagerup $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry. The construction relies on the recent exploration of the categorical Landau paradigm applied to fusion category symmetries. First, using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory, we construct all gapped phases with Haagerup symmetry. Extending this construction to gapless phases, we study the second order phase transition between gapped phases, and determine analytically an Haagerup-symmetric conformal field theory. This is given in terms of two copies of the three-state Potts model, on which we realise the full $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry action and determine the relevant deformations to the $\mathcal{H}_3$-symmetric gapped phases. This continuum analysis is corroborated by a lattice model construction of the gapped and gapless phases, using the anyon chain.</description>

      <title>Hidden Conformal Symmetry of the Discrete Series Scalars in dS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In $D$ dimensional de Sitter space, a scalar field has an infinite tower of special tachyonic mass values at which enhanced shift symmetries appear. After modding out by these shift symmetries, these fields correspond to the unitary irreducible representations of the de Sitter group known as the discrete series. We show that in $D=2$ these theories have global conformal symmetry. In all but the massless case, these theories have no stress tensor and the conformal symmetry does not act in the usual way on the scalar field. We find the conformal symmetry by explicitly computing the correlators of the shift invariant local operators and showing that they take conformally invariant forms. We also demonstrate how these fields are self dual in $D=2$, and dual to the shift invariant massive vector fields, which are therefore also conformally invariant.</description>

      <title>Aspects of Entanglement Entropy in $3d$ $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate entanglement entropy in $3d$ $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories from two different perspectives. We first confirm that the dependence of supersymmetric entanglement entropy (as defined in arXiv:1306.2958) on the entangling region is purely topological. We then compute entanglement entropy of $3d$ $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal gauge theories at arbitrary Yang-Mills coupling using the heat kernel method. This reveals a particular divergence originating in charge fluctuations in the vacuum, hence carrying information about internal symmetries of the theory. This computation leads to universal contributions to entanglement entropy from chiral and vector multiplets for unitary gauge groups of arbitrary rank, and has the advantage that the integral over the gauge moduli is simple to compute.</description>

      <title>Star-triangle dualities and supersymmetric improved bifundamentals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently it was shown that mirror duals of 3d and 4d theories with four super-charges can be described by generalized quiver theories, constructed using strongly coupled SCFTs as elementary building blocks that replace and improve standard bifundamentals. In this work we study and extend the family of such improved bifundamentals and discuss the network of star-triangle dualities they satisfy. We provide a field theoretic proof of the star-triangle dualities, which only assumes the basic Seiberg dualities, using the sequential deconfinement technique.</description>

      <title>Graded transcendental functions: an application to four-point amplitudes with one off-shell leg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a general method for constructing a minimal basis of transcendental functions tailored to a scattering amplitude. Starting with formal solutions for all master integral topologies, we grade the appearing functions by properties such as their symbol alphabet or letter adjacency. We rotate the basis such that functions with spurious features appear in the least possible number of basis elements. Since their coefficients must vanish for physical quantities, this approach avoids complex cancellations. As a first application, we evaluate all integral topologies relevant to the three-loop $Hggg$ and $Hgq\bar{q}$ amplitudes in the leading-colour approximation and heavy-top limit. We describe the derivation of canonical differential equation systems and present a method for fixing boundary conditions without the need for a full functional representation. Using multiple numerical reductions, we test the maximal transcendentality conjecture for $Hggg$ and identify a new letter which appears in functions of weight 4 and 5. In addition, we provide the first direct analytic computation of a three-point form factor of the operator $\mathrm{Tr}(\phi^2)$ in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ sYM and find agreement with numerical and bootstrapped results.</description>

      <title>The role of Sp(2n) duality in quantum theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: D-dimensional maximal supergravities type I with G/H coset spaces have global G-symmetry and local H symmetry, which can be gauge-fixed in symmetric or Iwasawa-type gauges. Maximal D-dimensional supergravities type II derived from higher dimensions without dualization have less local and global symmetries. In 4D, Gaillard-Zumino duality group Sp(56) enhances U-duality symmetry group $E_{7(7)}$. Using the Hamiltonian path integral, we show how extra symmetries beyond $E_{7(7)}$, serve to establish S-matrix equivalence of supergravities I and II in different gauges. Enhanced dualities are not available in D $&gt; 4$. This is consistent with the existence of local H symmetry and global G symmetry anomalies and UV divergences in D $&gt; 4$ supergravities, and with the absence of these anomalies and UV divergences, so far, in 4D ${\cal N}\geq 5$ supergravities.</description>

      <title>Finite Temperature Casimir Effect of Scalar Field: Revisit and New Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For both the one-dimensional and three-dimensional scalar fields at finite temperature, we find the analytic expressions of Gibbs free energy, Casimir force, and Casimir entropy. These results show that the widely used low-temperature approximation of thermal correction of Casimir force, $\pi{T}e^{-\pi{v}\hbar/aT}/2a^3$, have large errors with the exact solution. For three-dimensional scalar field, we find the leading order thermal correction of Gibbs free energy density, $F(a,T)=3\zeta(7/2)aT^4/8\pi^{3/2}(v\hbar)^3$, where $\zeta(.)$ represents the Riemann $\zeta$ function. This thermal correction can not be cancelled by the blackbody radiation density, $\pi^2{a}T^4/90(v\hbar)^3$.</description>

      <title>Saddle-point approximation to the false vacuum decay at finite temperature in one-dimensional quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the false-vacuum decay rate in one-dimensional quantum mechanics on the basis of the saddle-point approximation in the Euclidean path integral at finite temperature. The saddle points are the finite-T and shifted bounce solutions, which are finite-period analogs of the (zero-temperature) bounce solution, and the shot solutions. We re-examined the zero-temperature result by Callan and Coleman and compare with the zero-temperature limit of our results. We also perform some numerical calculations to illustrate the temperature dependence of the decay rate and compare it with the result by Affleck.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct maximal supergravity in five-dimensions by 'oxidizing' the four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=8$ theory. The relevant symmetries, the unitary symplectic group $USp(8)$ and the exceptional group $E_6$, are both presented in light-cone superspace and their connections with $SU(8)$ and $E_7$ highlighted. We explain a procedure to derive higher-point interaction vertices in both the 4- and 5-dimensional supergravity theories using exclusively the exceptional symmetries. Specific forms for the quartic and quintic interaction vertices in light-cone superspace are derived.</description>

      <title>A well-posed formulation of minimal dRGT massive gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ghost-free dRGT massive gravity is a subtle theory, even at the classical level. Its viability depends on Vainshtein screening, which is an intrinsically non-linear phenomenon, and thus understanding the full non-linear dynamics of the theory is crucial. The theory was not expected to have a well-posed hyperbolic formulation as it is usually interpreted as a low energy EFT, and hence its short distance physics would be modified by higher derivative operators. Here we study a new dynamical formulation of the theory for the case of the minimal mass term. This firstly involves using a harmonic formulation of the theory, and then writing it as a first order system. Surprisingly we are able to cast it in a form that we argue is strongly hyperbolic for generic metrics suitably close to Minkowski, so that its Cauchy evolution problem is well-posed. Interestingly, as part of the analysis, we find that the characteristics of the spin two graviton mode are simply governed by the inverse metric on a general background.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These notes are based on lectures given at the XIX Modave School on Mathematical Physics and present an introduction to Exceptional Field Theory. We cover the standard Kaluza-Klein reductions on tori, with applications to supergravity. We review the supergravity action of type IIA/IIB and eleven-dimensional supergravities. We motivate the appearance of the hidden symmetry groups $\mathrm{E}_{d(d)}$ through the lens of string dualities. We explore the construction and properties of $\mathrm{E}_{7(7)}$-ExFT and review other $\mathrm{E}_{d(d)}$-ExFT for $3\leq d\leq 8$, as well as double field theories. These notes conclude with some applications of ExFT to consistent truncations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By studying the Raychaudhuri equation for the gravitational force resulting from a string T-duality modified propagator, we present an analysis of the geodesic compression beyond the conventional classical limit. The result is that gravity on short length scales is subject to a screening effect similar to the Debye screening in electrostatics, which prevents the formation of curvature singularities. Using model-independent arguments, we conclude that the conventional attractive nature of gravity is only a low-energy effect.</description>

      <title>Backreacted Coulomb energy in the Skyrme model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Skyrme model is extended with the Maxwell action and a source term for the gauge field. We consider the specialized case of vanishing isospin states, such that only an electric potential is turned on and study the backreaction onto the Skyrme fields. In particular, we study Skyrmions with baryon numbers B=4,8,12,16 and 40. We find, in agreement with physical expectations, that the Coulomb backreaction is most pronounced for large Skyrmions and find furthermore that the dynamics of the theory is more sensitive to the backreaction than the ground states (global minimizers of the energy). Calibrating the model to Carbon-12, we find excellent agreement of the masses of the studied Skyrmions - within 1.86% of experimental data. The Coulomb energies are slightly larger than phenomenological fits suggest, but only by about 3-22%, whereas the radii are within 15% errors, with the largest errors on the smallest baryon number (B=4) and the smallest error on the large baryon numbers.</description>

      <title>Resurgence of $T\bar{T}$-deformed Partition Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study non-perturbative effects of torus partition function of the $T\bar{T}$-deformed 2d CFTs by resurgence. The deformed partition function can be written as an infinite series of the deformation parameter $\lambda$. We develop highly efficient methods to compute perturbative coefficients in the $\lambda$ expansion. To exemplify, the first 600 coefficients for the $T\bar{T}$-deformed free boson and free fermion are computed. Equipped with the large order perturbative data, we provide convincing numerical evidence that the $\lambda$ expansion series is asymptotic and not Borel resummable. We extract the non-perturbative contribution by resurgence and propose that they originate from new complex saddle points after analytically continuing the modular parameters in the integral representation of the partition function. The proposal is checked by comparing the predicted asymptotic behavior of the coefficients and large order perturbative data, which match nicely. The implications of these non-perturbative contributions for the Stokes phenomenon, which relates the positive and negative signs of $\lambda$, is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Pinching rules in the chiral-splitting description of one-loop string amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loop amplitudes in string theories reduce to those of gauge theories and (super)gravity in their worldline description as the inverse string tension $\alpha'$ tends to zero. The appearance of reducible diagrams in these $\alpha' \rightarrow 0$ limits is determined through so-called pinching rules in the worldline literature. In this work, we extend these pinching rules to the chiral-splitting description of one-loop superstring amplitudes where left- and right-moving degrees of freedom decouple at fixed loop momentum. Starting from six points, the Kronecker-Eisenstein integrands of chiral amplitudes introduce subtleties into the pinching rules and integration-by-parts simplifications. Resolutions of these subtleties are presented and applied to produce a new superspace representation of the six-point one-loop amplitude of type IIA/B supergravity. The worldline computations and their subtleties are compared with the ambitwistor-string approach to one-loop field-theory amplitudes where integration-by-parts manipulations are shown to be more flexible. Throughout this work, the homology invariance of loop-momentum dependent correlation functions on the torus is highlighted as a consistency condition of $\alpha' \rightarrow 0$ limits and their comparison with ambitwistor methods.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of three $(2+1)$-dimensional black holes in string theory, conformal gravity, and Hu-Sawicki $F(R)$ theory via the Heun function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the propagation of massless fermionic fields, implementing a family of special functions: Heun functions, in solving the wave equation in three three-dimensional backgrounds, including the BTZ black hole in string theory and Lifshitz black hole solutions in conformal gravity and Hu-Sawicki $F(R)$ theory. The main properties of the selected black hole solutions is that their line elements are Weyl related to that of a homogeneous spacetime, whose spatial part possesses Lie symmetry, described by Lobachevsky-type geometry with arbitrary negative Gaussian curvature. Using the Weyl symmetry of massless Dirac action, we consider the perturbation equations of fermionic fields in relation to those of the homogeneous background, which having definite singularities, are transformed into Heun equation. We point out the existence of quasinormal modes labeled by the accessory parameter of the Heun function. The distribution of the quasinormal modes has been clarified to satisfy the boundary conditions that require ingoing and decaying waves at the event horizon and conformal infinity, respectively. It turned out that the procedure based on the Heun function, beside reproducing the previously known results obtained via hypergemetric function for the BTZ and Lifshitz black hole solution in conformal gravity, brings up new families of quasinormal frequencies, which can also contain purely imaginary modes. Also, the analysis of the quasinormal modes shows that with the negative imaginary part of complex frequencies $\omega=\omega_{Re}+i\omega_{Im}$, the fermionic perturbations are stable in this background.</description>

      <title>Superstring amplitudes from BCJ numerators at one loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find a direct map that determines moduli-space integrands for one-loop superstring amplitudes in terms of field-theory loop integrands in the BCJ form. The latter can be computed using efficient unitarity methods, so our map provides an alternative to worldsheet CFT techniques. This construction is a one-loop higher-point analogue of a recent conjecture for the three-loop four-point superstring amplitude. Based on the one-loop chiral-splitting representation, we show how all coefficients of an ansatz for the superstring can be identified with field-theory BCJ numerators, up to at least 7-point amplitudes. Moreover, we obtain partial results for all higher-point amplitudes. The monodromy constraints associated to chiral splitting play a crucial role in determining coefficients of the ansatz that, naively, are not fixed by the field-theory limit. Taking a field-theory perspective, our ansatz for the superstring implies by construction the existence of one-loop BCJ numerators at any multiplicity.</description>

      <title>Einstein Equation Governs the Dynamics of Entanglement Entropy in CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The {\it finiteness} of the mixed state entanglement entropy $S_{\text{vN}}$ in CFT$_2$ enables us to show that, the dynamical equation of the coincidence limit of $(\frac{1}{2} S_{vN}^2);_{ij}$ is precisely Einstein equation. Thus the entanglement entropy induces an internal entropic gravitational geometry in CFT. The CFT RG equation turns out to be a geometric identity. In this entropic gravity, a covariant Klein-Gordon equation is found. As a natural consequence, we are led to conjecture that, the gauge/gravity duality is "flat background QFT coupled with an internal entropic gravitational geometry on the boundary $=$ gravity and coupled QFT in the bulk".</description>

Abstract: We introduce \texttt{cymyc}, a high-performance Python library for numerical investigation of the geometry of a large class of string compactification manifolds and their associated moduli spaces. We develop a well-defined geometric ansatz to numerically model tensor fields of arbitrary degree on a large class of Calabi-Yau manifolds. \texttt{cymyc} includes a machine learning component which incorporates this ansatz to model tensor fields of interest on these spaces by finding an approximate solution to the system of partial differential equations they should satisfy.</description>

      <title>RKHS, Berezin and Odzijewicz-type quantizations on arbitrary compact smooth manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02838v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we define Berezin-type and Odzijewicz-type quantizations on compact smooth manifolds. The method is we embed the smooth manifold of real dimension $n$ into ${\mathbb C}P^n$ and induce the quantizations from there. The standard way by which reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces are defined on submanifolds gives a way to define the pullback coherent states. In Berezin-type quantization the Hilbert space of quantization is the pullback (by the embedding) of the Hilbert space of geometric quantization of ${\mathbb C}P^n$. In the Odzijewicz-type quantization one has to consider a tensor product of the geometric quantization line bundle with holomorphic $n$-forms. In the Berezin case, the operators that are quantized are those induced from the ambient space ${\mathbb C}P^n$. The Berezin-type quantization exhibited here is a generalization of an earlier work of the author and Ghosh. In both Berezin and Odzijewicz-type quantizations we first exhibit this quantization explicitly on ${\mathbb C}P^n$ and we induce the quantization on the smooth compact embedded manifold from ${\mathbb C}P^n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we apply Dirac's Constraint Analysis (DCA) to solve Superconducting Quantum Circuits (SQC). The Lagrangian of a SQC reveals the constraints, that are classified in a Hamiltonian framework, such that redundant variables can be removed to isolate the canonical degrees of freedom for subsequent quantization of the Dirac Brackets. We demonstrate the robustness of DCA unlike certain other set of ideas like null vector and loop charge which are each applicable only to specific types of quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Quasi-Integrable Equations from traveling-wave data using the Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are used to study vortex solutions in the 2+1 dimensional nonlinear partial differential equations. These solutions include the regularized long-wave (RLW) equation and the Zakharov-Kuznetsov (ZK) equation, which are toy models of the geostrophic shallow water model in the planetary atmosphere. PINNs successfully solve these equations in the forward process and the solutions are obtained using the mesh-free approach and automatic differentiation while accounting for conservation laws. In the inverse process, the proper equations can be successfully derived from a given training data. Since these equations have a lot in common, there are situations when substantial misidentification arises during the inverse analysis. We consider PINNs with conservation laws (referred to as cPINNs), deformations of the initial profiles, and a friction approach that provides excellent discrimination of the equations to improve the identification's resolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate how field redefinition influences the spectrum of linearized perturbations in relativistic fluid dynamics. We show that the hydrodynamic modes do not get affected under local field redefinition, whereas the non-hydrodynamic modes do. These non-hydrodynamic modes can be removed through a suitable all-order field redefinition. This process leads to a new frame containing only hydrodynamic modes, which we refer to as the hydro frame. Additionally, we demonstrate that the resulting stress-energy tensor may constitute an infinite series in momentum space, with the radius of convergence associated with the removed non-hydrodynamic mode, highlighting its role in the hydrodynamic expansion's validity.</description>

Abstract: We describe the Ruijsenaars' action-angle duality in classical many-body integrable systems through the spectral duality transformation relating the classical spin chains and Gaudin models. For this purpose, the Lax matrices of many-body systems are represented in the multi-pole (Gaudin-like) form by introducing a fictitious spectral parameter. This form of Lax matrices is also interpreted as classical-classical version of quantum-classical duality.</description>

      <title>The complexity of entanglement embezzlement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embezzlement of entanglement is the counterintuitive process in which entanglement is extracted from a resource system using local unitary operations, with almost no detectable change in the resource's state. It has recently been argued that any state of a relativistic quantum field theory can serve as a resource for perfect embezzlement. We study the circuit complexity of embezzlement, using sequences of states that enable arbitrary precision for the process, commonly called universal embezzling families. In addition, we argue that this approach provides a well-defined model for the complexity of embezzlement from quantum field theories. Our results show that, under fairly general assumptions, lower bounds on the complexity increase with the precision of the process or embezzled entanglement, diverging as these become infinite. Consequently, the findings imply that circuit complexity acts as a physical obstruction to perfect embezzlement. Supplementary to the main results, we derive lower bounds for common models of circuit complexity for state preparation, based on the difference between the Schatten norms of the initial and final states.</description>

      <title>Absorption of a twisted photon by an electron in strong magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The work investigates absorption of a twisted photon, which possesses quantized total angular momentum (TAM), by a relativistic electron with the Lorentz factor $\gamma \sim 1-10$ in a strong magnetic field up to the Schwinger limit, $H_c = 4.4\cdot 10^{13}$ G. We examine the absorption cross sections and their dependence on the parameters of the incident photon and the initial Landau electron. It is found that total absorption cross sections decrease as angular momentum of the incident photon increases and increase as angular momentum of the initial electron grows. The process is also compared across different magnetic field strengths, and the contribution of various electron spin transitions to total absorption cross section is analyzed. We also find that the processes without an electron spin flip dominate and, on top of that, an asymmetry in the ``spin-down'' $\rightarrow$ ``spin-up'' and the ``spin-up'' $\rightarrow$ ``spin-down'' transitions is observed. Specifically, the cross sections for the ``spin-down'' $\rightarrow$ ``spin-up'' transition are larger, which can be interpreted as an analogy of the Sokolov-Ternov effect present for photon emission. Finally, the cross sections are found to be almost constant as the transverse momentum of the photon varies from $0.1$ eV to $100$ keV. Our findings can help to improve the understanding of the QED processes in critical fields, typical for astrophysical environments, e.g. magnetospheres of neutron stars.</description>

Abstract: We address the issue of cancellation of infrared (IR) divergences at the amplitude level in Light Front Quantum Chromodynamics (LFQCD) using the coherent state formalism. We consider the process $e^{+}e^{-}\rightarrow q\bar{q}g$ upto $\mathcal{O}(g^3)$ in light-cone-time-ordered Hamiltonian perturbation theory and show that IR divergences in S-matrix elements appear due to vanishing energy denominators. We construct the coherent state formalism for LFQCD and explicitly show that these divergences are cancelled when a coherent state basis is used for calculating the S-matrix elements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of a spherically symmetric regular black hole under charged scalar field perturbations. The findings reveal the presence of charged superradiant instability within specific parameter ranges, with the growth rate potentially reaching a high order of magnitude up to approximately $\text{Im} (M \omega) \sim 10^{-3}$. This value significantly surpasses the instability observed in ABG black holes reported in earlier studies, implying a potentially relevant timescale for observing this phenomenon in astrophysical scenarios. Furthermore, a detailed analysis is presented on how the model's three parameters affect the onset and intensity of the instability. Our study contributes further insights into the potential manifestation of this instability in spherical regular black holes and its correlation with the nonlinear effects of the electromagnetic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to numerically determine the location of a critical point in general systems using the finite-size scaling of Lee-Yang zeros. This method makes use of the fact that the ratios of Lee-Yang zeros on various spatial volumes intersect at the critical point. While the method is similar to the Binder-cumulant analysis, it is advantageous in suppressing the finite-volume effects arising from the mixing of variables in general systems. We show that the method works successfully for numerically locating the CP in the three-dimensional three-state Potts model with a nonzero external field.</description>

      <title>Fast Scrambling in Classically Simulable Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study operator scrambling in quantum circuits built from `super-Clifford' gates. For such circuits it was established in arXiv:2002.12824 that the time evolution of operator entanglement for a large class of many-body operators can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer, including for operators with volume-law entanglement. Here we extend the scope of this formalism in two key ways. Firstly we provide evidence that these classically simulable circuits include examples of fast scramblers, by constructing a circuit for which operator entanglement is numerically found to saturate in a time $t_* \sim \mathrm{ln}(N)$ (with $N$ the number of qubits). Secondly we demonstrate that, in addition to operator entanglement, certain out-of-time ordered correlation functions (OTOCs) can be classically simulated within the same formalism. As a consequence such OTOCs can be computed numerically in super-Clifford circuits with thousands of qubits, and we study several explicit examples in the aforementioned fast scrambling circuits.</description>

      <title>Schwinger Dyson Summation of Perturbation Expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a hierarchical system of approximations for summing both conventional perturbation theory and large N vector expansions of models in quantum field theory and condensed matter physics. Each stage of the hierarchy consists of a closed set of nonlinear equations for one particle irreducible correlation functions with no more than K points and captures the perturbation expansion of each of those functions up to some finite order. As K goes to infinity the full Schwinger Dyson hierarchy is approached. We present an argument that for ordinary finite dimensional integrals, the procedure converges to the exact answer in this limit, despite the fact that no finite order of the hierarchy sees effects from non-leading saddle points of the integral. Some potential applications to the calculation of critical exponents, to low dimensional condensed matter systems, and to the phase structure of the homogeneous electron gas are outlined, but no detailed calculations are presented.</description>

      <title>Boundary choices and one-loop Complex Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the path integral of the four-dimensional Einstein-Hilbert gravity for the deSitter-like Universe with fluctuations and study the transition amplitude from one boundary configuration to another for the gravitational system described by lapse, scale-factor and metric fluctuation field. For variational consistency, the bulk theory needs suitable augmentation of boundary action. A specific boundary choice on the scale-factor is achieved by an infinite family of covariant boundary actions, each restricting the boundary choices for the fluctuation field. The boundary choices for the two are intimately tied to each other via general covariance, and can't be independently chosen. In the background field formalism, the full gauge-fixed path-integral on ignoring back-reaction, decouples to a path-integral over scale-factor and fluctuation field, coupling to each other only via lapse. After exactly doing the path-integral over the scale factor, the fluctuation path-integral is computed to one-loop via mode-decomposition leading to a quantum corrected lapse action. Its complex saddles shows background saddles getting corrected due to contribution from fluctuations. ``No-boundary'' saddles are seen to be no longer the saddles of the full theory, implying a Universe starting with a non-vanishing size at the corrected saddles. One-loop contribution is seen to diverge logarithmically at the background ``no-boundary'' saddles. Counter term added to cancel divergence lead to finite lapse action and transition amplitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.03655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a unified framework of Mahler measure, dessins d'enfants, and gauge theory. With certain physically motivated Newton polynomials from reflexive polygons, the Mahler measure and the dessin are in one-to-one correspondence. From the Mahler measure, one can construct a Hauptmodul for a congruence subgroup of the modular group, which contains the subgroup associated to the dessin. We also discuss their connections to the quantum periods of del Pezzo surfaces, as well as certain elliptic pencils. In brane tilings and quiver gauge theories, the modular Mahler flow might shed light on the inequivalence amongst the three different complex structures $\tau_{R,G,B}$. We also study how, in F-theory, 7-branes and their monodromies arise in the context of dessins.</description>

      <title>BRST and Related Superfield Approach to 1D and 2D Diffeomorphism Invariant Models of Particles and a Bosonic String: A Brief Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06850v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this brief review-cum-research article, we discuss the off-shell nilpotent (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations, (anti-)BRST invariant Curci-Ferrari (CF) type restriction(s), coupled Lagrangians/Lagrangian densities, etc., for the 1D diffeomorphism (i.e. reparameterization) invariant models of $(i)$ a non-relativistic and non-SUSY free particle, $(ii)$ a scalar (i.e. non-SUSY) relativistic free particle, $(iii)$ a spinning (i.e. SUSY) relativistic free particle, and $(iv)$ a 2D diffeomorphism invariant model of a specific bosonic string theory within the framework of BRST and related supervariable/superfield approach. We take up a new 1D diffeomorphism (i.e. reparameterization) invariant model of an interacting scalar relativistic particle with the electromagnetic field. The latter is treated as a constant background variable and is, therefore, independent of the evolution parameter of the trajectory of the above interacting scalar relativistic particle. We show that the universal nature of the CF-type restriction is maintained in the case of this new model, too. The universal nature of the CF-type restriction(s) is proven by using the modified Bonora-Tonin supervariable/superfield approach (MBTSA) to BRST formalism in the context of 1D and 2D diffeomorphism invariant theories. We further demonstrate that the 1D diffeomorphism invariant models of all kinds of particles are described by the singular Lagrangians. Thus, they also respect the infinitesimal gauge symmetry transformations that are generated by the first-class constraints that exist on them. The equivalence of the 1D diffeomorphism and gauge symmetries is explicitly clarified under specific conditions.</description>

      <title>Nicolai maps with four-fermion interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19946v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nicolai maps offer an alternative description of supersymmetric theories via nonlinear and nonlocal transformations characterized by the so-called `free-action' and `determinant-matching' conditions. The latter expresses the equality of the Jacobian determinant of the transformation with the one obtained by integrating out the fermions, which so far have been considered only to quadratic terms. We argue that such a restriction is not substantial, as Nicolai maps can be constructed for arbitrary nonlinear sigma models, which feature four-fermion interactions. The fermionic effective one-loop action then gets generalized to higher loops and the perturbative tree expansion of such Nicolai maps receives quantum corrections in the form of fermion loop decorations. The `free-action condition' continues to hold for the classical map, but the `determinant-matching condition' is extended to an infinite hierarchy in fermion loop order. After general considerations for sigma models in four dimensions, we specialize to the case of $\mathbb{C}\mathrm{P}^N$ symmetric spaces and construct the associated Nicolai map. These sigma models admit a formulation with only quadratic fermions via an auxiliary vector field, which does not simplify our analysis.</description>

      <title>A multiverse model in $T^2$ dS wedge holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02074v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a multiverse model where empty AdS$_{d+1}$ space is cut off by a pair of accelerated dS$_d$ space universes, at a finite AdS boundary cutoff which we treat as a $T^2$ deformation in the holographic dual, and one in the AdS interior, the IR brane{; and denote the construction as $T^2$ dS wedge holography}. We glue together several copies of this configuration along the UV cutoff and the IR branes in a periodic matter. To provide the model with dynamics similar to those of near Nariai black holes used in other multiverse toy models{, we specialize to $d=2$ and} add dS JT gravity as an intrinsic gravity theory on the IR branes. We then study the entanglement entropy with respect to a finite cutoff observer, who finds a Page curve transition due to an entanglement island connecting the UV cutoff and IR brane. This process involves the coarse-graining of information outside the causally accessible region to the observer. Our model provides an explicit realization of entanglement between IR and UV degrees of freedom encoded in the multiverse.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy of a Scalar Field in a Squeezed State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03136v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the entanglement entropy within a spherical region for a free scalar field in a squeezed state in 3+1 dimensions. We show that, even for small squeezing, a volume term appears, whose coefficient is essentially independent of the field mass. This is in line with Page's argument that the entanglement entropy in an arbitrary quantum state is proportional to the number of degrees of freedom of the smaller subsystem. It follows that squeezed states can be considered as arbitrary quantum states, in contrast to the ground or coherent states that give rise to entanglement entropy that is dominated by a term proportional to the area of the entangling surface.</description>

Abstract: The vacuum of an accelerating observer is defined on the local inertial frame, which is called a ``moving frame''. However, in the discussion of the Unruh-deWitt detector, many papers define the vacuum on a fixed frame. This paper discusses the Unruh-deWitt detector by defining the vacuum directly on the local inertial frame, showing that the problem of the Stokes phenomenon can be solved by using the exact WKB.</description>

      <title>Swampland Conjectures Constraints on Dark Energy from a Highly Curved Field Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the interplay of the trans-Planckian censorship conjecture (TCC) and the swampland distance conjecture (SDC) in the context of multifield dark energy in a curved field space. In this scenario, the phase of accelerated expansion is realized as non-geodesic motion in a highly-curved field space, reminiscent of models developed in the context of inflation. The model features a stable attractor solution with near constant equation of state $w\simeq -1$, and predicts that the current era of accelerated expansion is eternal. The latter implies an eventual conflict with the TCC, which holds that the duration of any epoch of cosmic acceleration is bounded by the requirement that the large-scale observable universe is blind to Planck-scale early universe physics. This tension can be resolved by an interplay with the distance conjecture: for suitable parameter values, the apparent violation of the TCC occurs well after the fields have traversed a Planckian distance. The SDC then predicts a breakdown of the effective field theory (EFT) before the TCC can be violated. We derive the constraints on the model arising from the SDC+TCC and the de Sitter conjecture. We demonstrate that the model can be consistent with both swampland conjectures and observational data from Planck 2018 and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study on-shell scattering amplitudes for continuous-spin particles (CSPs). Poincar\'e invariance, little-group $ISO(2)$ covariance, analyticity, and on-shell factorisation (unitarity) impose stringent conditions on these amplitudes. We solve them by realizing a non-trivial representation for all little-group generators on the space of functions of bi-spinors. The three-point amplitudes are uniquely determined by matching their high-energy limit to that of definite-helicity (ordinary) massless particles. Four-point amplitudes are then bootstrapped using consistency conditions, allowing us to analyze the theory in a very transparent way, without relying on any off-shell Lagrangian formulation. We present several examples that highlight the main features of the resulting scattering amplitudes. We discuss CSP's amplitudes as a new infrared deformation of ordinary massless amplitudes, which is controlled by the scale of the Pauli-Lubanski vector squared, as opposed to the familiar mass deformation. Finally, we explore under which conditions it is possible to relax some assumptions, such as strict on-shell factorisation, analyticity, or others. In particular, we also investigate how continuous-spin particles may couple to gravity and electromagnetism, in a loose version of $S$-matrix principles.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study black hole solutions in double field theory. In the first part, we introduce a solution-generating method and classify black hole solutions into three categories in standard double field theory. To solve the problem of double time, we utilize space/time split double field theory in the second part to derive black hole solutions. By introducing a cosmological constant and imposing the strong constraint, our findings indicate that when considering the entire doubled spacetime, the curvature signifies a generalized AdS vacuum. However, in the subspace of the entire spacetime, black holes and curvature singularities emerge.</description>

Abstract: We construct several solutions of effective actions for string theories beyond the supergravity approximation utilizing the framework of the Double Field Theory (DFT). The DFT effective actions, which are well suited for accommodating abelian and non-abelian T dualities, are naturally written in terms of modified connections and curvatures with torsion. We construct the most general solutions with vanishing modified torsion, and such geometries don't receive quantum corrections. We also compute the leading $\alpha'$ corrections to several supergravity solutions, including a pair of geometries related by a non-abelian T duality.</description>

      <title>New purely damped pairs of quasinormal modes in a hot and dense strongly-coupled plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Perturbed black holes exhibit damped oscillations whose eigenfrequencies define their quasinormal modes (QNMs). In the case of asymptotically Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes, the spectra of QNMs are related to the near-equilibrium behavior of specific strongly interacting quantum field theories via the holographic gauge-gravity duality. In the present work, we numerically obtain the spectra of homogeneous non-hydrodynamic QNMs of a top-down holographic construction called the 2 R-Charge Black Hole (2RCBH) model, which describes a hot and dense strongly-coupled plasma. The main result is the discovery of a new structure of pairs of purely imaginary QNMs. Those new purely damped QNMs dominate the late time equilibration of the strongly-coupled plasma at large values of the chemical potential, while at lower values the fundamental QNMs are instead ordinary poles with imaginary and real parts describing oscillatory decaying perturbations. We also observe a new phenomenon of asymptotic pole fusion for different pairs of purely imaginary QNMs at asymptotically large values of the chemical potential. This phenomenon corresponds to the asymptotic merging of the two poles within each pair of purely imaginary QNMs, with the different pairs of merged poles being evenly spaced by a constant value of $4\pi$ in all the different perturbation channels associated to different irreducible representations of the spatial $SO(3)$ rotation symmetry of the medium. In particular, this indicates that characteristic equilibration times for the plasma develop upper bounds that cannot be surpassed by further doping the medium with increasing values of the chemical potential.</description>

Abstract: Conformal field theories with central charge $c\le1$ on random surfaces have been extensively studied in the past. Here, this discussion is extended from their equilibrium distribution to their critical dynamics. This is motivated by the conjecture that these models describe the time evolution of certain social networks that are self-driven to a critical point. The time evolution of the surface area is shown to follow a Cox Ingersol Ross process. Planar surfaces shrink, while higher genus surfaces grow until the cosmological constant stops their growth. Two different equilibrium states are distinguished, dominated by (i) planar surfaces, and (ii) ``foamy'' surfaces, whose genus diverges. Time variations of the order parameter are analyzed and are found to have generalized hyperbolic distributions. In state (i), those have power law tails with a tail index close to 4. Analogies between the time evolution of the order parameter and a multifractal random walk are also pointed out.</description>

      <title>Nicolai maps for supersymmetric sigma models</title>

Abstract: Supersymmetric field theories can be characterized by their Nicolai map, which is a nonlinear and nonlocal field transformation to their free-field limit. The systematic construction of such maps has recently been outlined for actions with power more than two in the fermions, which produces a perturbative expansion in loop-decorated fermionic tree diagrams. We thoroughly investigate the nonlinear $\mathbb C P^1$ sigma model in ($3{+}1$)-dimensional Minkowski space as a paradigmatical example. We construct and test a chiral form of the Nicolai map, to third order in the coupling, including all (regularized) quantum parts. In addition, all trees with one or two edges are summed up. The free-action condition determines only the one-edge part of the map. We resolve the fermion loop decoration of the Nicolai trees by injecting an auxiliary vector field and present the ensuing classical Nicolai map to second order in a dimensionful coupling.</description>

      <title>Matrix Theory Reloaded: A BPS Road to Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the decoupling limits that lead to matrix theories on D-branes. We highlight the BPS nature of these limits, in which the target space geometry becomes non-Lorentzian and wrapped D-branes experience instantaneous gravitational forces. Applied to curved D-brane geometries, we show that a single BPS decoupling limit induces the bulk near-horizon limit leading to AdS/CFT. By consecutively applying two such limits, we systematically generate further examples of holography, including novel versions with non-Lorentzian bulk geometry. Uplifted to M-theory, we are led to a unified framework where each BPS decoupling limit corresponds to a Discrete Light Cone Quantisation (DLCQ). We conjecture that a DLCQ${}^n$/DLCQ${}^{m}$ correspondence, with $m&gt;n$, captures the notion of holography in string theory. In particular, AdS${}_5$/CFT${}_4$ can be viewed as an example of DLCQ${}^0$/DLCQ${}^{1}$, with the extra DLCQ on the field theory side corresponding to the near-horizon limit in the bulk geometry. We further show that undoing these BPS decoupling limits can be viewed as deformations of matrix theories. We explain how these deformations are related to the $T\bar{T}$ deformation in two dimensions. In the context of holography, this allows us to view the ten-dimensional near-horizon brane geometry as an intrinsic deformation of the flat non-Lorentzian geometry that arises asymptotically. In field theoretic terms, these generalisations lead to $T\bar{T}$-like flow equations for the D$p$-brane DBI action.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2011.02867v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics is based on probabilities as fundamental entities of a mathematical description. Expectation values of observables are computed according to the classical statistical rule. The overall probability distribution for one world covers all times. The quantum formalism arises once one focuses on the evolution of the time-local probabilistic information. Wave functions or the density matrix allow the formulation of a general linear evolution law for classical statistics. The quantum formalism for classical statistics is a powerful tool which allows us to implement for generalized Ising models the momentum observable with the associated Fourier representation. The association of operators to observables permits the computation of expectation values in terms of the density matrix by the usual quantum rule. We show that probabilistic cellular automata are quantum systems in a formulation with discrete time steps and real wave functions. With a complex structure the evolution operator for automata can be expressed in terms of a Hamiltonian involving fermionic creation and annihilation operators. The time-local probabilistic information amounts to a subsystem of the overall probabilistic system which is correlated with its environment consisting of the past and future. Such subsystems typically involve probabilistic observables for which only a probability distribution for their possible measurement values is available. Incomplete statistics does not permit to compute classical correlation functions for arbitrary subsystem-observables. Bell's inequalities are not generally applicable.</description>

      <title>Higher memory effects and the post-Newtonian calculation of their gravitational-wave signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new hierarchy of lasting gravitational-wave effects (the higher memory effects) was recently identified in asymptotically flat spacetimes, with the better-known displacement, spin, and center-of-mass memory effects included as the lowest two orders in the set of these effects. These gravitational-wave observables are determined by a set of temporal moments of the news tensor, which describes gravitational radiation from an isolated source. The moments of the news can be expressed in terms of changes in charge-like expressions and integrals over retarded time of flux-like terms, some of which vanish in the absence of radiation. In this paper, we compute expressions for the flux-like contributions to the moments of the news in terms of a set of multipoles that characterize the gravitational-wave strain. We also identify a part of the strain that gives rise to these moments of the news. In the context of post-Newtonian theory, we show that the strain related to the moments of the news is responsible for the many nonlinear, instantaneous terms and "memory" terms that appear in the post-Newtonian expressions for the radiative multipole moments of the strain. We also apply our results to compute the leading post-Newtonian expressions for the moments of the news and the corresponding strains that are generated during the inspiral of compact binary sources. These results provide a new viewpoint on the waveforms computed from the multipolar post-Minkowski formalism, and they could be used to assess the detection prospects of this new class of higher memory effects.</description>

      <title>Dirac Spectral Density in N$_f$=2+1 QCD at T=230 MeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the renormalized Dirac spectral density in $N_f = 2+1$ QCD at physical quark masses, temperature $T = 230$ MeV and system size $L_s = 3.4$ fm. To that end, we perform a point-wise continuum limit of the staggered density in lattice QCD with staggered quarks. We find, for the first time, that a clear infrared structure (IR peak) emerges in the density of Dirac operator describing dynamical quarks. We also provide numerical evidence that a component of this peak, which becomes dominant in the thermodynamic limit, is due to a non-trivial accumulation of near-zero modes. Features of this structure are consistent with those previously attributed to the recently-proposed IR phase of thermal QCD. Our results (i) provide the only complete first-principles evidence that these IR features exist and are physical; (ii) improve the upper bound for IR-phase transition temperature $T_{\mathrm{IR}}$ so that the new window is $200 &lt; T_{\mathrm{IR}} &lt; 230\,$MeV; (iii) are consistent with non-restoration of anomalous U$_{\mathrm A}$(1) symmetry (chiral limit) below $T = 230$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Attractor in Ultracold Atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12921v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hydrodynamic attractor is a concept that describes universal equilibration behavior in which systems lose microscopic details before hydrodynamics becomes applicable. We propose a setup to observe hydrodynamic attractors in ultracold atomic gases, taking advantage of the fact that driving the two-body $s$-wave scattering length causes phenomena equivalent to isotropic fluid expansions. We specifically consider two-component fermions with contact interactions in three dimensions and discuss their dynamics under a power-law drive of the scattering length in a uniform system. By explicit computation, we derive a hydrodynamic relaxation model. We analytically solve their dynamics and find the hydrodynamic attractor solution. Our proposed method using the scattering length drive is applicable to a wide range of ultracold atomic systems, and our results establish these as a new platform for exploring hydrodynamic attractors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider spherically symmetric gravity coupled to a spherically symmetric scalar field with a specific coupling which depends on the Areal Radius. Classical collapse is described by the Vaidya solution. The semiclassical Einstein equations are well defined. Their solution describes an evaporating black hole. A balance law at future null infinity relates the rate of change of a back reaction-corrected Bondi mass to a manifestly positive flux. Its detailed form suggests a quantum extension of future null infinity along which all information including that in the collapsing matter is expected to emerge.</description>

      <title>Canonical quantization of the dark positive-energy Dirac field (and time asymmetry)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16545v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform canonical quantization of the single-component, spin-zero field that was introduced by Dirac in 1971 and recently suggested as a candidate for dark matter by Bogomolny. The massive and massless cases are treated separately. Since in the massive case only positive-frequency modes are normalizable and regarded as physical, the mode expansion for the field involves annihilation operators only, making the quantization procedure particularly simple. The corresponding Hamiltonian turns out to be unambiguous, with no need for normal ordering. The positive-energy requirement imposed on the second-quantized system leads to equally acceptable Bose and Fermi choices for particle statistics. This suggests supersymmetric extension of original Dirac's theory in which Bose and Fermi single-component positive-energy Dirac fields are combined into a doublet whose members can transform into each other. Our model includes a Landau-Anderson-Higgs type potential which allows spontaneous selection of the universe with a given bose-to-fermi ratio of the positive-energy Dirac particles. The bosonic sector of proposed extension hints at the possibility of a dark, background spacetime condensate that endows the universe with its cosmological temporal asymmetry. In the massless case of Dirac's original theory, we explore the possibility of allowing the field expansion to involve both positive- and negative-frequency modes. This leads to the anticommutation relations for creation and annihilation operators associated with the negative energy solutions, resulting in supersymmetric behavior of the single-component field in the ultrarelativistic limit. Finally, we speculate on the possibility for the positive-energy Dirac particles to obey some exotic (such as non-abelian, Clifford) statistics in which the particles are neither created nor destroyed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze all possible symmetry reductions of Lagrangians that yield fully equivalent field equations for any 4-dimensional metric theory of gravity. Specifically, we present a complete list of infinitesimal group actions obeying the principle of symmetric criticality, identify the corresponding invariant metrics (and $l$-chains), discuss relations among them, and analyze simplifications allowed by the residual diffeomorphism group and Noether identities before and after variation of the reduced Lagrangian. We employ rigorous treatment of the symmetry reduction by Fels and Torre and use the Hicks classification of infinitesimal group actions by means of Lie algebras pairs of isometries and their isotropy subalgebras. The classification is recast in the coordinates in which the well-known symmetries and geometries are easily recognizable and relatable to each other. The paper is accompanied by a code for the symmetry reduction of Lagrangians that we developed in \texttt{xAct} package of \textsc{Mathematica}.</description>

      <title>Stochastic gravitational wave background anisotropies from inflation with non-Bunch-Davies states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been known that stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs) have anisotropies generated by squeezed-type tensor non-Gaussianities originating from scalar-tensor-tensor (STT) and tensor-tensor-tensor cubic interactions. While the squeezed tensor non-Gaussianities in the standard slow-roll inflation with the Bunch-Davies vacuum state are suppressed due to the so-called consistency relation, those in extended models with the violation of the consistency relation can be enhanced. Among such extended models, we consider the inflation model with the non-Bunch-Davies state that has been known to enhance the squeezed tensor non-Gaussianities. We explicitly formulate the primordial STT bispectrum induced during inflation in the context of Horndeski theory with the non-Bunch-Davies state and show that the induced SGWB anisotropies can be enhanced. We then discuss the detectability of those anisotropies in future gravitational wave experiments.</description>

      <title>Angular integrals with three denominators via IBP, mass reduction, dimensional shift, and differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Angular integrals arise in a wide range of perturbative quantum field theory calculations. In this work we investigate angular integrals with three denominators in $d=4-2\varepsilon$ dimensions. We derive integration-by-parts relations for this class of integrals, leading to explicit recursion relations and a reduction to a small set of master integrals. Using a differential equation approach we establish results up to order $\varepsilon$ for general integer exponents and masses. Here, reduction identities for the number of masses, known results for two-denominator integrals, and a general dimensional-shift identity for angular integrals considerably reduce the required amount of work. For the first time we find for angular integrals a term contributing proportional to a Euclidean Gram determinant in the $\varepsilon$-expansion. This coefficient is expressed as a sum of Clausen functions with intriguing connections to Euclidean, spherical, and hyperbolic geometry. The results of this manuscript are applicable to phase-space calculations with multiple observed final-state particles.</description>
