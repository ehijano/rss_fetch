      <title>Data-generating process and time-series asset pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the data-generating processes for factors expressed in return differences, which the literature on time-series asset pricing seems to have overlooked. For the factors' data-generating processes or long-short zero-cost portfolios, a meaningful definition of returns is impossible; further, the compounded market factor (MF) significantly underestimates the return difference between the market and the risk-free rate compounded separately. Surprisingly, if MF were treated coercively as periodic-rebalancing long-short (i.e., the same as size and value), Fama-French three-factor (FF3) would be economically unattractive for lacking compounding and irrelevant for suffering from the small "size of an effect." Otherwise, FF3 might be misspecified if MF were buy-and-hold long-short. Finally, we show that OLS with net returns for single-index models leads to inflated alphas, exaggerated t-values, and overestimated Sharpe ratios (SR); worse, net returns may lead to pathological alphas and SRs. We propose defining factors (and SRs) with non-difference compound returns.</description>

      <title>Is the annualized compounded return of Medallion over 35%?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is a challenge to estimate fund performance by compounded returns. Arguably, it is incorrect to use yearly returns directly for compounding, with reported annualized return of above 60% for Medallion for the 31 years up to 2018. We propose an estimation based on fund sizes and trading profits and obtain a compounded return of 32.6% before fees with a 3% financing rate. Alternatively, we suggest using the manager's wealth as a proxy and arriving at a compounded growth rate of 25.6% for Simons for the 33 years up to 2020. We conclude that the annualized compounded return of Medallion before fees is probably under 35%. Our findings have implications for how to compute fund performance correctly.</description>
