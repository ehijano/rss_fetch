      <title>Mixed-feedback oscillations in the foraging dynamics of arboreal turtle ants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a model for the dynamics of the flow into and out of a nest for the arboreal turtle ant $\textit{Cephalotes goniodontus}$ during foraging to investigate a possible mechanism for the emergence of oscillations. In our model, there is mixed dynamic feedback between the flow of ants between different behavioral compartments and the concentration of pheromone along trails. On one hand, the ants deposit pheromone along the trail, which provides a positive feedback by increasing rates of return to the nest. On the other hand, pheromone evaporation is a source of negative feedback, as it depletes the pheromone and inhibits the return rate. We prove that the model is globally asymptotically stable in the absence of pheromone feedback. Then we show that pheromone feedback can lead to a loss of stability of the equilibrium and onset of sustained oscillations in the flow in and out of the nest via a Hopf bifurcation. This analysis sheds light on a potential key mechanism that enables arboreal turtle ants to effectively optimize their trail networks to minimize traveled path lengths and eliminate graph cycles.</description>

      <title>How Much is Enough? An Empirical Test of the Resource Dispersion Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free-ranging dogs (Canis familiaris) thrive in diverse landscapes, including those heavily modified by humans. This study investigated the influence of resource availability on their spatial ecology across 52 rural and 41 urban sites, comparing urban and rural environments. Census-based surveys were conducted to understand the distribution of dogs and resources, while territory-based observations were carried out across different seasons to capture temporal variability in dog populations and resource availability. Dog and resource density were significantly higher in urban areas, supporting the Resource Dispersion Hypothesis (RDH). Territory size (TS) varied seasonally, decreasing significantly (by 21%) post-mating, likely reflecting shifts in resource demands and distribution. TS was positively correlated with resource heterogeneity, dispersion, patch richness, and male-to-female ratio, but not with group size, which remained stable across seasons and resource gradients. This suggests that while resource availability and sex ratio influence space use, social factors play a key role in shaping group dynamics. These findings highlight the complex interplay between resource availability, social behaviour, and human influences in shaping the spatial ecology of free-ranging dogs and have important implications for their management and disease control, informing targeted interventions such as spay/neuter programs and responsible waste management in both urban and rural landscapes.</description>

      <title>The role of wild birds in the global highly pathogenic avian influenza H5 panzootic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5 clade 2.3.4.4b has triggered an unprecedented global panzootic. As the frequency and scale of HPAI H5 outbreaks continue to rise, understanding how wild birds contribute to shape the global virus spread across regions, affecting poultry, domestic and wild mammals, is increasingly critical. In this review, we examine ecological and evolutionary studies to map the global transmission routes of HPAI H5 viruses, identify key wild bird species involved in viral dissemination, and explore infection patterns, including mortality and survival. We also highlight major remaining knowledge gaps that hinder a full understanding of wild birds role in viral dynamics, which must be addressed to enhance surveillance strategies and refine risk assessment models aimed at preventing future outbreaks in wildlife, domestic animals and safeguard public health.</description>

      <title>Monitoring biodiversity on highly reactive rock-paper-scissors models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates how biodiversity is affected in a cyclic spatial May-Leonard model with hierarchical and non-hierarchical rules. Here we propose a generalization of the traditional rock-paper-scissors model by considering highly reactive species, i. e., species that react in a stronger manner compared to the others in respect to either competition or reproduction. These two classes of models, called here Highly Competitive and Highly Reproductive models, may lead to hierarchical and non-hierarchical dynamics, depending on the number of highly reactive species. The fundamental feature of these models is the fact that hierarchical models may as well support biodiversity, however, with a higher probability of extinction than the non-hierarchical ones, which are in fact more robust. This analysis is done by evaluating the probability of extinction as a function of mobility. In particular, we have analyzed how the dominance scheme changes depending on the highly reactive species for non-hierarchical models, where the findings lead to the conclusion that highly reactive species are usually at a disadvantage compared to the others. Moreover, we have investigated the power spectrum and the characteristic length of each species, including more information on the behavior of the several systems considered in the present work.</description>

      <title>Multi-type $\Xi$-coalescents from structured population models with bottlenecks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an individual-based model for structured populations undergoing demographic bottlenecks, i.e. drastic reductions in population size that last many generations and can have arbitrary shapes. We first show that the (non-Markovian) allele-frequency process converges to a Markovian diffusion process with jumps in a suitable relaxation of the Skorokhod J1 topology. Backward in time we find that genealogies of samples of individuals are described by multi-type $\Xi$-coalescents presenting multiple simultaneous mergers with simultaneous migrations. These coalescents are also moment-duals of the limiting jump diffusions. We then show through a numerical study that our model is flexible and can predict various shapes for the site frequency spectrum, consistent with real data, using a small number of interpretable parameters.</description>

      <title>Higher-order evolutionary dynamics with game transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-order interactions are prevalent in real-world complex systems and exert unique influences on system evolution that cannot be captured by pairwise interactions. We incorporate game transitions into the higher-order prisoner's dilemma game model, where these transitions consistently promote cooperation. Moreover, in systems with game transitions, the fraction of higher-order interactions has a dual impact, either enhancing the emergence and persistence of cooperation or facilitating invasions that promote defection within an otherwise cooperative system.</description>

      <title>Redefining Fitness: Evolution as a Dynamic Learning Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolution is the process of optimal adaptation of biological populations to their living environments. This is expressed via the concept of fitness, defined as relative reproductive success. However, it has been pointed out that this definition is incomplete and logically circular. To address this issue, several authors have called for new ways to specify fitness explicitly in terms of the relationship between phenotypes and their environment. Here, we show that fitness, defined as the likelihood function that follows from mapping population dynamics to Bayesian learning, provides a general solution to this problem. We show how probabilistic models of fitness can easily be constructed in this way, and how their averages acquire meaning as information. We also show how this approach leads to powerful tools to analyze challenging problems of evolution in variable environments, game theory, and selection in group-structured populations. The approach is general and creates an explicit bridge between population dynamics under selection, statistical learning theory, and emerging models of artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>The ecological forecast limit revisited: Potential, actual and relative system predictability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ecological forecasts are model-based statements about currently unknown ecosystem states in time or space. For a model forecast to be useful to inform decision makers, model validation and verification determine adequateness. The measure of forecast goodness that can be translated into a limit up to which a forecast is acceptable is known as the 'forecast limit'. While verification in weather forecasting follows strict criteria with established metrics and forecast limits, assessments of ecological forecasting models still remain experiment-specific, and forecast limits are rarely reported. As such, users of ecological forecasts remain uninformed of how far into the future statements can be trusted. In this work, we synthesise existing approaches to define empirical forecast limits in a unified framework for assessing ecological predictability and offer recipes for their computation. We distinguish the model's potential and absolute forecast limit, and show how a benchmark model can help determine its relative forecast limit. The approaches are demonstrated with three case studies from population, ecosystem, and Earth system research. We found that forecast limits can be computed with three requirements: A verification reference, a scoring function, and a predictive error tolerance. Within our framework, forecast limits are defined for practically any ecological forecast and support research on ecological predictability analysis.</description>
