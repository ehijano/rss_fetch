      <title>Stable rationality of hypersurfaces in sch\"{o}n affine varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a development in approaching rationality problems through the motivic methods (cf. [Kontsevich--Tschinkel'19], [Nicaise--Shinder'19], [Nicaise--Ottem'21]). This method requires the explicit construction of degeneration families of curves with favorable properties. While the specific construction is generally difficult, [Nicaise--Ottem'22] combines combinatorial methods to construct degeneration families of hypersurfaces in toric varieties and shows the non-stable rationality of a very general hypersurface in projective spaces. In this paper, we extend the result of [Nicaise--Ottem'22] not only for hypersurfaces in algebraic tori but also to those in sch\"{o}n affine varieties. In application, we show the irrationality of certain hypersurfaces in the complex Grassmannian variety Gr(2, n) using the motivic method, which coincides with the result obtained by the same author in the previous research.</description>

      <title>Descending strong generation in algebraic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formalize the main approach for showing Zariski descent-type statements for strong generation of triangulated categories associated to algebro-geometric objects. This recovers various known statements in the literature. As applications we show that strong generation for the singularity category of a Noetherian separated scheme is Zariski local and obtain a strong generation result for the bounded derived category of a Noetherian concentrated algebraic stacks with finite diagonal.</description>

      <title>Beyond Algebraic Superstring Compactification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superstring compactifications have been vigorously studied for over four decades, and have flourished involving an active iterative feedback between physics and (complex) algebraic geometry. This led to an unprecedented wealth of constructions, virtually all of which are "purely" algebraic. Recent developments however indicate many more possibilities to be afforded by including certain generalizations that, at first glance at least, are not algebraic -- yet fit remarkably well within an overall mirror-symmetric framework and are surprisingly amenable to standard computational analysis upon certain mild but systematic modifications.</description>

Abstract: Schmidt's subspace theorem in terms of Seshadri constants for closed subschemes in subgeneral position has been already developed sharply. We derive our theorem for numerically equivalent ample divisors by dint of the above theory step by step, providing a joint generalization of Schmidt's theorem for algebraic points of bounded degree.</description>

      <title>A new method for reducing algebraic programs to polynomial programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a generalization of polynomial programs: algebraic programs, which are optimization or feasibility problems with algebraic objectives or constraints. Algebraic functions are defined as zeros of multivariate polynomials. They are a rich set of functions that includes polynomials themselves, but also ratios and radicals, and finite compositions thereof. When an algebraic program is given in terms of radical expressions, a straightforward way of reformulating into a polynomial program is to introduce a new variable for each distinct radical that appears. Hence, the rich theory and algorithms for polynomial programs, including satisfiability via cylindrical algebraic decomposition, infeasibility certificates via Positivstellensatz theorems, and optimization with sum-of-squares programming directly apply to algebraic programs. We propose a different reformulation, that in many cases introduces significantly fewer new variables, and thus produces polynomial programs that are easier to solve. First, we exhibit an algorithm that finds a defining polynomial of an algebraic function given as a radical expression. As a polynomial does not in general define a unique algebraic function, additional constraints need to be added that isolate the algebraic function from others defined by the same polynomial. Using results from real algebraic geometry, we develop an algorithm that generates polynomial inequalities that isolate an algebraic function. This allows us to reformulate an algebraic program into a polynomial one, by introducing only a single new variable for each algebraic function. On modified versions of classic optimization benchmarks with added algebraic terms, our formulation achieves speedups of up to 50x compared to the straightforward reformulation.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic intersection theory in Riemannian homogeneous spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $M=G/H$ be a Riemannian homogeneous space, where $G$ is a compact Lie group with closed subgroup $H$. Classical intersection theory states that the de Rham cohomology ring of $M$ describes the signed count of intersection points of submanifolds $Y_1, \ldots, Y_s$ of $M$ in general position, when the codimensions add up to $\dim M$.
  We introduce the probabilistic intersection ring $\mathrm{H}_{\mathbb E}(M)$, whose multiplication describes the unsigned count of intersection points, when the $Y_i$ are randomly moved by independent uniformly random elements of $G$. The probabilistic intersection ring $\mathrm{H}_{\mathbb E}(M)$ has the structure of a graded commutative and associative real Banach algebra. It is defined as a quotient of the ring of Grassmann zonoids of a fixed cotangent space $V$ of $M$. The latter was introduced by the authors in [Adv. Math. 402, 2022]. There is a close connection to valuations of convex bodies: $\mathrm{H}_{\mathbb E}(M)$ can be interpreted as a subspace of the space of translation invariant, even, continuous valuations on $V$, whose multiplication coincides with Alesker's multiplication for smooth valuations.
  We describe the ring structure of the probabilistic intersection ring for spheres, real projective space and complex projective space, relying on Fu [J. Diff. Geo. 72(3), 2006] for the latter case. From this, we derive an interesting probabilistic intersection formula in complex projective space. Finally, we initiate the investigation of the probabilistic intersection ring for real Grassmannians, outlining the construction of a probabilistic version of Schubert Calculus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.09845v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the main open parts of the Kawaguchi--Silverman Conjecture, asserting that for a birational self-map $f$ of a smooth projective variety $X$ defined over $\overline{\mathbb Q}$, the arithmetic degree $\alpha_f(x)$ exists and coincides with the first dynamical degree $\delta_f$ for any $\overline{\mathbb Q}$-point $x$ of $X$ with a Zariski dense orbit. Among other results, we show that this holds when $X$ has Kodaira dimension zero and irregularity $q(X) \ge \dim X -1$ or $X$ is an irregular threefold (modulo one possible exception). We also study the existence of Zariski dense orbits, with explicit examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.09864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a correspondence between Mori dream regions arising from small modifications of normal projective varieties and $\mathbb{C}^*$-actions on polarized pairs which are bordisms. Moreover, we show that the Mori dream regions constructed in this way admit a chamber decomposition on which the models are the geometric quotients of the $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. In addition we construct, from a given $\mathbb{C}^*$-action on a polarized pair for which there exist at least two admissible geometric quotients, a $\mathbb{C}^*$-equivariantly birational $\mathbb{C}^*$-variety, whose induced action is a bordism, called the pruning of the variety.</description>

Abstract: We study the Hodge filtration of the intersection cohomology Hodge module for toric varieties. More precisely, we study the cohomology sheaves of the graded de Rham complex of the intersection cohomology Hodge module and give a precise formula relating it with the stalks of the intersection cohomology as a constructible complex. The main idea is to use the Ishida complex in order to compute the higher direct images of the sheaf of reflexive differentials.</description>

Abstract: For each smooth curve over a finite field, after puncturing it at finitely many points, we construct local systems on it of geometric origin which do not come from a family of abelian varieties. We do so by proving a criterion which must be satisfied by local systems which do come from abelian varieties, inspired by an analogous Hodge theoretic criterion in characteristic zero.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of Rational Cuspidal Curves via the WDVV equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a conjectural formula for the characteristic number of rational cuspidal curves in the projective plane by extending the idea of Kontsevich's recursion formula (namely, pulling back the equality of two divisors in the four pointed moduli space). The key geometric input that is needed here is that in the closure of rational cuspidal curves, there are two component rational curves which are tangent to each other at the nodal point. While this fact is geometrically quite believable, we haven't as yet proved it; hence our formula is for the moment conjectural. The answers that we obtain agree with what has been computed earlier Ran, Pandharipande, Zinger and Ernstrom and Kennedy. We extend this technique (modulo another conjecture) to obtain the characteristic number of rational quartics with an E6 singularity.</description>

      <title>Fiber products under toric flops and flips</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Sigma$ and $\Sigma'$ be two refinements of a fan $\Sigma_0$ and $f \colon X_{\Sigma} \dashrightarrow X_{\Sigma'}$ be the birational map induced by $X_{\Sigma} \rightarrow X_{\Sigma_0} \leftarrow X_{\Sigma'}$. We show that the graph closure $\overline{\Gamma}_f$ is a not necessarily normal toric variety and we give a combinatorial criterion for its normality.
  In contrast to it, for $f$ being a toric flop/flip, we show that the scheme-theoretic fiber product $X:=X_{\Sigma}\mathop{\times}\limits_{X_{\Sigma_0}}X_{\Sigma'}$ is in general not toric, though it is still irreducible and $X_{\rm red} = \overline{\Gamma}_f$.
  A complete numerical criterion to ensure $X = X_{\rm red}$ is given for 3-folds, which is fulfilled when $X_\Sigma$ has at most terminal singularities. In this case, we further conclude that $X$ is normal.</description>

Abstract: Let $K$ be a number field and $A/K$ be an abelian variety of dimension $g$. Assuming that the image $G_{\ell^\infty}$ of the natural Galois representation attached to the Tate module $T_\ell(A)$ is $\operatorname{GSp}_{2g}(\mathbb{Z}_\ell)$ for all sufficiently large primes $\ell$, we provide a semi-effective bound $\ell_0(A/K)$ such that $G_{\ell^\infty}=\operatorname{GSp}_{2g}(\mathbb{Z}_\ell)$ for all primes $\ell &gt; \ell_0(A/K)$. The bound is given in terms of the Faltings height of $A$ and of the cardinality of the residue field at a suitably generic place of $K$. We also describe an algorithmic approach to obtain better bounds for abelian threefolds over $\mathbb{Q}$.</description>

      <title>Categorifying Zeta Functions for Quadratic Covers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In various contexts, the zeta function of an object splits into a product of $L$-functions. We categorify this product formula for quadratic covers of objects in the following contexts: quadratic extensions of number fields, ramified double covers of algebraic curves, ramified double covers of topological spaces and Galois double covers of graphs. Our unified approach utilizes objective linear algebra in the abstract incidence algebra of each object, interpreted appropriately. We also provide several applications: for a hyperelliptic curve $C$ over a finite field, we prove a collection of combinatorial formulas relating the number of ramified, split and inert points on $C$ to the overall point count of $C$; and for a graph $G$, we deduce analogous combinatorial formulas for the numbers of split and inert primes in a Galois double cover $\widetilde{G}\rightarrow G$. We then use the formulas for graphs to deduce asymptotic counts of cycles in supersingular isogeny graphs and certain associated dual graphs of special fibers of Shimura curves. Finally, we analyze quadratic reciprocity from the perspective of zeta functions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work of Scott and Wilmer and of Woodroofe extends the Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem from set systems to subspaces of k-forms in an exterior algebra. We prove an extension of the Hilton-Milner theorem to the exterior algebra setting, answering in a strong way a question asked by these authors.</description>

      <title>Existence and unicity of pluriharmonic maps to Euclidean buildings and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a complex smooth quasi-projective variety $X$, a reductive algebraic group $G$ defined over some non-archimedean local field $K$ and a Zariski dense representation $\varrho:\pi_1(X)\to G(K)$, we construct a $\varrho$-equivariant pluriharmonic map from the universal cover of $X$ into the Bruhat-Tits building $\Delta(G)$ of $G$, with appropriate asymptotic behavior. We also establish the uniqueness of such a pluriharmonic map in a suitable sense, and provide a geometric characterization of these equivariant maps. This paper builds upon and extends previous work by the authors jointly with G. Daskalopoulos and D. Brotbek.</description>

      <title>Torsion of elliptic curves with rational $j$-invariant over the maximal elementary abelian 2-extension of $\mathbb{Q}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we classify the possible torsion subgroup structures of elliptic curves defined over the compositum of all quadratic extensions of the rational number field, whose $j$-invariant is a rational number not equal to 0 or 1728.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Functorial Homological Mirror Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mostly inspired by recent work by Katzarkov, Kontsevich, and Shehsmani, combined with previous work by Aganagic, Ooguri, Saulina and Vafa with regard to BPS black hole microstate counting in terms of topological field theory calculations, we will show how these tools can be applied to concrete setups arising from String Theory, and why the formalism of functorial Homological Mirror Symmetry needs to be further developed.</description>
