      <title>A new multiple-arc model of the resonant Kuiper belt objects -- Plutinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To incorporate the gravitational influence of Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) in planetary ephemerides, uniform-ring models are commonly employed. In this paper, for representing the KBO population residing in Neptune's 2:3 mean motion resonance (MMR), known as the Plutinos, we introduce a three-arc model by considering their resonant characteristics. Each `arc' refers to a segment of the uniform ring and comprises an appropriate number of point masses. Then the total perturbation of Plutinos is numerically measured by the change in the Sun-Neptune distance ($\Delta d_{SN}$). We conduct a comprehensive investigation to take into account various azimuthal and radial distributions associated with the resonant amplitudes ($A$) and eccentricities ($e$) of Plutinos, respectively. The results show that over a 100-year period: (1) at the smallest $e=0.05$, the Sun-Neptune distance change $\Delta d_{SN}$ caused by Plutinos decreases significantly as $A$ reduces. It can deviate from the value of $\Delta d_{SN}$ obtained in the ring model by approximately 100 km; (2) as $e$ increases in the medium range of 0.1-0.2, the difference in $\Delta d_{SN}$ between the arc and ring models becomes increasingly significant; (3) at the largest $e\gtrsim0.25$, $\Delta d_{SN}$ can approach zero regardless of $A$, and the arc and ring models exhibit a substantial difference in $\Delta d_{SN}$, reaching up to 170 km. Then the applicability of our three-arc model is further verified by comparing it to the perturbations induced by observed Plutinos on the positions of both Neptune and Saturn. Moreover, the concept of the multiple-arc model, designed for Plutinos, can be easily extended to other MMRs densely populated by small bodies.</description>

      <title>Light Scattering Measurements of KCl Particles as an Exoplanet Cloud Analog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Salt clouds are predicted to be common on warm exoplanets, but their optical properties are uncertain. The Exoplanet Cloud Ensemble Scattering System (ExCESS), a new apparatus to measure the scattering intensity and degree of linear polarization (DOLP) for an ensemble of particles, is introduced here and used to study the light scattering properties of KCl cloud analogs. ExCESS illuminates particles with a polarized laser beam (532 nm) and uses a photomultiplier tube detector to sweep the plane of illumination. Scattering measurements for KCl particles were collected for three size distributions representative of modeled clouds for the warm exoplanet GJ 1214b. Our measurements show that Lorenz-Mie calculations, commonly used to estimate the light scattering properties of assumedly spherical cloud particles, offer an inaccurate depiction of cubic and cuboid shaped KCl particles. All of our measurements indicate that Lorenz-Mie scattering overestimates the backscattering intensity of our cloud analogs and incorrectly predicts the scattering at mid-phase angles (~90 degrees) and preferential polarization state of KCl scattered light. Our results align with the general scattering properties of non-spherical particles and underscore the importance of further understanding the effects that such particles will have on radiative transfer models of exoplanet atmospheres and reflected light observations of exoplanets by the upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and Habitable Worlds Observatory.</description>

      <title>Our Solar System Neighborhood: Three Diverging Tales of Planetary Habitability and Windows to Earth's Past and Future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding planetary habitability is one of the major challenges of the current scientific era, particularly given the discovery of a large and diverse terrestrial exoplanet population. Discerning the primary factors that contribute to planetary habitability may be extracted through a detailed examination of the terrestrial planets within the Solar System, most particularly Venus, Earth, and Mars, and the evolution of their interiors and atmospheres through time. Here, we provide a detailed description of the fundamental properties of these three planets, the effects of solar evolution, and the potential contributions of these various aspects toward driving their evolutionary pathways. We argue that evolution of Venus, Earth, and Mars provide essential templates from which a more comprehensive approach toward the study of planetary habitability may be derived.</description>

      <title>Origins of Super Jupiters: TOI-2145b Has a Moderately Eccentric and Nearly Aligned Orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super Jupiters are giant planets with several Jupiter masses. It remains an open question whether these planets originate with such high masses or grow through collisions. Previous work demonstrates that warm super Jupiters tend to have more eccentric orbits compared to regular-mass warm Jupiters. This correlation between mass and eccentricity may indicate that planet-planet interactions significantly influence the warm giant planet demographics. Here we conducted a detailed characterization of a warm super Jupiter, TOI-2145b. This analysis utilized previous observations from TESS and Keck/HIRES, enhanced by new Rossiter-McLaughlin effect data from the NEID spectrometer on the 3.5 m WIYN Telescope. TOI-2145b is a $5.68^{+0.37}_{-0.34} M_{\rm Jup}$ planet on a moderate eccentricity ($e = 0.214^{+0.014}_{-0.014}$), 10.26-day orbit, orbiting an evolved A-star. We constrain the projected stellar obliquity to be $\lambda = 6.8^{+2.9}_{-3.8}$$^\circ$ from two NEID observations. Our $N$-body simulations suggest that the formation of super Jupiter TOI-2145b could involve either of two scenarios: a high initial mass or growth via collisions. On a population level, however, the collision scenario can better describe the mass-eccentricity distribution of observed warm Jupiters.</description>

      <title>Condensation and the Volatility Trend of the Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article describes condensation of the elements and use of condensation temperatures (Tcond) to interpret the volatility trend of the Earth. Major points are: (1) a listing of updated 50% Tcond for all natural elements and Pu at 1e-2 to 1e-8 bar pressure for solar composition matter. (2) The Tcond are mainly controlled by the Gibbs energy of condensation reactions and also by the Gibbs energy of ideal mixing if elements (compounds) condense in a solution. The Gibbs energy change of non-ideal solution (activity coefficients not equal to 1) is a secondary effect. (3) The theoretically correct relationship between Tcond and fraction condensed is derived from mass balance and chemical thermodynamic considerations. (4) The maximum amount of element condensed per 1/T, is at the inflection point in the logistic (sigmoid) curve for an element, which is also at (or close to) the 50% Tcond. (5) Plots of normalized elemental abundances versus 50% Tcond (volatility trends) are qualitative indicators of elemental fractionations due to volatility. (6) Volatility trend plots for average elemental abundances in CM, CO, CV, CR, H, L, LL, EH, EL chondrites show different trends for moderately and highly volatile elements, which may be linear, curved, a step function, or plateau. Comparison of three abundance sets for CM and CV chondrites shows trends depend on which elements are plotted, which data sources are used, and which temperature range is considered. (7) Proposed mechanisms for volatile element depletion in carbonaceous chondrites and the Earth are reviewed. (8) Possible implications of volatile element abundances in the bulk silicate Earth are discussed.</description>

      <title>Improving the parametrization of transport and mixing processes in planetary atmospheres: the importance of implementing the full Coriolis acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the ongoing characterisation of the atmospheres of exoplanets by the JWST, we are unveiling a large diversity of planetary atmospheres, both in terms of composition and dynamics. As such, it is necessary to build coherent atmospheric models for exoplanetary atmospheres to study their dynamics in any regime of thickness, stratification and rotation. However, many models only partially include the Coriolis acceleration with only taking into account the local projection of the rotation vector along the vertical direction (this is the so-called "Traditional Approximation of Rotation") and do not accurately model the effects of the rotation when it dominates the stratification.
  In this contribution, we report the ongoing efforts to take the full Coriolis acceleration into account for the transport of momentum and the mixing of chemicals. First, we show how the horizontal local component of the rotation vector can deeply modifies the instabilities of horizontal sheared flows and the turbulence they can trigger. Next, we show how the interaction between waves and zonal winds can be drastically modified because of the modification of the wave damping or breaking when taking into account the full Coriolis acceleration. These works are devoted to improve the parameterization of waves and turbulent processes in global atmospheric models.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov exponents in fundamental models of nonlinear resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of analytical estimation of the Lyapunov exponents and Lyapunov timescales of the motion in multiplets of interacting nonlinear resonances is considered. To this end, we elaborate a unified framework, based on the separatrix map theory, which incorporates both an earlier approach for the first fundamental model of perturbed resonance (given by the perturbed pendulum Hamiltonian) and a new one for its second fundamental model (given by the perturbed Andoyer Hamiltonian). Within this framework, new accurate estimates for the Lyapunov timescales of the inner and outer subsystems of the Solar planetary system are presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>The Enigmatic Smooth Patch on Comet 9P/Tempel 1: Revisiting Deep Impact and Stardust/NExT Missions Outcomes for Novel Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the region containing the large smooth patch on comet Tempel 1, focusing on its spectral and morphological characteristics and those of its surroundings. Utilizing observational data from the Deep Impact and Stardust-NExT missions, an updated stereophotoclinometry-based shape model, and numerical simulations, we aim to investigate the origin and evolution of this feature. Our study characterizes the morphological changes between the two mission visits, determining that the smooth patch has a thickness of approximately 25 meters. This patch is embedded in a cliff with an average height of 50 meters and exhibits a lobate U-shape morphology. Our findings support the previously suggested idea that an ice flow phenomenon is compatible with the observations. Moreover, our simulations indicate that a single phenomenon could link both the large and secondary smooth patches and the mass wasting feature observed on the comet's opposite northern face. We propose that a cryovolcano-like event may be responsible for this smooth feature, although more evidence is needed to support this hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Activity of main-belt comet 324P/La Sagra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the activity evolution of the main-belt comet 324P/La Sagra over time and the properties of its emitted dust. We performed aperture photometry on images taken by a wide range of telescopes at optical and thermal infrared wavelengths between 2010 and 2021. We derived the combined scattering cross section of the nucleus and dust (when present) as a function of time, and we derived the thermal emission properties. Fitting an IAU H-G phase function to the data obtained when 324P was likely inactive, we derived an absolute nucleus magnitude $H_R = (18.4 \pm 0.5)$ mag using $G = 0.15 \pm 0.12$. The activity of 324P/La Sagra during the 2015 perihelion passage has significantly decreased compared to the previous perihelion passage in 2010, and it decreased even further during the 2021 perihelion passage. This decrease in activity may be attributed to mantling or to the depletion of volatile substances. The $Af\rho$ profile analysis of the coma of the main-belt comet suggests a near-perihelion transition from a lower-activity pre-perihelion to a higher-activity post-perihelion steady state. We calculate a dust geometric albedo in the range of (2 - 45)%, which prevents us from constraining the spectral type of 324P/La Sagra, but we found an indication of dust superheating at 4.5 micrometers.</description>

      <title>Newtonian restricted three-body gravitational problem with positive and negative point masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Newtonian restricted three-body problem involving a positive primary point mass, $m_+$, and a negative secondary point mass, $m_-$, in a circular orbit, and a positive or negative tertiary point mass, $m_3$, with $m_+ &gt; |m_-| \gg |m_3|$, is solved. Five Lagrange points are found for $m_3$, three of which are coplanar with $m_+$ and $m_-$, and two of which are not, a subtle consequence of the gravitational repulsion from $m_-$. All Lagrange points are linearly unstable, except for one point in the regime $m_+ \gtrsim 8.4 |m_-|$, which is linearly stable and collinear with $m_+$ and $m_-$.</description>

      <title>New Cold Subdwarf Discoveries from Backyard Worlds and a Metallicity Classification System for T Subdwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the results of a spectroscopic survey of candidate T subdwarfs identified by the Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 program. Near-infrared spectra of 31 sources with red $J-W2$ colors and large $J$-band reduced proper motions show varying signatures of subsolar metallicity, including strong collision-induced H$_2$ absorption, obscured methane and water features, and weak K I absorption. These metallicity signatures are supported by spectral model fits and 3D velocities, indicating thick disk and halo population membership for several sources. We identify three new metal-poor T subdwarfs ([M/H] $\lesssim$ $-$0.5), CWISE J062316.19+071505.6, WISEA J152443.14$-$262001.8, and CWISE J211250.11-052925.2; and 19 new "mild" subdwarfs with modest metal deficiency ([M/H] $\lesssim$ $-$0.25). We also identify three metal-rich brown dwarfs with thick disk kinematics. We provide kinematic evidence that the extreme L subdwarf 2MASS J053253.46+824646.5 and the mild T subdwarf CWISE J113010.07+313944.7 may be part of the Thamnos population, while the T subdwarf CWISE J155349.96+693355.2 may be part of the Helmi stream. We define a metallicity classification system for T dwarfs that adds mild subdwarfs (d/sdT), subdwarfs (sdT), and extreme subdwarfs (esdT) to the existing dwarf sequence. We also define a metallicity spectral index that correlates with metallicities inferred from spectral model fits and iron abundances from stellar primaries of benchmark T dwarf companions. This expansion of the T dwarf classification system supports investigations of ancient, metal-poor brown dwarfs now being uncovered in deep imaging and spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>The physical and chemical processes in protoplanetary disks: constraints on the composition of comets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14529v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the recent observations of protoplanetary disks together with relevant theoretical studies with an emphasis on the evolution of volatiles. In the last several years Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) provided evidence of grain growth, gas-dust decoupling, and sub-structures such as rings and gaps in the dust continuum. Molecular line observations revealed radial and vertical distributions of molecular abundances and also provided significant constraints on the gas dynamics such as turbulence. While sub-millimeter and millimeter observations mainly probe the gas and dust outside the radius of several au, ice and inner warm gas are investigated at shorter wavelengths. Gas and dust dynamics are key to connecting these observational findings. One of the emerging trends is inhomogeneous distributions of elemental abundances, most probably due to dust-gas decoupling.</description>

Abstract: Time transformation between the geocentric, solar system barycentric, and luni-centric coordinate reference systems requires relativistic corrections to account for differences in gravitational potential and relative motion. To maintain consistency with Terrestrial Time (TT), solar system Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB) on average must exhibit no rate difference from TT. Although the IAU has established resolutions for transformations involving TT and TDB, the analogous transformation between TDB and a lunar surface time scale (TL) is essential, especially with upcoming robotic and crewed lunar missions. In this paper, we compute the rate terms involved in that transformation. We also present the TDB-compatible spatial scale and Lorentz contraction of Moon-centered positional coordinates. These transformations have been implemented in the JPL programs used to generate ephemerides of the Moon and planets. Finally, we provide expressions that can be used to synchronize TT and TL using either TDB or TT. The relevant transformations contain a small secular drift between the two time scales, at the rate of 56.0256 us/d, along with additional small periodic terms that can be numerically evaluated using the solar system and lunar ephemerides.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the gas-phase C/O ratio of DR Tau's outer disk from CS, SO, and C$_2$H observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01679</link>

Abstract: Millimeter wavelength observations of Class II protoplanetary disks often display strong emission from hydrocarbons and high CS/SO values, providing evidence that the gas-phase C/O ratio commonly exceeds 1 in their outer regions. We present new NOEMA observations of CS $5-4$, SO $7_6-6_5$ and $5_6-4_5$, C$_2$H $N=3-2$, HCN $3-2$, HCO$^+$ $3-2$, and H$^{13}$CO$^+$ $3-2$ in the DR Tau protoplanetary disk at a resolution of $\sim0.4''$ (80 au). Estimates for the disk-averaged CS/SO ratio range from $\sim0.4-0.5$, the lowest value reported thus far for a T Tauri disk. At a projected separation of $\sim180$ au northeast of the star, the SO moment maps exhibit a clump that has no counterpart in the other lines, and the CS/SO value decreases to $&lt;0.2$ at its location. Thermochemical models calculated with DALI indicate that DR Tau's low CS/SO ratio and faint C$_2$H emission can be explained by a gas-phase C/O ratio that is $&lt;1$ at the disk radii traced by NOEMA. Comparisons of DR Tau's SO emission to maps of extended structures traced by $^{13}$CO suggest that late infall may contribute to driving down the gas-phase C/O ratio of its disk.</description>

      <title>Enhancing 3D Planetary Atmosphere Simulations with a Surrogate Radiative Transfer Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces an approach to enhancing the computational efficiency of 3D atmospheric simulations by integrating a machine-learned surrogate model into the OASIS global circulation model (GCM). Traditional GCMs, which are based on repeatedly numerically integrating physical equations governing atmospheric processes across a series of time-steps, are time-intensive, leading to compromises in spatial and temporal resolution of simulations. This research improves upon this limitation, enabling higher resolution simulations within practical timeframes. Speeding up 3D simulations holds significant implications in multiple domains. Firstly, it facilitates the integration of 3D models into exoplanet inference pipelines, allowing for robust characterisation of exoplanets from a previously unseen wealth of data anticipated from JWST and post-JWST instruments. Secondly, acceleration of 3D models will enable higher resolution atmospheric simulations of Earth and Solar System planets, enabling more detailed insights into their atmospheric physics and chemistry. Our method replaces the radiative transfer module in OASIS with a recurrent neural network-based model trained on simulation inputs and outputs. Radiative transfer is typically one of the slowest components of a GCM, thus providing the largest scope for overall model speed-up. The surrogate model was trained and tested on the specific test case of the Venusian atmosphere, to benchmark the utility of this approach in the case of non-terrestrial atmospheres. This approach yields promising results, with the surrogate-integrated GCM demonstrating above 99.0% accuracy and 147 factor GPU speed-up of the entire simulation compared to using the matched original GCM under Venus-like conditions.</description>

      <title>High Resolution ALMA Observations of Richly Structured Protoplanetary Disks in $\sigma$ Orionis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: ALMA has detected substructures in numerous protoplanetary disks at radii from a few to over a hundred au. These substructures are commonly thought to be associated with planet formation, either by serving as sites fostering planetesimal formation or arising as a consequence of planet-disk interactions. Our current understanding of substructures, though, is primarily based on observations of nearby star-forming regions with mild UV environments, whereas stars are typically born in much harsher UV environments, which may inhibit planet formation in the outer disk through external photoevaporation. We present high resolution ($\sim8$ au) ALMA 1.3 mm continuum images of eight disks in $\sigma$ Orionis, a cluster irradiated by an O9.5 star. Gaps and rings are resolved in the images of five disks. The most striking of these is SO 1274, which features five gaps that appear to be arranged nearly in a resonant chain. In addition, we infer the presence of gap or shoulder-like structures in the other three disks through visibility modeling. These observations indicate that substructures robustly form and survive at semi-major axes of several tens of au or less in disks exposed to intermediate levels of external UV radiation as well as in compact disks. However, our observations also suggest that disks in $\sigma$ Orionis are mostly small and thus millimeter continuum gaps beyond a disk radius of 50 au are rare in this region, possibly due to either external photoevaporation or age effects.</description>

      <title>Photochemical Hazes in Exoplanetary Skies with Diamonds: Microphysical Modeling of Haze Composition Evolution via Chemical Vapor Deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observational efforts in the last decade suggest the prevalence of photochemical hazes in exoplanetary atmospheres. Recent JWST observations raise growing evidence that exoplanetary hazes tend to have reflective compositions, unlike the conventionally assumed haze analogs, such as tholin and soot. In this study, I propose a novel hypothesis: diamond formation through chemical vapor deposition (CVD) may be happening in exoplanetary atmospheres. Using an aerosol microphysical model combined with the theory of CVD diamond and soot formation established in the industry community, I study how the haze composition evolves in exoplanetary atmospheres for various planetary equilibrium temperature, atmospheric metallicity, and C/O ratio. I find that CVD diamond growth dominates over soot growth in a wide range of planetary parameters. Diamond haze formation is most efficient at $T_{\rm eq}\sim1000~{\rm K}$ and low atmospheric metallicity ([M/H]$\le2.0$), while soot could be the main haze component only if the atmosphere is hot ($T_{\rm eq}\ge1200~{\rm K}$) and carbon rich (C/O$&gt;1$). I also compute transmission, emission, and reflected light spectra, thereby suggesting possible observational signatures of diamond hazes, including the $3.53~{\rm {\mu}m}$ feature of hydrogenated diamonds, anomalously faint thermal emission due to thermal scattering, and a drastic increase in geometric albedo. This study suggests that warm exoplanetary atmospheres may be favorable sites for forming CVD diamonds, which would be testable by future observations by JWST and Ariel as well as haze synthesis experiments under hot hydrogen-rich conditions.</description>
