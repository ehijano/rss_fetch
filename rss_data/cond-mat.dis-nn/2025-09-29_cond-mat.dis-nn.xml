      <title>Dimer-driven multiple reentrant localization with composite potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21338v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have revealed reentrant localization transitions in quasi-periodic one-dimensional lattices, where the competition between dimerized hopping and staggered disorder plays a central role. Yet the extent to which such reentrant localization persists under more general conditions, such as additional periodic potentials, modified quasi-periodic modulations remains unclear. Here we investigate localization phenomena in a one-dimensional lattice subject to a periodic potential and an additional quasi-periodic modulation. Using both eigenstate-based indicators and experimentally accessible dynamical observables, we identify robust reentrant, or multiple, localization transitions. We show that these transitions are uniquely stabilized by the dimer structure of the unit cell, where the competition between the onsite periodic potential and the quasi-periodic modulation becomes most pronounced. By systematically varying the periodicity parameter $\alpha$ and the quasi-periodic frequency $\beta$, we find that the robust multiple reentrant localization behavior disappears for any deviation from the dimer configuration, confirming its essential role. Our results suggest that the interplay between these competing factors drives the multiple reentrant localization transitions.</description>

      <title>Transfer tensor analysis of localization in the Anderson and Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the transfer tensor method to analyze localization and transport in simple disordered systems, specifically the Anderson and Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper models. Emphasis is placed on the memory effects that emerge when ensemble-averaging over disorder, even when individual trajectories are strictly Markovian. We find that memory effects are necessary to remove fictitious terms that would correspond to redrawing static disorder at each time step, which would create a temporally uncorrelated dynamic disorder. Our results show that while eternal memory is a necessary condition for localization, it is not sufficient. We determine that signatures of localization and transport can be found within the transfer tensors themselves by defining a metric called "outgoing-pseudoflux". This work establishes connections between theoretical research on dynamical maps and Markovianity and localization phenomena in physically realizable model systems.</description>

      <title>Toward a Physics of Deep Learning and Brains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks and brains both learn and share superficial similarities: processing nodes are likened to neurons and adjustable weights are likened to modifiable synapses. But can a unified theoretical framework be found to underlie them both? Here we show that the equations used to describe neuronal avalanches in living brains can also be applied to cascades of activity in deep neural networks. These equations are derived from non-equilibrium statistical physics and show that deep neural networks learn best when poised between absorbing and active phases. Because these networks are strongly driven by inputs, however, they do not operate at a true critical point but within a quasi-critical regime -- one that still approximately satisfies crackling noise scaling relations. By training networks with different initializations, we show that maximal susceptibility is a more reliable predictor of learning than proximity to the critical point itself. This provides a blueprint for engineering improved network performance. Finally, using finite-size scaling we identify distinct universality classes, including Barkhausen noise and directed percolation. This theoretical framework demonstrates that universal features are shared by both biological and artificial neural networks.</description>

      <title>Universal Model of Urban Street Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyzing 9,000 urban areas' street networks, we identify properties, including extreme betweenness centrality heterogeneity, that typical spatial network models fail to explain. Accordingly we propose a universal, parsimonious, generative model based on a two-step mechanism that begins with a spanning tree as a backbone then iteratively adds edges to match empirical degree distributions. Controlled by a single parameter representing lattice-equivalent node density, it accurately reproduces key universal properties to bridge the gap between empirical observations and generative models.</description>

      <title>Statistical Advantage of Softmax Attention: Insights from Single-Location Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models rely on attention mechanisms with a softmax activation. Yet the dominance of softmax over alternatives (e.g., component-wise or linear) remains poorly understood, and many theoretical works have focused on the easier-to-analyze linearized attention. In this work, we address this gap through a principled study of the single-location regression task, where the output depends on a linear transformation of a single input token at a random location. Building on ideas from statistical physics, we develop an analysis of attention-based predictors in the high-dimensional limit, where generalization performance is captured by a small set of order parameters. At the population level, we show that softmax achieves the Bayes risk, whereas linear attention fundamentally falls short. We then examine other activation functions to identify which properties are necessary for optimal performance. Finally, we analyze the finite-sample regime: we provide an asymptotic characterization of the test error and show that, while softmax is no longer Bayes-optimal, it consistently outperforms linear attention. We discuss the connection with optimization by gradient-based algorithms.</description>

      <title>Uniform Hyperbolicity, Bandgaps and Edge Modes in Aperiodic Systems of Subwavelength Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We aim to characterise the spectral distributions of bi-infinite, semi-infinite, and finite aperiodic one-dimensional arrays of subwavelength resonators, constructed by sampling from a finite library of building blocks. By adopting the modern formalism of uniform hyperbolicity, we are able to strengthen and rigorously prove a Saxon-Hutner-type result, fully characterising the spectral gaps of the composite bi-infinite aperiodic system in terms of its constituent blocks. Crucial to this approach is a change of basis from transfer matrices to propagation matrices, allowing for a block-level characterisation. This approach also enables an explicit characterisation of edge-induced eigenmodes in the semi-infinite setting. Finally, we leverage finite section methods for Jacobi operators to extend our results to finite systems - providing strict bounds for their spectra in terms of their constituent blocks.</description>

      <title>Symmetry- and energy-resolved entanglement dynamics in a disordered Bose-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14825v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using numerical quantum quenches with the integration of both symmetry and energy resolutions, we comprehensively study the dynamics of symmetry-resolved entanglement in a disordered Bose-Hubbard (dBH) model, concentrating on the two types of inhomogeneous initial states to target the lower- and higher-energy sections of its dynamical phase diagram. (i) Motivated by the recent experiment [A. Lukin et al., Science 364, 256 (2019)] which focused on the lower-energy dynamic behaviors of the dBH chain, we first show that, at low energies, for a thermalizing state, although the second law of thermodynamics prohibits the decrease of the total entropy over time, for part of the channel-resolved entropies, a long-term entropic reduction may arise at weak disorder. (ii) A companion channel-resolved analysis at strong disorder further hints that the priorly observed double-log growth of the number entropy might not directly indicate the breakdown of MBL in spin or fermion chains, providing a refreshing perspective on this major controversy in the community. (iii) From time-evolving the line-shape low-energy product state, we subsequently reveal an abrupt formation of a novel "entropy imbalance pattern" across the different symmetry channels. Intriguingly, this imbalance melts in the strong-disorder limit. We conjecture that the melting of the entropic pattern, together with the freezing of a concurrent particle-density wave, embodies a dual trait inherent to MBL. (iv) Specifically, we find a cluster MBL regime, unique to the Bose statistics, emerging from the higher-energy section. This cluster MBL regime realizable even at weak disorder appears not suffer from the finite-size drift and is distinguished by its absence of the hallmark of MBL - the unbounded growth of the entanglement entropy. Our theoretical predictions are by and large testable via the present experimental facilities.</description>

      <title>Density of states correlations in L\'evy Rosenzweig-Porter model via supersymmetry approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23903v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We studied global density-of-states correlation function $R(\omega)$ for L\'evy-Rosenzweig-Porter random matrix ensemble in the non-ergodic extended phase. Using an extension of Efetov's supersymmetry approach we calculated $R(\omega)$ exactly in all relevant ranges of $\omega$. At relatively low $\omega \leq \Gamma$\, (with $\Gamma \gg \Delta$ being the effective miniband width) we found GUE-type oscillations with period of level spacing $\Delta$, decaying exponentially at the Thouless energy scale $E_{Th} = \sqrt{\Delta \Gamma/2\pi}$. At high energies $\omega \gg E_{Th}$ our results coincide with those obtainen via cavity equation approach. Inverse of the effective miniband width, $1/\Gamma$, is shown to be given by the average of the local decay times over L\'evy distribution.</description>

      <title>Implicit bias produces neural scaling laws in learning curves, from perceptrons to deep networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scaling laws in deep learning -- empirical power-law relationships linking model performance to resource growth -- have emerged as simple yet striking regularities across architectures, datasets, and tasks. These laws are particularly impactful in guiding the design of state-of-the-art models, since they quantify the benefits of increasing data or model size, and hint at the foundations of interpretability in machine learning. However, most studies focus on asymptotic behavior at the end of training. In this work, we describe a richer picture by analyzing the entire training dynamics: we identify two novel \textit{dynamical} scaling laws that govern how performance evolves as function of different norm-based complexity measures. Combined, our new laws recover the well-known scaling for test error at convergence. Our findings are consistent across CNNs, ResNets, and Vision Transformers trained on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Furthermore, we provide analytical support using a single-layer perceptron trained with logistic loss, where we derive the new dynamical scaling laws, and we explain them through the implicit bias induced by gradient-based training.</description>

      <title>Two failure modes of deep transformers and how to avoid them: a unified theory of signal propagation at initialisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding the right initialisation for neural networks is crucial to ensure smooth training and good performance. In transformers, the wrong initialisation can lead to one of two failure modes of self-attention layers: rank collapse, where all tokens collapse into similar representations, and entropy collapse, where highly concentrated attention scores lead to training instability. While previous work has studied different scaling regimes for transformers, an asymptotically exact, down-to-the constant prescription for how to initialise transformers has so far been lacking. Here, we provide an analytical theory of signal propagation through deep transformers with self-attention, layer normalisation, skip connections and MLP. Our theory yields a simple algorithm to compute trainability diagrams that identify the correct choice of initialisation hyper-parameters for a given architecture. We overcome the key challenge, an exact treatment of the self-attention layer, by establishing a formal parallel with the Random Energy Model from statistical physics. We also analyse gradients in the backward path and determine the regime where gradients vanish at initialisation. We demonstrate the versatility of our framework through three case studies. Our theoretical framework gives a unified perspective on the two failure modes of self-attention and gives quantitative predictions on the scale of both weights and residual connections that guarantee smooth training.</description>

      <title>Exact results on the hydrodynamics of certain kinetically-constrained hopping processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a model of interacting random walkers on a triangular chain and triangular lattice, where a particle can move only if the other two sites of the triangle are unoccupied -- a kinetically-constrained hopping process (KCHP) recently introduced in the context of non-linear diffusion cascades. Using a classical-to-quantum mapping -- where the rate matrix of the stochastic KCHP corresponds to a spin Hamiltonian, and the equilibrium probability distribution to the quantum ground state -- we develop a systematic perturbation theory to calculate the diffusion constant; the hydrodynamics of the KCHPs is determined by the low-energy properties of the spin Hamiltonian, which we analyse with the standard Holstein-Primakoff spin-wave expansion.
  For the triangular hopping we consider, we show that \textit{non-interacting} spin-wave theory predicts the \textit{exact} diffusion constant. We conjecture this holds for all KCHPs with (i) hard-core occupancy, (ii) parity-symmetry, and (iii) where the hopping processes are given by three-site gates -- that is, where hopping between two sites is conditioned on the occupancy of a third. We further show that there are corrections to the diffusion constant when the KCHP is described by \textit{four}-site gates, which we calculate at leading order in the semi-classical $1/S$ expansion. We support all these conclusions with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Intuition emerges in Maximum Caliber models at criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whether large predictive models merely parrot their training data or produce genuine insight lacks a physical explanation. This work reports a primitive form of intuition that emerges as a metastable phase of learning that critically balances next-token prediction against future path-entropy. The intuition mechanism is discovered via mind-tuning, the minimal principle that imposes Maximum Caliber in predictive models with a control temperature-like parameter $\lambda$. Training on random walks in deterministic mazes reveals a rich phase diagram: imitation (low $\lambda$), rule-breaking hallucination (high $\lambda$), and a fragile in-between window exhibiting strong protocol-dependence (hysteresis) and multistability, where models spontaneously discover novel goal-directed strategies. These results are captured by an effective low-dimensional theory and frame intuition as an emergent property at the critical balance between memorizing what is and wondering what could be.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal interactions are widely observed in nonequilibrium systems, from biological or sociological dynamics to open quantum systems. Despite the ubiquity of nonreciprocity, its impact on phase transitions is not fully understood. In this work, we derive criteria to perturbatively assess whether nonreciprocity changes the universality class of pairs of asymmetrically coupled systems undergoing a phase transition. These simple criteria are stated in terms of the unperturbed critical exponents, in the spirit of the Harris criterion for disordered systems, and agree with numerical simulations. Beyond nonreciprocity, our approach provides guidelines for assessing how dynamical phase transitions are affected by perturbations.</description>
