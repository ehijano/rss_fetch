      <title>Sub-MHz Radio Background from Ultralight Dark Photon Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark photons are a well-motivated candidate for dark matter, but their detection becomes challenging for ultralight masses with both experimental and astrophysical probes. In this work, we propose a new approach to explore this regime through the dark inverse Compton scattering of ultralight dark photons with cosmic ray electrons and positrons. We show this process generates a potentially observable background radiation that is most prominent at frequencies below MHz. We compute this effect using the latest cosmic ray models and radio absorption maps. Comparing it to observations of the Milky Way's radio spectrum from Explorer 43, Radio Astronomy Explorer 2, and the Parker Solar Probe, we place leading constraints on the kinetic mixing of dark photon dark matter for masses $\lesssim 2 \times 10^{-17} \ \rm eV$.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves of GUT Phase Transition during Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GUT phase transition during inflation solves the GUT monopole problem on one hand. On the other hand, gravitational waves (GWs) from such a phase transition, if it is first-order, are redshifted and deformed, and might be observed today in GW observatories. We review the formalism of inflated GWs and derive the general deformation function between inflated and uninflated GW spectra in the instant-source application. It is valid for any e-folding number of instant source. Applying the formalism to GUT phase transition, we find that the e-folding number at 15 or 25 can shift the GWs to 10 Hz or mHz hands, respectively, which might be tested in the future ground-based or space-based interferometers. We further generalise the discussion to inflated GWs via phase transition below the GUT scale. It is worth mentioning that, due to the deformation of the spectrum, the peak of inflated GWs is not simply a redshift of the peak of uninflated GWs.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We first describe the predictions concerning jet production in the very forward region, especially in the FOCAL kinematic region of the ALICE collaboration at CERN as a test of saturation. We also compare vector meson production cross sections at the LHC in Pb Pb and p Pb collisions with the Balitsky Fadin Kuraev Lipatov and the Balitsky Kovchegov evolution equations and data favor the observation of saturation at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Mountains: current-carrying domain walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain wall (DW) networks may have formed in the early universe following the spontaneous breaking of a discrete symmetry. Notably, several particle physics models predict the existence of current-carrying DWs, which can capture and store particles as zero modes on it. In this study, we demonstrate that gravitational waves (GWs) generated by current-carrying DWs with fermionic zeromodes exhibit a novel feature: an additional peak in the GW spectrum resembling mountains, arising from metastable topological remnants, which we term ``spherons.'' This distinct signature could be detectable in upcoming GW observatories such as LISA and ET. The results suggest that DW networks in beyond Standard Model scenarios could emit GW signals that are significantly stronger and with greater detectability than previously expected.</description>

      <title>Heavy quark suppression and anisotropic flow at intermediate momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an intermediate-momentum regime where mass effects are significant, heavy quark suppression and anisotropic flow are computed to investigate the transition between the collisional and radiative energy loss. Based on the collision kernel for diffusion, elastic scattering and semi-collinear gluon-bremsstrahlung can be consistently incorporated into a Boltzmann equation that involves the heavy quark diffusion coefficient. Using the running coupling constant and the diffusion coefficient constrained by lattice QCD data, the collisional and radiative energy-loss contributions to the $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ are studied in hydrodynamically expanding thermal media. The evolution of the observables, the bulk flow effect, and the dependence on mass and centrality are discussed in noncentral heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>On the pole trajectory of the subthreshold negative parity nucleon with varying pion masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the pole trajectory of the recently established subthreshold negative parity nucleon, namely the $N^*(920)$, with varying pion masses, in the scheme of linear $\sigma$ model with nucleons. We find that the pole moves from the complex plane to the real axis rather straightfowardly, on the second Riemann sheet. We also re-examined the $\sigma$ pole trajectory and find it in good agreement with Roy equation analysis result.</description>

      <title>Equivalence between top-down and bottom-up holographic approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work raises the question of whether finding an equivalent bottom-up description to a given top-down one is possible. We consider the vector meson spectrum derived in the D3/D7 system to answer this question. Using WKB analysis, we reconstruct a bottom-up confining potential that resembles the geometric structure of the so-called hardwall model. We compute some properties for this bottom-up model, including the thermal deconfinement phase transition, the $\rho$ radial Regge trajectory, and the configurational entropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stueckelberg introduced an axion like scalar field to provide mass to the gauge electromagnetic field without breaking gauge invariance. This can be considered as a precursor to the spontaneously broken abelian Higgs model. We will consider its role in cosmology to provide a novel candidate to the dark matter question. In addition its implications to deeper issues will be pointed out.</description>

      <title>Systematic analysis of the mass spectra of $\Omega_{ccb}$ and $\Omega_{bbc}$ baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass spectra, root mean square (r.m.s.) radii and radial density distributions of $\Omega_{ccb}$ and $\Omega_{bbc}$ baryons are systematically analyzed in the present work. The calculations are carried out in the frame work of relativized quark model, where the baryon is regarded as a real three-quark system. Our results show that the excited energy of charmed-bottom triply baryons are always associated with heavier quark. This means the lowest state of $\Omega_{ccb}$ baryon is dominated by the $\lambda$-mode, however, the dominant orbital excitation for $\Omega_{bbc}$ baryon is $\rho$-mode. In addition, the influence of configuration mixing on mass spectrum, which is induced by different angular momentum assignments, is also analyzed. It shows that energy of the lowest state will be further lowered by this mixing effect. According to this conclusion, we systematically analyze the mass spectra of the ground and excited states($1S\sim4S$, $1P\sim4P$, $1D\sim4D$, $1F\sim4F$ and $1G\sim4G$). Finally, with the predicated mass spectra, the Regge trajectories of $\Omega_{ccb}$ and $\Omega_{bbc}$ in the ($J$,$M^{2}$) plane are constructed.</description>

      <title>Complete function space for planar two-loop six-particle scattering amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the full system of canonical differential equations for all planar two-loop massless six-particle master integrals, and determine analytically the boundary conditions. This fully specifies the solutions, which may be written as Chen iterated integrals. We argue that this is sufficient information for evaluating any scattering amplitude in four dimensions up to the finite part. We support this claim by reducing, for the most complicated integral topologies, integrals with typical Yang-Mills numerators. We use the analytic solutions to the differential equations, together with dihedral symmetry, to provide the full solution space relevant for two-loop six-particle computations. This includes the relevant function alphabet, as well as the independent set of iterated integrals up to weight four. We also provide the answer for all master integrals in terms of iterated integrals that can be readily evaluated numerically. As a proof of concept, we provide a numerical implementation that evaluates the integrals in part of the Euclidean region, and validate this against numerical evaluation of the Feynman integrals. Our result removes the bottleneck of Feynman integral evaluation, paving the way to future analytic evaluations of six-particle scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Constraining eV-scale axion-like particle dark matter: insights from the M87 Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) can account for the observed dark matter (DM) of the Universe and if their masses are at the eV scale, they can decay into infrared, optical and ultraviolet photons with a decay lifetime larger than the age of the Universe. We analyze multi-wavelength data obtained from the central region of Messier 87 (M87) galaxy by several telescopes, such as, Swift, Astrosat, Kanata, Spitzer and International Ultraviolet Explorer in the infrared to ultraviolet frequencies ($\sim 2\times10^{14} \, {\rm Hz} - 3\times10^{15}$ Hz), to constrain the narrow emission lines indicative of the eV scale ALP DM decay. We derive constraints on the ALP coupling to two photons ($g_{a\gamma\gamma}$) for ALP mass range $2 \, {\rm eV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 20 \, {\rm eV}$, assuming ALPs form the DM in the M87 halo. We find that our bounds on ALP-two-photon coupling can become stronger than the existing ones by an order of magnitude in the ALP mass range $8 \, {\rm eV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 20 \, {\rm eV}$.</description>

      <title>QCD Phase Diagram and Astrophysical Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I make a brief review about the QCD phases and the equation of state inferred from the neutron star data. Along the temperature axis at low baryon density, the QCD phase transition is a smooth crossover, and it is a natural extension of our imagination to postulate a similar crossover along the density axis at low temperature. Even without phase transitions, the inferred thermodynamic properties of neutron star matter turn out to be highly nontrivial already at twice of the nuclear saturation density. I also give some discussions about the substantiation of quark matter by means of the gravitational wave signals including the multi-messenger prospect.</description>

Abstract: We present methods for the numerical evaluation of the master integrals that appear in the calculation of scattering amplitudes at higher order in perturbative quantum field theory. We follow the general strategy of solving first-order ordinary differential equations through series expansion. We have collected these procedures in an open source computer program that we dub \Line{}. Boundary conditions can be provided by the user or computed internally using the method of expansion by regions. Illustrative examples are also given.</description>

      <title>Lie, Noether, Kosmann, and Diffeomorphism Anomalies Redux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03667v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Noether procedure carries an inherent ambiguity due to the necessary local extension, no longer a symmetry, of the global symmetry. The gauging should fix the ambiguity once and for all, however, and, for translations, the general covariance demands us to use the Lie derivative. We argue that, with this alone and without any further tweaking, the Noether energy-momentum $\hat{\mathbb{T}}$ must equal the symmetric counterpart, $T$, inevitably and show the equality explicitly for general tensors. For spinors, a subtlety with the Lie derivative itself enters the issue and leads us to the Kosmann lift, often unnoticed by the physics community, from which $T=\hat{\mathbb{T}}$ again emerges straightforwardly and in a naturally symmetric form. Finally, we address how the same Kosmann lift affects the anomaly computations and show that the diffeomorphism anomaly from the seminal paper must be halved, while the venerable anomaly polynomials themselves stand unaffected. We discuss the ramifications of these findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The general theory of relativity is currently established as the most precise theory of gravity supported by observations, and its application is diverse ranging from astronomy to cosmology, while its application to astrophysics has been restricted only to compact stars due to the assumption that the Newtonian approximation is sufficient for celestial bodies with medium density such as the sun. Surprisingly, the recent research of the author has implied that this long-held assumption is not valid, and that non-perturbative effects significantly change relevant results obtained by Newtonian gravity. In particular, local physical quantities inside the sun are newly predicted to exhibit power law differently from the so-called standard solar model. This surprising result is reviewed including brief discussion of physics behind the discrepancy and a new application of the new mass formula to gas planets.</description>

      <title>Studying the Strangeness $D$-Term in Hall C via Exclusive $\phi$ Electroproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a measurement of exclusive electroproduction of $\phi$ mesons near threshold in Hall C. The $|t|$-dependence of the exclusive $\phi$ cross section, $d\sigma/d|t|$, has recently been proposed as an observable sensitive to the strangeness $D$-term. The contribution of strangeness to the total quark $D$-term is presently unknown, with different arguments favoring $D_s$ being large, small, or even having opposite sign from the total quark $D$-term. In addition, this dataset will allow us to perform measurements of other exclusive meson final states, including the first measurement of $\eta'$ electroproduction.</description>

      <title>Very high energy cosmic ray particles from the Kerr black hole at the galaxy center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional general relativity supplies the notion of a vacuum tension and thus a maximum force $F_{max}=c^4/4G\approx\ 3\times 10^{43}$ Newtons, that is realized for a black hole. In conjunction with the Wilson area rule, we are thus led to the surface confinement of the mass of a black hole analogous to the surface confinement of quarks. The central result of our paper is that PeV scale protons exist on the surface of a Kerr black hole residing at our galactic center that is in concert with the HAWC Collaboration result of a PeVatron at the galactic center.</description>

      <title>Describing the speed of sound peak of isospin-asymmetric cold strongly interacting matter using effective models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-monotonic behavior of the speed of sound for isospin imbalanced strongly interacting matter, found by recent lattice QCD simulations, can be reproduced within the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model and Linear Sigma Model with quarks when the couplings become isospin chemical potential-dependent. The introduction of medium-dependent couplings can potentially affect the equivalence between the thermodynamic relations and their definitions from statistical mechanics. We describe the procedure to compensate for the introduction of medium-dependent couplings to preserve the correct thermodynamic identities. We find the isospin chemical potential dependence for the couplings from the isospin density LQCD data and, after finding the compensating function to correctly describe the pressure, we show that the description of the square of the speed of sound reported by LQCD is well reproduced when using the found medium-dependent couplings in both models.</description>

Abstract: The observed Standard Model (SM) quark/lepton mass hierarchies and the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) mixing pattern are described in an ${\rm SU}(8)$ theory through its realistic symmetry breaking pattern with three intermediate stages, which rely on a set of $d=5$ gravity-induced operators that break the emergent global symmetries in the chiral fermion sector, as well as the precise identifications of all non-trivially embedded SM flavors.</description>

      <title>A Potential Model Study of the Nucleon's Charge and Mass Radius</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the charge and mass distributions within a nucleon and compute the associated squared radii based on a potential model approach. Different constituent quark configurations such as $\Delta$, $Y$, and quark-diquark are considered and compared, with model parameters calibrated by experimental measurements of the proton and neutron charge radius. The results suggest that while the charge radius is dictated by quark dynamics, the mass radius is strongly influenced by nonperturbative QCD contributions to a nucleon's mass that are not sensitive to the constituent quarks. As a result, the mass radius could become substantially different from the charge radius. The obtained nucleon mass distributions of different configurations are further used for simulations of the initial conditions in heavy ion collisions. The computed eccentricities $\varepsilon_2$ and $\varepsilon_3$ are found to demonstrate a considerable sensitivity to the input nucleon profiles, especially to the mass radius in the peripheral region as well as for systems with fewer participants.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Catalyzed Baryon Destruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: WIMP-type dark matter may have additional interactions that break baryon number, leading to induced nucleon decays which are subject to direct experimental constraints from proton decay experiments. In this work, we analyze the possibility of continuous baryon destruction, deriving strong limits from the dark matter accumulating inside old neutron stars, as such a process leads to excess heat generation. We construct the simplest particle dark matter model that breaks baryon and lepton numbers separately but conserves $B-L$. Virtual exchange by DM particles in this model results in di-nucleon decay via $nn\to n\bar\nu$ and $np\to ne^+$ processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axion-mediated forces are enhanced by the presence of CP-violating axion couplings, which are however tightly constrained by electric dipole moment (EDM) searches. We discuss the underlying hypotheses behind different sources of CP violation at high energies and the interplay between axion-mediated force experiments and EDM observables. Specifically, we identify various mechanisms, based on new sources of CP violation or Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking, that can significantly relax EDM constraints, leading to a substantial redefinition of the QCD axion window for axion-mediated forces. By considerably enlarging the QCD axion parameter space, our results provide a well-motivated target for experiments probing scalar axion couplings to matter fields. These include fifth-force tests of gravity, as well as searches for spin-dependent forces via precision magnetometry, proton storage rings and ultracold molecules.</description>

Abstract: This work demonstrates that once a large number of pion is condensed in a high-energy hadron collision, the gamma-ray spectrum from $\pi^0$ decay takes on a typical broken power-law shape, which has been documented in many astronomical observations, but we have not yet recognized it. We show that this pion condensation is caused by a large number of soft gluons condensed in protons.</description>

      <title>Establishing CP violation in $b$-baryon decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is a long-standing puzzle why the CP violation (CPV) in the baryon system has not yet been definitively established as in the meson one. We demonstrate that individual partial-wave CPV in the $\Lambda_b\to p\pi^-$, $pK^-$ decays can exceed $10\%$, but the destruction between partial waves results in small net direct CPV as measured currently. Our finding highlights the different dynamics responsible for CPVs in baryon and meson decays. We propose to probe the CPV observables associated with the angular distributions of the $\Lambda_b\to pa_1(1260)$, $pK_1(1270)$ decay products, which are large enough for being identified experimentally.</description>

Abstract: STRINGS is a Monte Carlo (MC) event generator for simulating the production and decay of first and second string resonances in proton-proton collisions. STRINGS can also interface with other programs such as Pythia using the Les Houches Accord to produce more accurate data. In this paper, we validate STRINGS for the simulation of 2-parton $\rightarrow$ $\gamma$-parton scattering events by comparing to previous literature. After validation, we produce MC samples of resonances using $M_s$ = {5.0,5.5,6.0,6.5,7.0} TeV at $\sqrt{s}$ = {13,13.6} TeV with STRINGS and Pythia and analyze the kinematic data. To accurately reproduce previous results close to resonance, it is necessary to introduce a scaling factor of $\approx$ 0.53. With this correction, the resonance structure is as expected.</description>

Abstract: U(4) local transformations on the four Weyl spinors forming the isospin doublet of Dirac fermions are assumed as symmetries of the standard model. With the Lorentz transformations considered simultaneously, the symmetry group is enlarged in order to form a closed Lie algebra. In this framework, the chirality mixing gauge components with certain constraints collectively are identified as the Higgs field in the standard model. The scalar-appearance of the gauge-natured Higgs field and its varying coupling constants with the fermions, i.e. the mass-ratio parameters, are also given natural explanation. Additionally, a background of a constant right-handed gauge component is postulated to obtain the symmetry-breaking Higgs potential, which leads to a possible explanation of the parity violation in weak interactions. Further, the new framework provides an alternative perspective to understand the hyper symmetry U(1)Y , as a combination of a simultaneous phase rotation on both the left and right handed fermions and a rotation in the third direction of SU(2)R on the right-handed fermions. At last, a topological term involving the Higgs field is found to exist.</description>

      <title>No massive black holes in the Milky Way halo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02386v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational wave detectors have unveiled a population of massive black holes that do not resemble those observed in the Milky Way and whose origin is debated. According to one possible explanation, these black holes may have formed from density fluctuations in the early Universe (primordial black holes), and they should comprise from several to 100% of dark matter to explain the observed black hole merger rates. If such black holes existed in the Milky Way dark matter halo, they would cause long-timescale gravitational microlensing events lasting years. The previous experiments were not sufficiently sensitive to such events. Here we present the results of the search for long-timescale microlensing events among the light curves of nearly 80 million stars located in the Large Magellanic Cloud that were monitored for 20 years by the OGLE survey. We did not find any events with timescales longer than one year, whereas all shorter events detected may be explained by known stellar populations. We find that compact objects in the mass range from $1.8 \times 10^{-4}$ to $6.3\,M_{\odot}$ cannot compose more than 1% of dark matter, and those in the mass range from $1.3 \times 10^{-5}$ to $860\,M_{\odot}$ cannot make up more than 10% of dark matter. Thus, primordial black holes in this mass range cannot simultaneously explain a significant fraction of dark matter and gravitational wave events.</description>

      <title>Regularizing infrared divergences in de Sitter spacetime: Loops, dimensional regularization, and cutoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07610v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Correlation functions of light scalar fields in de Sitter spacetime, computed via standard perturbation theory, often exhibit secular growth characterized by time-dependent divergent terms in the form of powers of $\ln a(t)$, where $a(t)$ is the scale factor describing cosmic expansion. It is widely believed that loop corrections further enhance this secular growth. We argue that this is not necessarily the case: Loop corrections can be systematically handled using standard perturbative techniques, such as dimensional regularization, without introducing new $\ln a(t)$ terms. We focus on a canonical massless scalar field $\varphi$ with self-interactions described by a potential $\mathcal{V}(\varphi)$, and analyze correlation functions represented by diagrams with a single vertex and an arbitrary number of loops. In this framework, infrared divergences can be systematically eliminated with counterterms at each order in perturbation theory, leading to loop-corrected correlation functions that are indistinguishable from their tree-level forms, with no secular growth from loops. Furthermore, adopting a Wilsonian perspective, we explore the role of cutoffs in computing loop corrections within effective field theory and identify the effective potential $\mathcal{V}_{\rm eff}(\varphi)$, which guarantees cutoff-independent observables. We conclude that when infrared comoving cutoffs are used to regularize loop integrals, time-dependent Wilsonian coefficients are necessary to maintain cutoff-free correlation functions. Neglecting this time dependence results in secular growth from loops.</description>
