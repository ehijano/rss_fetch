      <title>Stronger together? The homophily trap in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While homophily -- the tendency to link with similar others -- may nurture a sense of belonging and shared values, it can also hinder diversity and widen inequalities. Here, we unravel this trade-off analytically, revealing homophily traps for minority groups: scenarios where increased homophilic interaction among minorities negatively affects their structural opportunities within a network. We demonstrate that homophily traps arise when minority size falls below 25% of a network, at which point homophily comes at the expense of lower structural visibility for the minority group. Our work reveals that social groups require a critical size to benefit from homophily without incurring structural costs, providing insights into core processes underlying the emergence of group inequality in networks.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph-Based Dynamic Graph Node Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Node classification on static graphs has achieved significant success, but achieving accurate node classification on dynamic graphs where node topology, attributes, and labels change over time has not been well addressed. Existing methods based on RNNs and self-attention only aggregate features of the same node across different time slices, which cannot adequately address and capture the diverse dynamic changes in dynamic graphs. Therefore, we propose a novel model named Hypergraph-Based Multi-granularity Dynamic Graph Node Classification (HYDG). After obtaining basic node representations for each slice through a GNN backbone, HYDG models the representations of each node in the dynamic graph through two modules. The individual-level hypergraph captures the spatio-temporal node representations between individual nodes, while the group-level hypergraph captures the multi-granularity group temporal representations among nodes of the same class. Each hyperedge captures different temporal dependencies of varying lengths by connecting multiple nodes within specific time ranges. More accurate representations are obtained through weighted information propagation and aggregation by the hypergraph neural network. Extensive experiments on five real dynamic graph datasets using two GNN backbones demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework.</description>

      <title>"The Prophet said so!": On Exploring Hadith Presence on Arabic Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hadith, the recorded words and actions of the prophet Muhammad, is a key source of the instructions and foundations of Islam, alongside the Quran. Interpreting individual hadiths and verifying their authenticity can be difficult, even controversial, and the subject has attracted the attention of many scholars who have established an entire science of Hadith criticism. Recent quantitative studies of hadiths focus on developing systems for automatic classification, authentication, and information retrieval that operate over existing hadith compilations. Qualitative studies on the other hand try to discuss different social and political issues from the perspective of hadiths, or they inspect how hadiths are used in specific contexts in official communications and press releases for argumentation and propaganda. However, there are no studies that attempt to understand the actual presence of hadiths among Muslims in their daily lives and interactions. In this study, we try to fill this gap by exploring the presence of hadiths on Twitter from January 2019 to January 2023. We highlight the challenges that quantitative methods should consider while processing texts that include hadiths and we provide a methodology for Islamic scholars to validate their hypotheses about hadiths on big data that better represent the position of the society and Hadith influence on it.</description>

      <title>Two Birds with One Stone: Improving Rumor Detection by Addressing the Unfairness Issue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The degraded performance and group unfairness caused by confounding sensitive attributes in rumor detection remains relatively unexplored. To address this, we propose a two-step framework. Initially, it identifies confounding sensitive attributes that limit rumor detection performance and cause unfairness across groups. Subsequently, we aim to learn equally informative representations through invariant learning. Our method considers diverse sets of groups without sensitive attribute annotations. Experiments show our method easily integrates with existing rumor detectors, significantly improving both their detection performance and fairness.</description>

      <title>Influence Maximization in Temporal Networks with Persistent and Reactive Behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Influence maximization in temporal social networks presents unique challenges due to the dynamic interactions that evolve over time. Traditional diffusion models often fall short in capturing the real-world complexities of active-inactive transitions among nodes, obscuring the true behavior of influence spread. In dynamic networks, nodes do not simply transition to an active state once; rather, they can oscillate between active and inactive states, with the potential for reactivation and reinforcement over time. This reactivation allows previously influenced nodes to regain influence potency, enhancing their ability to spread influence to others and amplifying the overall diffusion process. Ignoring these transitions can thus conceal the cumulative impact of influence, making it essential to account for them in any effective diffusion model. To address these challenges, we introduce the Continuous Persistent Susceptible-Infected Model with Reinforcement and Re-activation (cpSI-R), which explicitly incorporates active-inactive transitions, capturing the progressive reinforcement that makes nodes more potent spreaders upon reactivation. This model naturally leads to a submodular and monotone objective function, which supports efficient optimization for seed selection in influence maximization tasks. Alongside cpSI-R, we propose an efficient temporal snapshot sampling method, simplifying the analysis of evolving networks. We then adapt the prior algorithms of seed selection to our model and sampling strategy, resulting in reduced computational costs and enhanced seed selection efficiency. Experimental evaluations on diverse datasets demonstrate substantial improvements in performance over baseline methods, underscoring the effectiveness of cpSI-R for real-world temporal networks</description>

      <title>Assessing Text Classification Methods for Cyberbullying Detection on Social Media Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyberbullying significantly contributes to mental health issues in communities by negatively impacting the psychology of victims. It is a prevalent problem on social media platforms, necessitating effective, real-time detection and monitoring systems to identify harmful messages. However, current cyberbullying detection systems face challenges related to performance, dataset quality, time efficiency, and computational costs. This research aims to conduct a comparative study by adapting and evaluating existing text classification techniques within the cyberbullying detection domain. The study specifically evaluates the effectiveness and performance of these techniques in identifying cyberbullying instances on social media platforms. It focuses on leveraging and assessing large language models, including BERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, DistilBERT, and GPT-2.0, for their suitability in this domain. The results show that BERT strikes a balance between performance, time efficiency, and computational resources: Accuracy of 95%, Precision of 95%, Recall of 95%, F1 Score of 95%, Error Rate of 5%, Inference Time of 0.053 seconds, RAM Usage of 35.28 MB, CPU/GPU Usage of 0.4%, and Energy Consumption of 0.000263 kWh. The findings demonstrate that generative AI models, while powerful, do not consistently outperform fine-tuned models on the tested benchmarks. However, state-of-the-art performance can still be achieved through strategic adaptation and fine-tuning of existing models for specific datasets and tasks.</description>

      <title>Towards Ideal Temporal Graph Neural Networks: Evaluations and Conclusions after 10,000 GPU Hours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for modeling dynamic interactions across various domains. The design space of TGNNs is notably complex, given the unique challenges in runtime efficiency and scalability raised by the evolving nature of temporal graphs. We contend that many of the existing works on TGNN modeling inadequately explore the design space, leading to suboptimal designs. Viewing TGNN models through a performance-focused lens often obstructs a deeper understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of each technique. Specifically, benchmarking efforts inherently evaluate models in their original designs and implementations, resulting in unclear accuracy comparisons and misleading runtime. To address these shortcomings, we propose a practical comparative evaluation framework that performs a design space search across well-known TGNN modules based on a unified, optimized code implementation. Using our framework, we make the first efforts towards addressing three critical questions in TGNN design, spending over 10,000 GPU hours: (1) investigating the efficiency of TGNN module designs, (2) analyzing how the effectiveness of these modules correlates with dataset patterns, and (3) exploring the interplay between multiple modules. Key outcomes of this directed investigative approach include demonstrating that the most recent neighbor sampling and attention aggregator outperform uniform neighbor sampling and MLP-Mixer aggregator; Assessing static node memory as an effective node memory alternative, and showing that the choice between static or dynamic node memory should be based on the repetition patterns in the dataset. Our in-depth analysis of the interplay between TGNN modules and dataset patterns should provide a deeper insight into TGNN performance along with potential research directions for designing more general and effective TGNNs.</description>

      <title>Iterative structural coarse-graining for contagion dynamics in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contagion dynamics in complex networks drive critical phenomena such as epidemic spread and information diffusion,but their analysis remains computationally prohibitive in large-scale, high-complexity systems. Here, we introduce the Iterative Structural Coarse-Graining (ISCG) framework, a scalable methodology that reduces network complexity while preserving key contagion dynamics with high fidelity. Importantly, we derive theoretical conditions ensuring the precise preservation of both macroscopic outbreak sizes and microscopic node-level infection probabilities during network reduction. Under these conditions, extensive experiments on diverse empirical networks demonstrate that ISCG achieves significant complexity reduction without sacrificing prediction accuracy. Beyond simplification, ISCG reveals multiscale structural patterns that govern contagion processes, enabling practical solutions to longstanding challenges in contagion dynamics. Specifically, ISCG outperforms traditional adaptive centrality-based approaches in identifying influential spreaders, immunizing critical edges, and optimizing sentinel placement for early outbreak detection, offering superior accuracy and computational efficiency. By bridging computational efficiency with dynamical fidelity, ISCG provides a transformative framework for analyzing large-scale contagion processes, with broad applications for epidemiology, information dissemination, and network resilience.</description>

      <title>Matrix Concentration for Random Signed Graphs and Community Recovery in the Signed Stochastic Block Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider graphs where edges and their signs are added independently at random from among all pairs of nodes. We establish strong concentration inequalities for adjacency and Laplacian matrices obtained from this family of random graph models. Then, we apply our results to study graphs sampled from the signed stochastic block model. Namely, we take a two-community setting where edges within the communities have positive signs and edges between the communities have negative signs and apply a random sign perturbation with probability $0&lt; s &lt;1/2$. In this setting, our findings include: first, the spectral gap of the corresponding signed Laplacian matrix concentrates near $2s$ with high probability; and second, the sign of the first eigenvector of the Laplacian matrix defines a weakly consistent estimator for the balanced community detection problem, or equivalently, the $\pm 1$ synchronization problem. We supplement our theoretical contributions with experimental data obtained from the models under consideration.</description>

      <title>Efficient Parallel Genetic Algorithm for Perturbed Substructure Optimization in Complex Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evolutionary computing, particularly genetic algorithm (GA), is a combinatorial optimization method inspired by natural selection and the transmission of genetic information, which is widely used to identify optimal solutions to complex problems through simulated programming and iteration. Due to its strong adaptability, flexibility, and robustness, GA has shown significant performance and potentiality on perturbed substructure optimization (PSSO), an important graph mining problem that achieves its goals by modifying network structures. However, the efficiency and practicality of GA-based PSSO face enormous challenges due to the complexity and diversity of application scenarios. While some research has explored acceleration frameworks in evolutionary computing, their performance on PSSO remains limited due to a lack of scenario generalizability. Based on these, this paper is the first to present the GA-based PSSO Acceleration framework (GAPA), which simplifies the GA development process and supports distributed acceleration. Specifically, it reconstructs the genetic operation and designs a development framework for efficient parallel acceleration. Meanwhile, GAPA includes an extensible library that optimizes and accelerates 10 PSSO algorithms, covering 4 crucial tasks for graph mining. Comprehensive experiments on 18 datasets across 4 tasks and 10 algorithms effectively demonstrate the superiority of GAPA, achieving an average of 4x the acceleration of Evox.

      <title>Why the Metric Backbone Preserves Community Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The metric backbone of a weighted graph is the union of all-pairs shortest paths. It is obtained by removing all edges $(u,v)$ that are not the shortest path between $u$ and $v$. In networks with well-separated communities, the metric backbone tends to preserve many inter-community edges, because these edges serve as bridges connecting two communities, but tends to delete many intra-community edges because the communities are dense. This suggests that the metric backbone would dilute or destroy the community structure of the network. However, this is not borne out by prior empirical work, which instead showed that the metric backbone of real networks preserves the community structure of the original network well. In this work, we analyze the metric backbone of a broad class of weighted random graphs with communities, and we formally prove the robustness of the community structure with respect to the deletion of all the edges that are not in the metric backbone. An empirical comparison of several graph sparsification techniques confirms our theoretical finding and shows that the metric backbone is an efficient sparsifier in the presence of communities.</description>

      <title>Academic collaboration on large language model studies increases overall but varies across disciplines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interdisciplinary collaboration is crucial for addressing complex scientific challenges. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in benefiting researchers across various fields. To explore their potential for interdisciplinary collaboration, we collect and analyze data from OpenAlex, an open-source academic database. Our dataset comprises 59,293 LLM-related papers, along with 70,945 machine learning (ML) papers and 73,110 papers from non-LLM/ML fields as control groups. We first employ Shannon Entropy to assess the diversity of collaboration. Our results reveal that many fields have exhibited a more significant increasing trend following the release of ChatGPT as compared to the control groups. In particular, Computer Science and Social Science display a consistent increase in both institution and department entropy. Other fields such as Decision Science, Psychology, and Health Professions have shown minor to significant increases. Our difference-in-difference analysis also indicates that the release of ChatGPT leads to a statistically significant increase in collaboration in several fields, such as Computer Science and Social Science. In addition, we analyze the author networks and find that Computer Science, Medicine, and other Computer Science-related departments are the most prominent. Regarding authors' institutions, our analysis reveals that entities such as Stanford University, Harvard University, and University College London are key players, either dominating centrality or playing crucial roles in connecting research networks. Overall, this study provides valuable information on the current landscape and evolving dynamics of collaboration networks in LLM research. It also suggests potential areas for fostering more diverse collaborations and highlights the need for continued research on the impact of LLMs on scientific practices.</description>

      <title>GISExplainer: On Explainability of Graph Neural Networks via Game-theoretic Interaction Subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Explainability is crucial for the application of black-box Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in critical fields such as healthcare, finance, cybersecurity, and more. Various feature attribution methods, especially the perturbation-based methods, have been proposed to indicate how much each node/edge contributes to the model predictions. However, these methods fail to generate connected explanatory subgraphs that consider the causal interaction between edges within different coalition scales, which will result in unfaithful explanations. In our study, we propose GISExplainer, a novel game-theoretic interaction based explanation method that uncovers what the underlying GNNs have learned for node classification by discovering human-interpretable causal explanatory subgraphs. First, GISExplainer defines a causal attribution mechanism that considers the game-theoretic interaction of multi-granularity coalitions in candidate explanatory subgraph to quantify the causal effect of an edge on the prediction. Second, GISExplainer assumes that the coalitions with negative effects on the predictions are also significant for model interpretation, and the contribution of the computation graph stems from the combined influence of both positive and negative interactions within the coalitions. Then, GISExplainer regards the explanation task as a sequential decision process, in which a salient edges is successively selected and connected to the previously selected subgraph based on its causal effect to form an explanatory subgraph, ultimately striving for better explanations. Additionally, an efficiency optimization scheme is proposed for the causal attribution mechanism through coalition sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GISExplainer achieves better performance than state-of-the-art approaches w.r.t. two quantitative metrics: Fidelity and Sparsity.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Mixture Models Based Augmentation Enhances GNN Generalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great promise in tasks like node and graph classification, but they often struggle to generalize, particularly to unseen or out-of-distribution (OOD) data. These challenges are exacerbated when training data is limited in size or diversity. To address these issues, we introduce a theoretical framework using Rademacher complexity to compute a regret bound on the generalization error and then characterize the effect of data augmentation. This framework informs the design of GMM-GDA, an efficient graph data augmentation (GDA) algorithm leveraging the capability of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to approximate any distribution. Our approach not only outperforms existing augmentation techniques in terms of generalization but also offers improved time complexity, making it highly suitable for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Multi-Grained Preference Enhanced Transformer for Multi-Behavior Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12179</link>

Abstract: Sequential recommendation (SR) aims to predict the next purchasing item according to users' dynamic preference learned from their historical user-item interactions. To improve the performance of recommendation, learning dynamic heterogeneous cross-type behavior dependencies is indispensable for recommender system. However, there still exists some challenges in Multi-Behavior Sequential Recommendation (MBSR). On the one hand, existing methods only model heterogeneous multi-behavior dependencies at behavior-level or item-level, and modelling interaction-level dependencies is still a challenge. On the other hand, the dynamic multi-grained behavior-aware preference is hard to capture in interaction sequences, which reflects interaction-aware sequential pattern. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Multi-Grained Preference enhanced Transformer framework (M-GPT). First, M-GPT constructs a interaction-level graph of historical cross-typed interactions in a sequence. Then graph convolution is performed to derive interaction-level multi-behavior dependency representation repeatedly, in which the complex correlation between historical cross-typed interactions at specific orders can be well learned. Secondly, a novel multi-scale transformer architecture equipped with multi-grained user preference extraction is proposed to encode the interaction-aware sequential pattern enhanced by capturing temporal behavior-aware multi-grained preference . Experiments on the real-world datasets indicate that our method M-GPT consistently outperforms various state-of-the-art recommendation methods.</description>

      <title>A Graph Neural Network deep-dive into successful counterattacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A counterattack in soccer is a high speed, high intensity direct attack that can occur when a team transitions from a defensive state to an attacking state after regaining possession of the ball. The aim is to create a goal-scoring opportunity by convering a lot of ground with minimal passes before the opposing team can recover their defensive shape. The purpose of this research is to build gender-specific Graph Neural Networks to model the likelihood of a counterattack being successful and uncover what factors make them successful in professional soccer. These models are trained on a total of 20863 frames of synchronized on-ball event and spatiotemporal (broadcast) tracking data. This dataset is derived from 632 games of MLS (2022), NWSL (2022) and international soccer (2020-2022). With this data we demonstrate that gender-specific Graph Neural Networks outperform architecturally identical gender-ambiguous models in predicting the successful outcome of counterattacks. We show, using Permutation Feature Importance, that byline to byline speed, angle to the goal, angle to the ball and sideline to sideline speed are the node features with the highest impact on model performance. Additionally, we offer some illustrative examples on how to navigate the infinite solution search space to aid in identifying improvements for player decision making.
  This research is accompanied by an open-source repository containing all data and code, and it is also accompanied by an open-source Python package which simplifies converting spatiotemporal data into graphs. This package also facilitates testing, validation, training and prediction with this data. This should allow the reader to replicate and improve upon our research more easily.</description>

      <title>Cluster-guided Contrastive Class-imbalanced Graph Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of class-imbalanced graph classification, which aims at effectively classifying the graph categories in scenarios with imbalanced class distributions. While graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success, their modeling ability on imbalanced graph-structured data remains suboptimal, which typically leads to predictions biased towards the majority classes. On the other hand, existing class-imbalanced learning methods in vision may overlook the rich graph semantic substructures of the majority classes and excessively emphasize learning from the minority classes. To address these challenges, we propose a simple yet powerful approach called C$^3$GNN that integrates the idea of clustering into contrastive learning to enhance class-imbalanced graph classification. Technically, C$^3$GNN clusters graphs from each majority class into multiple subclasses, with sizes comparable to the minority class, mitigating class imbalance. It also employs the Mixup technique to generate synthetic samples, enriching the semantic diversity of each subclass. Furthermore, supervised contrastive learning is used to hierarchically learn effective graph representations, enabling the model to thoroughly explore semantic substructures in majority classes while avoiding excessive focus on minority classes. Extensive experiments on real-world graph benchmark datasets verify the superior performance of our proposed method against competitive baselines.</description>

      <title>Supervised centrality via sparse network influence regression: an application to the 2021 Henan floods' social network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The social characteristics of players in a social network are closely associated with their network positions and relational importance. Identifying those influential players in a network is of great importance as it helps to understand how ties are formed, how information is propagated, and, in turn, can guide the dissemination of new information. Motivated by a Sina Weibo social network analysis of the 2021 Henan Floods, where response variables for each Sina Weibo user are available, we propose a new notion of supervised centrality that emphasizes the task-specific nature of a player's centrality. To estimate the supervised centrality and identify important players, we develop a novel sparse network influence regression by introducing individual heterogeneity for each user. To overcome the computational difficulties in fitting the model for large social networks, we further develop a forward-addition algorithm and show that it can consistently identify a superset of the influential Sina Weibo users. We apply our method to analyze three responses in the Henan Floods data: the number of comments, reposts, and likes, and obtain meaningful results. A further simulation study corroborates the developed method.</description>
