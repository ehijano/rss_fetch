      <title>Positive Characteristic Sets for Relational Pattern Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of learning formal languages, data about an unknown target language L is given in terms of a set of (word,label) pairs, where a binary label indicates whether or not the given word belongs to L. A (polynomial-size) characteristic set for L, with respect to a reference class L of languages, is a set of such pairs that satisfies certain conditions allowing a learning algorithm to (efficiently) identify L within L. In this paper, we introduce the notion of positive characteristic set, referring to characteristic sets of only positive examples. These are of importance in the context of learning from positive examples only. We study this notion for classes of relational pattern languages, which are of relevance to various applications in string processing.</description>

      <title>Atomic Gliders and CA as Language Generators (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellular automata (CA) are well-studied models of decentralized parallel computation, known for their ability to exhibit complex global behavior from simple local rules. While their dynamics have been widely explored through simulations, a formal treatment of CA as genuine language generators remains underdeveloped. We formalize CA-expressible languages as sets of finite words obtained by projecting the non-quiescent segments of configurations reachable by one-dimensional, deterministic, synchronous CA over bi-infinite grids. These languages are defined with respect to sets of initial configurations specified by a regular language as in regular model checking. To capture structured dynamics, we propose a glider-based generative semantics for CA. Inspired by the classical notion of gliders, we define a glider as a one-cell entity carrying a symbol in a certain velocity under well defined interaction semantics. We show that despite the regularity of the initial configurations and the locality of the transition rules, the resulting languages can exhibit non-regular and even non-context-free structure. This positions regular-initialized CA languages as a surprisingly rich computational model, with potential applications in the formal analysis of linearly ordered MAS.</description>

      <title>Formal Foundations for Controlled Stochastic Activity Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Controlled Stochastic Activity Networks (Controlled SANs), a formal extension of classical Stochastic Activity Networks that integrates explicit control actions into a unified semantic framework for modeling distributed real-time systems. Controlled SANs systematically capture dynamic behavior involving nondeterminism, probabilistic branching, and stochastic timing, while enabling policy-driven decision-making within a rigorous mathematical framework.
  We develop a hierarchical, automata-theoretic semantics for Controlled SANs that encompasses nondeterministic, probabilistic, and stochastic models in a uniform manner. A structured taxonomy of control policies, ranging from memoryless and finite-memory strategies to computationally augmented policies, is formalized, and their expressive power is characterized through associated language classes. To support model abstraction and compositional reasoning, we introduce behavioral equivalences, including bisimulation and stochastic isomorphism.
  Controlled SANs generalize classical frameworks such as continuous-time Markov decision processes (CTMDPs), providing a rigorous foundation for the specification, verification, and synthesis of dependable systems operating under uncertainty. This framework enables both quantitative and qualitative analysis, advancing the design of safety-critical systems where control, timing, and stochasticity are tightly coupled.</description>

      <title>Towards Autoformalization of LLM-generated Outputs for Requirement Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autoformalization, the process of translating informal statements into formal logic, has gained renewed interest with the emergence of powerful Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs show promise in generating structured outputs from natural language (NL), such as Gherkin Scenarios from NL feature requirements, there's currently no formal method to verify if these outputs are accurate. This paper takes a preliminary step toward addressing this gap by exploring the use of a simple LLM-based autoformalizer to verify LLM-generated outputs against a small set of natural language requirements. We conducted two distinct experiments. In the first one, the autoformalizer successfully identified that two differently-worded NL requirements were logically equivalent, demonstrating the pipeline's potential for consistency checks. In the second, the autoformalizer was used to identify a logical inconsistency between a given NL requirement and an LLM-generated output, highlighting its utility as a formal verification tool. Our findings, while limited, suggest that autoformalization holds significant potential for ensuring the fidelity and logical consistency of LLM-generated outputs, laying a crucial foundation for future, more extensive studies into this novel application.</description>

      <title>Active Learning of Symbolic Automata Over Rational Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automata learning has many applications in artificial intelligence and software engineering. Central to these applications is the $L^*$ algorithm, introduced by Angluin. The $L^*$ algorithm learns deterministic finite-state automata (DFAs) in polynomial time when provided with a minimally adequate teacher. Unfortunately, the $L^*$ algorithm can only learn DFAs over finite alphabets, which limits its applicability. In this paper, we extend $L^*$ to learn symbolic automata whose transitions use predicates over rational numbers, i.e., over infinite and dense alphabets. Our result makes the $L^*$ algorithm applicable to new settings like (real) RGX, and time series. Furthermore, our proposed algorithm is optimal in the sense that it asks a number of queries to the teacher that is at most linear with respect to the number of transitions, and to the representation size of the predicates.</description>

      <title>Ontology-Driven Model-to-Model Transformation of Workflow Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proprietary workflow modeling languages such as Smart Forms &amp; Smart Flow hamper interoperability and reuse because they lock process knowledge into closed formats. To address this vendor lock-in and ease migration to open standards, we introduce an ontology-driven model-to-model pipeline that systematically translates domain-specific workflow definitions to Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) 2.0. The pipeline comprises three phases: RML-based semantic lifting of JSON to RDF/OWL, ontology alignment and reasoning, and BPMN generation via the Camunda Model API. By externalizing mapping knowledge into ontologies and declarative rules rather than code, the approach supports reusability across vendor-specific formats and preserves semantic traceability between source definitions and target BPMN models. We instantiated the pipeline for Instituto Superior T\'ecnico (IST)'s Smart Forms &amp; Smart Flow and implemented a converter that produces standard-compliant BPMN diagrams. Evaluation on a corpus of 69 real-world workflows produced 92 BPMN diagrams with a 94.2% success rate. Failures (5.81%) stemmed from dynamic behaviors and time-based transitions not explicit in the static JSON. Interviews with support and development teams indicated that the resulting diagrams provide a top-down view that improves comprehension, diagnosis and onboarding by exposing implicit control flow and linking tasks and forms back to their sources. The pipeline is generalizable to other proprietary workflow languages by adapting the ontology and mappings, enabling interoperability and reducing vendor dependency while supporting continuous integration and long-term maintainability. The presented case study demonstrates that ontology-driven M2M transformation can systematically bridge domain-specific workflows and standard notations, offering quantifiable performance and qualitative benefits for stakeholders.</description>

      <title>WEX: Formal Specifications for Windows in Stream Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.04244v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key operation in processing an unbounded data stream is windowing, which extracts finite portions of streams for further handling. The existing frameworks and query languages either require windows to be defined using ad hoc imperative languages or are limited to rudimentary constructs such as time- or count-based windows. We propose Window EXpression, a formal specification for precisely expressing windowing constructs based on monadic second-order logic. WEX can naturally express traditional windowing constructs such as sliding windows and tumbling windows, as well as more complex windows whose start and end indices are triggered based on the satisfaction of given logical conditions. After introducing a model of symbolic automata with lookbacks over an alphabet theory, we present another equivalent representation of WEX based on symbolic regular expressions. The precise semantics of windowing enable static analysis over WEX. In particular, we show that, in general, it is undecidable to check whether a WEX allows an unbounded number of overlapping windows. However, when the data stream is over a finite alphabet, or the alphabet theory has the so-called completion property, the problem becomes decidable.</description>

      <title>Runs, Squares, Palindromes, and Unbordered Factors of a Family of Binary Pattern Sequences with the All-One Pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20547v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents results on maximal runs, order of squares, palindromes, and unbordered factors of members of the family of binary pattern sequences with the all-one pattern. Restricting ourselves to binary pattern sequences with the all-one pattern with at least three ones, five categories of maximal run lengths and 3 categories of orders of squares are presented, palindromes with locally maximal length as well as palindromes with the second to fifth-largest palindrome lengths are described, and unbordered factors of lengths powers of two are presented. Interestingly, the characteristic functions of specified prefixes of sequences of the 2-kernel of these sequences can be formulated using the Vile and Jacobsthal sequences. Both Mathematica and Walnut are employed for exploratory pattern analysis. Proofs are based on a correspondence between binary strings under concatenation and integers under addition and multiplication. It is observed that this correspondence seems most efficacious for proofs of theorems whose statements are classified at low levels in the arithmetic hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Smallest Suffixient Sets as a Repetitiveness Measure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05638v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A suffixient set is a novel combinatorial object that captures the essential information of repetitive strings in a way that, provided with a random access mechanism, supports various forms of pattern matching. In this paper, we study the size $\chi$ of the smallest suffixient set as a repetitiveness measure: we place it between known measures and study its sensitivity to various string operations. As a corollary of our results, we give simple online algorithms to compute smallest suffixient sets.</description>

      <title>Good-for-MDP State Reduction for Stochastic LTL Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study stochastic planning problems in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with goals specified in Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). The state-of-the-art approach transforms LTL formulas into good-for-MDP (GFM) automata, which feature a restricted form of nondeterminism. These automata are then composed with the MDP, allowing the agent to resolve the nondeterminism during policy synthesis. A major factor affecting the scalability of this approach is the size of the generated automata. In this paper, we propose a novel GFM state-space reduction technique that significantly reduces the number of automata states. Our method employs a sophisticated chain of transformations, leveraging recent advances in good-for-games minimisation developed for adversarial settings. In addition to our theoretical contributions, we present empirical results demonstrating the practical effectiveness of our state-reduction technique. Furthermore, we introduce a direct construction method for formulas of the form $\mathsf{G}\mathsf{F}\varphi$, where $\varphi$ is a co-safety formula. This construction is provably single-exponential in the worst case, in contrast to the general doubly-exponential complexity. Our experiments confirm the scalability advantages of this specialised construction.</description>

      <title>Context-free graphs and their transition groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13070v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting from context-free inverse graphs, we introduce a new class of groups and study their structural properties. We establish closure properties, show that their co-word problems are context-free, analyze torsion elements, and realize them as subgroups of the asynchronous rational group. Context-freeness is preserved under a generalized free product of graphs, and using this construction we provide examples of groups that are not residually finite or not poly-context-free, making them relevant for testing the Lehnert and Brough conjectures. Moreover, we investigate how small local modifications of a graph affect the global structure of the transition group, showing that for locally quasi-transitive graphs with infinite orbits, the transition group decomposes into a highly structured quotient by a bounded torsion subgroup, showing strong global constraints induced by local graph properties.</description>
