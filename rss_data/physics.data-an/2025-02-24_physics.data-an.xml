      <title>Bispectral decomposition and energy transfer in a turbulent jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ bispectral mode decomposition (BMD) to investigate coherent triadic interactions and nonlinear energy transfer in a subsonic turbulent jet. BMD extracts the flow structures corresponding to the dominant triadic interactions. We find a strong triadic correlation among the Kelvin-Helmholtz wavepacket, its conjugate, and the streaks. The most energetic streaks occur at the azimuthal wavenumber $m=2$, with the dominant contributing azimuthal wavenumber triad being $[m_1,m_2,m_3]=[1,1,2]$. The spectral energy budget reveals that nonlinear triadic interactions represent an energy loss to the streaks. Analysis across a wide range of frequencies and azimuthal wavenumbers identifies the direction of nonlinear energy transfer and the spatial regions where these transfers are most active. The turbulent jet exhibits a forward energy cascade in a global sense, though the direction of energy transfer varies locally. In the shear layer near the nozzle exit, triadic interactions between relatively smaller scales are dominant, leading to an inverse energy cascade. Farther downstream, beyond the end of the potential core, triadic interactions between larger scales dominate, resulting in a forward energy cascade.</description>

      <title>PhyLiNO -- A Forward-Folding Likelihood-Fit Framework for Neutrino Oscillation Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for the analysis of data from neutrino oscillation experiments. The framework performs a profile likelihood fit and employs a forward folding technique to optimize its model with respect to the oscillation parameters. It is capable of simultaneously handling multiple datasets from the same or different experiments and their correlations. The code of the framework is optimized for performance and allows for convergence times of a few seconds handling hundreds of fit parameters, thanks to multi-threading and usage of GPUs. The framework was developed in the context of the Double Chooz experiment, where it was successfully used to fit three- and four-flavor models to the data, as well as in the measurement of the energy spectrum of reactor neutrinos. We demonstrate its applicability to other experiments by applying it to a study of the oscillation analysis of a medium baseline reactor experiment similar to JUNO.</description>
