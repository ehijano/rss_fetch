      <title>Asset-liability management with Epstein-Zin utility$\quad$ under stochastic interest rate and unknown market price of risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers a stochastic control problem with Epstein-Zin recursive utility under partial information (unknown market price of risk), in which an investor is constrained to a liability at the end of the investment period. Introducing liabilities is the main novelty of the model and appears for the first time in the literature of recursive utilities. Such constraint leads to a fully coupled forward-backward stochastic differential equation (FBSDE), which well-posedness has not been addressed in the literature. We derive an explicit solution to the FBSDE, contrasting with the existence and uniqueness results with no explicit expression of the solutions typically found in most related literature. Moreover, under minimal additional assumptions, we obtain the Malliavin differentiability of the solution of the FBSDE. We solve the problem completely and find the expression of the controls and the value function. Finally, we determine the utility loss that investors suffer from ignoring the fact that they can learn about the market price of risk.</description>

      <title>Generative modelling of financial time series with structured noise and MMD-based signature learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19848v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating synthetic financial time series data that accurately reflects real-world market dynamics holds tremendous potential for various applications, including portfolio optimization, risk management, and large scale machine learning. We present an approach that {uses structured noise} for training generative models for financial time series. The expressive power of the signature transform {has been shown to be able} to capture the complex dependencies and temporal structures inherent in financial data {when used to train generative models in the form of a signature kernel }. We employ a moving average model to model the variance of the noise input, enhancing the model's ability to reproduce stylized facts such as volatility clustering. Through empirical experiments on S\&amp;P 500 index data, we demonstrate that our model effectively captures key characteristics of financial time series and outperforms comparable {approaches}. In addition, we explore the application of the synthetic data generated to train a reinforcement learning agent for portfolio management, achieving promising results. Finally, we propose a method to add robustness to the generative model by tweaking the noise input so that the generated sequences can be adjusted to different market environments with minimal data.</description>

      <title>First order Martingale model risk and semi-static hedging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate model risk distributionally robust sensitivities for functionals on the Wasserstein space when the underlying model is constrained to the martingale class and/or is subject to constraints on the first marginal law. Our results extend the findings of Bartl, Drapeau, Obloj \&amp; Wiesel \cite{bartl2021sensitivity} and Bartl \&amp; Wiesel \cite{bartlsensitivityadapted} by introducing the minimization of the distributionally robust problem with respect to semi-static hedging strategies. We provide explicit characterizations of the model risk (first order) optimal semi-static hedging strategies. The distributional robustness is analyzed both in terms of the adapted Wasserstein metric and the more relevant standard Wasserstein metric.</description>

      <title>Differential Beliefs in Financial Markets Under Information Constraints: A Modeling Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the theory of McKean-Vlasov-type SDEs to study several problems related to market efficiency in the context of partial information and partially observable financial markets: (i) convergence of reduced-information market price processes to the true price process under an increasing information flow; (ii) a specific mechanism of shrinking biases under increasing information flows; (iii) optimal aggregation of expert opinions by a trader seeking a positive alpha. All these problems are studied by means of (conditional) McKean-Vlasov-type SDEs, Wasserstein barycenters, KL divergence and relevant tools from convex optimization, optimal control and nonlinear filtering. We supply the theoretical results in (i)-(iii) with concrete simulations demonstrating how the proposed models can be applied in practice to model financial markets under information constraints and the arbitrage-seeking behavior of traders with differential beliefs.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo algorithm for solving Black-Scholes PDEs for high-dimensional option pricing in finance and its complexity analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09241v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a quantum Monte Carlo algorithm to solve high-dimensional Black-Scholes PDEs with correlation for high-dimensional option pricing. The payoff function of the option is of general form and is only required to be continuous and piece-wise affine (CPWA), which covers most of the relevant payoff functions used in finance. We provide a rigorous error analysis and complexity analysis of our algorithm. In particular, we prove that the computational complexity of our algorithm is bounded polynomially in the space dimension $d$ of the PDE and the reciprocal of the prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon$. Moreover, we show that for payoff functions which are bounded, our algorithm indeed has a speed-up compared to classical Monte Carlo methods. Furthermore, we provide numerical simulations in one and two dimensions using our developed package within the Qiskit framework tailored to price CPWA options with respect to the Black-Scholes model, as well as discuss the potential extension of the numerical simulations to arbitrary space dimension.</description>
