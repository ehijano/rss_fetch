      <title>The co-evolution of direct, indirect and generalized reciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: People often engage in costly cooperation, especially in repeated interactions. When deciding whether to cooperate, individuals typically take into account how others have acted in the past. For instance, when one person is deciding whether to cooperate with another, they may consider how they were treated by the other party (direct reciprocity), how the other party treated others (indirect reciprocity), or how they themselves were treated by others in general (generalized reciprocity). Given these different approaches, it is unclear which strategy, or more specifically which mode of reciprocity, individuals will prefer. This study introduces a model where individuals decide how much weight to give each type of information when choosing to cooperate. Through equilibrium analysis, we find that all three modes of reciprocity can be sustained when individuals have sufficiently frequent interactions. However, the existence of such equilibria does not guarantee that individuals will learn to use them. Simulations show that when individuals mainly imitate others, generalized reciprocity often hinders cooperation, leading to defection even under conditions favorable to cooperation. In contrast, when individuals explore new strategies during learning, stable cooperation emerges through direct reciprocity. This study highlights the importance of studying all forms of reciprocity in unison.</description>

      <title>A Temporal Playbook for Multiple Wave Dengue Pandemic from Latin America and Asia to Italy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the epidemiological Renormalization Group (eRG) framework is a useful and minimal tool to effectively describe the temporal evolution of the Dengue multi-wave pandemics. We test the framework on the Dengue history of several countries located in both Latin America and Asia. We also observe a strong correlation between the total number of infected individuals and the changes in the local temperature. Our results further support the expectation that global warming is bound to increase the cases of Dengue worldwide. We then move to investigate, via the eRG, the recent outbreak in Fano, Italy and offer our projections.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary features in a minimal physical system: directionality, diversity, selection, growth, inheritance, and adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple physical model that recapitulates several features of biological evolution, despite being based only on thermally-driven attachment and detachment of elementary building blocks. Through its dynamics, this model samples a large and diverse array of non-equilibrium steady states, both within and between independent trajectories. These dynamics exhibit directionality with a quantity that increases in time, selection and preferential spatial expansion of particular states, as well as inheritance in the form of correlated compositions between successive states, and environment-dependent adaptation. The model challenges common conceptions regarding the requirements for life-like properties: it does not involve separate mechanisms for metabolism, replication and compartmentalization, stores and transmits digital information without template replication or assembly of large molecules, exhibits selection both without and with reproduction, and undergoes growth without autocatalysis. As the model is based on generic physical principles, it is amenable to various experimental implementations.</description>

      <title>Exo-Daisy World: Revisiting Gaia Theory through an Informational Architecture Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Daisy World model has long served as a foundational framework for understanding the self-regulation of planetary biospheres, providing insights into the feedback mechanisms that may govern inhabited exoplanets. In this study, we extend the classic Daisy World model through the lens of Semantic Information Theory (SIT), aiming to characterize the information flow between the biosphere and planetary environment -- what we term the \emph{information architecture} of Daisy World systems. Our objective is to develop novel methodologies for analyzing the evolution of coupled planetary systems, including biospheres and geospheres, with implications for astrobiological observations and the identification of agnostic biosignatures. To operationalize SIT in this context, we introduce a version of the Daisy World model tailored to reflect potential conditions on M-dwarf exoplanets, formulating a system of stochastic differential equations that describe the co-evolution of the daisies and their planetary environment. Analysis of this Exo-Daisy World model reveals how correlations between the biosphere and environment intensify with rising stellar luminosity, and how these correlations correspond to distinct phases of information exchange between the coupled systems. This \emph{rein control} provides a quantitative description of the informational feedback between the biosphere and its host planet. Finally, we discuss the broader implications of our approach for developing detailed ExoGaia models of inhabited exoplanetary systems, proposing new avenues for interpreting astrobiological data and exploring biosignature candidates.</description>

      <title>On the study of the limit cycles for a class of population models with time-varying factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of population models with time-varying factors, represented by one-dimensional piecewise smooth autonomous differential equations.
  We provide several derivative formulas in "discrete" form for the Poincar\'{e} map of such equations, and establish a criterion for the existence of limit cycles.
  These two tools, together with the known ones, are then combined in a preliminary procedure that can provide a simple and unified way to analyze the equations.
  As an application, we prove that a general model of single species with seasonal constant-yield harvesting can only possess at most two limit cycles, which improves the work of Xiao in 2016.
  We also apply our results to a general model described by the Abel equations with periodic step function coefficients, showing that its maximum number of limit cycles, is three.
  Finally, a population suppression model for mosquitos considered by Yu and Li in 2020 and Zheng et al. in 2021 is studied using our approach.</description>
