      <title>Impurities and polarons in bosonic quantum gases: a review on recent progress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review describes the field of Bose polarons, arising when mobile impurities are immersed into a bosonic quantum gas. The latter can be realized by a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of ultracold atoms, or of exciton polaritons in a semiconductor, which has led to a series of experimental observations of Bose polarons near inter-species Feshbach resonances that we survey. Following an introduction to the topic, with references to its historic roots and a presentation of the Bose polaron Hamiltonian, we summarize state-of-the-art experiments. Next we provide a detailed discussion of polaron models, starting from the ubiquitous Fr\"ohlich Hamiltonian that applies at weak couplings. We proceed by a survey of concurrent theoretical methods used for solving strongly interacting Bose polaron problems. The subsequent sections are devoted to the large bodies of work investigating strong coupling Bose polarons, including detailed comparisons with radio-frequency (RF) spectra obtained in ultracold atom experiments; to investigations of universal few-body and Efimov states associated with a Feshbach resonance in atomic mixtures; to studies of quantum dynamics and polarons out of equilibrium; Bose polarons in low-dimensional; induced interactions among polarons and bipolaron formation; and to Bose polarons at non-zero temperatures. We end our review by detailed discussions of closely related experimental setups and systems, including ionic impurities, systems with strong light-matter interactions, and variations and extensions of the Bose polaron concepts e.g. to baths with topological order or strong interactions relevant for correlated electrons. Finally, an outlook is presented, highlighting possible future research directions and open questions in the field as a whole.</description>

      <title>Autoionization-enhanced Rydberg dressing by fast contaminant removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg dressing is a powerful tool for entanglement generation in long-lived atomic states. While already employed effectively in several demonstrations, a key challenge for this technique is the collective loss triggered by blackbody-radiation-driven transitions to contaminant Rydberg states of opposite parity. We demonstrate the rapid removal of such contaminants using autoionization (AI) transitions found in alkaline-earth-like atoms. The AI is shown to be compatible with coherent operation of an array of optical clock qubits. By incorporating AI pulses into a stroboscopic Rydberg dressing (SRD) sequence, we enhance lifetimes by an order of magnitude for system sizes of up to 144 atoms, while maintaining an order of magnitude larger duty cycle than previously achieved. To highlight the utility of our approach, we use the AI-enhanced SRD protocol to improve the degree of spin-squeezing achieved during early-time dressing dynamics. These results bring Rydberg dressing lifetimes closer to fundamental limits, opening the door to previously infeasible dressing proposals.</description>

      <title>Topological Chiral Edge States in a Synthetic Dimension of Atomic Trap States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key hallmark of quantum Hall physics is the existence of topological chiral states at the system boundary. Signatures of these edge states have been experimentally observed in cold atoms by using different approaches, including notably that of ``synthetic dimension'' in which internal states are coupled together and reinterpreted as sites along an artificial spatial dimension. However, previous atomic synthetic dimension implementations have been limited to relatively small system sizes with inflexible boundaries. In this paper, we propose instead how to use a synthetic dimension of atomic trap states to observe chiral edge states in a large quantum Hall system with a tunable edge. We present numerical simulations for relevant experimental parameters, showing how this scheme may be used to probe the properties and robustness of the edge states to defects. Our work opens the way for future experiments in topological physics with synthetic dimensions, while also providing new ways to manipulate and control highly-excited trap states.</description>

      <title>Tachyonic and parametric instabilities in an extended bosonic Josephson Junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics and decay of quantum phase coherence for Bose-Einstein condensates in tunnel-coupled quantum wires. The two elongated Bose-Einstein condensates exhibit a wide variety of dynamic phenomena where quantum fluctuations can lead to a rapid loss of phase coherence. We investigate the phenomenon of self-trapping in the relative population imbalance of the two condensates, particularly $\pi$-trapped oscillations that occur when also the relative phase is trapped. Though this state appears stable in mean-field descriptions, the $\pi$-trapped state becomes dynamically unstable due to quantum fluctuations. Nonequilibrium instabilities result in the generation of pairs excited from the condensate to higher momentum modes. We identify tachyonic instabilities, which are associated with imaginary parts of the dispersion relation, and parametric resonance instabilities that are triggered by oscillations of the relative phase and populations. At early times, we compute the instability chart of the characteristic modes through a linearized analysis and identify the underlying physical process. At later times, the primary instabilities trigger secondary instabilities due to the build-up of non-linearities. We perform numerical simulations in the Truncated Wigner approximation in order to observe the dynamics also in this non-linear regime. Furthermore, we discuss realistic parameters for experimental realizations of the $\pi$-mode in ultracold atom setups.</description>

      <title>A phase microscope for quantum gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherence properties are central to quantum systems and are at the heart of phenomena such as superconductivity. Here we study coherence properties of an ultracold Bose gas in a two-dimensional optical lattice across the thermal phase transition. To infer the phase coherence and phase fluctuation profile, we use direct matter-wave imaging of higher Talbot revivals as well as a new phase microscope based on a site-resolved mapping of phase fluctuations to density fluctuations during matter-wave imaging. We observe the algebraic decay of the phase correlations in the superfluid phase and a linear temperature increase of the exponent. These techniques will also allow studying coherence properties in strongly-correlated quantum systems with full spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>Cooling a strongly-interacting quantum gas by interaction modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a cooling method for a strongly-interacting trapped quantum gas. By applying a magnetic field modulation with frequencies close to the binding energy of a molecular bound state we selectively remove dimers with high kinetic energy from the sample. We demonstrate cooling of the sample over a wide range of interaction strengths and measure a high cooling efficiency of $\gamma=4$ that exceeds all previous cooling near Feshbach resonances.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Mutual Gauge Field in Microwave-Shielded Polar Molecular Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent breakthrough of realizing the Bose-Einstein condensate of polar molecules and degenerate Fermi molecules in three dimensions relies crucially on the microwave shielding technique, which strongly suppresses the collision loss between molecules. In this letter, we show that the cooperation of microwave shielding and dipolar interaction naturally leads to the emergence of a synthetic gauge field. Unlike that studied in cold atoms before, this gauge field couples to the relative motion of every two molecules instead of single-particle motion, therefore being a mutual gauge field. In this case, every molecule carrying a synthetic charge sees the other molecule as carrying the source of the magnetic field, and the spatial distribution of the magnetic field is reminiscent of a solenoid attached to the molecule. In other words, in addition to microwave-shielded interaction, another part of the interaction between two molecules behaves as a charge interacting with a solenoid, which was missed in the previous discussion. We argue that the physical manifestation of this gauge field is breaking time-reversal symmetry in the collective spatial motion of molecules. Finally, we discuss the challenges in quantitatively studying such a quantum many-body system.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing Strong-to-Weak Symmetry Breaking via Wightman Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry plays a fundamental role in quantum many-body physics, and a central concept is spontaneous symmetry breaking, which imposes crucial constraints on the possible quantum phases and their transitions. Recent developments have extended the discussion of symmetry and its breaking to mixed states, enhancing our understanding of novel quantum phases that have no counterpart in pure states. Specific attention has been paid to scenarios where a strongly symmetric density matrix exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking to weak symmetry, characterized by the fidelity correlator. In this work, we propose the Wightman correlator as an alternative diagnostic tool. This construction relies on the introduction of the thermofield double state for a generic density matrix, which maps the strong symmetry of the density matrix to the doubled symmetry of the pure state, allowing the Wightman correlator to emerge naturally as a standard probe of symmetry breaking. We prove the equivalence between the Wightman function and the fidelity correlator in defining strong-to-weak symmetry breaking, and examine explicit examples involving spin glasses, thermal density matrices, and the decohered Ising model. Additionally, we discuss a susceptibility interpretation of the Wightman correlator.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Framework for Engineering Arbitrary Floquet Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic perturbative framework to engineer an arbitrary target Hamiltonian in the Floquet phase space of a periodically driven oscillator based on Floquet-Magnus expansion. The high-order errors in the engineered Floquet Hamiltonian are mitigated by adding high-order driving potentials perturbatively. Especially, we introduce a bracket transformation that makes the calculation of high-order correction drives feasible. We apply our method to engineering a target Hamiltonian with discrete rotational and chiral symmetries in phase space that are important for fault-tolerant hardware-efficiency bosonic quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Proposal for simulating quantum spin models with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction using Rydberg atoms and the construction of asymptotic quantum many-body scar states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05591v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have developed a method to simulate quantum spin models with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) using Rydberg atom quantum simulators. Our approach involves a two-photon Raman transition and a transformation to the spin-rotating frame, both of which are feasible with current experimental techniques. As a model that can be simulated in our setup but not in solid-state systems, we consider an $S=\frac{1}{2}$ spin chain with a Hamiltonian consisting of the DMI and Zeeman energy. We study the magnetization curve in the ground state of this model and quench dynamics. Further, we show the existence of quantum many-body scar states and asymptotic quantum many-body scar states. The observed nonergodicity in this model demonstrates the importance of the highly tunable DMI that can be realized by the proposed quantum simulator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06095v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss rapidly rotating states of a superfluid. We concentrate on the Giant-Vortex (GV) state, which is a coherent rotating solution with a macroscopic hole at the center. We show that, for any trap, the fluctuations obey an approximately chiral dispersion relation, describing arbitrary shape deformations moving with the speed of the ambient superfluid. This dispersion relation is a consequence of a peculiar infinite symmetry group that emerges at large angular velocity and implies an infinite ground-state degeneracy. The degeneracy is lifted by small corrections which we determine both for smooth traps and the hard trap.</description>

      <title>Exciting the Higgs mode in a strongly-interacting Fermi gas by interaction modulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Higgs mode of a strongly-interacting Fermi gas in the crossover regime between a fermionic and bosonic superfluid. By periodically modulating the interaction strength of the gas, we parametrically excite the Higgs mode and study its resonance frequency and line width as a function of both interaction strength and temperature. We find that the resonance frequency at low temperature agrees with a local-density approximation of the pairing gap. Both frequency and line width do not exhibit a pronounced variation with temperature, which is theoretically unexpected, however, in qualitative agreement with a different recent study.</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced dissipative quantum phase transition in a head-to-tail atomic Josephson junction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a dissipative phase transition in a head-to-tail Bose Josephson junction. The quantum phase transition has the same origin as the one in a resistively shunted Josephson junction, but the intrinsic momentum coupling between the Josephson mode and the bath modes enables us to observe the dissipative phase transition without any synthetic dissipation. We show that the interatomic interaction strength plays the role of the damping parameter. Consequently, in contrast to a resistively shunted Josephson circuit, the Bose Josephson junction can exhibit an insulating phase in a wider parameter region by increasing the repulsive interaction strength, which is robust against nonperturbative effects. We argue that tight transverse confinement of the quasi-one-dimensional atomic gas allows us to reach the insulating phase.</description>

      <title>Multi-qubit gates and Schr\"odinger cat states in an optical clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16289v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many-particle entanglement is a key resource for achieving the fundamental precision limits of a quantum sensor. Optical atomic clocks, the current state-of-the-art in frequency precision, are a rapidly emerging area of focus for entanglement-enhanced metrology. Augmenting tweezer-based clocks featuring microscopic control and detection with the high-fidelity entangling gates developed for atom-array information processing offers a promising route towards leveraging highly entangled quantum states for improved optical clocks. Here we develop and employ a family of multi-qubit Rydberg gates to generate Schr\"odinger cat states of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) type with up to 9 optical clock qubits in a programmable atom array. In an atom-laser comparison at sufficiently short dark times, we demonstrate a fractional frequency instability below the standard quantum limit using GHZ states of up to 4 qubits. However, due to their reduced dynamic range, GHZ states of a single size fail to improve the achievable clock precision at the optimal dark time compared to unentangled atoms. Towards overcoming this hurdle, we simultaneously prepare a cascade of varying-size GHZ states to perform unambiguous phase estimation over an extended interval. These results demonstrate key building blocks for approaching Heisenberg-limited scaling of optical atomic clock precision.</description>

Abstract: Atomic interferometers measure phase differences along paths with exceptional precision. Tweezer interferometry represents a novel approach for this measurement by guiding particles along predefined trajectories. This study explores the feasibility of using condensed bosons in tweezer interferometry. Unlike the factor $\sqrt{N}$ enhancement expected with classical ensembles, using NOON state interferometry can yield an enhancement by a factor of $N$. We consider a protocol for a tweezer-based NOON state interferometer that includes adiabatic splitting and merging of condensed bosons, followed by adiabatic branching for phase encoding. Our theoretical analysis focuses on the conditions necessary to achieve adiabaticity and avoid spontaneous symmetry breaking. Additionally, we demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed scheme and estimate the time required to perform these sweep processes.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Open Quantum Systems</title>

Abstract: These Lecture Notes discuss the recent theoretical advances in the understanding of open quantum many-body physics in platforms where both dissipative and coherent processes can be tuned and controlled to a high degree. We start by reviewing the theoretical frameworks and methods used to describe and tackle open quantum many-body systems. We then discuss the use of dissipative processes to engineer many-body stationary states with desired properties and the emergence of dissipative phase transitions arising out of the competition between coherent evolution and dissipation. We review the dynamics of open quantum many body systems in the presence of correlated many-body dissipative processes, such as heating and many-body losses. Finally we provide a different perspective on open quantum many-body systems by looking at stochastic quantum trajectories, relevant for the case in which the environment represents a monitoring device, and the associated measurement-induced phase transitions.</description>
