      <title>Extreme events scaling in self-organized critical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study extreme events of avalanche activities in finite-size two-dimensional self-organized critical (SOC) models, specifically the stochastic Manna model (SMM) and the Bak-Tang-Weisenfeld (BTW) sandpile model. Employing the approach of block maxima, the study numerically reveals that the distributions for extreme avalanche size and area follow the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution. The extreme avalanche size follows the Gumbel distribution with shape parameter $\xi=0$ while in the case of the extreme avalanche area, we report $\xi&gt;0$. We propose scaling functions for extreme avalanche activities that connect the activities on different length scales. With the help of data collapse, we estimate the precise values of these critical exponents. The scaling functions provide an understanding of the intricate dynamics for different variants of the sandpile model, shedding light on the relationship between system size and extreme event characteristics. Our findings give insight into the extreme behavior of SOC models and offer a framework to understand the statistical properties of extreme events.</description>

      <title>Gravity-Induced Modulation of Negative Differential Thermal Resistance in Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how gravity influences negative differential thermal resistance (NDTR) in fluids modeled by multiparticle collision dynamics. In the integrable case, we derive the heat flux formula for the system exhibiting the NDTR effect, and show that by introducing a gravity along the direction of the thermodynamic force, the temperature difference required for the occurrence of NDTR can be greatly reduced. Meanwhile, we also demonstrate that the heat-bath-induced NDTR mechanism -- originally found to be applicable only to weakly interacting systems -- can now operate in systems with stronger interactions due to the presence of gravity, and further remains robust even in mixed fluids. These results provide new insights into heat transport and establish a theoretical foundation for designing fluidic thermal devices that harness the NDTR effect under gravity.</description>

      <title>Collective Variables Based on Multipole Expansion of Ewald Summation for Crystallization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystallization, a fundamental phase transition process governing material formation in natural and industrial contexts, involves the spontaneous emergence of long-range structural order from disordered phases. This long-range periodicity involves spatial and molecular orientation order. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of crystallization require collective variables (CVs) that accurately distinguish this long-\range periodicity. Existing CVs based on local descriptors (e.g., bond-orientational order) often lack transferability across crystal structures. To address this, we propose a unified CV framework derived from the multipole expansion of Ewald summation: a mathematical formalism bridging X-ray diffraction (XRD) principles and electrostatic energy computation in MD. By projecting atomic configurations onto a basis of spherical harmonics (complete for angular function representation), our CV achieves high-fidelity encoding of both translational and orientational order. Metadynamics simulations demonstrate that this CV drives efficient sampling of polymorphic pathways for known crystals and predicts stable phases even without crystal structures. This approach shows potential as a transferable platform for ab initio crystal structure prediction.</description>

      <title>An exactly solvable asymmetric simple inclusion process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a generalization of the asymmetric simple inclusion process (ASIP) on a periodic one-dimensional lattice, where the integers in the particles rates are deformed to their $t$-analogues. We call this the $(q, t, \theta)$~ASIP, where $q$ is the asymmetric hopping parameter and $\theta$ is the diffusion parameter. We show that this process is a misanthrope process, and consequently the steady state is independent of $q$. We compute the steady state, the one-point correlation and the current in the steady state. In particular, we show that the single-site occupation probabilities follow a \emph{beta-binomial} distribution at $t=1$. We compute the two-dimensional phase diagram in various regimes of the parameters $(t, \theta)$ and perform simulations to justify the results. We also show that a modified form of the steady state weights at $t \neq 1$ satisfy curious palindromic and antipalindromic symmetries. Lastly, we define an enriched process at $t=1$ and $\theta$ an integer which projects onto the $(q, 1, \theta)$~ASIP and whose steady state is uniform, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning of the Biswas-Chatterjee-Sen Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the critical properties of kinetic continuous opinion dynamics using deep learning techniques. The system consists of $N$ continuous spin variables in the interval $[-1,1]$. Dense neural networks are trained on spin configuration data generated via kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, accurately identifying the critical point on both square and triangular lattices. Classical unsupervised learning with principal component analysis reproduces the magnetization and allows estimation of critical exponents. Additionally, variational autoencoders are implemented to study the phase transition through the loss function, which behaves as an order parameter. A correlation function between real and reconstructed data is defined and found to be universal at the critical point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic processes out-of-equilibrium often involve asymmetric contributions that break detailed balance and lead to non-monotonic entropy production, limiting thermodynamic interpretations and inference techniques. Here we use Dyson maps to restore monotonic entropy growth in those processes, allowing the use of standard tools from statistical physics, providing a general and computationally tractable method applicable to a broad class of Markovian systems.</description>

      <title>Generalised fractional Rabi problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractional quantum dynamics provides a natural framework to capture nonlocal temporal behavior and memory effects in quantum systems. In this work, we analyze the physical consequences of fractional-order quantum evolution using a Green's function formulation based on the Caputo fractional derivative. Explicit iterative expressions for the evolved state are derived and applied to an extended two-level Rabi model, a paradigmatic setting for coherent quantum control. We find that even in the absence of external driving, the static Hamiltonian term induces non-trivial spin dynamics with damping features directly linked to the fractional temporal nonlocality. When a periodically varying driving field is introduced, the competition between energy injection and memory effects gives rise to a richer dynamical behavior, manifest in the evolution of spin polarization, autocorrelation function, and fidelity. Unlike the standard Rabi oscillations characterized by a fixed frequency, the fractional regime introduces controllable damping and dephasing governed by the degree of fractionality. These distinctive signatures could be observable through the Loschmidt echo and autocorrelation function, and would offer potential routes to probe fractional quantum dynamics experimentally. Our findings open pathways toward exploring memory-induced dynamical phenomena in other systems effectively described by a two-level approximation, such as graphene-like materials and topological SSH chains, where non-integer order evolution may reveal novel topological or relaxation effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In thermodynamics, an agent's ability to extract work is fundamentally constrained by their environment. Traditional frameworks struggle to capture how strategic decision-making under uncertainty -- particularly an agent's tolerance for risk -- determines the trade-off between extractable work and probability of success in finite-scale experiments. Here, we develop a framework for non-equilibrium thermodynamics based on adversarial resource theories, in which work extraction is modelled as an adversarial game for an agent extracting work. Within this perspective, we recast the Szilard engine as a game isomorphic to Kelly gambling, an information-theoretic model of optimal betting under uncertainty -- but with a thermodynamic utility function. Extending the framework to finite-size regimes, we apply a risk-reward trade-off to find an interpretation of the Renyi-divergences, in terms of extractable work for a given failure probability. By incorporating risk sensitivity via utility functions, we show that the guaranteed amount of work a rational agent would accept instead of undertaking a risky protocol is given by a R\'enyi divergence. This provides a unified picture of thermodynamics and gambling, and highlights how generalized free energies emerge from an adversarial setup.</description>

Abstract: Dynamic bonding is an essential feature of many soft materials. Molecular simulations have proven to be a powerful tool for modeling bonding kinetics and thermodynamics in these materials, providing insights into their properties that cannot be obtained by experiments alone. Here, we review recent advances in modeling dynamic bonding in soft matter via molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo, and hybrid simulation methods, highlighting outstanding challenges and future directions.</description>

      <title>Triadic percolation on multilayer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Triadic interactions are special types of higher-order interactions that occur when regulator nodes modulate the interactions between other two or more nodes. In presence of triadic interactions, a percolation process occurring on a single-layer network becomes a fully-fledged dynamical system, characterized by period-doubling and a route to chaos. Here, we generalize the model to multilayer networks and name it as the multilayer triadic percolation (MTP) model. We find a much richer dynamical behavior of the MTP model than its single-layer counterpart. MTP displays a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation, leading to oscillations of arbitrarily large period or pseudo-periodic oscillations. Moreover, MTP admits period-two oscillations without negative regulatory interactions, whereas single-layer systems only display discontinuous hybrid transitions. This comprehensive model offers new insights on the importance of regulatory interactions in real-world systems such as brain networks, climate, and ecological systems.</description>

      <title>Localizing the Ising CFT from the ground state of the Ising model on the fuzzy sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We locate the phase-transition line for the Ising model on the fuzzy sphere from a finite-size scaling analysis of its ground-state energy. This is similar to what was used to locate the complex CFT of the 5-state Potts model in dimension $d=2$ [PRL 133 (2024) 077101]. There it was shown that a CFT is characterized by a stationarity condition for the measured effective central charge. Our strategy is to write the ground-state energy as $E_{\rm GS}(N)/N_m = E_{0} + E_1 /N_m + E_{3/2}/N_m^{3/2}+ ...$, and to search for a minimum of $ E_{3/2}/E_0$ as a function of the couplings. This procedure finds the critical curve of [PRX 13 (2023) 021009] with good precision, and their sweet spot as well. We find similar results when normalizing by the gap to the stress tensor tensor $T$ or first parity-odd operator $\sigma$.</description>

Abstract: We present a new unified theory of critical finite-size scaling for lattice statistical mechanical models with periodic boundary conditions above the upper critical dimension. Our theory is based on recent mathematically rigorous results for linear and branched polymers, multi-component spin systems, and percolation. Both short-range and long-range interactions are included. The universal finite-size scaling is inherited from the scaling of the system unwrapped to the infinite lattice. We also present conjectures for universal scaling profiles for the susceptibility and two-point function plateau in a critical window. For free boundary conditions, the universal scaling has been proven to apply at a pseudocritical point for hierarchical spins, and we conjecture that this holds generally.</description>

Abstract: In this work, the origin of nonlocal effects is inspected and the contributions of nontrivial topological structures to physical properties are investigated in details for both the 3D Ising model and the Z2 lattice gauge model. Then the exact solution for the 3D Z2 lattice gauge theory is derived by the duality between the two models. Several fundamental issues, such as dimensionality, duality, symmetry, manifold, degenerate states, are investigated for these many-body interacting spin systems. The connections with superfluid, superconductors, etc. are evaluated. Furthermore, physical significances and mathematical aspects of the 3D Z2 lattice gauge theory are discussed with respect to topology, geometry, and algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14293v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conjecture that the current fluctuations in one-dimensional driven transport systems obey an upper bound determined by the mean current and the driving force. This inequality originates from repulsive interactions between transporting particles, and the bound is approached both in near-equilibrium systems and in far-from-equilibrium systems with weak interactions. We first propose a coarse-grained model describing random particle exchanges between two reservoirs with constant rates, from which the upper bound emerges. We then rigorously prove the inequality in quantum ballistic transport systems. Finally, we demonstrate its validity in two specific diffusive systems: the exclusion process, for which the inequality can be proven, and charged-particle transport, for which numerical evidence supports the inequality.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical autoregressive neural networks in three-dimensional statistical system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autoregressive Neural Networks (ANN) have been recently proposed as a mechanism to improve the efficiency of Monte Carlo algorithms for several spin systems. The idea relies on the fact that the total probability of a configuration can be factorized into conditional probabilities of each spin, which in turn can be approximated by a neural network. Once trained, the ANNs can be used to sample configurations from the approximated probability distribution and to explicitly evaluate this probability for a given configuration. It has also been observed that such conditional probabilities give access to information-theoretic observables such as mutual information or entanglement entropy. In this paper, we describe the hierarchical autoregressive network (HAN) algorithm in three spatial dimensions and study its performance using the example of the Ising model. We compare HAN with three other autoregressive architectures and the classical Wolff cluster algorithm. Finally, we provide estimates of thermodynamic observables for the three-dimensional Ising model, such as entropy and free energy, in a range of temperatures across the phase transition.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct dynamic models governing two nonreciprocally coupled fields for several cases with zero, one, and two conservation laws. Starting from two microscopic nonreciprocally coupled Ising models, and using the mean-field approximation, we obtain closed-form evolution equations for the spatially resolved magnetization in each lattice. Only allowing for single spin-flip dynamics, the macroscopic equations in the thermodynamic limit are closely related to the nonreciprocal Allen-Cahn equations, i.e. conservation laws are absent. Likewise, only accounting for spin-exchange dynamics within each lattice, the thermodynamic limit yields equations similar to the nonreciprocal Cahn-Hilliard model, i.e. with two conservation laws. In the case of spin-exchange dynamics within and between the two lattices, we obtain two nonreciprocally coupled equations that add up to one conservation law. For each of these cases, we systematically map out the linear instabilities that can arise. Moreover, combining the different dynamics gives a large number of further models. Our results provide a microscopic foundation for a broad class of nonreciprocal field theories, establishing a direct link between nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and macroscopic continuum descriptions.</description>

      <title>Slow dynamics from a nested hierarchy of frozen states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify the mechanism of slow heterogeneous relaxation in quantum kinetically constrained models (KCMs) in which the potential energy strength is controlled by a coupling parameter. The regime of slow relaxation includes the large-coupling limit. By expanding around that limit, we reveal a \emph{nested hierarchy} of states that remain frozen on time scales determined by powers of the coupling. The classification of such states, together with the evolution of their Krylov complexity, reveal that these time scales are related to the distance between the sites where facilitated dynamics is allowed by the kinetic constraint. While correlations within frozen states relax slowly and exhibit metastable plateaus that persist on time scales set by powers of the coupling parameter, the correlations in the rest of the states decay rapidly. We compute the plateau heights of correlations across all frozen states up to second-order corrections in the inverse coupling. Our results explain slow relaxation in quantum KCMs and elucidate dynamical heterogeneity by relating the relaxation times to the spatial separations between the active regions.</description>

      <title>Strong Characterization for the Airy Line Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show that a Brownian Gibbsian line ensemble whose top curve approximates a parabola must be given by the parabolic Airy line ensemble. More specifically, we prove that if $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{L}} = (\mathcal{L}_1, \mathcal{L}_2, \ldots )$ is a line ensemble satisfying the Brownian Gibbs property, such that for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ there exists a constant $\mathfrak{K} (\varepsilon) &gt; 0$ with $$\mathbb{P} \Big[ \big| \mathcal{L}_1 (t) + 2^{-1/2} t^2 \big| \le \varepsilon t^2 + \mathfrak{K} (\varepsilon) \Big] \ge 1 - \varepsilon, \qquad \text{for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$},$$ then $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{L}}$ is the parabolic Airy line ensemble, up to an independent affine shift. Specializing this result to the case when $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{L}} (t) + 2^{-1/2} t^2$ is translation-invariant confirms a prediction of Okounkov and Sheffield from 2006 and Corwin-Hammond from 2014.</description>

      <title>Frustrated Quantum Magnetism on Complex Networks: What Sets the Total Spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09116v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider equal antiferromagnetic Heisenberg interactions between qubits forming a complex, nonbipartite network. We ask the question: How does the network topology determine the net magnetization of the ground state and to what extent is it tunable? By examining over 75000 networks of different families with tunable structural properties, we demonstrate that (i) heterogeneity in the number of neighbors is essential for a nonzero total spin, and (ii) apart from the number of neighbors, the key determinant is the presence of (disassortative) hubs, as opposed to the frustration level. In fact, one can vary the magnetization throughout its range by embedding such hubs. We also discuss simple, exactly solvable networks where such tunability leads to both abrupt and continuous transitions, with quantum effects giving rise to a diverging susceptibility. Our findings can be realized on emerging platforms and pose a number of fundamental questions, strongly motivating wider exploration of quantum many-body phenomena on complex networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21397v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurements in many-body quantum systems can generate non-trivial phenomena, such as preparation of long-range entangled states, dynamical phase transitions, or measurement-altered criticality. Here, we introduce a new measurement scheme that produces an ensemble of mixed states in a subsystem, obtained by measuring a local Hermitian observable on part of its complement. We refer to this as the observable-projected ensemble. Unlike standard projected ensembles-where pure states are generated by projective measurements on the complement-our approach involves projective partial measurements of specific observables. This setup has two main advantages: theoretically, it is amenable to analytical computations, especially within conformal field theories. Experimentally, it requires only a linear number of measurements, rather than an exponential one, to probe the properties of the ensemble. As a first step in exploring the observable-projected ensemble, we investigate its entanglement properties in conformal field theory and perform a detailed analysis of the free compact boson.</description>

      <title>Filtering out mislabeled training instances using black-box optimization and quantum annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study proposes an approach for removing mislabeled instances from contaminated training datasets by combining surrogate model-based black-box optimization (BBO) with postprocessing and quantum annealing. Mislabeled training instances, a common issue in real-world datasets, often degrade model generalization, necessitating robust and efficient noise-removal strategies. The proposed method evaluates filtered training subsets based on validation loss, iteratively refines loss estimates through surrogate model-based BBO with postprocessing, and leverages quantum annealing to efficiently sample diverse training subsets with low validation error. Experiments on a noisy majority bit task demonstrate the method's ability to prioritize the removal of high-risk mislabeled instances. Integrating D-Wave's clique sampler running on a physical quantum annealer achieves faster optimization and higher-quality training subsets compared to OpenJij's simulated quantum annealing sampler or Neal's simulated annealing sampler, offering a scalable framework for enhancing dataset quality. This work highlights the effectiveness of the proposed method for supervised learning tasks, with future directions including its application to unsupervised learning, real-world datasets, and large-scale implementations.</description>

      <title>Fixation and extinction in time-fluctuating spatially structured metapopulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08433v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bacteria evolve in volatile environments and complex spatial structures. Migration, fluctuations and environmental variability therefore have a significant impact on the evolution of microbial populations. Here, we consider a class of spatially explicit metapopulation models arranged as regular (circulation) graphs where wild-type and mutant cells compete in a time-fluctuating environment in which demes (subpopulations) are connected by slow cell migration. The carrying capacity is the same at each deme and endlessly switches between two values associated to harsh and mild environmental conditions. Environmental variability can lead to population bottlenecks, following which the population is prone to fluctuation-induced extinction. Here, we analyse how slow migration, spatial structure, and fluctuations affect the phenomena of fixation and extinction on clique, cycle, and square lattice metapopulations. When the carrying capacity remains large, bottlenecks are weak and deme extinction can be ignored. The dynamics is thus captured by a coarse-grained description within which the probability and mean time of fixation are obtained analytically. This allows us to show that, in contrast to static environments, the mutant fixation probability depends on the rate of migration. We also show that the fixation probability and mean fixation time can exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on the switching rate. When the carrying capacity is small under harsh conditions, bottlenecks are strong, and the metapopulation evolution is shaped by the coupling of deme extinction and strain competition. This yields rich dynamical scenarios, among which we identify the best conditions to eradicate mutants without dooming the metapopulation to extinction. We offer an interpretation of these findings in the context of an idealised treatment strategy and discuss possible generalisations of our models.</description>

      <title>Many-body critical phase in a quasiperiodic chain and dynamical Widom lines in Fock space properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a quasiperiodic model in one dimension, namely the extended Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (EAAH) chain, that realizes a critical phase comprising entirely single-particle critical states in the non-interacting limit. In the presence of short-range interactions, the non-interacting critical phase transforms to a many-body critical (MBC) phase, separated by lines of MBC-ergodic, MBC-many-body localized (MBL) and ergodic-MBL phase transitions that meet at a triple point. We elucidate the unusual characteristics of the MBC phase compared to the ergodic and MBL phases through the localization properties of the excitations in real space and Fock space (FS), and eigenstate inverse participation ratio (IPR). We show that the MBC phase, like the MBL phase, is well described by a multifractal scaling of the IPR and a linear finite-size scaling ansatz near the transition to the ergodic and MBL phases. However, the MBC phase, at the same time, exhibits delocalization of all single-particle excitations and a system-size dependent Fock-space localization length, analogous to the ergodic phase. Remarkably, we find evidence of unusual Widom lines on the phase diagram in the form of lines of pronounced peaks or dips in the FS localization properties inside the MBC and MBL phases. These Widom lines either emerge as a continuation of the precursor phase transition line, terminating at the triple point, or originate from a phase boundary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03668v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the one dimensional, critical transverse field Ising model is Yang-Baxter integrable. This is done by constructing commuting transfer matrices built out of a $R$-matrix satisfying the Yang-Baxter equation with additive spectral parameters. The $R$-matrix is non-local, as it is expressed in terms of Majorana fermions. It is also non-regular. Nevertheless, we show that the quantum inverse scattering method can still be suitably adapted. We then recursively obtain the conserved quantities [in the infinite volume] by the boost operator method. Remarkably, among the conserved charges we also find the Kramers-Wannier duality and other non-invertible symmetries for the periodic transverse field Ising model.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Boltzmann brains, the time-asymmetry of memory, and the second law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10959v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Are you, with your perceptions, memories and observational data, a Boltzmann brain, i.e., a statistical fluctuation out of the thermal equilibrium of the universe? Arguments are given in the literature for and against taking this hypothesis seriously. Complicating these analyses have been the many subtle - and very often implicit - entanglements between related arguments that have been given for the past hypothesis, the second law, and even Bayesian inference of the reliability of experimental data. These entanglements can easily lead to circular reasoning. To help disentangle those arguments, since almost all of them involve Boltzmann's H theorem, we begin by formalizing the H theorem as a time-symmetric, time-translation invariant Markov process over the entropy values of the universe. Crucially, this process does not specify the time(s) on which we should condition it in order to infer the stochastic dynamics of our universe's entropy. Any such choice of conditioning events must be introduced as an independent assumption. This observation allows us to disentangle the standard Boltzmann brain hypothesis, its "1000CE" variant, the past hypothesis, the second law, and the reliability of our experimental data, all in a fully formal manner. In particular, we show that they all adopt the H theorem's stipulation that the universe's entropy evolves as a Markov processes, and all make an arbitrary assumption that the process should be conditioned on a single moment in time. Their only difference is what single time to condition on. In this aspect, the Boltzmann brain hypothesis and the second law are equally legitimate (or not).</description>

Abstract: We derive the asymptotic expansion of the partition function of a Coulomb gas system in the determinantal case on compact Riemann surfaces of any genus g. Our main tool is the bosonization formula relating the analytic torsion and geometric quantities including the Green functions appearing in the definition of this partition function. As a result, we prove the geometric version of the Zabrodin-Wiegmann conjecture in the determinantal case.</description>

      <title>ChromRec: Self-Assembly of Nucleosomes Driven by Directional Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24970v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding chromatin dynamics across multiple spatiotemporal scales requires models that reconcile biological specificity with physics-based interactions and computational tractability. We present a modular, recognition-enabled ultra-coarse-grained (UCG) framework that captures both histone-DNA and histone-histone interactions using site-specific, off-center "recognition" potentials. These recognition sites, combined with generic attractive and repulsive terms, encode directional and stoichiometrically faithful assembly rules. Benchmark simulations demonstrate that this scheme robustly drives the self-assembly of geometrically correct histone octamers and enables stable nucleosome formation. The model also supports tunable resolution, allowing simplification of intra-octamer, nucleosomal, or fiber-level structures depending on the biological question to be addressed. This flexibility is especially useful for exploring chromatin reorganization driven by epigenetic regulation. While developed with chromatin in mind, our framework generalizes to other multivalent assemblies governed by molecular recognition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the late-time dynamics of a generic spin ensemble with inhomogeneous broadening - equivalently, qubits with arbitrary Zeeman splittings - coupled to a dissipative environment with strength decreasing as $1/t$. The approach to the steady state follows a power law, reflecting the interplay between Hamiltonian dynamics and vanishing dissipation. The decay exponents vary non-analytically with the ramp rate, exhibiting a cusp singularity, and $n$-point correlation functions factorize into one- and two-point contributions. Our exact solution anchors a universality class of open quantum systems with explicitly time-dependent dissipation.</description>
