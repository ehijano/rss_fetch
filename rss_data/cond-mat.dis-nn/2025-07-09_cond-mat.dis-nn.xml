      <title>Revealing the Void-Size Distribution of Silica Glass using Persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oxide glasses have proven to be useful across a wide range of technological applications. Nevertheless, their medium-range structure has remained elusive. Previous studies focused on the ring statistics as a metric for the medium-range structure, which, however, provides an incomplete picture of the glassy structure. Here, we use atomistic simulations and state-of-the-art topological analysis tools, namely persistent homology (PH), to analyze the medium-range structure of the archetypal oxide glass (Silica) at ambient temperatures and with varying pressures. PH presents an unbiased definition of loops and voids, providing an advantage over other methods for studying the structure and topology of complex materials, such as glasses, across multiple length scales. We captured subtle topological transitions in medium-range order and cavity distributions, providing new insights into glass structure. Our work provides a robust way for extracting the void distribution of oxide glasses based on persistent homology.</description>

      <title>Ontological differentiation as a measure of semantic accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding semantic relationships within complex networks derived from lexical resources is fundamental for network science and language modeling. While network embedding methods capture contextual similarity, quantifying semantic distance based directly on explicit definitional structure remains challenging. Accurate measures of semantic similarity allow for navigation on lexical networks based on maximizing semantic similarity in each navigation jump (Semantic Navigation, SN). This work introduces Ontological Differentiation (OD), a formal method for measuring divergence between concepts by analyzing overlap during recursive definition expansion. The methodology is applied to networks extracted from the Simple English Wiktionary, comparing OD scores with other measures of semantic similarity proposed in the literature (cosine similarity based on random-walk network exploration). We find weak correlations between direct pairwise OD scores and cosine similarities across $\sim$~2 million word pairs, sampled from a pool representing over 50\% of the entries in the Wiktionary lexicon. This establishes OD as a largely independent, definition-based semantic metric, whose orthogonality to cosine similarity becomes more pronounced when low-semantic-content terms were removed from the dataset. Additionally, we use cumulative OD scores to evaluate paths generated by vector-based SN and structurally optimal Shortest Paths (SP) across networks. We find SN paths consistently exhibit significantly lower cumulative OD scores than shortest paths, suggesting that SN produces trajectories more coherent with the dictionary's definitional structure, as measured by OD. Ontological Differentiation thus provides a novel, definition-grounded tool for analyzing semantic structure and validating navigation processes in lexical networks.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-likelihood produces associative memories able to generalize, even for asymmetric couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy-based probabilistic models learned by maximizing the likelihood of the data are limited by the intractability of the partition function. A widely used workaround is to maximize the pseudo-likelihood, which replaces the global normalization with tractable local normalizations. Here we show that, in the zero-temperature limit, a network trained to maximize pseudo-likelihood naturally implements an associative memory: if the training set is small, patterns become fixed-point attractors whose basins of attraction exceed those of any classical Hopfield rule. We explain quantitatively this effect on uncorrelated random patterns. Moreover, we show that, for different structured datasets coming from computer science (random feature model, MNIST), physics (spin glasses) and biology (proteins), as the number of training examples increases the learned network goes beyond memorization, developing meaningful attractors with non-trivial correlations with test examples, thus showing the ability to generalize. Our results therefore reveal pseudo-likelihood works both as an efficient inference tool and as a principled mechanism for memory and generalization.</description>

      <title>The Neural Networks with Tensor Weights and the Corresponding Fermionic Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a theoretical connection between complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) and fermionic quantum field theory (QFT), bridging a fundamental gap in the emerging framework of neural network quantum field theory (NN-QFT). While prior NN-QFT works have linked real-valued architectures to bosonic fields, we demonstrate that CVNNs equipped with tensor-valued weights intrinsically generate fermionic quantum fields. By promoting hidden-to-output weights to Clifford algebra-valued tensors, we induce anticommutation relations essential for fermionic statistics. Through analytical study of the generating functional, we obtain the exact quantum state in the infinite-width limit, revealing that the parameters between the input layer and the last hidden layer correspond to the eigenvalues of the quantum system, and the tensor weighting parameters in the hidden-to-output layer map to dynamical fermionic fields. The continuum limit reproduces free fermion correlators, with diagrammatic expansions confirming anticommutation. The work provides the first explicit mapping from neural architectures to fermionic QFT at the level of correlation functions and generating functional. It extends NN-QFT beyond bosonic theories and opens avenues for encoding fermionic symmetries into machine learning models, with potential applications in quantum simulation and lattice field theory.</description>

      <title>Looking elsewhere: improving variational Monte Carlo gradients by importance sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural-network quantum states (NQS) offer a powerful and expressive ansatz for representing quantum many-body wave functions. However, their training via Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) methods remains challenging. It is well known that some scenarios - such as sharply peaked wave functions emerging in quantum chemistry - lead to high-variance gradient estimators hindering the effectiveness of variational optimizations. In this work we investigate a systematic strategy to tackle those sampling issues by means of adaptively tuned importance sampling. Our approach is explicitly designed to (i) target the gradient estimator instead of the loss function, (ii) not introduce additional hyperparameters and (iii) be computationally inexpensive. We benchmarked our approach across the ground-state search of a wide variety of hamiltonians, including frustrated spin systems and ab-initio quantum chemistry. We also show systematic improvements on the infidelity minimization in the context of neural projected quantum dynamics. Overall, our approach can reduce the computational cost of vanilla VMC considerably, up to a factor of 100x when targeting highly peaked quantum chemistry wavefunctions.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Variation-Resilient Random Number Generator for Embedded Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With a growing interest in securing user data within the internet-of-things (IoT), embedded encryption has become of paramount importance, requiring light-weight high-quality Random Number Generators (RNGs). Emerging stochastic device technologies produce random numbers from stochastic physical processes at high quality, however, their generated random number streams are adversely affected by process and supply voltage variations, which can lead to bias in the generated streams. In this work, we present an adaptive variation-resilient RNG capable of extracting unbiased encryption-grade random number streams from physically driven entropy sources, for embedded cryptography applications. As a proof of concept, we employ a stochastic magnetic tunnel junction (sMTJ) device as an entropy source. The impact of variations in the sMTJ is mitigated by employing an adaptive digitizer with an adaptive voltage reference that dynamically tracks any stochastic signal drift or deviation, leading to unbiased random bit stream generation. The generated unbiased bit streams, due to their higher entropy, then only need to undergo simplified post-processing. Statistical randomness tests based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) test suite are conducted on bit streams obtained using simulations and FPGA entropy source emulation experiments, validating encryption-grade randomness at a significantly reduced hardware cost, and across a wide range of process-induced device variations and supply voltage fluctuations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking is the core concept for understanding the emergence of collective order. In finite-dimensional systems, however, the nature of the broken phase is often constrained by the compatibility between spontaneous order and the microscopic symmetries of the underlying lattice. Here, we propose the topological substratum on which Ising spin lattices exhibit long-range order when cooled under non-ergodic conditions. Our topological decomposition, tantamount to resonating sand plates, enables monitoring and control of the dynamical evolution in systems surfing complex energy landscapes with multiple metastable patterns.</description>

      <title>Inferring Higher-Order Couplings with Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06108v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Maximum entropy methods, rooted in the inverse Ising/Potts problem from statistical physics, are widely used to model pairwise interactions in complex systems across disciplines such as bioinformatics and neuroscience. While successful, these approaches often fail to capture higher-order interactions that are critical for understanding collective behavior. In contrast, modern machine learning methods can model such interactions, but their interpretability often comes at a prohibitive computational cost. Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) provide a computationally efficient alternative by encoding statistical correlations through hidden units in a bipartite architecture. In this work, we introduce a method that maps RBMs onto generalized Potts models, enabling the systematic extraction of interactions up to arbitrary order. Leveraging large-$N$ approximations, made tractable by the RBM's structure, we extract effective many-body couplings with minimal computational effort. We further propose a robust framework for recovering higher-order interactions in more complex generative models, and introduce a simple gauge-fixing scheme for the effective Potts representation. Validation on synthetic data demonstrates accurate recovery of two- and three-body interactions. Applied to protein sequence data, our method reconstructs contact maps with high fidelity and outperforms state-of-the-art inverse Potts models. These results establish RBMs as a powerful and efficient tool for modeling higher-order structure in high-dimensional categorical data.</description>

      <title>The origin of anomalous non-linear microwave absorption in Josephson junction qubits: mysterious nature of two level systems or their dynamic interaction?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum two-level systems (TLSs) commonly found at low temperature in amorphous and disordered materials are responsible for decoherence in superconducting Josephson junction qubits particularly because they absorb energy of coherent qubit oscillations in the microwave frequency range. In planar Josephson resonators with oxide interfaces this absorption is characterized by an anomalously weak loss tangent dependence on the field in the non-linear regime that conflicts with the theoretical expectations and the observations in amorphous dielectrics. It was recently suggested that this anomalous absorption is due to TLS dynamic interactions. Here we show that such interactions cannot lead to the observed loss-tangent field dependence and suggest the alternative explanation assuming that TLS dipole moments $p$ are distributed according to the specific power law $P(p) \propto 1/p^{3-\eta}$ ($0\leq \eta &lt;1$). This assumption, indeed, results in the observed loss tangent behavior. The hypothesis of a power law distribution is supported both by the recent measurements of individual TLS dipole moments and the theoretical model of TLS formation due to the long-range dipole-dipole interaction, thus connecting the anomalous absorption with the possible solution of the long-standing problem of the nature of TLSs.</description>

      <title>Free energy in multi-species mixed $p$-spin spherical models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.14790v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a Parisi formula for the limiting free energy of multi-species spherical spin glasses with mixed $p$-spin interactions. The upper bound involves a Guerra-style interpolation and requires a convexity assumption on the model's covariance function. Meanwhile, the lower bound adapts the cavity method of Chen so that it can be combined with the synchronization technique of Panchenko; this part requires no convexity assumption. In order to guarantee that the resulting Parisi formula has a minimizer, we formalize the pairing of synchronization maps with overlap measures so that the constraint set is a compact metric space. This space is not related to the model's spherical structure and can be carried over to other multi-species settings.</description>

      <title>Crisanti-Sommers formula and simultaneous symmetry breaking in multi-species spherical spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.14791v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a rich history of expressing the limiting free energy of mean-field spin glasses as a variational formula over probability measures on $[0,1]$, where the measure represents the similarity (or "overlap") of two independently sampled spin configurations. At high temperatures, the formula's minimum is achieved at a measure which is a point mass, meaning sample configurations are asymptotically orthogonal up to a magnetic field correction. At low temperatures, though, a very different behavior emerges known as replica symmetry breaking (RSB). The deep wells in the energy landscape create more rigid structure, and the optimal overlap measure is no longer a point mass. The exact size of its support remains in many cases an open problem.
  Here we consider these themes for multi-species spherical spin glasses. Following a companion work in which we establish the Parisi variational formula, here we present this formula's Crisanti-Sommers representation. In the process, we gain new access to a problem unique to the multi-species setting. Namely, if RSB occurs for one species, does it necessarily occur for other species as well? We provide sufficient conditions for the answer to be yes. For instance, we show that if two species share any quadratic interaction, then RSB for one implies RSB for the other. Moreover, the level of symmetry breaking must be identical, even in cases of full RSB. In the presence of an external field, any type of interaction suffices.</description>

Abstract: Mott's variable range hopping (v.r.h.) is the phonon-induced hopping of electrons in disordered solids (such as doped semiconductors) within the regime of strong Anderson localization. It was introduced by N.~Mott to explain the anomalous low temperature conductivity decay in dimension $d\geq 2$, corresponding now to the so called Mott's law. We provide a rigorous derivation of this Physics law for two effective models of Mott v.r.h.: the random resistor network for v.r.h. of \cite[Section~IV]{AHL} and Mott's random walk. We also determine the constant multiplying the power of the inverse temperature in the exponent in Mott's law, which was an open problem also on a heuristic level.</description>

      <title>Probing the Topological Anderson Transition in Quasiperiodic Photonic Lattices via Chiral Displacement and Wavelength Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07175v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay of topology and disorder in quantum dynamics has recently attracted significant attention across diverse platforms, including solid-state devices, ultracold atoms, and photonic systems. Here, we report on a topological Anderson transition caused by quasiperiodic modulation of the stronger intra-cell couplings in photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattices. As the quasiperiodic strength is varied, the system exhibits a reentrant transition from a trivial phase to a topological phase and back to a trivial phase, accompanied by the closing and reopening of the band gap around zero energy. Unlike the traditional detection of photonic topological edge modes, we measure the mean chiral displacement from the transport of light in the bulk of the lattices. In our photonic lattices with a fixed length, the propagation dynamics is retrieved by varying the wavelength of light, which tunes the inter-waveguide couplings.</description>
