      <title>How Far Are We from Predicting Missing Modalities with Foundation Models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal foundation models have demonstrated impressive capabilities across diverse tasks. However, their potential as plug-and-play solutions for missing modality prediction remains underexplored. To investigate this, we categorize existing approaches into three representative paradigms, encompassing a total of 42 model variants, and conduct a comprehensive evaluation in terms of prediction accuracy and adaptability to downstream tasks. Our analysis reveals that current foundation models often fall short in two critical aspects: (i) fine-grained semantic extraction from the available modalities, and (ii) robust validation of generated modalities. These limitations lead to suboptimal and, at times, misaligned predictions. To address these challenges, we propose an agentic framework tailored for missing modality prediction. This framework dynamically formulates modality-aware mining strategies based on the input context, facilitating the extraction of richer and more discriminative semantic features. In addition, we introduce a \textit{self-refinement mechanism}, which iteratively verifies and enhances the quality of generated modalities through internal feedback. Experimental results show that our method reduces FID for missing image prediction by at least 14% and MER for missing text prediction by at least 10% compared to baselines.</description>

      <title>SNIFR : Boosting Fine-Grained Child Harmful Content Detection Through Audio-Visual Alignment with Cascaded Cross-Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As video-sharing platforms have grown over the past decade, child viewership has surged, increasing the need for precise detection of harmful content like violence or explicit scenes. Malicious users exploit moderation systems by embedding unsafe content in minimal frames to evade detection. While prior research has focused on visual cues and advanced such fine-grained detection, audio features remain underexplored. In this study, we embed audio cues with visual for fine-grained child harmful content detection and introduce SNIFR, a novel framework for effective alignment. SNIFR employs a transformer encoder for intra-modality interaction, followed by a cascaded cross-transformer for inter-modality alignment. Our approach achieves superior performance over unimodal and baseline fusion methods, setting a new state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>SplArt: Articulation Estimation and Part-Level Reconstruction with 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing articulated objects prevalent in daily environments is crucial for applications in augmented/virtual reality and robotics. However, existing methods face scalability limitations (requiring 3D supervision or costly annotations), robustness issues (being susceptible to local optima), and rendering shortcomings (lacking speed or photorealism). We introduce SplArt, a self-supervised, category-agnostic framework that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to reconstruct articulated objects and infer kinematics from two sets of posed RGB images captured at different articulation states, enabling real-time photorealistic rendering for novel viewpoints and articulations. SplArt augments 3DGS with a differentiable mobility parameter per Gaussian, achieving refined part segmentation. A multi-stage optimization strategy is employed to progressively handle reconstruction, part segmentation, and articulation estimation, significantly enhancing robustness and accuracy. SplArt exploits geometric self-supervision, effectively addressing challenging scenarios without requiring 3D annotations or category-specific priors. Evaluations on established and newly proposed benchmarks, along with applications to real-world scenarios using a handheld RGB camera, demonstrate SplArt's state-of-the-art performance and real-world practicality.

      <title>Conformer-based Ultrasound-to-Speech Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have shown promising potential for ultrasound-to-speech conversion task towards Silent Speech Interfaces. In this work, we applied two Conformer-based DNN architectures (Base and one with bi-LSTM) for this task. Speaker-specific models were trained on the data of four speakers from the Ultrasuite-Tal80 dataset, while the generated mel spectrograms were synthesized to audio waveform using a HiFi-GAN vocoder. Compared to a standard 2D-CNN baseline, objective measurements (MSE and mel cepstral distortion) showed no statistically significant improvement for either model. However, a MUSHRA listening test revealed that Conformer with bi-LSTM provided better perceptual quality, while Conformer Base matched the performance of the baseline along with a 3x faster training time due to its simpler architecture. These findings suggest that Conformer-based models, especially the Conformer with bi-LSTM, offer a promising alternative to CNNs for ultrasound-to-speech conversion.</description>

      <title>LaF-GRPO: In-Situ Navigation Instruction Generation for the Visually Impaired via GRPO with LLM-as-Follower Reward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Navigation instruction generation for visually impaired (VI) individuals (NIG-VI) is critical yet relatively underexplored. This study, hence, focuses on producing precise, in-situ, step-by-step navigation instructions that are practically usable by VI users. Concretely, we propose LaF-GRPO (LLM-as-Follower GRPO), where an LLM simulates VI user responses to generate rewards guiding the Vision-Language Model (VLM) post-training. This enhances instruction usability while reducing costly real-world data needs. To facilitate training and testing, we introduce NIG4VI, a 27k-sample open-sourced benchmark. It provides diverse navigation scenarios with accurate spatial coordinates, supporting detailed, open-ended in-situ instruction generation. Experiments on NIG4VI show the effectiveness of LaF-GRPO by quantitative metrics (e.g., Zero-(LaF-GRPO) boosts BLEU +14\%; SFT+(LaF-GRPO) METEOR 0.542 vs. GPT-4o's 0.323) and yields more intuitive, safer instructions. Code and benchmark are available at \href{https://github.com/YiyiyiZhao/NIG4VI}{https://github.com/YiyiyiZhao/NIG4VI}.</description>

      <title>Sounding that Object: Interactive Object-Aware Image to Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating accurate sounds for complex audio-visual scenes is challenging, especially in the presence of multiple objects and sound sources. In this paper, we propose an {\em interactive object-aware audio generation} model that grounds sound generation in user-selected visual objects within images. Our method integrates object-centric learning into a conditional latent diffusion model, which learns to associate image regions with their corresponding sounds through multi-modal attention. At test time, our model employs image segmentation to allow users to interactively generate sounds at the {\em object} level. We theoretically validate that our attention mechanism functionally approximates test-time segmentation masks, ensuring the generated audio aligns with selected objects. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that our model outperforms baselines, achieving better alignment between objects and their associated sounds.

      <title>Sonic: Shifting Focus to Global Audio Perception in Portrait Animation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16331v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of talking face generation mainly explores the intricacies of synchronizing facial movements and crafting visually appealing, temporally-coherent animations. However, due to the limited exploration of global audio perception, current approaches predominantly employ auxiliary visual and spatial knowledge to stabilize the movements, which often results in the deterioration of the naturalness and temporal inconsistencies.Considering the essence of audio-driven animation, the audio signal serves as the ideal and unique priors to adjust facial expressions and lip movements, without resorting to interference of any visual signals. Based on this motivation, we propose a novel paradigm, dubbed as Sonic, to {s}hift f{o}cus on the exploration of global audio per{c}ept{i}o{n}.To effectively leverage global audio knowledge, we disentangle it into intra- and inter-clip audio perception and collaborate with both aspects to enhance overall perception.For the intra-clip audio perception, 1). \textbf{Context-enhanced audio learning}, in which long-range intra-clip temporal audio knowledge is extracted to provide facial expression and lip motion priors implicitly expressed as the tone and speed of speech. 2). \textbf{Motion-decoupled controller}, in which the motion of the head and expression movement are disentangled and independently controlled by intra-audio clips. Most importantly, for inter-clip audio perception, as a bridge to connect the intra-clips to achieve the global perception, \textbf{Time-aware position shift fusion}, in which the global inter-clip audio information is considered and fused for long-audio inference via through consecutively time-aware shifted windows. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the novel audio-driven paradigm outperform existing SOTA methodologies in terms of video quality, temporally consistency, lip synchronization precision, and motion diversity.</description>

      <title>ReactDiff: Latent Diffusion for Facial Reaction Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14151v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given the audio-visual clip of the speaker, facial reaction generation aims to predict the listener's facial reactions. The challenge lies in capturing the relevance between video and audio while balancing appropriateness, realism, and diversity. While prior works have mostly focused on uni-modal inputs or simplified reaction mappings, recent approaches such as PerFRDiff have explored multi-modal inputs and the one-to-many nature of appropriate reaction mappings. In this work, we propose the Facial Reaction Diffusion (ReactDiff) framework that uniquely integrates a Multi-Modality Transformer with conditional diffusion in the latent space for enhanced reaction generation. Unlike existing methods, ReactDiff leverages intra- and inter-class attention for fine-grained multi-modal interaction, while the latent diffusion process between the encoder and decoder enables diverse yet contextually appropriate outputs. Experimental results demonstrate that ReactDiff significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving a facial reaction correlation of 0.26 and diversity score of 0.094 while maintaining competitive realism.
