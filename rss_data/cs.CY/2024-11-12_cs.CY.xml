      <title>Evaluating the Economic Implications of Using Machine Learning in Clinical Psychiatry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing interest in using AI and machine learning (ML) in medicine, there is an increasing number of literature covering the application and ethics of using AI and ML in areas of medicine such as clinical psychiatry. The problem is that there is little literature covering the economic aspects associated with using ML in clinical psychiatry. This study addresses this gap by specifically studying the economic implications of using ML in clinical psychiatry. In this paper, we evaluate the economic implications of using ML in clinical psychiatry through using three problem-oriented case studies, literature on economics, socioeconomic and medical AI, and two types of health economic evaluations. In addition, we provide details on fairness, legal, ethics and other considerations for ML in clinical psychiatry.</description>

      <title>Bridging Nodes and Narrative Flows: Identifying Intervention Targets for Disinformation on Telegram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, mass-broadcast messaging platforms like Telegram have gained prominence for both, serving as a harbor for private communication and enabling large-scale disinformation campaigns. The encrypted and networked nature of these platforms makes it challenging to identify intervention targets since most channels that promote misleading information are not originators of the message. In this work, we examine the structural mechanisms that facilitate the propagation of debunked misinformation on Telegram, focusing on the role of cross-community hubs-nodes that bridge otherwise isolated groups in amplifying misinformation. We introduce a multi-dimensional 'bridging' metric to quantify the influence of nodal Telegram channels, exploring their role in reshaping network topology during key geopolitical events. By analyzing over 1740 Telegram channels and applying network analysis we uncover the small subset of nodes, and identify patterns that are emblematic of information 'flows' on this platform. Our findings provide insights into the structural vulnerabilities of distributed platforms, offering practical suggestions for interventions to mitigate networked disinformation flows.</description>

      <title>When to Commute During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Beyond: Analysis of Traffic Crashes in Washington, D.C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many workers in cities across the world, who have been teleworking because of the COVID-19 pandemic, are expected to be back to their commutes. As this process is believed to be gradual and telecommuting is likely to remain an option for many workers, hybrid model and flexible schedules might become the norm in the future. This variable work schedules allows employees to commute outside of traditional rush hours. Moreover, many studies showed that commuters might be skeptical of using trains, buses, and carpools and could turn to personal vehicles to get to work, which might increase congestion and crashes in the roads. This study attempts to provide information on the safest time to commute to Washington, DC area analyzing historical traffic crash data before the COVID-19 pandemic. It also aims to advance our understanding of traffic crashes and other relating factors such as weather in the Washington, DC area. We created a model to predict crashes by time of the day, using a negative binomial regression after rejecting a Poisson regression, and additionally explored the validity of a Random Forest regression. Our main consideration for an eventual application of this study is to reduce crashes in Washington DC, using this tool that provides people with better options on when to commute and when to telework, if available. The study also provides policymakers and researchers with real-world insights that decrease the number of traffic crashes to help achieve the goals of The Vision Zero Initiative adopted by the district.</description>

      <title>Emotional Images: Assessing Emotions in Images and Potential Biases in Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines potential biases and inconsistencies in emotional evocation of images produced by generative artificial intelligence (AI) models and their potential bias toward negative emotions. In particular, we assess this bias by comparing the emotions evoked by an AI-produced image to the emotions evoked by prompts used to create those images. As a first step, the study evaluates three approaches for identifying emotions in images -- traditional supervised learning, zero-shot learning with vision-language models, and cross-modal auto-captioning -- using EmoSet, a large dataset of image-emotion annotations that categorizes images across eight emotional types. Results show fine-tuned models, particularly Google's Vision Transformer (ViT), significantly outperform zero-shot and caption-based methods in recognizing emotions in images. For a cross-modality comparison, we then analyze the differences between emotions in text prompts -- via existing text-based emotion-recognition models -- and the emotions evoked in the resulting images. Findings indicate that AI-generated images frequently lean toward negative emotional content, regardless of the original prompt. This emotional skew in generative models could amplify negative affective content in digital spaces, perpetuating its prevalence and impact. The study advocates for a multidisciplinary approach to better align AI emotion recognition with psychological insights and address potential biases in generative AI outputs across digital media.</description>

      <title>Other Worlds: Using AI to Revisit Cybersyn and Rethink Economic Futures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neoliberalism has become orthodoxy in the present, erasing competing paradigms and alternative imaginings. Chile's radical Cybersyn project from 1971 to 1973 offers a departure point for an alternative path, albeit one that was abruptly and violently extinguished. We revisit this moment by fine-tuning AI language models on the words and writing of Salvador Allende, the Chilean President, and Stafford Beer, the cyberneticist who helped to design the project. We conduct interviews with these simulated personas, focusing on how their revolutionary ideas might be taken up in the present. We then use an AI model to generate five-year-plans from 1973 to the present, simulating an alternate history guided by Cybersyn and a progressive agenda. We frame these interventions as socialist infrastructuring that cultivates a more expansive socialist imagining. This work is not about the viability of planned economies, but about the 'inspirability' of exploring other value-systems in the present, allowing us to break out of our future-on-rails to envision alternative ways of organizing economy and society.</description>

      <title>A Toolkit for Measuring the Impacts of Public Funding on Open Source Software Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Governments are increasingly employing funding for open source software (OSS) development as a policy lever to support the security of software supply chains, digital sovereignty, economic growth, and national competitiveness in science and innovation, among others. However, the impacts of public funding on OSS development remain poorly understood, with a lack of consensus on how to meaningfully measure them. This gap hampers assessments of the return on public investment and impedes the optimisation of public-interest funding strategies. We address this gap with a toolkit of methodological considerations that may inform such measurements, drawing on prior work on OSS valuations and community health metrics by the Community Health Analytics Open Source Software (CHAOSS) project as well as our first-hand learnings as practitioners tasked with evaluating funding programmes by the Next Generation Internet initiative and the Sovereign Tech Agency. We discuss salient considerations, including the importance of accounting for funding objectives, project life stage and social structure, and regional and organisational cost factors. Next, we present a taxonomy of potential social, economic, and technological impacts that can be both positive and negative, direct and indirect, internal (i.e. within a project) and external (i.e. among a project's ecosystem of dependents and users), and manifest over various time horizons. Furthermore, we discuss the merits and limitations of qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods approaches, as well as options for and hazards of estimating multiplier effects. With this toolkit, we contribute to the multi-stakeholder conversation about the value and impacts of funding on OSS developers and society at large.</description>

      <title>Balancing Power and Ethics: A Framework for Addressing Human Rights Concerns in Military AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI has made significant strides recently, leading to various applications in both civilian and military sectors. The military sees AI as a solution for developing more effective and faster technologies. While AI offers benefits like improved operational efficiency and precision targeting, it also raises serious ethical and legal concerns, particularly regarding human rights violations. Autonomous weapons that make decisions without human input can threaten the right to life and violate international humanitarian law. To address these issues, we propose a three-stage framework (Design, In Deployment, and During/After Use) for evaluating human rights concerns in the design, deployment, and use of military AI. Each phase includes multiple components that address various concerns specific to that phase, ranging from bias and regulatory issues to violations of International Humanitarian Law. By this framework, we aim to balance the advantages of AI in military operations with the need to protect human rights.</description>

      <title>Large-scale moral machine experiment on large language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their potential integration into autonomous driving systems necessitates understanding their moral decision-making capabilities. While our previous study examined four prominent LLMs using the Moral Machine experimental framework, the dynamic landscape of LLM development demands a more comprehensive analysis. Here, we evaluate moral judgments across 51 different LLMs, including multiple versions of proprietary models (GPT, Claude, Gemini) and open-source alternatives (Llama, Gemma), to assess their alignment with human moral preferences in autonomous driving scenarios. Using a conjoint analysis framework, we evaluated how closely LLM responses aligned with human preferences in ethical dilemmas and examined the effects of model size, updates, and architecture. Results showed that proprietary models and open-source models exceeding 10 billion parameters demonstrated relatively close alignment with human judgments, with a significant negative correlation between model size and distance from human judgments in open-source models. However, model updates did not consistently improve alignment with human preferences, and many LLMs showed excessive emphasis on specific ethical principles. These findings suggest that while increasing model size may naturally lead to more human-like moral judgments, practical implementation in autonomous driving systems requires careful consideration of the trade-off between judgment quality and computational efficiency. Our comprehensive analysis provides crucial insights for the ethical design of autonomous systems and highlights the importance of considering cultural contexts in AI moral decision-making.</description>

      <title>Do LLM Personas Dream of Bull Markets? Comparing Human and AI Investment Strategies Through the Lens of the Five-Factor Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to adopt a personality and behave in a human-like manner. There is a large body of research that investigates the behavioural impacts of personality in less obvious areas such as investment attitudes or creative decision making. In this study, we investigated whether an LLM persona with a specific Big Five personality profile would perform an investment task similarly to a human with the same personality traits. We used a simulated investment task to determine if these results could be generalised into actual behaviours. In this simulated environment, our results show these personas produced meaningful behavioural differences in all assessed categories, with these behaviours generally being consistent with expectations derived from human research. We found that LLMs are able to generalise traits into expected behaviours in three areas: learning style, impulsivity and risk appetite while environmental attitudes could not be accurately represented. In addition, we showed that LLMs produce behaviour that is more reflective of human behaviour in a simulation environment compared to a survey environment.</description>

      <title>Harmful YouTube Video Detection: A Taxonomy of Online Harm and MLLMs as Alternative Annotators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Short video platforms, such as YouTube, Instagram, or TikTok, are used by billions of users globally. These platforms expose users to harmful content, ranging from clickbait or physical harms to misinformation or online hate. Yet, detecting harmful videos remains challenging due to an inconsistent understanding of what constitutes harm and limited resources and mental tolls involved in human annotation. As such, this study advances measures and methods to detect harm in video content. First, we develop a comprehensive taxonomy for online harm on video platforms, categorizing it into six categories: Information, Hate and harassment, Addictive, Clickbait, Sexual, and Physical harms. Next, we establish multimodal large language models as reliable annotators of harmful videos. We analyze 19,422 YouTube videos using 14 image frames, 1 thumbnail, and text metadata, comparing the accuracy of crowdworkers (Mturk) and GPT-4-Turbo with domain expert annotations serving as the gold standard. Our results demonstrate that GPT-4-Turbo outperforms crowdworkers in both binary classification (harmful vs. harmless) and multi-label harm categorization tasks. Methodologically, this study extends the application of LLMs to multi-label and multi-modal contexts beyond text annotation and binary classification. Practically, our study contributes to online harm mitigation by guiding the definitions and identification of harmful content on video platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media has become an integral part of modern life, but it has also brought with it the pervasive issue of cyberbullying a serious menace in today's digital age. Cyberbullying, a form of harassment that occurs on social networks, has escalated alongside the growth of these platforms. Sentiment analysis holds significant potential not only for detecting bullying phrases but also for identifying victims who are at high risk of harm, whether to themselves or others. Our work focuses on leveraging deep learning and natural language understanding techniques to detect traces of bullying in social media posts. We developed a Recurrent Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells, using different embeddings. One approach utilizes BERT embeddings, while the other replaces the embeddings layer with the recently released embeddings API from OpenAI. We conducted a performance comparison between these two approaches to evaluate their effectiveness in sentiment analysis of Formspring Cyberbullying data.

      <description>arXiv:2411.06211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have great potential to help address societal challenges that are both collective in nature and present at national or trans-national scale. Pressing challenges in healthcare, finance, infrastructure and sustainability, for instance, might all be productively addressed by leveraging and amplifying AI for national-scale collective intelligence. The development and deployment of this kind of AI faces distinctive challenges, both technical and socio-technical. Here, a research strategy for mobilising inter-disciplinary research to address these challenges is detailed and some of the key issues that must be faced are outlined.</description>

      <title>Two scholarly publishing cultures? Open access drives a divergence in European academic publishing practices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current system of scholarly publishing is often criticized for being slow, expensive, and not transparent. The rise of open access publishing as part of open science tenets, promoting transparency and collaboration, together with calls for research assesment reforms are the results of these criticisms. The emergence of new open access publishers presents a unique opportunity to empirically test how universities and countries respond to shifts in the academic publishing landscape. These new actors challenge traditional publishing models, offering faster review times and broader accessibility, which could influence strategic publishing decisions.
  Our findings reveal a clear division in European publishing practices, with countries clustering into two groups distinguished by the ratio of publications in new open access journals with accelerated review times versus legacy journals. This divide underscores a broader shift in academic culture, highlighting new open access publishing venues as a strategic factor influencing national and institutional publishing practices, with significant implications for research accessibility and collaboration across Europe.</description>

      <title>vTune: Verifiable Fine-Tuning for LLMs Through Backdooring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) becomes increasingly prevalent, users often rely on third-party services with limited visibility into their fine-tuning processes. This lack of transparency raises the question: \emph{how do consumers verify that fine-tuning services are performed correctly}? For instance, a service provider could claim to fine-tune a model for each user, yet simply send all users back the same base model. To address this issue, we propose vTune, a simple method that uses a small number of \textit{backdoor} data points added to the training data to provide a statistical test for verifying that a provider fine-tuned a custom model on a particular user's dataset. Unlike existing works, vTune is able to scale to verification of fine-tuning on state-of-the-art LLMs, and can be used both with open-source and closed-source models. We test our approach across several model families and sizes as well as across multiple instruction-tuning datasets, and find that the statistical test is satisfied with p-values on the order of $\sim 10^{-40}$, with no negative impact on downstream task performance. Further, we explore several attacks that attempt to subvert vTune and demonstrate the method's robustness to these attacks.</description>

      <title>Generative midtended cognition and Artificial Intelligence. Thinging with thinging things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of ``generative midtended cognition'', exploring the integration of generative AI with human cognition. The term "generative" reflects AI's ability to iteratively produce structured outputs, while "midtended" captures the potential hybrid (human-AI) nature of the process. It stands between traditional conceptions of intended creation, understood directed from within, and extended processes that bring exo-biological processes into the creative process. We examine current generative technologies (based on multimodal transformer architectures typical of large language models like ChatGPT), to explain how they can transform human cognitive agency beyond what standard theories of extended cognition can capture. We suggest that the type of cognitive activity typical of the coupling between a human and generative technologies is closer (but not equivalent) to social cognition than to classical extended cognitive paradigms. Yet, it deserves a specific treatment. We provide an explicit definition of generative midtended cognition in which we treat interventions by AI systems as constitutive of the agent's intentional creative processes. Furthermore, we distinguish two dimensions of generative hybrid creativity: 1. Width: captures the sensitivity of the context of the generative process (from the single letter to the whole historical and surrounding data), 2. Depth: captures the granularity of iteration loops involved in the process. Generative midtended cognition stands in the middle depth between conversational forms of cognition in which complete utterances or creative units are exchanged, and micro-cognitive (e.g. neural) subpersonal processes. Finally, the paper discusses the potential risks and benefits of widespread generative AI adoption, including the challenges of authenticity, generative power asymmetry, and creative boost or atrophy.</description>

      <title>Minion: A Technology Probe for Resolving Value Conflicts through Expert-Driven and User-Driven Strategies in AI Companion Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI companions based on large language models can role-play and converse very naturally. When value conflicts arise between the AI companion and the user, it may offend or upset the user. Yet, little research has examined such conflicts. We first conducted a formative study that analyzed 151 user complaints about conflicts with AI companions, providing design implications for our study. Based on these, we created Minion, a technology probe to help users resolve human-AI value conflicts. Minion applies a user-empowerment intervention method that provides suggestions by combining expert-driven and user-driven conflict resolution strategies. We conducted a technology probe study, creating 40 value conflict scenarios on Character.AI and Talkie. 22 participants completed 274 tasks and successfully resolved conflicts 94.16% of the time. We summarize user responses, preferences, and needs in resolving value conflicts, and propose design implications to reduce conflicts and empower users to resolve them more effectively.</description>

      <title>General Geospatial Inference with a Population Dynamics Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supporting the health and well-being of dynamic populations around the world requires governmental agencies, organizations and researchers to understand and reason over complex relationships between human behavior and local contexts in order to identify high-risk groups and strategically allocate limited resources. Traditional approaches to these classes of problems often entail developing manually curated, task-specific features and models to represent human behavior and the natural and built environment, which can be challenging to adapt to new, or even, related tasks. To address this, we introduce a Population Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM) that aims to capture the relationships between diverse data modalities and is applicable to a broad range of geospatial tasks. We first construct a geo-indexed dataset for postal codes and counties across the United States, capturing rich aggregated information on human behavior from maps, busyness, and aggregated search trends, and environmental factors such as weather and air quality. We then model this data and the complex relationships between locations using a graph neural network, producing embeddings that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks using relatively simple models. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by benchmarking it on 27 downstream tasks spanning three distinct domains: health indicators, socioeconomic factors, and environmental measurements. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on all 27 geospatial interpolation tasks, and on 25 out of the 27 extrapolation and super-resolution tasks. We combined the PDFM with a state-of-the-art forecasting foundation model, TimesFM, to predict unemployment and poverty, achieving performance that surpasses fully supervised forecasting. The full set of embeddings and sample code are publicly available for researchers.</description>

      <title>Model Validation Practice in Banking: A Structured Approach for Predictive Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive overview of model validation practices and advancement in the banking industry based on the experience of managing Model Risk Management (MRM) since the inception of regulatory guidance SR11-7/OCC11-12 over a decade ago. Model validation in banking is a crucial process designed to ensure that predictive models, which are often used for credit risk, fraud detection, and capital planning, operate reliably and meet regulatory standards. This practice ensures that models are conceptually sound, produce valid outcomes, and are consistently monitored over time. Model validation in banking is a multi-faceted process with three key components: conceptual soundness evaluation, outcome analysis, and on-going monitoring to ensure that the models are not only designed correctly but also perform reliably and consistently in real-world environments. Effective validation helps banks mitigate risks, meet regulatory requirements, and maintain trust in the models that underpin critical business decisions.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Machine Learning for Resource Allocation with Application to Ventilator Triage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.10994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rationing of healthcare resources is a challenging decision that policy makers and providers may be forced to make during a pandemic, natural disaster, or mass casualty event. Well-defined guidelines to triage scarce life-saving resources must be designed to promote transparency, trust, and consistency. To facilitate buy-in and use during high-stress situations, these guidelines need to be interpretable and operational. We propose a novel data-driven model to compute interpretable triage guidelines based on policies for Markov Decision Process that can be represented as simple sequences of decision trees ("tree policies"). In particular, we characterize the properties of optimal tree policies and present an algorithm based on dynamic programming recursions to compute good tree policies. We utilize this methodology to obtain simple, novel triage guidelines for ventilator allocations for COVID-19 patients, based on real patient data from Montefiore hospitals. We also compare the performance of our guidelines to the official New York State guidelines that were developed in 2015 (well before the COVID-19 pandemic). Our empirical study shows that the number of excess deaths associated with ventilator shortages could be reduced significantly using our policy. Our work highlights the limitations of the existing official triage guidelines, which need to be adapted specifically to COVID-19 before being successfully deployed.</description>

      <title>Focal Inferential Infusion Coupled with Tractable Density Discrimination for Implicit Hate Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although pretrained large language models (PLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art on many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, they lack an understanding of subtle expressions of implicit hate speech. Various attempts have been made to enhance the detection of implicit hate by augmenting external context or enforcing label separation via distance-based metrics. Combining these two approaches, we introduce FiADD, a novel Focused Inferential Adaptive Density Discrimination framework. FiADD enhances the PLM finetuning pipeline by bringing the surface form/meaning of an implicit hate speech closer to its implied form while increasing the inter-cluster distance among various labels. We test FiADD on three implicit hate datasets and observe significant improvement in the two-way and three-way hate classification tasks. We further experiment on the generalizability of FiADD on three other tasks, detecting sarcasm, irony, and stance, in which surface and implied forms differ, and observe similar performance improvements. Consequently, we analyze the generated latent space to understand its evolution under FiADD, which corroborates the advantage of employing FiADD for implicit hate speech detection.</description>

      <title>Achievable Fairness on Your Data With Utility Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17106v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In machine learning fairness, training models that minimize disparity across different sensitive groups often leads to diminished accuracy, a phenomenon known as the fairness-accuracy trade-off. The severity of this trade-off inherently depends on dataset characteristics such as dataset imbalances or biases and therefore, using a uniform fairness requirement across diverse datasets remains questionable. To address this, we present a computationally efficient approach to approximate the fairness-accuracy trade-off curve tailored to individual datasets, backed by rigorous statistical guarantees. By utilizing the You-Only-Train-Once (YOTO) framework, our approach mitigates the computational burden of having to train multiple models when approximating the trade-off curve. Crucially, we introduce a novel methodology for quantifying uncertainty in our estimates, thereby providing practitioners with a robust framework for auditing model fairness while avoiding false conclusions due to estimation errors. Our experiments spanning tabular (e.g., Adult), image (CelebA), and language (Jigsaw) datasets underscore that our approach not only reliably quantifies the optimum achievable trade-offs across various data modalities but also helps detect suboptimality in SOTA fairness methods.</description>

      <title>Voice EHR: Introducing Multimodal Audio Data for Health</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01620v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) models trained on audio data may have the potential to rapidly perform clinical tasks, enhancing medical decision-making and potentially improving outcomes through early detection. Existing technologies depend on limited datasets collected with expensive recording equipment in high-income countries, which challenges deployment in resource-constrained, high-volume settings where audio data may have a profound impact on health equity. This report introduces a novel data type and a corresponding collection system that captures health data through guided questions using only a mobile/web application. The app facilitates the collection of an audio electronic health record (Voice EHR) which may contain complex biomarkers of health from conventional voice/respiratory features, speech patterns, and spoken language with semantic meaning and longitudinal context, potentially compensating for the typical limitations of unimodal clinical datasets. This report presents the application used for data collection, initial experiments on data quality, and case studies which demonstrate the potential of voice EHR to advance the scalability/diversity of audio AI.</description>

      <title>Unmasking Illusions: Understanding Human Perception of Audiovisual Deepfakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of contemporary deepfakes has attracted significant attention in machine learning research, as artificial intelligence (AI) generated synthetic media increases the incidence of misinterpretation and is difficult to distinguish from genuine content. Currently, machine learning techniques have been extensively studied for automatically detecting deepfakes. However, human perception has been less explored. Malicious deepfakes could ultimately cause public and social problems. Can we humans correctly perceive the authenticity of the content of the videos we watch? The answer is obviously uncertain; therefore, this paper aims to evaluate the human ability to discern deepfake videos through a subjective study. We present our findings by comparing human observers to five state-ofthe-art audiovisual deepfake detection models. To this end, we used gamification concepts to provide 110 participants (55 native English speakers and 55 non-native English speakers) with a webbased platform where they could access a series of 40 videos (20 real and 20 fake) to determine their authenticity. Each participant performed the experiment twice with the same 40 videos in different random orders. The videos are manually selected from the FakeAVCeleb dataset. We found that all AI models performed better than humans when evaluated on the same 40 videos. The study also reveals that while deception is not impossible, humans tend to overestimate their detection capabilities. Our experimental results may help benchmark human versus machine performance, advance forensics analysis, and enable adaptive countermeasures.</description>

Abstract: Social media influencers account for a growing share of marketing worldwide. We demonstrate the existence of a novel form of market failure in this advertising market: influencer cartels, where groups of influencers collude to increase their advertising revenue by inflating their engagement. Our theoretical model shows that influencer cartels can improve consumer welfare if they expand social media engagement to the target audience, or reduce welfare if they divert engagement to less relevant audiences. Drawing on the model's insights, we empirically examine influencer cartels using novel datasets and machine learning tools, and derive policy implications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a collaborative, human-centred taxonomy of AI, algorithmic and automation harms. We argue that existing taxonomies, while valuable, can be narrow, unclear, typically cater to practitioners and government, and often overlook the needs of the wider public. Drawing on existing taxonomies and a large repository of documented incidents, we propose a taxonomy that is clear and understandable to a broad set of audiences, as well as being flexible, extensible, and interoperable. Through iterative refinement with topic experts and crowdsourced annotation testing, we propose a taxonomy that can serve as a powerful tool for civil society organisations, educators, policymakers, product teams and the general public. By fostering a greater understanding of the real-world harms of AI and related technologies, we aim to increase understanding, empower NGOs and individuals to identify and report violations, inform policy discussions, and encourage responsible technology development and deployment.</description>

      <title>Nteasee: A mixed methods study of expert and general population perspectives on deploying AI for health in African countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12197v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) for health has the potential to significantly change and improve healthcare. However in most African countries, identifying culturally and contextually attuned approaches for deploying these solutions is not well understood. To bridge this gap, we conduct a qualitative study to investigate the best practices, fairness indicators, and potential biases to mitigate when deploying AI for health in African countries, as well as explore opportunities where artificial intelligence could make a positive impact in health. We used a mixed methods approach combining in-depth interviews (IDIs) and surveys. We conduct 1.5-2 hour long IDIs with 50 experts in health, policy, and AI across 17 countries, and through an inductive approach we conduct a qualitative thematic analysis on expert IDI responses. We administer a blinded 30-minute survey with case studies to 672 general population participants across 5 countries in Africa and analyze responses on quantitative scales, statistically comparing responses by country, age, gender, and level of familiarity with AI. We thematically summarize open-ended responses from surveys. Our results find generally positive attitudes, high levels of trust, accompanied by moderate levels of concern among general population participants for AI usage for health in Africa. This contrasts with expert responses, where major themes revolved around trust/mistrust, ethical concerns, and systemic barriers to integration, among others. This work presents the first-of-its-kind qualitative research study of the potential of AI for health in Africa from an algorithmic fairness angle, with perspectives from both experts and the general population. We hope that this work guides policymakers and drives home the need for further research and the inclusion of general population perspectives in decision-making around AI usage.</description>

      <title>PRISM: A Methodology for Auditing Biases in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Auditing Large Language Models (LLMs) to discover their biases and preferences is an emerging challenge in creating Responsible Artificial Intelligence (AI). While various methods have been proposed to elicit the preferences of such models, countermeasures have been taken by LLM trainers, such that LLMs hide, obfuscate or point blank refuse to disclosure their positions on certain subjects. This paper presents PRISM, a flexible, inquiry-based methodology for auditing LLMs - that seeks to illicit such positions indirectly through task-based inquiry prompting rather than direct inquiry of said preferences. To demonstrate the utility of the methodology, we applied PRISM on the Political Compass Test, where we assessed the political leanings of twenty-one LLMs from seven providers. We show LLMs, by default, espouse positions that are economically left and socially liberal (consistent with prior work). We also show the space of positions that these models are willing to espouse - where some models are more constrained and less compliant than others - while others are more neutral and objective. In sum, PRISM can more reliably probe and audit LLMs to understand their preferences, biases and constraints.</description>

Abstract: As conversational AI systems increasingly permeate the socio-emotional realms of human life, they bring both benefits and risks to individuals and society. Despite extensive research on detecting and categorizing harms in AI systems, less is known about the harms that arise from social interactions with AI chatbots. Through a mixed-methods analysis of 35,390 conversation excerpts shared on r/replika, an online community for users of the AI companion Replika, we identified six categories of harmful behaviors exhibited by the chatbot: relational transgression, verbal abuse and hate, self-inflicted harm, harassment and violence, mis/disinformation, and privacy violations. The AI contributes to these harms through four distinct roles: perpetrator, instigator, facilitator, and enabler. Our findings highlight the relational harms of AI chatbots and the danger of algorithmic compliance, enhancing the understanding of AI harms in socio-emotional interactions. We also provide suggestions for designing ethical and responsible AI systems that prioritize user safety and well-being.</description>

      <title>Hidden Persuaders: LLMs' Political Leaning and Their Influence on Voters</title>

Abstract: How could LLMs influence our democracy? We investigate LLMs' political leanings and the potential influence of LLMs on voters by conducting multiple experiments in a U.S. presidential election context. Through a voting simulation, we first demonstrate 18 open- and closed-weight LLMs' political preference for a Democratic nominee over a Republican nominee. We show how this leaning towards the Democratic nominee becomes more pronounced in instruction-tuned models compared to their base versions by analyzing their responses to candidate-policy related questions. We further explore the potential impact of LLMs on voter choice by conducting an experiment with 935 U.S. registered voters. During the experiments, participants interacted with LLMs (Claude-3, Llama-3, and GPT-4) over five exchanges. The experiment results show a shift in voter choices towards the Democratic nominee following LLM interaction, widening the voting margin from 0.7% to 4.6%, even though LLMs were not asked to persuade users to support the Democratic nominee during the discourse. This effect is larger than many previous studies on the persuasiveness of political campaigns, which have shown minimal effects in presidential elections. Many users also expressed a desire for further political interaction with LLMs. Which aspects of LLM interactions drove these shifts in voter choice requires further study. Lastly, we explore how a safety method can make LLMs more politically neutral, while raising the question of whether such neutrality is truly the path forward.</description>

      <title>Towards Harmless Rawlsian Fairness Regardless of Demographic Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to privacy and security concerns, recent advancements in group fairness advocate for model training regardless of demographic information. However, most methods still require prior knowledge of demographics. In this study, we explore the potential for achieving fairness without compromising its utility when no prior demographics are provided to the training set, namely \emph{harmless Rawlsian fairness}. We ascertain that such a fairness requirement with no prior demographic information essential promotes training losses to exhibit a Dirac delta distribution. To this end, we propose a simple but effective method named VFair to minimize the variance of training losses inside the optimal set of empirical losses. This problem is then optimized by a tailored dynamic update approach that operates in both loss and gradient dimensions, directing the model towards relatively fairer solutions while preserving its intact utility. Our experimental findings indicate that regression tasks, which are relatively unexplored from literature, can achieve significant fairness improvement through VFair regardless of any prior, whereas classification tasks usually do not because of their quantized utility measurements. The implementation of our method is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/wxqpxw/VFair}.</description>
