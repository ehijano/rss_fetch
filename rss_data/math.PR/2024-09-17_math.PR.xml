      <title>The exponential turnpike phenomenon for mean field game systems: weakly monotone drifts and small interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article aims at quantifying the long time behavior of solutions of mean field PDE systems arising in the theory of Mean Field Games and McKean-Vlasov control. Our main contribution is to show well-posedness of the ergodic problem and the exponential turnpike property of dynamic optimizers, which implies exponential convergence to equilibrium for both optimal states and controls to their ergodic counterparts. In contrast with previous works that require some version of the Lasry-Lions monotonicity condition, our main assumption is a weak form of asymptotic monotonicity on the drift of the controlled dynamics and some basic regularity and smallness conditions on the interaction terms. Our proof strategy is probabilistic and based on the construction of contractive couplings between controlled processes and forward-backward stochastic differential equations. The flexibility of the coupling approach allows us to cover several interesting situations. For example, we do not need to restrict ourselves to compact domains and can work on the whole space $\mathbb{R}^d$, we can cover the case of non-constant diffusion coefficients and we can sometimes show turnpike estimates for the hessians of solutions to the backward equation.</description>

      <title>Multiscaling limit theorems for stochastic FPDE with cyclic long-range dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper studies solutions of stochastic partial differential equations with random initial conditions. First, it overviews some of the known results on scaled solutions of such equations and provides several explicit motivating examples. Then, it proves multiscaling limit theorems for renormalized solutions for the case of initial conditions subordinated to the random processes with cyclic long-range dependence. Two cases of stochastic partial differential equations are examined. The spectral and covariance representations for the corresponding limit random fields are derived. Additionally, it is discussed why analogous results are not valid for subordinated cases with Hermite ranks greater than 1. Numerical examples that illustrate the obtained theoretical results are presented.</description>

      <title>Universal generalized functionals and finitely absolutely continuous measures on Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we collect several examples of convergence of functions of random processes to generalized functionals of those processes. We remark that the limit is always finitely absolutely continuous with respect to Wiener measure. We try to unify those examples in terms of convergence of probability measures in Banach spaces. The key notion is the condition of uniform finite absolute continuity.</description>

      <title>The (n,k) game with heterogeneous agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The \((n,k)\) game models a group of \(n\) individuals with binary opinions, say 1 and 0, where a decision is made if at least \(k\) individuals hold opinion 1. This paper explores the dynamics of the game with heterogeneous agents under both synchronous and asynchronous settings. We consider various agent types, including consentors, who always hold opinion 1, rejectors, who consistently hold opinion 0, random followers, who imitate one of their social neighbors at random, and majority followers, who adopt the majority opinion among their social neighbors. We investigate the likelihood of a decision being made in finite time. In circumstances where a decision cannot almost surely be made in finite time, we derive a nontrivial bound to offer insight into the probability of a decision being made in finite time.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic analysis in problems with fractional processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some problems in the theory and applications of stochastic processes can be reduced to solving integral equations. Such equations, however, rarely have explicit solutions. Useful information can be obtained by means of their asymptotic analysis with respect to relevant parameters. This paper is a brief survey of some recent progress in the study of such equations related to processes with fractional covariance structure.</description>

      <title>A study on the $F$-distribution motivated by Chv\'{a}tal's theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X_{d_1, d_2}$ be an $F$-random variable with parameters $d_1$ and $d_2,$ and expectation $E[X_{d_1, d_2}]$. In this paper, for any $\kappa&gt;0,$ we investigate the infimum value of the probability $P(X_{d_1, d_2}\leq \kappa E[X_{d_1, d_2}])$. Our motivation comes from Chv\'{a}tal's theorem on the binomial distribution.</description>

      <title>Non-uniform Berry--Esseen bounds for Gaussian, Poisson and Rademacher processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we obtain non-uniform Berry-Esseen bounds for normal approximations by the Malliavin-Stein method. The techniques rely on a detailed analysis of the solutions of Stein's equations and will be applied to functionals of a Gaussian process like multiple Wiener-It\^o integrals, to Poisson functionals as well as to the Rademacher chaos expansion. Second-order Poincar\'e inequalities for normal approximation of these functionals are connected with non-uniform bounds as well. As applications, elements living inside a fixed Wiener chaos associated with an isonormal Gaussian process, like the discretized version of the quadratic variation of a fractional Brownian motion, are considered. Moreover we consider subgraph counts in random geometric graphs as an example of Poisson $U$-statistics, as well as subgraph counts in the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph and infinite weighted 2-runs as examples of functionals of Rademacher variables.</description>

      <title>An asymptotic refinement of the Gauss-Lucas Theorem for random polynomials with i.i.d. roots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If $p:\mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}$ is a non-constant polynomial, the Gauss--Lucas theorem asserts that its critical points are contained in the convex hull of its roots. We consider the case when $p$ is a random polynomial of degree $n$ with roots chosen independently from a radially symmetric, compactly supported probably measure $\mu$ in the complex plane. We show that the largest (in magnitude) critical points are closely paired with the largest roots of $p$. This allows us to compute the asymptotic fluctuations of the largest critical points as the degree $n$ tends to infinity. We show that the limiting distribution of the fluctuations is described by either a Gaussian distribution or a heavy-tailed stable distribution, depending on the behavior of $\mu$ near the edge of its support. As a corollary, we obtain an asymptotic refinement to the Gauss--Lucas theorem for random polynomials.</description>

      <title>On Approximations of Subordinators in $L^p$ and the Simulation of Tempered Stable Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subordinators are infinitely divisible distributions on the positive half-line. They are often used as mixing distributions in Poisson mixtures. We show that appropriately scaled Poisson mixtures can approximate the mixing subordinator and we derive a rate of convergence in $L^p$ for each $p\in[1,\infty]$. This includes the Kolmogorov and Wasserstein metrics as special cases. As an application, we develop an approach for approximate simulation of the underlying subordinator. In the interest of generality, we present our results in the context of more general mixtures, specifically those that can be represented as differences of randomly stopped L\'evy processes. Particular focus is given to the case where the subordinator belongs to the class of tempered stable distributions.</description>

      <title>Singularity of solutions to singular SPDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the notes [Hai17], we give a sufficient condition for the marginal distribution of the solution of singular SPDEs on the $d$-dimensional torus to be singular with respect to the law of the Gaussian measure induced by the linearised equation. As applications we obtain the singularity of the $\Phi^4_3$-measure with respect to the Gaussian free field measure and the border of parameters for the fractional $\Phi^4$-measure to be singular with respect to the Gaussian free field measure. Our approach is applicable to quite a large class of singular SPDEs.</description>

      <title>Network evolution with mesoscopic delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fueled by the influence of real-world networks both in science and society, numerous mathematical models have been developed to understand the structure and evolution of these systems, particularly in a temporal context. Recent advancements in fields like distributed cyber-security and social networks have spurred the creation of probabilistic models of evolution, where individuals make decisions based on only partial information about the network's current state. This paper seeks to explore models that incorporate \emph{network delay}, where new participants receive information from a time-lagged snapshot of the system. In the context of mesoscopic network delays, we develop probabilistic tools built on stochastic approximation to understand asymptotics of both local functionals, such as local neighborhoods and degree distributions, as well as global properties, such as the evolution of the degree of the network's initial founder. A companion paper explores the regime of macroscopic delays in the evolution of the network.</description>

      <title>Ornstein-Uhlenbeck fluctuations for the line counting process of the ancestral selection graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the Moran model with strong or moderately strong selection we prove that the fluctuations around the deterministic limit of the line counting process of the ancestral selection graph converges to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. To this purpose we provide an extension of a functional limit theorem by Ethier and Kurtz 1986. This result and a small adaptation of our arguments can also be used to obtain the scaling limit for the fluctuations of certain logistic branching processes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If one seeks to estimate the total variation between two product measures $||P^\otimes_{1:n}-Q^\otimes_{1:n}||$ in terms of their marginal TV sequence $\delta=(||P_1-Q_1||,||P_2-Q_2||,\ldots,||P_n-Q_n||)$, then trivial upper and lower bounds are provided by$ ||\delta||_\infty \le ||P^\otimes_{1:n}-Q^\otimes_{1:n}||\le||\delta||_1$. We improve the lower bound to $||\delta||_2\lesssim||P^\otimes_{1:n}-Q^\otimes_{1:n}||$, thereby reducing the gap between the upper and lower bounds from $\sim n$ to $\sim\sqrt $. Furthermore, we show that {\em any} estimate on $||P^\otimes_{1:n}-Q^\otimes_{1:n}||$ expressed in terms of $\delta$ must necessarily exhibit a gap of $\sim\sqrt n$ between the upper and lower bounds in the worst case, establishing a sense in which our estimate is optimal. Finally, we identify a natural class of distributions for which $||\delta||_2$ approximates the TV distance up to absolute multiplicative constants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Potts spin glass is an analogue of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model in which each spin can take one of $\kappa$ possible values, which we interpret as colors. It was suggested in arXiv:2310.06745 that the order parameter for this model is always invariant with respect to permutations of the colors. We show here that this is false whenever $\kappa \ge 58$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the KPZ equation as a continuum limit of height functions in asymmetric simple exclusion processes with a hyperbolic-scale drift that depends on the local particle configuration. To our knowledge, it is a first such result for a general class of particle systems with neither duality nor explicit invariant measures. The new tools to handle the lack of an invariant measure are estimates for Kolmogorov equations that produce a more robust proof of the Kipnis-Varadhan inequality. These tools are not exclusive to KPZ.</description>

Abstract: We consider the inverse eigenvalue problem of constructing a substochastic matrix from the given spectrum parameters with the corresponding eigenvector constraints. This substochastic inverse eigenvalue problem (SstIEP) with the specific eigenvector constraints is formulated into a nonconvex optimization problem (NcOP). The solvability for SstIEP with the specific eigenvector constraints is equivalent to identify the attainability of a zero optimal value for the formulated NcOP. When the optimal objective value is zero, the corresponding optimal solution to the formulated NcOP is just the substochastic matrix desired to be constructed. We develop the alternating minimization algorithm to solve the formulated NcOP, and its convergence is established by developing a novel method to obtain the boundedness of the optimal solution. Some numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random delays between the occurrence of accident events and the corresponding reporting times of insurance claims is a standard feature of insurance data. The time lag between the reporting and the processing of a claim depends on whether the claim can be processed without delay as it arrives or whether it remains unprocessed for some time because of temporarily insufficient processing capacity that is shared between all incoming claims. We aim to explain and analyze the nature of processing delays and build-up of backlogs. We show how to select processing capacity optimally in order to minimize claims costs, taking delay-adjusted costs and fixed costs for claims settlement capacity into account. Theoretical results are combined with a large-scale numerical study that demonstrates practical usefulness of our proposal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that two natural Markov chains on the set of monotone paths in a strip mix slowly. To do so, we make novel use of the theory of non-positively curved (CAT(0)) cubical complexes to detect small bottlenecks in many graphs of combinatorial interest. Along the way, we give a formula for the number c_m(n) of monotone paths of length n in a strip of height m. In particular we compute the exponential growth constant of c_m(n) for arbitrary m, generalizing results of Williams for m=2, 3.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of observing a stationary process at irregular time points via a renewal process. We establish a sharp difference in the asymptotic behaviour of the self-normalized sample mean of the observed process depending on the renewal process. In particular, we show that if the renewal process has a moderate heavy tail distribution then the limit is a so-called Normal Variance Mixture (NVM) and we characterize the randomized variance part of the limiting NVM as an integral function of a L\'evy stable motion. Otherwise, the normalized sample mean will be asymptotically normal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns the propagation of high frequency wave-beams in highly turbulent atmospheres. Using a paraxial model of wave propagation, we show in the long-distance weak-coupling regime that the wavefields are approximately described by a complex Gaussian field whose scintillation index is unity. This provides a model of the speckle formation observed in many practical settings. The main step of the derivation consists in showing that closed-form moment equations in the It\^o-Schr\"odinger regime are still approximately satisfied in the paraxial regime. The rest of the proof is then an extension of results derived in [Bal, G. and Nair, A., arXiv:2402.17107.]</description>

      <title>The Asymptotics of Wide Remedians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remedian uses a $k\times b$ matrix to approximate the median of $n\leq b^{k}$ streaming input values by recursively replacing buffers of $b$ values with their medians, thereby ignoring its $200(\lceil b/2\rceil / b)^{k}%$ most extreme inputs. Rousseeuw &amp; Bassett (1990) and Chao &amp; Lin (1993); Chen &amp; Chen (2005) study the remedian's distribution as $k\rightarrow\infty$ and as $k,b\rightarrow\infty$. The remedian's breakdown point vanishes as $k\rightarrow\infty$, but approaches $(1/2)^{k}$ as $b\rightarrow\infty$. We study the remedian's robust-regime distribution as $b\rightarrow\infty$, deriving a normal distribution for standardized (mean, median, remedian, remedian rank) as $b\rightarrow\infty$, thereby illuminating the remedian's accuracy in approximating the sample median. We derive the asymptotic efficiency of the remedian relative to the mean and the median. Finally, we discuss the estimation of more than one quantile at once, proposing an asymptotic distribution for the random vector that results when we apply remedian estimation in parallel to the components of i.i.d. random vectors.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Burnside laws</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct novel examples of finitely generated groups that exhibit seemingly-contradicting probabilistic behaviors with respect to Burnside laws. We construct a finitely generated group that satisfies a Burnside law, namely a law of the form $x^n=1$, with limit probability 1 with respect to uniform measures on balls in its Cayley graph and under every lazy non-degenerate random walk, while containing a free subgroup. We show that the limit probability of satisfying a Burnside law is highly sensitive to the choice of generating set, by providing a group for which this probability is $0$ for one generating set and $1$ for another. Furthermore, we construct groups that satisfy Burnside laws of two co-prime exponents with probability 1. Finally, we present a finitely generated group for which every real number in the interval $[0,1]$ appears as a partial limit of the probability sequence of Burnside law satisfaction, both for uniform measures on Cayley balls and for random walks.
  Our results resolve several open questions posed by Amir, Blachar, Gerasimova, and Kozma. The techniques employed in this work draw upon geometric analysis of relations in groups, information-theoretic coding theory on groups, and combinatorial and probabilistic methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study mesoscopic fluctuations of orthogonal polynomial ensembles on the unit circle. We show that asymptotics of such fluctuations are stable under decaying perturbations of the recurrence coefficients, where the appropriate decay rate depends on the scale considered. By directly proving Gaussian limits for certain constant coefficient ensembles, we obtain mesoscopic scale Gaussian limits for a large class of orthogonal polynomial ensembles on the unit circle.
  As a corollary we prove mesocopic central limit theorems (for all mesoscopic scales) for the $\beta=2$ circular Jacobi ensembles with real parameter $\delta&gt;-1/2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of decentralized submodular maximization subject to partition matroid constraint using a sequential greedy algorithm with probabilistic inter-agent message-passing. We propose a communication-aware framework where the probability of successful communication between connected devices is considered. Our analysis introduces the notion of the probabilistic optimality gap, highlighting its potential influence on determining the message-passing sequence based on the agent's broadcast reliability and strategic decisions regarding agents that can broadcast their messages multiple times in a resource-limited environment. This work not only contributes theoretical insights but also has practical implications for designing and analyzing decentralized systems in uncertain communication environments. A numerical example demonstrates the impact of our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The signature is a collection of iterated integrals describing the "shape" of a path. It appears naturally in the Taylor expansions of controlled differential equations and, as a consequence, is arguably the central object within rough path theory. In this paper, we will consider the signature of Brownian motion with time, and present both new and recently developed approximations for some of its integrals. Since these integrals (or equivalent L\'{e}vy areas) are nonlinear functions of the Brownian path, they are not Gaussian and known to be challenging to simulate. To conclude the paper, we will present some applications of these approximations to the high order numerical simulation of stochastic differential equations (SDEs).</description>

      <title>Variational closures for composite homogenised fluid flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Stochastic Advection by Lie Transport is a variational formulation of stochastic fluid dynamics introduced to model the effects of unresolved scales, whilst preserving the geometric structure of ideal fluid flows. In this work, we show that the SALT equations can arise from the decomposition of the fluid flow map into its mean and fluctuating components. The fluctuating component is realised as a prescribed stochastic diffeomorphism that introduces stochastic transport into the system and we construct it using homogenisation theory. The dynamics of the mean component are derived from a variational principle utilising particular forms of variations that preserve the composite structure of the flow. Using a new variational principle, we show that SALT equations can arise from random Lagrangians and are equivalent to random coefficient PDEs. We also demonstrate how to modify the composite flow and the associated variational principle to derive models inspired by the Lagrangian Averaged Euler-Poincare (LAEP) theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.02850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we characterize all distributional limits of the random quadratic form $T_n =\sum_{1\le u&lt; v\le n} a_{u, v} X_u X_v$, where $((a_{u, v}))_{1\le u,v\le n}$ is a $\{0, 1\}$-valued symmetric matrix with zeros on the diagonal and $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ are i.i.d.~ mean $0$ variance $1$ random variables with common distribution function $F$. In particular, we show that any distributional limit of $S_n:=T_n/\sqrt{\mathrm{Var}[T_n]}$ can be expressed as the sum of three independent components: a Gaussian, a (possibly) infinite weighted sum of independent centered chi-squares, and a Gaussian mixture with a random variance. As a consequence, we prove a fourth moment theorem for the asymptotic normality of $S_n$, which applies even when $F$ does not have finite fourth moment. More formally, we show that $S_n$ converges to $N(0, 1)$ if and only if the fourth moment of $S_n$ (appropriately truncated when $F$ does not have finite fourth moment) converges to 3 (the fourth moment of the standard normal distribution).</description>

      <title>Interpolated Drift Implicit Euler MLMC Method for Barrier Option Pricing and application to CIR and CEV Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.00779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Giles et al. [14] proved that the efficiency of the Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method for evaluating Down-and-Out barrier options for a diffusion process $(X_t)_{t\in[0,T]}$ with globally Lipschitz coefficients, can be improved by combining a Brownian bridge technique and a conditional Monte Carlo method provided that the running minimum $\inf_{t\in[0,T]}X_t$ has a bounded density in the vicinity of the barrier. In the present work, thanks to the Lamperti transformation technique and using a Brownian interpolation of the drift implicit Euler scheme of Alfonsi [2], we show that the efficiency of the MLMC can be also improved for the evaluation of barrier options for models with non-Lipschitz diffusion coefficients under certain moment constraints. We study two example models: the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) and the Constant of Elasticity of Variance (CEV) processes for which we show that the conditions of our theoretical framework are satisfied under certain restrictions on the models parameters. In particular, we develop semi-explicit formulas for the densities of the running minimum and running maximum of both CIR and CEV processes which are of independent interest. Finally, numerical tests are processed to illustrate our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.17245v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In decision making under uncertainty and risk, worst-case risk assessments are often conducted using maxitive monetary risk measures. In this article, we study maxitive monetary risk measures on the space $L^0$ of all random variables identified modulo almost sure equality. We prove that a monetary risk measure is maxitive and continuous from below if and only if it is a penalized maximum loss. Furthermore, we characterize the maximum loss as the unique maxitive and law-invariant monetary risk measure. We apply the results to large deviation theory by providing a general criterion to establish a sharp large deviation estimate for sequences of probability measures. We use these findings to provide a formula for the asymptotics of the distortion-exponential insurance premium principle under risk pooling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08942v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central limit theorem is established for a sum of random variables belonging to a sequence of random fields. The fields are assumed to have zero mean conditional on the past history and to satisfy certain conditional $\alpha$-mixing conditions in space or time. Exploiting conditional centering and the space-time structure, the limiting normal distribution is obtained for increasing spatial domain, increasing length of the sequence, or both of these. The theorem is very well suited for establishing asymptotic normality in the context of unbiased estimating function inference for a wide range of space-time processes. This is pertinent given the abundance of space-time data. Two examples demonstrate the applicability of the theorem.</description>

      <title>Markov properties of Gaussian random fields on compact metric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03190v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has recently been much interest in Gaussian fields on linear networks and, more generally, on compact metric graphs. One proposed strategy for defining such fields on a metric graph $\Gamma$ is through a covariance function that is isotropic in a metric on the graph. Another is through a fractional-order differential equation $L^{\alpha/2} (\tau u) = \mathcal{W}$ on $\Gamma$, where $L = \kappa^2 - \nabla(a\nabla)$ for (sufficiently nice) functions $\kappa, a$, and $\mathcal{W}$ is Gaussian white noise. We study Markov properties of these two types of fields. First, we show that no Gaussian random fields exist on general metric graphs that are both isotropic and Markov. Then, we show that the second type of fields, the generalized Whittle--Mat\'ern fields, are Markov if $\alpha\in\mathbb{N}$, and conversely, if $a$ and $\kappa$ are constant and $u$ is Markov, then $\alpha\in\mathbb{N}$. Further, if $\alpha\in\mathbb{N}$, a generalized Whittle--Mat\'ern field $u$ is Markov of order $\alpha$, which means that the field $u$ in one region $S\subset\Gamma$ is conditionally independent of $u$ in $\Gamma\setminus S$ given the values of $u$ and its $\alpha-1$ derivatives on $\partial S$. Finally, we provide two results as consequences of the theory developed: first we prove that the Markov property implies an explicit characterization of $u$ on a fixed edge $e$, revealing that the conditional distribution of $u$ on $e$ given the values at the two vertices connected to $e$ is independent of the geometry of $\Gamma$; second, we show that the solution to $L^{1/2}(\tau u) = \mathcal{W}$ on $\Gamma$ can obtained by conditioning independent generalized Whittle--Mat\'ern processes on the edges, with $\alpha=1$ and Neumann boundary conditions, on being continuous at the vertices.</description>

      <title>Moderate Deviations for the Capacity of the Random Walk range in dimension four</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07685v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we find a natural four dimensional analog of the moderate deviation results for the capacity of the random walk, which corresponds to Bass, Chen and Rosen \cite{BCR} concerning the volume of the random walk range for $d=2$. We find that the deviation statistics of the capacity of the random walk can be related to the following constant of generalized Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequalities, \begin{equation*} \label{eq:maxineq} \inf_{f: \|\nabla f\|_{L^2}&lt;\infty} \frac{\|f\|^{1/2}_{L^2} \|\nabla f\|^{1/2}_{L^2}}{ [\int_{(\mathbb{R}^4)^2} f^2(x) G(x-y) f^2(y) \text{d}x \text{d}y]^{1/4}}. \end{equation*}</description>

      <title>Exact decay of the persistence probability in the Airy$_1$ process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Airy$_1$ process, which is the limit process in KPZ growth models with flat and non-random initial conditions. We study the persistence probability, namely the probability that the process stays below a given threshold $c$ for a time span of length $L$. This is expected to decay as $e^{-\kappa(c) L}$. We determine an analytic expression for $\kappa(c)$ for all $c\geq 3/2$ starting with the continuum statistics formula for the persistence probability. As the formula is analytic only for $c&gt;0$, we determine an analytic continuation of $\kappa(c)$ and numerically verify the validity for $c&lt;0$ as well.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Expansions of the Limit Laws of Gaussian and Laguerre (Wishart) Ensembles at the Soft Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07628v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The large-matrix limit laws of the rescaled largest eigenvalue of the orthogonal, unitary and symplectic $n$-dimensional Gaussian ensembles -- and of the corresponding Laguerre ensembles (Wishart distributions) for various regimes of the parameter $\alpha$ (degrees of freedom $p$) -- are known to be the Tracy-Widom distributions $F_\beta$ ($\beta=1,2,4$). We will establish (paying particular attention to large, or small, ratios $p/n$) that, with careful choices of the rescaling constants and the expansion parameter $h$, the limit laws embed into asymptotic expansions in powers of $h$, where $h \asymp n^{-2/3}$ resp. $h \asymp (n\,\wedge\,p)^{-2/3}$. We find explicit analytic expressions of the first few expansions terms as linear combinations, with rational polynomial coefficients, of higher order derivatives of the limit law $F_\beta$. With a proper parametrization, the expansions in the Gaussian cases can be understood, for given $n$, as the limit $p\to\infty$ of the Laguerre cases. Whereas the results for $\beta=2$ are presented with proof, the discussion of the cases $\beta=1,4$ is based on some hypotheses, focussing on the algebraic aspects of actually computing the polynomial coefficients. For the purposes of illustration and validation, the various results are checked against simulation data with large sample sizes.</description>

      <title>Graph Expansions of Deep Neural Networks and their Universal Scaling Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08459v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a unified approach to obtain scaling limits of neural networks using the genus expansion technique from random matrix theory. This approach begins with a novel expansion of neural networks which is reminiscent of Butcher series for ODEs, and is obtained through a generalisation of Fa\`a di Bruno's formula to an arbitrary number of compositions. In this expansion, the role of monomials is played by random multilinear maps indexed by directed graphs whose edges correspond to random matrices, which we call operator graphs. This expansion linearises the effect of the activation functions, allowing for the direct application of Wick's principle to compute the expectation of each of its terms. We then determine the leading contribution to each term by embedding the corresponding graphs onto surfaces, and computing their Euler characteristic. Furthermore, by developing a correspondence between analytic and graphical operations, we obtain similar graph expansions for the neural tangent kernel as well as the input-output Jacobian of the original neural network, and derive their infinite-width limits with relative ease. Notably, we find explicit formulae for the moments of the limiting singular value distribution of the Jacobian. We then show that all of these results hold for networks with more general weights, such as general matrices with i.i.d. entries satisfying moment assumptions, complex matrices and sparse matrices.</description>

      <title>Sharp bounds on aggregate expert error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the classic problem of aggregating binary advice from conditionally independent experts, also known as the Naive Bayes setting. Our quantity of interest is the error probability of the optimal decision rule. In the case of symmetric errors (sensitivity = specificity), reasonably tight bounds on the optimal error probability are known. In the general asymmetric case, we are not aware of any nontrivial estimates on this quantity. Our contribution consists of sharp upper and lower bounds on the optimal error probability in the general case, which recover and sharpen the best known results in the symmetric special case. Since this turns out to be equivalent to estimating the total variation distance between two product distributions, our results also have bearing on this important and challenging problem.</description>

      <title>Markov Processes and Stochastic Extrinsic Derivative Flows on the Space of Absolutely Continuous Measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $E$ be the class of finite (resp. probability) measures absolutely continuous with respect to a $\sigma$-finite Radon measure on a Polish space. We present a criterion on the quasi-regularity of Dirichlet forms on $E$ in terms of upper bound conditions given by the uniform $(L^1+L^\infty)$-norm of the extrinsic derivative. As applications, we construct a class of general type Markov processes on $E$ via quasi-regular Dirichlet forms containing the diffusion, jump and killing terms. Moreover, stochastic extrinsic derivative flows on $E$ are studied by using quasi-regular Dirichlet forms, which in particular provide martingale solutions to SDEs on these two spaces, with drifts given by the extrinsic derivative of entropy functionals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11486v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fix a prime number $p$. Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ be a finite field of characteristic coprime to 2, 3, and $p$, which also contains the primitive $p$-th root of unity $\mu_p$. Based on the works by Swinnerton-Dyer and Klagsbrun, Mazur, and Rubin, we prove that the probability distribution of the sizes of prime Selmer groups over a family of cyclic prime twists of non-isotrivial elliptic curves over $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$ satisfying a number of mild constraints conforms to the distribution conjectured by Bhargava, Kane, Lenstra, Poonen, and Rains with explicit error bounds. The key tools used in proving these results are the Riemann hypothesis over global function fields, the Erd\"os-Kac theorem, and the geometric ergodicity of Markov chains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.05421v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most of the existing methods for pricing Asian options are less efficient in the limit of small maturities and small volatilities. In this paper, we use the large deviations theory for the analysis of short-maturity Asian options. We present a local volatility model for the underlying market that incorporates a jump term in addition to the drift and diffusion terms. We estimate the asymptotics for the out-of-the-money, in-the-money, and at-the-money short-maturity Asian call and put options. Under appropriate assumptions, we show that the asymptotics for out-of-the-money Asian call and put options are governed by rare events. For the at-the-money Asian options, the result is more involved and in that case, we find the upper and lower bounds of the asymptotics of the Asian option price.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07772v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that a wide class of random quantum channels with few Kraus operators, sampled as random matrices with some sparsity and moment assumptions, typically exhibit a large spectral gap, and are therefore optimal quantum expanders. In particular, our result provides a recipe to construct random quantum expanders from their classical (random or deterministic) counterparts. This considerably enlarges the list of known constructions of optimal quantum expanders, which was previously limited to few examples. Our proofs rely on recent progress in the study of the operator norm of random matrices with dependence and non-homogeneity, which we expect to have further applications in several areas of quantum information.</description>

      <title>Existence, uniqueness, and universality of global dynamics for the fractional hyperbolic $\Phi^4_3$-model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the fractional $\Phi^4_3$-measure (with order $\alpha &gt; 1$) and the dynamical problem of its canonical stochastic quantization: the three-dimensional stochastic damped fractional nonlinear wave equation with a cubic nonlinearity, also called the fractional hyperbolic $\Phi^4_3$-model. We first construct the fractional $\Phi^4_3$-measure via the variational approach by Barashkov-Gubinelli (2020). When $\alpha \leq \frac{9}{8}$, this fractional $\Phi^4_3$-measure turns out to be mutually singular with respect to the base Gaussian measure. We then prove almost sure global well-posedness of the fractional hyperbolic $\Phi^4_3$-model and invariance of the fractional $\Phi^4_3$-measure for all $\alpha &gt; 1$ by further developing the globalization framework due to Oh-Okamoto-Tolomeo (2021) on the hyperbolic $\Phi^3_3$-model. Furthermore, when $\alpha &gt; \frac{9}{8}$ , we prove weak universality of the fractional hyperbolic $\Phi^4_3$-model via both measure convergence and dynamical convergence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A nonnegative real function f is bell-shaped if it converges to zero at plus and minus infinity and the nth derivative of f changes sign n times for every n = 0, 1, 2, ... Similarly, a two-sided nonnegative sequence a(k) is bell-shaped if it converges to zero at plus and minus infinity and the nth iterated difference of a(k) changes sign n times for every n = 0, 1, 2, ... A characterisation of bell-shaped functions was given by Thomas Simon and the first named author, and recently a similar result for one-sided bell-shaped sequences was found by the authors. In the present article we give a complete description of two-sided bell-shaped sequences. Our main result proves that bell-shaped sequences are convolutions of P\'olya frequency sequences and what we call absolutely monotone-then-completely monotone sequences, and it provides an equivalent, and relatively easy to verify, condition in terms of holomorphic extensions of the generating function.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Graphon Theory: Fluctuations, Degeneracies, and Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exchangeable random graphs, which include some of the most widely studied network models, have emerged as the mainstay of statistical network analysis in recent years. Graphons, which are the central objects in graph limit theory, provide a natural way to sample exchangeable random graphs. It is well known that network moments (motif/subgraph counts) identify a graphon (up to an isomorphism), hence, understanding the sampling distribution of subgraph counts in random graphs sampled from a graphon is pivotal for nonparametric network inference. In this paper, we derive the joint asymptotic distribution of any finite collection of network moments in random graphs sampled from a graphon, that includes both the non-degenerate case (where the distribution is Gaussian) as well as the degenerate case (where the distribution has both Gaussian or non-Gaussian components). This provides the higher-order fluctuation theory for subgraph counts in the graphon model. We also develop a novel multiplier bootstrap for graphons that consistently approximates the limiting distribution of the network moments (both in the Gaussian and non-Gaussian regimes). Using this and a procedure for testing degeneracy, we construct joint confidence sets for any finite collection of motif densities. This provides a general framework for statistical inference based on network moments in the graphon model. To illustrate the broad scope of our results we also consider the problem of detecting global structure (that is, testing whether the graphon is a constant function) based on small subgraphs. We propose a consistent test for this problem, invoking celebrated results on quasi-random graphs, and derive its limiting distribution both under the null and the alternative.</description>

Abstract: We establish a theory for multivariate extreme value analysis of dynamical systems. Namely, we provide conditions adapted to the dynamical setting which enable the study of dependence between extreme values of the components of $\R^d$-valued observables evaluated along the orbits of the systems. We study this cross-sectional dependence, which results from the combination of a spatial and a temporal dependence structures. We give several illustrative applications, where concrete systems and dependence sources are introduced and analysed.</description>

      <title>The loop equations for noncommutative geometries on quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a path integral over Dirac operators that averages over noncommutative geometries on a fixed graph, as the title reveals, using quiver representations. We prove algebraic relations that are satisfied by the expectation value of the respective observables, computed in terms of integrals over unitary groups, with weights defined by the spectral action. These equations generalise the Makeenko-Migdal equations -- the constraints of lattice gauge theory -- from lattices to arbitrary graphs. As a perspective, our loop equations are combined with positivity conditions (on a matrix parametrised by composition of Wilson loops). On a simple quiver this combination known as `bootstrap' is fully worked out. The respective partition function boils down to an integral known as Gross-Witten-Wadia model; their solution confirms the solution bootstrapped by our loop equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07148v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms come to rescue when sampling from a complex, high-dimensional distribution by a conventional method is intractable. Even though MCMC is a powerful tool, it is also hard to control and tune in practice. Simultaneously achieving both local exploration of the state space and global discovery of the target distribution is a challenging task. In this work, we present a MCMC formulation that subsumes all existing MCMC samplers employed in rendering. We then present a novel framework for adjusting an arbitrary Markov chain, making it exhibit invariance with respect to a specified target distribution. To showcase the potential of the proposed framework, we focus on a first simple application in light transport simulation. As a by-product, we introduce continuous-time MCMC sampling to the computer graphics community. We show how any existing MCMC-based light transport algorithm can be embedded into our framework. We empirically and theoretically prove that this embedding is superior to running the standalone algorithm. In fact, our approach will convert any existing algorithm into a highly parallelizable variant with shorter running time, smaller error and less variance.</description>
