      <title>Uncertainty principle for solutions of the Schr{\"o}dinger equation on the Heisenberg group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is two prove two versions of the Dynamical Uncertainty Principlefor the Schr\"odinger equation $i\partial_s u=\mathcal{L}u+Vu$, $u(s=0)=u_0$ where$\mathcal{L}$ is the sub-Laplacian on the Heisenberg group.We show two results of this type. For the first one, the potential $V=0$, we establish a dynamical version of Amrein-Berthier-Benedicks's Uncertainty Principle that shows that if $u_0$ and $u_1=u(s=1)$ have both small support then $u=0$. For the second result, we add some potential to the equation and we obtain a dynamical version of the Paley-Wiener Theorem in the spirit of the result of Kenig, Ponce, Vega \cite{KPV}. Both results are obtained by suitably transfering results from the Euclidean setting.We also establish some limitations to Dynamical Uncertainty Principles.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear approximation of harmonic functions from shifts of the Newtonian kernel in BMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study nonlinear n-term approximation of harmonic functions on the unit ball in $R^d$ from linear combinations of shifts of the Newtonian kernel (fundamental solution of the Laplace equation) in BMO. A sharp Jackson estimate is established that naturally involves certain Besov spaces. The method for obtaining this result is based on the construction of highly localized frames for Besov spaces and VMO on the sphere whose elements are linear combinations of a fixed number of shifts of the Newtonian kernel.</description>

      <title>Measure rigidity for generalized u-Gibbs states and stationary measures via the factorization method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain measure rigidity results for stationary measures of random walks generated by diffeomorphisms, and for actions of $\operatorname{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ on smooth manifolds. Our main technical result, from which the rest of the theorems are derived, applies also to the case of a single diffeomorphism or $1$-parameter flow and establishes extra invariance of a class of measures that we call ``generalized u-Gibbs states''.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive study of bound-states for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on single-knot metric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the existence and qualitative properties of action ground-states (that is, bound-states with minimal action) {of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation} over single-knot metric graphs -- which are made of half-lines, loops and pendants, all connected at a single vertex. First, we prove existence of action ground-state for generic single-knot graphs, even in the absence of an associated variational problem. Second, for regular single-knot graphs of length $\ell$, we perform a complete analysis of positive monotone bound-states. Furthermore, we characterize all positive bound-states when $\ell$ is small and prove some symmetry-breaking results for large $\ell$. Finally, we apply the results to some particular graphs to illustrate the complex relation between action ground-states and the topological {and metric} features of the underlying metric graph.
  The proofs are nonvariational, using a careful phase-plane analysis, the study of sections of period functions, asymptotic estimates and blowup arguments. We show, in particular, how nonvariational techniques are complementary to variational ones in order to deeply understand bound-states of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on metric graphs.</description>

      <title>Spider's webs and sharp $L^p$ bounds for the Hardy--Littlewood maximal operator on Gromov hyperbolic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove that if $1&lt;a\leq b&lt;a^2$ and $X$ is a locally doubling $\delta$-hyperbolic complete connected length metric measure space with $(a,b)$-pinched exponential growth at infinity, then the centred Hardy--Littlewood maximal operator $\mathcal M$ is bounded on $L^p(X)$ for all $p&gt;\tau$, and it is of weak type $(\tau,\tau)$, where $\tau := \log_ab$. A key step in the proof is a new structural theorem for Gromov hyperbolic spaces with $(a,b)$-pinched exponential growth at infinity, consisting in a discretisation of $X$ by means of certain graphs, introduced in this paper and called spider's webs, with ``good connectivity properties". Our result applies to trees with bounded geometry, and Cartan--Hadamard manifolds of pinched negative curvature, providing new boundedness results in these settings. The index $\tau$ is optimal in the sense that if $p&lt;\tau$, then there exists $X$ satisfying the assumptions above such that $\mathcal M$ is not of weak type $(p,p)$. Furthermore, if $b&gt;a^2$, then there are examples of spaces $X$ satisfying the assumptions above such that $\mathcal M$ bounded on $L^p(X)$ if and only if $p=\infty$.</description>

      <title>Kharitonov's Theorem with Degree Drop: a Wronskian Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a simplified proof of Kharitonov's Theorem, an important result on determining the Hurwitz stability of interval polynomials. Our new approach to the proof, which is based on the Wronskian of a pair of polynomials, is not only more elementary in comparison to known methods, but is able to handle the degree drop case with ease.</description>

      <title>Flows driven by multi-indices Rough Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a solution theory for scalar-valued rough differential equations driven by multi-indices rough paths. To achieve this task, we will show how the flow approach using the log-ODE method introduced by Bailleul fits perfectly in this setting. In addition, we also describe the action of multi-indices rough paths at the level of rough differential equations.</description>

      <title>Higher Order Lipschitz Sandwich Theorems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06849v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the consequence of two Lip$(\gamma)$ functions, in the sense of Stein, being close throughout a subset of their domain. A particular consequence of our results is the following. Given $K_0 &gt; \varepsilon &gt; 0$ and $\gamma &gt; \eta &gt; 0$ there is a constant $\delta = \delta(\gamma,\eta,\varepsilon,K_0) &gt; 0$ for which the following is true. Let $\Sigma \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ be closed and $f , h : \Sigma \to \mathbb{R}$ be Lip$(\gamma)$ functions whose Lip$(\gamma)$ norms are both bounded above by $K_0$. Suppose $B \subset \Sigma$ is closed and that $f$ and $h$ coincide throughout $B$. Then over the set of points in $\Sigma$ whose distance to $B$ is at most $\delta$ we have that the Lip$(\eta)$ norm of the difference $f-h$ is bounded above by $\varepsilon$. More generally, we establish that this phenomenon remains valid in a less restrictive Banach space setting under the weaker hypothesis that the two Lip$(\gamma)$ functions $f$ and $h$ are only close in a pointwise sense throughout the closed subset $B$. We require only that the subset $\Sigma$ be closed; in particular, the case that $\Sigma$ is finite is covered by our results. The restriction that $\eta &lt; \gamma$ is sharp in the sense that our result is false for $\eta := \gamma$.</description>

      <title>Sobolev embeddings on domains involving two types of symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that Sobolev embeddings can be improved in the presence of symmetries. In this article, we considere the situation in which given a domain $\Omega=\Omega_1 \times \Omega_2$ in $\mathbb{R}^N$ with a cylindrical symmetry, and acting a group $G$ in $\Omega_1$, for this situation it is shown that the critical Sobolev exponent increases in the case of embeddings into weighted spaces $L^{q}_{h}(\Omega)$. In this paper, we will enunciate several results related to compact embeddings of a Sobolev space with radially symmetric functions into some weighted space $L^{q}$, with $q$ higher than the usual critical exponent.</description>

Abstract: We establish new versions of the Wiener-Ikehara theorem where only boundary assumptions on the real part of the Laplace transform are imposed. Our results generalize and improve a recent theorem of T. Koga [J. Fourier Anal. Appl. 27 (2021), Article No. 18]. As an application, we give a quick Tauberian proof of Blackwell's renewal theorem.</description>

      <title>Cylindrical Networks and Total Nonnegativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that an infinite block-Toeplitz matrix with finite diagonal support is totally nonnegative if and only if it is the weight matrix of a cylindrical network. This generalizes a well-known theorem of Brenti concerning finite totally nonnegative matrices and planar networks; in particular, our work gives an alternative, self-contained proof of the non-square case. Our argument employs Temperley-Lieb immanants, first introduced by Rhoades and Skandera, which are certain elements of Lusztig's dual canonical bases. As an application, we also obtain a new proof of a well-known theorem relating totally nonnegative block-Toeplitz matrices to interlacing polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the scattering of linear internal waves in a two dimensional channel with subcritical bottom topography. We construct the scattering matrix for the internal wave problem in a channel with straight ends, mapping incoming data to outgoing data; this operator turns out to differ by a smoothing operator from the pullback by the ``bounce map'' for boundary data obtained by ray-tracing. As a consequence we obtain unique solvability of the inhomogeneous stationary scattering problem subject to an appropriate outgoing radiation condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a non-explosion result for rough differential equations (RDEs) in which both the noise and drift coefficients together with their derivatives are allowed to grow at infinity. Additionally, we prove the existence of a bi-continuous solution flow for stochastic differential equations (SDEs). In the case of RDEs with additive noise, we show that our result is optimal by providing a counterexample.</description>
