      <title>Bright Coherent Ultrahigh Harmonics in the keV X-Ray Regime from Mid-Infrared Femtosecond Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High harmonic generation traditionally combines ~100 near-infrared laser photons, to generate bright, phase matched, extreme ultraviolet beams when the emission from many atoms adds constructively. Here we show that by guiding a mid-infrared femtosecond laser in a high pressure gas, ultrahigh harmonics can be generated up to orders &gt; 5000, that emerge as a bright supercontinuum that spans the entire electromagnetic spectrum from the ultraviolet to &gt; 1.6 keV, allowing in-principle the generation of pulses as short as 2.5 attoseconds. The multi-atmosphere gas pressures required for bright, phase matched emission also supports laser beam self-confinement, further enhancing the x-ray yield. Finally, the x-ray beam exhibits high spatial coherence, even though at high gas density, the recolliding electrons responsible for high harmonic generation encounter other atoms during the emission process.</description>

      <title>Phase-Matched Generation of Coherent Soft-X-Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase-matched harmonic conversion of visible laser light into soft x-rays was demonstrated. The recently developed technique of guided-wave frequency conversion was used to upshift light from 800 nanometers to the range from 17 to 32 nanometers. This process increased the coherent x-ray output by factors of 10^2 to 10^3 compared to the non-phase-matched case. This source uses a small-scale (sub-millijoule) high repetition-rate laser and will enable a wide variety of new experimental investigations in linear and nonlinear x-ray science.</description>

      <title>Prospects of a thousand-ion Sn$^{2+}$ Coulomb-crystal clock with sub-$10^{-19}$ inaccuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.15484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a many-ion optical atomic clock based on three-dimensional Coulomb crystals of order one thousand Sn$^{2+}$ ions confined in a linear RF Paul trap. Sn$^{2+}$ has a unique combination of features that is not available in previously considered ions: a $^1$S$_0$ $\leftrightarrow$ $^3$P$_0$ clock transition between two states with zero electronic and nuclear angular momentum (I = J = F = 0) making it immune to nonscalar perturbations, a negative differential polarizability making it possible to operate the trap in a manner such that the two dominant shifts for three-dimensional ion crystals cancel each other, and a laser-accessible transition suitable for direct laser cooling and state readout. We present calculations of the differential polarizability, other relevant atomic properties, and the motion of ions in large Coulomb crystals, in order to estimate the achievable accuracy and precision of Sn$^{2+}$ Coulomb-crystal clocks.</description>

      <title>The spin-flip-induced quadrupole resonance in odd-$A$ exotic atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the possible existence of quadrupole resonances in exotic atoms containing odd-$A$ nuclei. We find that the spin-flip of the de-exciting exotic particle can induce a resonance, altering the orbital angular momentum of the nucleus by one quanta. This process results in an excited nucleus with a suppression in x-ray photon emissions during the exotic atom cascade. We provide specific cases of antiprotonic atoms of stable elements where this resonance effect is expected to occur. The study of this phenomena may provide insight into the strong interaction of deeply bound antiprotonic states in the proximity of the unpaired nucleon, and serve as a tool for probing short-lived excited nuclear states.</description>

      <title>Theoretical consideration of a twisted atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the twisted state of an atom and the possible effect of such a state on the properties of the photons emitted as a result of an electron transition in that atom. We first propose a framework for describing the twisted atomic state, and then explore possible differences in the nuclear recoil effects in the twisted atom compared to those in the plane-wave atom. We conclude that if the initial atomic state is twisted, then the photon distribution is altered. We point out that in a certain observation scheme, one can detect a feature of this twist in the distribution of the emitted photons, even in zero order in $m/M$.</description>

      <title>Emergent Fano-Feshbach resonance in two-band superconductors with an incipient quasi-flat band: Enhanced critical temperature evading particle-hole fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In superconductivity, a surge of interests in enhancing $T_{\rm c}$ is ever mounting, where a recent focus is toward multi-band superconductivity. In $T_{\rm c}$ enhancements specific to two-band cases, especially around the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) to Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) crossover considered here, we have to be careful about how quantum fluctuations affect the many-body states, i.e., particle-hole fluctuations suppressing the pairing for attractive interactions. Here we explore how to circumvent the suppression by examining multichannel pairing interactions in two-band systems. With the Gor'kov-Melik-Barkhudarov (GMB) formalism for particle-hole fluctuations in a continuous space, we look into the case of a deep dispersive band accompanied by an incipient heavy-mass (i.e., quasi-flat) band. We find that, while the GMB corrections usually suppress $T_{\rm c}$ significantly, this in fact competes with the enhanced pairing arising from the heavy band, with the trade-off leading to a peaked structure in $T_{\rm c}$ against the band-mass ratio when the heavy band is incipient. The system then plunges into a strong-coupling regime with the GMB screening vastly suppressed. This occurs prominently when the chemical potential approaches the bound state lurking just below the heavy band, which can be viewed as a Fano-Feshbach resonance, with its width governed by the pair-exchange interaction. The diagrammatic structure comprising particle-particle and particle-hole channels is heavily entangled, so that the emergent Fano-Feshbach resonance dominates all the channels, suggesting a universal feature in multiband superconductivity.</description>
