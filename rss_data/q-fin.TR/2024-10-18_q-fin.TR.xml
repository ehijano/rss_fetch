      <title>Concentrated Superelliptical Market Maker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An automated market maker where the price can cross the zero bound into the negative price domain with applications in electricity, energy, and derivatives markets is presented. A unique feature involves the ability to swap both negatively and/or positively priced assets between one another, which unlike traditional markets requires a numeraire in the form of a currency. The payoff, invariant, and liquidity distribution is compared to a replicating market maker. Model extensions to skew and widen liquidity with a superellipse are shown. The ability to access negative liquidity, which is present on constant product market makers, is shown as well.</description>

      <title>Competitive equilibria in trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the third paper in a series concerning the game-theoretic aspects of position-building while in competition. The first paper set forth foundations and laid out the essential goal, which is to minimize implementation costs in light of how other traders are likely to trade. The majority of results in that paper center on the two traders in competition and equilibrium results are presented. The second paper, introduces computational methods based on Fourier Series which allows the introduction of a broad range of constraints into the optimal strategies derived. The current paper returns to the unconstrained case and provides a complete solution to finding equilibrium strategies in competition and handles completely arbitrary situations. As a result we present a detailed analysis of the value (or not) of trade centralization and we show that firms who naively centralize trades do not generally benefit and sometimes, in fact, lose. On the other hand, firms that strategically centralize their trades generally will be able to benefit.</description>
