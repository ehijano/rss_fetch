      <title>Comprehensive indicators and fine granularity refine density scaling laws in rural-urban systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density scaling laws complement traditional population scaling laws by enabling the analysis of the full range of human settlements and revealing rural-to-urban transitions with breakpoints at consistent population densities. However, previous studies have been constrained by the granularity of rural and urban units, as well as limitations in the quantity and diversity of indicators. This study addresses these gaps by examining Middle Layer Super Output Areas (MSOAs) in England and Wales, incorporating an extensive set of 117 indicators for the year 2021, spanning age, ethnicity, educational attainment, religion, disability, economic activity, mortality, crime, property transactions, and road accidents. Results indicate that the relationship between indicator density and population density is best described by a segmented power-law model with a consistent breakpoint (33 +- 5 persons per hectare) for 92 of the 117 indicators. Additionally, increasing granularity reveals further rural-to-urban transitions not observed at coarser spatial resolutions. Our findings also highlight the influence of population characteristics on scaling exponents, where stratifying dementia and ischaemic heart disease by older age groups (aged 70 and above) significantly affects these exponents, illustrating a protective urban effect.</description>

      <title>Towards a European Quantum Act: A Two-Pillar Framework for Regulation and Innovation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum technologies promise transformative advancements but pose significant dual-use risks. Realizing their potential while mitigating risks necessitates a robust, anticipatory, and harmonized EU regulatory framework, grounded in the precautionary principle. Such a framework must be sui generis, as foundational quantum mechanical phenomena -incl. superposition, entanglement, and tunneling -defy the intuitive classical assumptions of factual certainty, causality, and locality that underpin existing legal paradigms, demanding a bespoke regulatory architecture that contributes to the emerging lex specialis for quantum information technologies. Responding to the Quantum Europe Strategy, this contribution outlines the rationale for a dedicated European Quantum Act. Drawing lessons from legislative strategies in the semiconductor (EU/US Chips Acts) and AI (EU AI Act) domains, and analyzing US and Chinese technology policy, we argue the EU needs a 'full-stack' industrial policy. We propose the EU Quantum Act should be a two-pillar instrument, combining New Legislative Framework-style regulation with an ambitious Chips Act-style industrial and security policy. This dual approach fosters innovation through strategic investment (e.g. via a DARPA-style agency) while managing risk through clear, risk-based tiers and regulatory sandboxes. This strategy is presented as essential for EU technological sovereignty and for building a strong transatlantic tech alliance. On the international stage, we advocate for a global non-proliferation framework for quantum and AI wmd's inspired by the IAEA/NPT model and overseen by an 'International Quantum Agency'. This vision culminates in the 'Qubits for Peace' initiative, a global governance structure to ensure quantum technologies are developed safely and ethically. The article concludes by consolidating the analysis into a detailed legislative blueprint.</description>

      <title>A generative model of function growth explains hidden self-similarities across biological and social systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From genomes and ecosystems to bureaucracies and cities, the growth of complex systems occurs by adding new types of functions and expanding existing ones. We present a simple generative model that generalizes the Yule-Simon process by including: (i) a size-dependent probability of introducing new functions, and (ii) a generalized preferential attachment mechanism for expanding existing ones. We uncover a shared underlying structure that helps explain how function diversity evolves in empirical observations, such as prokaryotic proteomes, U.S. federal agencies, and urban economies. We show that real systems are often best represented as having non-Zipfian rank-frequency distributions, driven by sublinear preferential attachment, whilst still maintaining power-law scaling in their abundance distributions. Furthermore, our analytics explain five distinct phases of the organization of functional elements across complex systems. The model integrates empirical findings regarding the logarithmic growth of diversity in cities and the self-similarity of their rank-frequency distributions. Self-similarity previously observed in the rank-frequency distributions of cities is not observed in cells and federal agencies -- however, under a rescaling relative to the total diversity, all systems admit self-similar structures predicted by our theory.</description>

      <title>Utilizando o captador de guitarra como sensor: Construindo um kit para abordar a Lei de Faraday em sala de aula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The approach to the concept of electromagnetic induction in physics education can present challenges, particularly regarding its distance from students' everyday experiences. The functioning of an electric guitar pickup can serve as an interesting example to contextualize the topic, allowing students to understand the correlation between the variation in magnetic field flux and the induced electromotive force. This study aims to present a low-cost project to explore Faraday's Law of Induction through an experimental kit composed mainly of an electric guitar pickup, an electric motor with a speed controller, a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) sensor, and permanent magnets.</description>

      <title>Universality of SIS epidemics starting from small initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.02092v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are investigating deterministic SIS dynamics on large networks starting from only a few infected individuals. Under mild assumptions we show that any two epidemic curves - on the same network and with the same parameters - are almost identical up to time translation when initial conditions are small enough regardless of how infections are distributed at the beginning. The limit object - an epidemic starting from the infinite past with infinitesimal prevalence - is identified as the nontrivial eternal solution connecting the disease free state with the endemic equilibrium. Our framework covers several benchmark models including the N-Intertwined Mean Field Approximation (NIMFA) and the Inhomogeneous Mean Field Approximation (IMFA).</description>

      <title>A Simple and Explainable Model for Park-and-Ride Car Park Occupancy Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a scenario of growing usage of park-and-ride facilities, understanding and predicting car park occupancy is becoming increasingly important. This study presents a model that effectively captures the occupancy patterns of park-and-ride car parks for commuters using truncated normal distributions for vehicle arrival and departure times. The objective is to develop a predictive model with minimal parameters corresponding to commuter behaviour, enabling the estimation of parking saturation and unfulfilled demand. The proposed model successfully identifies the regular, periodic nature of commuter parking behaviour, where vehicles arrive in the morning and depart in the afternoon. It operates using aggregate data, eliminating the need for individual tracking of arrivals and departures. The model's predictive and now-casting capabilities are demonstrated through real-world data from car parks in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area. A simple model extension furthermore enables the prediction of when a car park will reach its occupancy limit and estimates the additional spaces required to accommodate such excess demand. Thus, beyond forecasting, the model serves as a valuable tool for evaluating interventions, such as expanding parking capacity, to optimize park-and-ride facilities.</description>

      <title>Fast Unbiased Sampling of Networks with Given Expected Degrees and Strengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13230v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The configuration model is a cornerstone of statistical assessment of network structure. While the Chung-Lu model is among the most widely used configuration models, it systematically oversamples edges between large-degree nodes, leading to inaccurate statistical conclusions. Although the maximum entropy principle offers unbiased configuration models, its high computational cost has hindered widespread adoption, making the Chung-Lu model an inaccurate yet persistently practical choice. Here, we propose fast and efficient sampling algorithms for the max-entropy-based models by adapting the Miller-Hagberg algorithm. Evaluation on 103 empirical networks demonstrates 10-1000 times speedup, making theoretically rigorous configuration models practical and contributing to a more accurate understanding of network structure.</description>
