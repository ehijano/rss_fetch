      <title>Consciousness defined: requirements for biological and artificial general intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consciousness is notoriously hard to define with objective terms. An objective definition of consciousness is critically needed so that we might accurately understand how consciousness and resultant choice behaviour may arise in biological or artificial systems. Many theories have integrated neurobiological and psychological research to explain how consciousness might arise, but few, if any, outline what is fundamentally required to generate consciousness. To identify such requirements, I examine current theories of consciousness and corresponding scientific research to generate a new definition of consciousness from first principles. Critically, consciousness is the apparatus that provides the ability to make decisions, but it is not defined by the decision itself. As such, a definition of consciousness does not require choice behaviour or an explicit awareness of temporality despite both being well-characterised outcomes of conscious thought. Rather, requirements for consciousness include: at least some capability for perception, a memory for the storage of such perceptual information which in turn provides a framework for an imagination with which a sense of self can be capable of making decisions based on possible and desired futures. Thought experiments and observable neurological phenomena demonstrate that these components are fundamentally required of consciousness, whereby the loss of any one component removes the capability for conscious thought. Identifying these requirements provides a new definition for consciousness by which we can objectively determine consciousness in any conceivable agent, such as non-human animals and artificially intelligent systems.</description>

      <title>Understanding Auditory Evoked Brain Signal via Physics-informed Embedding Network with Multi-Task Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the fields of brain-computer interaction and cognitive neuroscience, effective decoding of auditory signals from task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is key to understanding how the brain processes complex auditory information. Although existing methods have enhanced decoding capabilities, limitations remain in information utilization and model representation. To overcome these challenges, we propose an innovative multi-task learning model, Physics-informed Embedding Network with Multi-Task Transformer (PEMT-Net), which enhances decoding performance through physics-informed embedding and deep learning techniques. PEMT-Net consists of two principal components: feature augmentation and classification. For feature augmentation, we propose a novel approach by creating neural embedding graphs via node embedding, utilizing random walks to simulate the physical diffusion of neural information. This method captures both local and non-local information overflow and proposes a position encoding based on relative physical coordinates. In the classification segment, we propose adaptive embedding fusion to maximally capture linear and non-linear characteristics. Furthermore, we propose an innovative parameter-sharing mechanism to optimize the retention and learning of extracted features. Experiments on a specific dataset demonstrate PEMT-Net's significant performance in multi-task auditory signal decoding, surpassing existing methods and offering new insights into the brain's mechanisms for processing complex auditory information.</description>

      <title>NeuroAssist: Enhancing Cognitive-Computer Synergy with Adaptive AI and Advanced Neural Decoding for Efficient EEG Signal Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional methods of controlling prosthetics frequently encounter difficulties regarding flexibility and responsiveness, which can substantially impact people with varying cognitive and physical abilities. Advancements in computational neuroscience and machine learning (ML) have recently led to the development of highly advanced brain-computer interface (BCI) systems that may be customized to meet individual requirements. To address these issues, we propose NeuroAssist, a sophisticated method for analyzing EEG data that merges state-of-the-art BCI technology with adaptable artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. NeuroAssist's hybrid neural network design efficiently overcomes the constraints of conventional EEG data processing. Our methodology combines a Natural Language Processing (NLP) BERT model to extract complex features from numerical EEG data and utilizes LSTM networks to handle temporal dynamics. In addition, we integrate spiking neural networks (SNNs) and deep Q-networks (DQN) to improve decision-making and flexibility. Our preprocessing method classifies motor imagery (MI) one-versus-the-rest using a common spatial pattern (CSP) while preserving EEG temporal characteristics. The hybrid architecture of NeuroAssist serves as the DQN's Q-network, enabling continuous feedback-based improvement and adaptability. This enables it to acquire optimal actions through trial and error. This experimental analysis has been conducted on the GigaScience and BCI-competition-IV-2a datasets, which have shown exceptional effectiveness in categorizing MI-EEG signals, obtaining an impressive classification accuracy of 99.17%. NeuroAssist offers a crucial approach to current assistive technology by potentially enhancing the speed and versatility of BCI systems.</description>

      <title>Comparison of the Effects of Interaction with Intentional Agent and Artificial Intelligence using fNIRS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As societal interactions increasingly involve both intentional and unintentional agents, understanding their effects on human cognition becomes paramount. This study investigates the neural correlates of interacting with intentional versus artificial agents in a simulated tennis game scenario. Employing functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), brain activity in 50 male participants during gameplay against both types of opponents was analyzed. The used methodological approach ensures ecological validity by simulating real-world decision-making scenarios while participants undergo fNIRS scanning, avoiding the constraints of traditional neuroimaging methods. Six prefrontal cortex channels are focused on, leveraging the 10-20 system, to capture nuanced differences in brain activity. Wavelet analysis was utilized to dissect the data into frequency-specific differences, revealing subtle variations across different channels and frequency bands. Moreover, activity was quantified by comparing average data signals between rest and play modes across all points using Generalized Linear Model (GLM). The findings unveil significant differences in neural activation patterns, particularly in one specific channel and frequency range, suggesting distinct cognitive processing when interacting with intentional agents. These results align with previous neuroimaging studies and contribute to understanding the neural underpinnings of human-agent interactions in naturalistic settings. While acknowledging study limitations, including sample homogeneity and spatial accuracy constraints, the study's findings underscore the potential of fNIRS in exploring complex cognitive phenomena beyond laboratory confines.</description>

      <title>A rank decomposition for the topological classification of neural representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19710v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks can be thought of as applying a transformation to an input dataset. The way in which they change the topology of such a dataset often holds practical significance for many tasks, particularly those demanding non-homeomorphic mappings for optimal solutions, such as classification problems. In this work, we leverage the fact that neural networks are equivalent to continuous piecewise-affine maps, whose rank can be used to pinpoint regions in the input space that undergo non-homeomorphic transformations, leading to alterations in the topological structure of the input dataset. Our approach enables us to make use of the relative homology sequence, with which one can study the homology groups of the quotient of a manifold $\mathcal{M}$ and a subset $A$, assuming some minimal properties on these spaces.
  As a proof of principle, we empirically investigate the presence of low-rank (topology-changing) affine maps as a function of network width and mean weight. We show that in randomly initialized narrow networks, there will be regions in which the (co)homology groups of a data manifold can change. As the width increases, the homology groups of the input manifold become more likely to be preserved. We end this part of our work by constructing highly non-random wide networks that do not have this property and relating this non-random regime to Dale's principle, which is a defining characteristic of biological neural networks.
  Finally, we study simple feedforward networks trained on MNIST, as well as on toy classification and regression tasks, and show that networks manipulate the topology of data differently depending on the continuity of the task they are trained on.</description>
