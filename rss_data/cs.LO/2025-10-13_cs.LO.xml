      <title>U-Turn: Enhancing Incorrectness Analysis by Reversing Direction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: O'Hearn's Incorrectness Logic (IL) has sparked renewed interest in static analyses that aim to detect program errors rather than prove their absence, thereby avoiding false alarms -- a critical factor for practical adoption in industrial settings. As new incorrectness logics emerge to capture diverse error-related properties, a key question arises: can the combination of (in)correctness techniques enhance precision, expressiveness, automation, or scalability? Notable frameworks, such as outcome logic, UNTer, local completeness logic, and exact separation logic, unify multiple analyses within a single proof system. In this work, we adopt a complementary strategy. Rather than designing a unified logic, we combine IL, which identifies reachable error states, with Sufficient Incorrectness Logic (SIL), which finds input states potentially leading to those errors. As a result, we get a more informative and effective analysis than either logic in isolation. Rather than naively sequencing them, our key innovation is reusing heuristic choices from the first analysis to steer the second. In fact, both IL and SIL rely on under-approximation and thus their automation legitimates heuristics that avoid exhaustive path enumeration (e.g., selective disjunct pruning, loop unrolling). Concretely, we instrument the second logic's proof rules with derivations coming from the first to inductively guide rule selection and application. To our knowledge, this is the first rule format enabling such inter-analysis instrumentation. This combined analysis aids debugging and testing by revealing both reachable errors and their causes, and opens new avenues for embedding incorrectness insights into (a new kind of) scalable, expressive, automated code contracts.</description>

      <title>An MDL-Style Cost Functional KC, Distribution-Preserving Reductions ($A2^d$), and an $AC^0$+log Lower Bound for 3SAT via Balanced 3XOR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a model-agnostic MDL-style cost functional $K_C$ for resource-bounded classifiers and prove a Total-Variation stable reduction lemma ($A2^d$) for distribution-preserving many-to-one reductions. On a balanced distribution of random 3XOR instances (with co-rank $t'=\Theta(n)$) we obtain a size-aware lower bound against P-uniform AC^0+log models: $\Pr[M=\chi] \le \frac{1}{2} + s(N)\exp(-\alpha_d m^{c/d})$ with an absolute $c \in (0,1)$ (e.g., $c=1/3$ gives $\beta_d=1/(3d)$). A deterministic, injective 3XOR-&gt;3SAT translation (four 3-clauses per XOR, no auxiliaries) is $\delta=0$ measure-preserving on its image window; by $A2^d$ the bound transfers to 3SAT. This yields, to our knowledge, the first explicit $K_C$-reading of such size-aware bounds under a $\delta=0$ measure-preserving reduction in small-depth circuit lower bounds. We provide artifacts (generator -&gt; DIMACS -&gt; verification) with match-rate 1.0.</description>

      <title>Psi-Turing Machines: Bounded Introspection for Complexity Barriers and Oracle Separations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Psi-Turing Machines (Psi-TM): classical Turing machines equipped with a constant-depth introspection interface $ \iota $ and an explicit per-step information budget $ B(d,n)=c\,d\log_2 n $. With the interface frozen, we develop an information-theoretic lower-bound toolkit: Budget counting, $ \Psi $-Fooling, and $ \Psi $-Fano, with worked examples $ L_k $ and $ L_k^{\mathrm{phase}} $. We prove an oracle-relative separation $ P^{\Psi} \neq NP^{\Psi} $ and a strict depth hierarchy, reinforced by an Anti-Simulation Hook that rules out polynomial emulation of $ \iota_k $ using many calls to $ \iota_{k-1} $ under the budget regime. We also present two independent platforms (Psi-decision trees and interface-constrained circuits IC-AC$^{0}$/IC-NC$^{1}$) and bridges that transfer bounds among machine, tree, and circuit with explicit poly/log losses. The model preserves classical computational power outside $ \iota $ yet enables precise oracle-aware statements about barriers (relativization; partial/conditional progress on natural proofs and proof complexity). The aim is a standardized minimal introspection interface with clearly accounted information budgets.</description>

      <title>A Formalization of the Generalized Quantum Stein's Lemma in Lean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Generalized Quantum Stein's Lemma is a theorem in quantum hypothesis testing that provides an operational meaning to the relative entropy within the context of quantum resource theories. Its original proof was found to have a gap, which led to a search for a corrected proof. We formalize the proof presented in [Hayashi and Yamasaki (2024)] in the Lean interactive theorem prover. This is the most technically demanding theorem in physics with a computer-verified proof to date, building with a variety of intermediate results from topology, analysis, and operator algebra. In the process, we rectified minor imprecisions in [HY24]'s proof that formalization forces us to confront, and refine a more precise definition of quantum resource theory. Formalizing this theorem has ensured that our Lean-QuantumInfo library, which otherwise has begun to encompass a variety of topics from quantum information, includes a robust foundation suitable for a larger collaborative program of formalizing quantum theory more broadly.</description>

      <title>The Fractal Logic of $\Phi$-adic Recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish that valid $\Sigma_1$ propositional inference admits reduction to Fibonacci-indexed witness equations. Specifically, modus ponens verification reduces to solving a linear Diophantine equation in $O(M(\log n))$ time, where $M$ denotes integer multiplication complexity. This reduction is transitive: tautology verification proceeds via Fibonacci index arithmetic, bypassing semantic evaluation entirely. The core discovery is a transitive closure principle in $\Phi$-scaled space (Hausdorff dimension $\log_\Phi 2$), where logical consequence corresponds to a search problem over Fibonacci arcs -- a geometric invariant encoded in Zeckendorf representations. This yields a computational model wherein proof verification is achieved through \emph{arithmetic alignment} rather than truth-functional analysis, preserving soundness while respecting incompleteness. The construction synthesizes Lovelace's anticipation of symbolic computation (Note G) with the Turing-Church formalism, revealing a geometric interpretability of logic relative to a $\Sigma_1$ or $\omega$-consistent theory.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Models for Natural Language Reasoning: The Case of Syllogistic Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress in neural models, their ability to generalize, a cornerstone for applications like logical reasoning, remains a critical challenge. We delineate two fundamental aspects of this ability: compositionality, the capacity to abstract atomic logical rules underlying complex inferences, and recursiveness, the aptitude to build intricate representations through iterative application of inference rules. In the literature, these two aspects are often confounded together under the umbrella term of generalization. To sharpen this distinction, we investigated the logical generalization capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) using the syllogistic fragment as a benchmark for natural language reasoning. Though simple, this fragment provides a foundational yet expressive subset of formal logic that supports controlled evaluation of essential reasoning abilities. Our findings reveal a significant disparity: while LLMs demonstrate reasonable proficiency in recursiveness, they struggle with compositionality. To overcome these limitations and establish a reliable logical prover, we propose a hybrid architecture integrating symbolic reasoning with neural computation. This synergistic interaction enables robust and efficient inference, neural components accelerate processing, while symbolic reasoning ensures completeness. Our experiments show that high efficiency is preserved even with relatively small neural components. As part of our proposed methodology, this analysis gives a rationale and highlights the potential of hybrid models to effectively address key generalization barriers in neural reasoning systems.</description>

      <title>Strong normalization through idempotent intersection types: a new syntactical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09831v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that intersection type assignment systems can be used to characterize strong normalization (SN). Typical proofs that typable lambda-terms are SN in these systems rely on semantical techniques. In this work, we study $\Lambda_\cap^e$, a variant of Coppo and Dezani's (Curry-style) intersection type system, and we propose a syntactical proof of strong normalization for it. We first design $\Lambda_\cap^i$, a Church-style version, in which terms closely correspond to typing derivations. Then we prove that typability in $\Lambda_\cap^i$ implies SN through a measure that, given a term, produces a natural number that decreases along with reduction. Finally, the result is extended to $\Lambda_\cap^e$, since the two systems simulate each other.</description>

      <title>Cyclic Proofs in Hoare Logic and its Reverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the relationships between axiomatic and cyclic proof systems for the partial and total versions of Hoare logic and those of its dual, known as reverse Hoare logic (or sometimes incorrectness logic). In the axiomatic proof systems for these logics, the proof rules for looping constructs involve an explicit loop invariant, which in the case of the total versions additionally require a well-founded termination measure. In the cyclic systems, these are replaced by rules that simply unroll the loops, together with a principle allowing the formation of cycles in the proof, subject to a global soundness condition that ensures the well-foundedness of the circular reasoning. Interestingly, the cyclic soundness conditions for partial Hoare logic and its reverse are similar and essentially coinductive in character, while those for the total versions are also similar and essentially inductive. We show that these cyclic systems are sound, by direct argument, and relatively complete, by translation from axiomatic to cyclic proofs.</description>

      <title>Non-expansive Fuzzy ALC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09416v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fuzzy description logics serve the representation of vague knowledge, typically letting concepts take truth degrees in the unit interval. Expressiveness, logical properties, and complexity vary strongly with the choice of propositional base. The Lukasiewicz propositional base is generally perceived to have preferable logical properties but often entails high complexity or even undecidability. Contrastingly, the less expressive Zadeh propositional base comes with low complexity but entails essentially no change in logical behaviour compared to the classical case. To strike a balance between these poles, we propose non-expansive fuzzy ALC, in which the Zadeh base is extended with Lukasiewicz connectives where one side is restricted to be a rational constant, that is, with constant shift operators. This allows, for instance, modelling dampened inheritance of properties along roles. We present an unlabelled tableau method for non-expansive fuzzy ALC, which allows reasoning over general TBoxes in EXPTIME like in two-valued ALC.</description>
