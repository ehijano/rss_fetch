      <title>Barr-Zee Diagrams at a High-Energy Muon Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sensitivity of electron EDM experiments has been increasing at a rapid pace, and could yield indications of new physics in the coming decade. An intriguing possibility is that an EDM signal could be generated by new, electroweak-charged particles at the TeV scale that couple to the Higgs and contribute to the electron EDM at two-loop order via Barr-Zee diagrams. A high-energy muon collider could decisively search for new physics at this scale. In this work, we explore this complementarity between colliders and EDM experiments, and note that Barr-Zee diagrams from the aforementioned particles are closely related to vector-boson scattering processes at a muon collider. These loop corrections lead to kinematic features in the differential cross sections of these processes, dictated by the optical theorem. We demonstrate this connection in the context of the singlet-doublet and doublet-triplet extensions to the SM, explore the detectability of these features at a muon collider experiment, and discuss how these measurements can be used to ascertain the underlying model parameters.</description>

      <title>Electroweak Symmetry Restoration in Extended Higgs Sectors via Domain Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain walls are a type of topological defects that can arise in the early universe after the spontaneous breaking of a discrete symmetry. This occurs in several beyond Standard Model theories with an extended Higgs sector such as the Next-to-Two-Higgs-Doublet model (N2HDM). In this talk, I will discuss the domain wall solution related to the singlet scalar of the N2HDM and demonstrate the possibility of electroweak symmetry restoration (EWSR) in the vicinity of the domain wall. Such symmetry restoration can have profound implications on the early universe cosmology as the sphaleron rate inside the domain wall would, in principle, be unsuppressed compared with the rate outside the wall.</description>

      <title>Superfluids in expanding backgrounds and attractor times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the behavior of an out-of-equilibrium superfluid, composed of a $U(1)$ Goldstone mode coupled to hydrodynamic modes in a M\"uller-Israel-Stewart theory, in expanding backgrounds relevant to heavy ion collision experiments and cosmology. For suitable initial conditions, the evolution of the hydrodynamic variables leads to a change in the potential of the Goldstone mode, spontaneously breaking the symmetry. After some time, the condensate becomes small, leading the system evolution to be well described via hydrodynamic attractors for a timescale that we determine in Bjorken and Gubser flows. We define this new timescale as the \textit{attractor time} and show its dependence on initial conditions. In the case of the Gubser flow, we provide for the first time a complete description of the nonlinear evolution of the system, including a novel nonlinear regime of constant anisotropy not found in the Bjorken evolution. Finally, we consider the superfluid in the dynamical FLRW (Friedmann-Lemaitre-Roberston-Walker) background, where we observe a similar attractor behavior, dependent on the initial conditions, that at late times approaches a regime dominated by the condensate.</description>

      <title>Probing Leptogenesis through Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that a gravitational wave can be generated during leptogenesis in the early Universe which occurs when a heavy right handed neutrino decays out of equilibrium. Such a gravitational wave, as remnant of leptogenesis, is shown to be associated with distinguishing signatures that act as a powerful probe to leptogenesis and its requirements, which otherwise remains difficult to validate despite its success in explaining the baryon asymmetry of the Universe bearing connection to neutrino physics.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Single Inclusive Jet Production: Small-$R$ Resummation at Next-to-Leading Logarithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precision description of jet production plays an important role in many aspects of collider physics. In a recent paper we have presented a new factorization theorem for inclusive small radius jet production. The jet function appearing in our factorization theorem exhibits a non-standard renormalization group evolution, which, starting at next-to-leading logarithm (NLL), differs from previous results in the literature. In this paper we perform a first phenomenological study using our newly developed formalism, applying it to compute the spectrum of small radius jets in $e^+e^-\to J+X$ at NLL. We compare our results with previous predictions, highlighting the numerical impact of previously neglected terms throughout phase space. Our approach can be used for a variety of different collider systems, in particular, $ep$ and $pp$ collisions, with broad applications to the jet substructure program. Most importantly, since our factorization theorem is valid to all orders, the approach developed here will enable NNLL resummation of small radius logarithms in inclusive jet production, extending the precision of jet substructure calculations.</description>

      <title>Stellar evolution and axion-like particles: new constraints and hints from globular clusters in the GAIA DR3 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) are hypothetical pseudoscalar bosons, natural in extensions of the Standard Model. Their interactions with ordinary matter and radiation are suppressed, making it challenging to detect them in laboratory experiments. However, these particles, produced within stellar interiors, can provide an additional mechanism for energy loss, potentially influencing stellar evolution. Prominent methods for searching for such effects involve measuring the properties of red giants and helium-burning stars in globular clusters (GCs). Here we use published catalogs of stars selected as members of seven GCs on the basis of parallaxes and proper motions measured by Gaia (Data Realease 3). Making use of previously derived theoretical relations and the new data, we find the upper limit on the ALP-electron coupling, g_{ae}&lt;2.3 10^{-14} (95\% CL), and an indication (3.5 \sigma) to nonzero ALP-photon coupling, g_{a\gamma}=(6.5 +1.0 -1.2) 10^{-11} GeV^{-1}. Given the precision of contemporary observational data, it is imperative to refine ALP constraints through more sophisticated analyses, which will be explored in detail elsewhere.</description>

      <title>Scattering of mesons and emergence of tetraquarks in two-dimensional QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scattering of two mesons is considered in the framework of two-dimensional QCD in the large-$N_c^{}$ limit with four different quark flavors. The scattering takes place through two coupled channels, corresponding to direct and quark-exchange processes, which are of order $O(N_c^{-2})$ and $O(N_c^{-1})$, respectively. Finiteness of the scattering amplitudes to order $N_c^{-2}$ is pointed out. The theory reduces, at low energies, to an effective theory of mesons, interacting by a quark-exchange process, by means of a contact term. The unitarization of the scattering amplitudes leads to the emergence of a tetraquark bound state, located very close to the lowest two-meson elastic threshold.</description>

      <title>Do heavy Monopoles hide from us ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dirac showed that the existence of one magnetic pole in the universe could offer an explanation of the discrete nature of the electric charge. Magnetic poles appear naturally in most grand unified theories. Their discovery would be of greatest importance for particle physics and cosmology. The intense experimental search carried thus far has not met with success. In order to understand this lack of success we studied monopolium a monopole anti-monopole bound state with properties very different from monopoles in which monopoles could be hiding. In here, we propose another mechanism, namely that magnetic poles bind deeply with some neutral states hiding in this way some of the properties of the free monopoles. We study different scenarios of these systems and analyze their detectability. In particular, one scenario is very interesting because it leads to a light state, an analog of an electron with magnetic instead of electric charge, which we call magnetron.</description>

      <title>The Landau Bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We advocate a strategy of bootstrapping Feynman integrals from just knowledge of their singular behavior. This approach is complementary to other bootstrap programs, which exploit non-perturbative constraints such as unitarity, or amplitude-level constraints such as gauge invariance. We begin by studying where a Feynman integral can become singular, and the behavior it exhibits near these singularities. We then characterize the space of functions that we expect the integral to evaluate to, in order to formulate an appropriate ansatz. Finally, we derive constraints on where each singularity can appear in this ansatz, and use information about the expansion of the integral around singular points in order to determine the value of all remaining free coefficients. Throughout, we highlight how constraints that have previously only been derived for integrals with generic masses can be extended to integrals involving particles of equal or vanishing mass. We illustrate the effectiveness of this approach by bootstrapping a number of examples, including the four-point double box with a massive internal loop.</description>

      <title>Slow it down: axion-photon conversion down to the non-relativistic regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the presence of a magnetic field, axions can convert into photons and viceversa. The phenomenology of the conversion is captured by a system of two coupled Klein-Gordon equations, which, assuming that the axion is relativistic, is usually recast into a pair of first order Schr\"odinger-like equations. In such a limit, focusing on a constant magnetic field and plasma frequency, the equations admit an exact analytic solution. The relativistic limit significantly simplifies the calculations; therefore, it is widely used in phenomenological applications. In this work, we discuss how to evaluate the axion-photon system evolution without relying on such relativistic approximation. In particular, we give an exact analytical solution, valid for any axion energy, in the case that both the magnetic field and plasma frequency are constant. Moreover, we devise an analytic perturbative expansion that allows for tracking the conversion probability in a slightly inhomogeneous magnetic field or plasma frequency, whose characteristic scale of variation is much larger than the typical axion-photon oscillation length. Finally, we discuss a case of resonant axion-photon conversion giving useful simplified formulae that might be directly applied to dark matter axions converting in neutron star magnetospheres.</description>

      <title>Looking for WIMPs through the neutrino fogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the expected sensitivity of large-scale xenon detectors to Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). Assuming current primary noise sources can be mitigated, we find that with the present discrimination power between nuclear and electron recoils, the experimental sensitivity is limited not only by atmospheric neutrinos' nuclear recoils (''nuclear recoil neutrino fog'') but also by solar neutrinos' electron-recoil events (''electron recoil neutrino fog''). While this is known by experimentalists, it is often missed or misunderstood by theorists, and we therefore emphasize this effect. We set up a realistic detector simulation to quantify the contamination of the WIMP signal from both these neutrino backgrounds. We observe that the electron-recoil background remains significant even for signal rates exceeding those of atmospheric neutrinos, as predicted by most electroweak WIMP candidates. We update the projections for the required exposure to exclude/discover a given electroweak WIMP, streamlining the computation of their signal rates and uncertainties. We show that all of the real WIMPs with zero hypercharge can be excluded (discovered) with a 50 tonne year (300 tonne year) exposure. A similar exposure will allow to probe a large portion of the viable parameter space for complex WIMP with non-zero hypercharge.</description>

      <title>Transverse Energy-Energy Correlator for Vector Boson-Tagged Hadron Production in $pp$ and $pA$ collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the transverse energy-energy correlator (TEEC) event-shape observable for back-to-back $\gamma + h$ and $Z + h$ production in both $pp$ and $pA$ collisions. Our study incorporates nuclear modifications into the transverse-momentum dependent (TMD) factorization framework, with resummation up to next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) accuracy, for TEEC as a function of the variable $\tau = \left(1 + \cos{\phi} \right)/2$, where $\phi$ is the azimuthal angle between the vector boson and the final hadron. We analyze the nuclear modification factor $R_{pA}$ in $p\mathrm{Au}$ collisions at RHIC and $p\mathrm{Pb}$ collisions at the LHC. Our results demonstrate that the TEEC observable is a sensitive probe for nuclear modifications in TMD physics. Specifically, the changes in the $\tau$-distribution shape provide insights into transverse momentum broadening effects in large nuclei, while measurements at different rapidities allow us to explore nuclear modifications in the collinear component of the TMD parton distribution functions in nuclei.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Driven by the Cohen-Kaplan-Nelson Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we confront the bound on an ultraviolet cutoff (UV) of a quantum field theory (QFT) proposed by Cohen, Kaplan, and Nelson (CKN) with the latest results of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). The former relates the UV cutoff with an infrared (IR) cutoff of the theory, only using general entropy arguments. Identifying now the IR cutoff with the Hubble horizon yields a time-varying contribution of the vacuum energy to the dark energy density of the universe. At the same time the DESI results in combination with other cosmological data point towards a preference of time-varying dark energy models with regard to $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Analytic Bounds on the Spectrum of Crossing Symmetric S-Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive two rigorous constraints on the spectrum of massive states in weakly coupled theories with massless scalars in the adjoint representation of a large-$N$ gauge group. First, we show that the presence of massive spinning states necessitates the existence of lighter states with lower spins. Explicitly, if there exists a massive state with spin $J &gt; 2$, then there must be a state with spin $J-1$ and a non-zero mass lower than that of the lightest spin-$J$ state, a state with spin $J-2$ and a mass lower than that of the lightest spin-($J-1$) particle and so on until we reach a mass below which only states with spin less than 2 are exchanged. Second, we find strict upper bounds on the masses of the lightest states at any spin. If there are spin-$J$ states in the spectrum, the maximum mass of the lightest spin-($J+1$) state is determined by the masses of the lightest spin-$J$ and $(J-1)$ states. In the approximation that this bound applies to pion scattering in real world QCD, we find it gives a window of only ${\sim}150$ MeV for the expected mass of the yet unmeasured spin-7 meson.</description>

      <title>Geometric realization from irrelevant deformations induced by the stress-energy tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the deformations driven by the stress-energy tensor $T$ and investigate their relation to the flow equation for the background metric at the classical level. For a deformation operator $\mathcal O$ as a polynomial function of the stress-energy tensor, we develop a formalism that relates a deformed action to a flow equation for the metric in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. It is shown that in the $T\bar{T}$ deformation and the $\mathcal O(T)=\text{tr}[\textbf{T}]^m$ deformation, the flow equations for the metric allow us to directly obtain exact solutions in closed forms. We also demonstrate the perturbative approach to find the same results. As several applications of the $\mathcal O(T)=\text{tr}[\textbf{T}]^m$ deformation, we discuss the relation between the deformations and gravitational models. Besides, the deformations of Lagrangians for scalar field theories are performed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) from the early Universe that can contribute to dark matter (DM) abundance have been linked to gravitational wave observations. Super-massive black holes (SMBHs) at the centers of galaxies are expected to modify distribution of DM in their vicinity, and can result in highly concentrated DM spikes. We revisit PBH merger rates in the presence of DM spikes, tracking their history. We find novel peaked structure in the redshift-evolution of PBH merger rates at low redshifts around $z \sim 5$. These effects are generic and are present for distinct PBH mass functions and spike profiles, and also can be linked to peaked structure in redshift evolution of star formation rate. Redshift evolution characteristics of PBH merger rates can be distinguished from astrophysical black hole contributions and observable with gravitational waves, enabling them to serve as probes of DM in galactic centers.</description>

      <title>The three phases of self-gravitating scalar field ground states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is generally assumed that scalar field dark matter halos would contain solitonic cores -- spherically symmetric ground state configurations -- at their centers. This is especially interesting in the case of ultralight dark matter (ULDM), where the solitons sizes are on the order of galaxies. In this work, we show that the paradigm of a spherically symmetric soliton embedded in the center of each halo is not universally valid in a scenario with multiple interacting scalar fields. In particular, sufficiently strong repulsive interspecies interactions make the fields immiscible. In such models, the ground state configuration can fall into a number of different phases that depend on the fields' relative densities, masses, and interaction strengths. This raises the possibility that the inner regions of ULDM halos are more complex and diverse than previously assumed.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factors of glueballs in Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents preliminary results of the first determination of the energy-momentum tensor form factors of the scalar glueball, referred to as gravitational form factors (GFFs). The calculation has been carried out in lattice Yang-Mills theory at a single lattice spacing. Using variationally optimized operators, the matrix elements are extracted from ratios of three-point functions to two-point functions. The glueball GFFs and their kinematic dependence are compared to those of other hadrons from previous calculations.</description>

      <title>Exploring neutrino masses, $(g-2)_{\mu, e}$ in type I+II seesaw in ${L^{}_e-L^{}_{\alpha}}$ gauge extended model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.04066v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to explore the implications of $U(1)_{L_e-L_{\alpha}}$ gauge symmetries, where $\alpha=\tau, \mu$, in the neutrino sector through the type-(I+II) seesaw mechanisms. To achieve such a hybrid framework, we include a scalar triplet and three right-handed neutrinos. The model can successfully account for the active neutrino masses, mixing angles, mass squared differences, and the CP-violating phase within the $3 \sigma$ bounds of NuFit v5.2 neutrino oscillation data. The presence of new gauge boson at the MeV scale provides an explanation for the muon and electron $(g-2)$ within the confines of their experimental limits. Furthermore, we scrutinize the proposed models in the context of upcoming long-baseline neutrino experiments such as DUNE, P2SO, T2HK, and T2HKK. The findings reveal that P2SO and T2HK have the ability to probe both the models in their $5 \sigma$ allowed oscillation parameter region, whereas DUNE and T2HKK can conclusively test only model with $U(1)_{L_e-L_\mu}$- symmetry within their $5 \sigma$ parameter space if the true values of the oscillation parameters remain consistent with NuFit v5.2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for massive parton evolution which is based on the differentially accurate simulation of soft-gluon radiation by means of a non-trivial azimuthal angle dependence of the splitting functions. The kinematics mapping is chosen such as to to reflect the symmetry of the final state in soft-gluon radiation and collinear splitting processes. We compute the counterterms needed for a fully differential NLO matching and discuss the analytic structure of the parton shower in the NLL limit. We implement the new algorithm in the numerical code Alaric and present a first comparison to experimental data.</description>

Abstract: The matrix element method is the LHC inference method of choice for limited statistics. We present a dedicated machine learning framework, based on efficient phase-space integration, a learned acceptance and transfer function. It is based on a choice of INN and diffusion networks, and a transformer to solve jet combinatorics. We showcase this setup for the CP-phase of the top Yukawa coupling in associated Higgs and single-top production.</description>

      <title>Quantum tomography of helicity states for general scattering processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum tomography has become an indispensable tool in order to compute the density matrix $\rho$ of quantum systems in Physics. Recently, it has further gained importance as a basic step to test entanglement and violation of Bell inequalities in High-Energy Particle Physics. In this work, we present the theoretical framework for reconstructing the helicity quantum initial state of a general scattering process. In particular, we perform an expansion of $\rho$ over the irreducible tensor operators $\{T^L_M\}$ and compute the corresponding coefficients uniquely by averaging, under properly chosen Wigner D-matrices weights, the angular distribution data of the final particles. Besides, we provide the explicit angular dependence of both the normalised differential cross section and the generalised production matrix $\Gamma$. Finally, we re-derive all our previous results from a quantum-information perspective using the Weyl-Wigner-Moyal formalism and we obtain in addition simple analytical expressions for the Wigner $P$ and $Q$ symbols.</description>

      <title>Study of Long Range Force in P2SO and T2HKK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we have studied the sensitivity of the future long-baseline neutrino experiments P2SO and T2HKK to the long-range force (LRF). In the context of these two experiments, our aim is to study: (i) the capability to put bounds on the LRF parameters, (ii) effect of LRF in the measurement of standard oscillation parameters and (iii) capability to constrain the mass of the new gauge boson and the value of new coupling constant, that gives rise to LRF due to matter density in Sun. In our study, we find that among the different neutrino experiments, the best bound on the LRF parameters including mass of the new gauge boson and the value of new coupling constant will come from the P2SO experiment. Our study also shows that LRF has non-trivial effect on the determination of the standard neutrino oscillation parameters except the precision of $\Delta m^2_{31}$. For this parameter, the precision remains unaltered in the presence of LRF for both these experiments.</description>

      <title>Kinetic theory of vacuum pair production in uniform electric fields revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of electron-positron pair production from vacuum in the presence of a uniform time-dependent electric field of arbitrary polarization. Taking into account the interaction with the external classical background in a nonperturbative manner, we quantize the electron-positron field and derive a system of ten quantum kinetic equations (QKEs) showing that the previously-used QKEs are incorrect once the external field rotates in space. We employ then the Wigner-function formalism of the field quantization and establish a direct connection between the Dirac-Heisenberg-Wigner (DHW) approach to investigating the vacuum pair-production process and the QKEs. We provide a self-contained description of the two theoretical frameworks rigorously proving their equivalence and present an exact one-to-one correspondence between the kinetic functions involved within the two techniques. Special focus is placed on the analysis of the spin effects in the final particle distributions.</description>

Abstract: We have studied the charge and heat transport properties of a hot and dense QCD matter using a novel approximation method within the quasiparticle model. Utilizing the novel collision integrals for both the relaxation time approximation (RTA) and the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) models, we have solved the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation to estimate the electrical conductivity and the thermal conductivity of the medium. We have investigated the temperature dependence of these transport coefficients. We have also provided a comparison between our findings and those of the standard RTA and standard BGK models. Further, we have explored the temperature dependence of the thermal diffusion constant and the Lorenz number using the novel approaches of the aforesaid models.</description>

      <title>Spatial resolution of dijet photoproduction in near-encounter ultraperipheral nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present next-to-leading order perturbative QCD predictions for inclusive dijet photoproduction in ultra-peripheral nucleus-nucleus collisions (UPCs) within the impact-parameter dependent equivalent photon approximation. Taking into account the finite size of both the photon-emitting and the target nucleus, we show that this process is sensitive to the transverse-plane geometry of the UPC events. We show that this leads to a sizeable, 20-40% effect for large values of the $z_\gamma$ variable in the dijet photoproduction cross section in lead-lead UPCs at 5.02 TeV compared to the widely-used pointlike approximation where the nuclear radius is accounted for only as a sharp cut-off in the photon flux calculation. This resolution of the spatial degrees of freedom is a result of having high-transverse-momentum jets in the final state, which at the large-$z_\gamma$ kinematics requires a highly energetic photon in the initial state, thus biasing the collisions to small impact-parameter ''near-encounter'' configurations. We further discuss the role of the forward-neutron event-class selection in isolating the photonuclear cross section in the nucleus-nucleus collisions, and employ the needed electromagnetic breakup survival factor in our predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A number of new four-quark states containing from one to four charm or anti-charm quarks have been observed recently. Many of these new states have been discovered at the LHC. The production of these states via intrinsic charm in the proton is investigated. The tetraquark masses obtained in this approach, while dependent on the internal transverse momenta of the partons in the state, are shown to agree well with the measured masses. These calculations can provide some insight into the nature of the tetraquark candidates, whether as a bound meson pair or as a looser configuration of four individual partons. The kinematic distributions of these states as a function of rapidity and transverse momentum are also studied. The possible cross sections for these states are finally considered.</description>

Focusing on models of dipole inelastic Dark Matter and active-sterile neutrino dipole interactions, we compute the corresponding expected sensitivities finding promising prospects for discovery already with $\sim10^{17}$ proton-on-target, corresponding to the present accumulated dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02219v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study for the first time the production of charmonia in nuclear ultra-peripheral and electron-ion collisions based on a rigorous Green function formalism. Such formalism allows to incorporate properly formation effects (color transparency), as well as the quantum coherence inherent in higher twist shadowing corrections related to the $|Q \bar{Q}\rangle$ Fock component of the photon. The leading twist gluon shadowing associated with multi-gluon photon fluctuations is also included within the same formalism. The later effect represents the dominant source of shadowing at mid rapidities in the LHC kinematic region, while the reduced effect of quark shadowing leads to a significant modification of differential cross sections $d\sigma/dy$ at forward and/or backwards rapidities. Model calculations for $d\sigma/dy$ are in a good agreement with available UPC data on coherent charmonium production at RHIC and the LHC. In addition, we also perform predictions for nuclear effects in the electroproduction of charmonia, which can be verified by new data from electron-ion colliders.</description>

      <title>Model-independent analysis of new physics effects in $B\rightarrow K^*_2(1430)\mu^+ \mu^-$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the LHCb Collaboration provided updated measurements for the lepton flavour ratios $R_K$ and $R_{K^*}$. The currently observed values align with the predictions of the standard model. In light of these recent updates, our investigation delves into the repercussions of new physics characterized by universal couplings to electrons and muons. We specifically focus on their impact on various observables within the $B\to K_2^*(1430)(\to K\pi)\mu^+ \mu^-$ decay. These observables include the differential branching ratio, forward-backward asymmetry ($A_{FB}$), longitudinal polarization asymmetry ($F_L$), and a set of optimized observables ($P_i$). Our findings indicate that the branching ratio of $B\to K_2^*(\to K\pi)\mu^+ \mu^-$ decay can be suppressed up to $25\%$ for various new physics solutions. Furthermore, all permissible new physics scenarios demonstrate finite enhancement in the muon forward-backward asymmetry $(A_{FB})$ as well as an increase in the value of the optimized angular observable $P_2$. Moreover, in the presence of new physics zero crossing points for $A_{FB}$ and $P_2$ shift towards higher $q^2$. The current data have a mild deviation from SM predictions in $P_5'$ observable in the low-$q^2$ bin. We also explored massive $Z'$ models, which can generate universal 1D new physics scenarios, characterized by $C_9^{NP}&lt;0$, $C_9^{NP}=-C_{10}^{NP}$, and $C_9^{NP}=-C_9'$. Using additional constraints coming from $B_s-\overline{B_s}$ mixing and neutrino trident process, we find that the conclusions of the model-independent analysis remain valid.</description>

      <title>Novel two component dark matter features in the $Z_2 \times Z_2$ 3HDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the constraints and phenomenology of the $Z_2 \times Z_2$ three Higgs doublet model (3HDM) with two inert scalars, originating two dark matter (DM) particles. We elucidate the competing vacua and we submit the model to all theoretical and current experimental constraints. We find unexplored regions of parameter space and investigate their experimental signatures. In particular, we find regions where the two DM particles contribute equally to the relic DM density.</description>

      <title>Axion signals from neutron star populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutron stars provide a powerful probe of axion dark matter, especially in higher frequency ranges where there remain fewer laboratory constraints. Populations of neutron stars near the Galactic Centre have been proposed as a means to place strong constraints on axion dark matter. One downside of this approach is that there are very few direct observations of neutron stars in this region, introducing uncertainties in the total number of neutron stars in this ``invisible" population at the Galactic Centre, whose size must be inferred through birth rate modelling. We suggest this number could also be reduced due to stellar dynamics carrying stars away from the Galactic Centre via large kick velocities at birth. We attempt to circumvent the uncertainty on the Galactic Centre population size by modelling the axion signal from better understood populations outside the Galactic Centre using {\tt PsrPopPy} which is normalised against pulsar observations. We consider lower-frequency, wider-angle searches for this signal via a range of instruments including MeerKAT and SKA-low but find that the sensitivity is not competitive with existing constraints. Finally, returning to the Galactic Centre, we compare populations to single objects as targets for axion detection. Using the latest modelling of axion-photon conversion in the Galactic Centre magnetar, we conclude that within astrophysical uncertainties, the Galactic Centre population and the magnetar could give comparable sensitivities to axion dark matter, suggesting one should continue to search for both signals in future surveys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I obtain the effective K\"ahler potential at three-loop order for a general renormalizable supersymmetric theory containing only chiral supermultiplets. The three-loop contribution is remarkably simple, consisting of only four terms involving three distinct renormalized master integrals. In the case of the Wess-Zumino model with a single chiral superfield, I also obtain the effective auxiliary field potential at three-loop order, extending previous results at one-loop order. The method used is inferential, relying on existing knowledge of the ordinary scalar effective potential.</description>

      <title>An FONLL prescription with coexisting flavor number PDFs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new prescription to account for heavy quark mass effects in the determination of parton distribution functions (PDFs) based on the FONLL scheme. Our prescription makes explicit use of the freedom to choose the number of active flavors at a given scale and, thus, use coexisting PDFs with different active flavor number. This new prescription is perturbatively equivalent to the former but improves the implementation in two ways. First, it can be naturally generalized to account simultaneously for multiple heavy quark effects, such as charm and bottom effects, which can both be relevant at the same scale due to the small mass difference. Second, it can be trivially generalized to use at any fixed-order or collinear resummed accuracy, while previous prescriptions required ad-hoc expansions of the DGLAP evolution kernels for each coefficient. We supplement the paper with codes for the computation of deep inelastic scattering observables in this new prescription.</description>

Abstract: The inclusive tagging method is a highly efficient reconstruction approach, especially in beauty-physics experiments. In this Letter, we introduce an innovative inclusive-tagging scheme that is capable of capturing the four-momentum of an undetected particle on the signal side, such as a neutrino, K_L^0, etc., in collider experiments. This proposed scheme, based on an asymptotically recursive vector sequence, has the potential to catalyze a significant transformation in the capabilities of the inclusive tagging method and might also have promising applications in other fields.</description>

      <title>Assessing Uncertainties in Parton Showers at Double Logarithmic Accuracy for Jet Quenching Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper assesses the uncertainties inherent to parton shower simulations at double logarithmic accuracy, with a focus on their impact on jet quenching studies in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. For that purpose, we developed a massless quark-initiated vacuum parton shower toy-model with different evolution variables, such as inverse formation time, invariant squared mass, and squared opening angle. In addition to the effects of varying the ordering variable we further examine their corresponding kinematic reconstructions. The results highlight how these variations influence key distributions, including the number of splittings, angular and transverse momentum distribution of subsequent emissions. We also analyse the Lund distributions and their average trajectories, revealing that the choice of ordering variable has a significantly greater impact on the vacuum parton shower evolution than the kinematic scheme, particularly in large-angle emission regions. When a simple jet quenching model based on decoherence is implemented, we observe that the fraction of quenched events is sensitive to the ordering prescription, especially for the first splitting and thin media, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of the branching process in the presence of an extended QCD media.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the clean cusp, seen in the $\eta \pi$ mass distribution with high precision of the $\chi_{c1} \to \eta \pi^+ \pi^-$ reaction in the BESIII experiment, with the aim of making a precise determination of the scattering length $a$ and effective range $r_0$ of $K^+ \bar{K}^{0}$. For that, we follow a previous theoretical work that gave a good reproduction of these data using the chiral unitary approach for the meson-meson interaction, and allow some flexibility in the input to carry a better fit to the data. The important task of determining the uncertainties in the scattering parameters is done using the resampling method and an accuracy in $a$ and $r_0$ is obtained better than $20\%$. The effective range is determined for the first time with this analysis.</description>

      <title>Impact of dark boson mediated feeble interaction between dark matter and hadronic matter on $f$-mode oscillation of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We studied the possible presence of dark matter (DM) in neutron stars (NSs) and the structural properties of the DM admixed NSs (DMANSs) in one of our recent works \cite{Guha:2024pnn}. The feeble interaction between the fermionic DM ($\chi$) with the hadronic matter is introduced through a dark scalar ($\phi$) and a dark vector ($\xi$) boson as mediators. The allowed range of the mass of the fermionic DM ($m_{\chi}$), for a particular range of DM Fermi momentum ($k_F^{\chi}$), was obtained in the same work \cite{Guha:2024pnn} with respect to the various astrophysical constraints on the structural properties of compact stars viz. the mass, radius and tidal deformability. The present work is dedicated to the calculation and study of non-radial oscillation of the DMANSs using Cowling approximation. We particularly investigate the effect of presence of DM on the fundamental ($f$) mode oscillation frequencies of the DMANSs utilizing the previously obtained range of $m_{\chi}$ for four different hadronic models. In this work we thoroughly investigate how the individual and combined effects of $m_{\chi}$ and $k_F^{\chi}$ affect the $f$-mode oscillation frequency. Within the framework of our DMANS models, for a particular value of $k_F^{\chi}$, the range of $f_{max}^{DMANS}$ with respect to the allowed range of $m_{\chi}$, is also obtained in the present work for four different hadronic models. Since in the present era, the 1.4 and 2.01 $M_{\odot}$ NSs are of special interest after the detection of GW170817 and PSR J0740+6620, we particularly investigate, for the four hadronic models, the range of $f_{1.4}^{DMANS}$ and $f_{2.01}^{DMANS}$ with respect to the acceptable range of $m_{\chi}$ corresponding to the range of $k_F^{\chi}$.</description>

      <title>Machine learning a fixed point action for SU(3) gauge theory with a gauge equivariant convolutional neural network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fixed point lattice actions are designed to have continuum classical properties unaffected by discretization effects and reduced lattice artifacts at the quantum level. They provide a possible way to extract continuum physics with coarser lattices, thereby allowing one to circumvent problems with critical slowing down and topological freezing toward the continuum limit. A crucial ingredient for practical applications is to find an accurate and compact parametrization of a fixed point action, since many of its properties are only implicitly defined. Here we use machine learning methods to revisit the question of how to parametrize fixed point actions. In particular, we obtain a fixed point action for four-dimensional SU(3) gauge theory using convolutional neural networks with exact gauge invariance. The large operator space allows us to find superior parametrizations compared to previous studies, a necessary first step for future Monte Carlo simulations and scaling studies.</description>

      <title>Exploring Spin Polarization of Heavy Quarks in Magnetic Fields and Hot Medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relativistic heavy-ion collisions give rise to the formation of both deconfined QCD matter and a strong magnetic field. The spin of heavy quarks is influenced by interactions with the external magnetic field as well as by random scatterings with thermal light partons. The presence of QCD matter comprising charged quarks can extend the lifetime and strength of the magnetic field, thereby enhancing the degree of heavy quark polarization. However, the random scatterings with QCD matter tend to diminish heavy quark polarization. In this study, we utilize the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation to investigate both these contributions. Taking into account the realistic evolutions of medium temperatures and the in-medium magnetic fields at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), we observe that heavy quark polarization is limited by the short lifetime of the magnetic field and the high temperatures of the medium. Furthermore, we explore the mass dependence of quark polarization, revealing that the polarization degree of strange quarks is much larger than that of charm quarks.</description>

Abstract: The generation of charged pions, kaons, and protons from proton beam incident on Carbon at 31 GeV/c is calculated and compared with the results of the NA61/SHINE experiment. Predictions of the single charged particle yield by proton off the Carbon target is calculated using the Giessen Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (GiBUU) model and compared with the recent data of the EMPHATIC hadron scattering and production experiment for incident proton beam energies of 20, 30, and 120 GeV/c within $\pm$20 mrad with respect to the beam particle. We present the analysis for the single and double differential cross-sections for the produced particles at various scattering angles and conduct a comprehensive comparison with the experimental data. These studies show significant agreement with the measured data.</description>

      <title>Observational test for $f(Q)$ gravity with weak gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we confront a class of $f(Q)$ gravity models with observational data of galaxy-galaxy lensing. Specifically, we consider the $f(Q)$ gravity models containing a small quadratic correction when compared with General Relativity (GR), and quantify this correction by a model parameter $\alpha$. To derive the observational constraints, we start by extracting the spherically symmetric solutions which correspond to the deviations from the Schwarzschild solution that depends on the model parameter in a two-fold way, i.e., a renormalized mass and a new term proportional to $r^{-2}$. Then, we calculate the effective lensing potential, the deflection angle, the shear component, and the effective Excess Surface Density (ESD) profile. After that, we employ the group catalog and shape catalog from the SDSS DR7 for the lens and source samples respectively. Moreover, we handle the off-center radius as a free parameter and constrain it using the MCMC. Concerning the deviation parameter from GR we derive $\alpha=1.202^{+0.277}_{-0.179}\times 10^{-6} {\rm Mpc}^{-2}$ at 1 $\sigma$ confidence level, and then compare the fitting efficiency with the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm by applying the AIC and BIC information criteria. Our results indicate that the $f(Q)$ corrections alongside off-center effects yield a scenario that is slightly favored.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supergeometric Quantum Field Theories (SG-QFTs) are theories that go beyond the standard supersymmetric framework, since they allow for general scalar-fermion field transformations on the configuration space of a supermanifold, without requiring an equality between bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom. After revisiting previous considerations, we extend them by calculating the one-loop effective action of minimal SG-QFTs that feature non-zero fermionic curvature in two and four spacetime dimensions. By employing an intuitive approach to the Schwinger-DeWitt heat-kernel technique and a novel field-space generalised Clifford algebra, we derive the ultra-violet structure of characteristic effective-field-theory (EFT) operators up to four spacetime derivatives that emerge at the one-loop order and are of physical interest. Upon minimising the impact of potential ambiguities due to the so-called multiplicative anomalies, we find that the EFT interactions resulting from the one-loop supergeometric effective action are manifestly diffeomorphically invariant in configuration space. The extension of our approach to evaluating higher-loops of the supergeometric quantum effective action is described. The emerging landscape of theoretical and phenomenological directions for further research of SG-QFTs is discussed.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Scattering and Beyond from Extreme Mass Ratio Effective Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a recently proposed effective field theory describing electromagnetically or gravitationally interacting massive particles in an expansion about their mass ratio, also known as the self-force (SF) expansion. By integrating out the deviation of the heavy particle about its inertial trajectory, we obtain an effective action whose only degrees of freedom are the lighter particle together with the photon or graviton, all propagating in a Coulomb or Schwarzschild background. The 0SF dynamics are described by the usual background field method, which at 1SF is supplemented by a "recoil operator" that encodes the wobble of the heavy particle, and similarly computable corrections appearing at 2SF and higher. Our formalism exploits the fact that the analytic expressions for classical backgrounds and particle trajectories encode dynamical information to all orders in the couplings, and from them we extract multiloop integrands for perturbative scattering. As a check, we study the two-loop classical scattering of scalar particles in electromagnetism and gravity, verifying known results. We then present new calculations for the two-loop classical scattering of dyons, and of particles interacting with an additional scalar or vector field coupling directly to the lighter particle but only gravitationally to the heavier particle.</description>

      <title>PT symmetric fermionic particle oscillations in even dimensional representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a novel class of quantum mechanical particle oscillations in both relativistic and non-relativistic systems based on $PT$ symmetry and $T^2=-1$ (relevant for fermions), where $P$ is parity and $T$ is time reversal. The Hamiltonians are chosen at the outset to be self-adjoint with respect to a PT inner product. The quantum mechanical time evolution is based on a modified $CPT$ inner product constructed in terms of a suitable $C$ operator. The resulting quantum mechanical evolution is shown to be unitary and probability is conserved by the oscillations.</description>

      <title>Incoherent solar-neutrino scattering off the stable Tl-isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclear-structure calculations for the description of low-energy neutral-current neutrino scattering off the stable $^{203,205}$Tl isotopes are performed in the context of the nuclear shell model using the model space jj56pn. Cross-section and event-rate calculations focusing on inelastic solar-neutrino scattering off $^{203,205}$Tl are performed. The individual contributions of the various nuclear responses are presented and discussed, and the results are also illustrated in terms of the nuclear recoil energy. Analytical expressions entering the cross sections are given in order to achieve a direct connection with experimental observables.</description>

      <title>Probing QGP droplets with charmonium in high-multiplicity proton-proton collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the hot medium effects in high-multiplicity proton-proton (pp) collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=13$ TeV via the charmonium probes. The hot medium is described with the hydrodynamic model, while charmonium evolutions in the medium are studied with a time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. The hot medium dissociation on charmonium is considered with the temperature-dependent complex potential parametrized with the results from lattice QCD calculations. The ratio $\sigma_{\psi(2S)}/\sigma_{J/\psi}$ of $J/\psi$ and $\psi(2S)$ production cross sections are calculated and compared with the LHCb experimental data in pp collisions. Our calculations explain the charmonium relative suppression in different transverse momentum and multiplicity bins. The suppression of this ratio is mainly affected by the effects of the deconfined medium. It is less affected by the initial effects before the generation of the heavy quark pair. We suggest this to be a clear signal of the small QGP droplets generated in high multiplicity pp collisions.</description>

      <title>Extreme softening of QCD phase transition under weak acceleration: first principle Monte Carlo results for gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of gluon plasma subjected to a weak acceleration using first-principle numerical Monte Carlo simulations. We use the Luttinger (Tolman-Ehrenfest) correspondence between temperature gradient and gravitational field to impose acceleration in imaginary time formalism. Under acceleration, the system resides in global thermal equilibrium. Our results indicate that even the weakest acceleration up to $a \simeq 27$ MeV drastically softens the deconfinement phase transition, converting the first-order phase transition of a static system to a soft crossover for accelerating gluons. The accelerating environment can be relevant to the first moments of the early Universe and the initial glasma regime of relativistic heavy ion collisions. In particular, our results imply that the acceleration, if present, may also inhibit the detection of the thermodynamic phase transition from quark-gluon plasma to the hadronic phase.</description>
