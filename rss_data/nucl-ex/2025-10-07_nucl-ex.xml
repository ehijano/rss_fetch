      <title>Exploring the Origin of Anisotropy in Small Systems: From Symmetric (O+O) to Asymmetric (d+Au) Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This contribution reports STAR measurements of azimuthal anisotropies in produced particle distributions of the d+Au and $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV, probing the origin of collectivity in small systems. We test the hydrodynamic response of the produced medium by comparing these systems with vastly different initial geometries. The measured elliptic ($v_2$) and triangular ($v_3$) anisotropies, and their event-by-event fluctuations, scale robustly with initial-state eccentricities, consistent with the hydrodynamic behavior expected from a Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) droplet formed in these collisions. The result also helps constrain the role of sub-nucleon fluctuations in determining the initial conditions. Second, the wide pseudorapidity coverage of the STAR detector is used to investigate longitudinal dynamics. Correlations across different rapidity gaps show no significant impact from flow decorrelation, but non-flow contributions are substantial and require careful subtraction.</description>

      <title>Possibility of Inducing $^{241}$Am Fluctuations (Primakoff Photon-Magnetic Field Coupling Experiment)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reports on results from an experiment designed to search for exotic particles interacting with nuclear matter. These particles could be created through the Primakoff coupling between photons and an external magnetic field. Theory suggests this coupling leads to the production of weakly interacting particles (e.g. axions) that are important to understanding the lack of a measured neutron electric dipole moment (nEDM). The current experiment has been run to look for evidence of weakly interacting particles, created by photons propagating through a magnetic field, by studying their influence on the measured decay spectrum of Americium (241Am). The results shown here reflect a statistically significant difference (sigma &gt; 6.0) between observed decays when the experiment was run in a mode that allowed photons to traverse a magnetic field (light mode or sP for system-Photons) when compared to a second mode where the light was blocked from entering the cavity (dark mode or sD for system-Dark). This difference was observed to impact the count rate for the release of a 59.54keV gamma from 237Np. Repeated experimentation suggests the effect is robust and not due to spurious changes in background events. This could be confirmation that the Primakoff mechanism has been observed for visible photons. As importantly, this experiment looks at the possibility to develop a novel nuclear instrument that can modify nuclear decay rates.</description>

      <title>Status of the PrimEx $\eta$ experiment at Jefferson Lab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The GlueX detector in the experimental Hall $D$ at Jefferson Lab offers a unique opportunity to perform a measurement of the decay width of eta mesons through the Primakoff effect. The PrimEx $\eta$ experiment complements the physics program at Jefferson Lab on measuring the decay width of light pseudoscalar mesons via the Primakoff process. The goal of PrimEx $\eta$ is to measure differential cross sections of $\eta$ mesons at forward angles using a beam of tagged photons incident on a liquid ${}^{4}{\rm He}$ target. The data will be used for the extraction of the decay width. This measurement is vital for understanding fundamental properties like the ratios of the light quark masses and the $\eta$-$\eta^\prime$ mixing angle, and will provide an important test of chiral symmetry breaking in QCD. Our experimental results will help reduce uncertainties on partial widths of all other $\eta$ decays. The experiment collected data during three physics runs between 2019 and 2022. We will give an overview of the PrimEx $\eta$ experiment and the current status of our data analyses. We will also discuss the feasibility of conducting future Primakoff measurements in light of the recent upgrade of the GlueX forward calorimeter and the potential accelerator energy upgrade to 22 GeV.</description>

      <title>Proton Pandemonium: A first look at the $^{31}$Cl($\beta p \gamma$)$^{30}$P decay scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positron decays of proton-rich nuclides exhibit large $Q$ values, producing complex cascades which often involve various radiations, including protons and $\gamma$ rays. Often, only one of the two are measured in a single experiment, limiting the accuracy and completeness of the decay scheme. An example is $^{31}$Cl, for which protons and $\gamma$ rays have been measured in detail individually but never with substantial sensitivity to proton-$\gamma$ coincidences. The purpose of this work is to provide detailed measurements of $^{31}$Cl $\beta$-delayed proton decay including $\beta$-$p$-$\gamma$ sequences, extract spectroscopic information on $^{31}$S excited states as well as their $\beta$ feeding, and compare to shell-model calculations. A fast, fragmented beam of $^{31}$Cl provided was deposited in the Gaseous Detector with Germanium Tagging (GADGET) system. GADGET's gas-filled Proton Detector was used to detect $beta$-delayed protons, and the Segmented Germanium Array (SeGA) was used to detect $\beta$-delayed $\gamma$ rays. Up to 18 previously unobserved $\beta$-delayed proton transitions have been discovered, most of which populate excited states of $^{30}$P. Here present the first detailed $^{31}$Cl($\beta p \gamma$)$^{30}$P decay scheme and find improved agreement with theoretical calculations of the Gamow-Teller strength distribution for $^{31}$S excitation energies $7.5 &lt; E_x &lt; 9.5$ MeV. The present work demonstrates that the capability to detect $\beta$-delayed protons and $\gamma$ rays in coincidence is essential to construct accurate positron decay schemes for comparison to theoretical nuclear structure calculations. In some respects, this phenomenon for $\beta$-delayed protons resembles the pandemonium effect originally introduced for $\beta$-delayed $\gamma$ rays.</description>

      <title>The challenging first direct measurement of the 65 keV resonance strength in the $^{17}$O(p,$\gamma$)$^{18}$F reaction at LUNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A precise determination of the proton capture rates on oxygen is mandatory to predict the abundance ratios of oxygen isotopes in a stellar environment where the hydrogen burning is active. The 17O(p,{\gamma})18F reaction, in particular, plays a crucial role in AGB nucleosynthesis as well as in explosive hydrogen burning occurring in novae and type I supernovae. At the temperature of interest for the former scenario (from 20 MK to 80 MK) the main contribution to the astrophysical reaction rate comes from the Er = 64.5 keV resonance. The strength of this resonance is presently determined only through indirect measurements, with an adopted value {\omega}{\gamma} = 16(3) peV. A new high sensitivity setup has been installed at LUNA, located at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso. The underground location of LUNA 400kV guarantees a reduction of the cosmic ray background by several orders of magnitude. The residual background was further reduced by a dedicated shielding. On the other hand the 4{\pi}BGO detector efficiency was optimized installing an aluminum target chamber and holder. With about 400 C accumulated on Ta2O5 targets, highly enriched in 17O, the LUNA collaboration has performed the first ever direct measurement of the 64.5 keV resonance strength.</description>

      <title>Spectral Measurement of the $^{214}$Bi beta-decay to the $^{214}$Po Ground State with XENONnT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the measurement of the $^{214}$Bi beta-decay spectrum to the ground state of $^{214}$Po using the XENONnT detector. This decay is classified as first-forbidden non-unique, for which theoretical predictions require detailed nuclear structure modeling. A dedicated identification algorithm isolates a high-purity sample of ground-state beta-decays, explicitly excluding events with associated gamma-rays emission. By comparing the measured spectrum, which covers energies up to 3.27 MeV, with several nuclear models, we find that the prediction based on the conserved vector current (CVC) hypothesis provides the best description of the data. Using this dataset, we additionally derive charge and light yield curves for electronic recoils, extending detector response modeling up to the MeV scale.</description>

      <title>Valence $1s-0d$ proton vacancy of the $^{32}$Si ground state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $^{32}$Si($^3$He,$d$)$^{33}$P reaction was studied in inverse kinematics at 6.3~MeV/$u$. States in $^{33}$P corresponding to the proton $1s-0d$ single-particle orbitals were identified up to $\sim$4.5 MeV in excitation energy. The ($^{3}$He,$d$) spectroscopic factors were determined from Distorted Wave Born Approximation calculations. When combined with complementary neutron-adding data, the $1s-0d$ proton vacancies in the $^{32}$Si ground state were extracted. In conjunction with a re-analysis of data from previous single-particle measurements, the trends in proton and neutron vacancy were explored across the $^{28,30,32,34}$Si isotopes. Both proton and neutron vacancy data show gradual changes in their occupancies. The proton $1s_{1/2}$ orbitals in $^{32}$Si and $^{34}$Si are both consistent with being empty. The ground-state nucleon distributions are described by shell-model calculations constrained to the $1s-0d$ model space.</description>

      <title>First Demonstration that Quark-Gluon Plasma has a Nonzero Resolution Length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on our investigation in arXiv:2509.08881 of how recent jet substructure measurements constrain the resolution length $L_{\rm res}$ of the quark-gluon plasma formed in heavy-ion collisions. $L_{\rm res}$ is defined such that high-energy partons within a jet shower are resolved by the medium if and only if they are separated by a distance greater than $L_{\rm res}$. Using the Hybrid Model, we reproduce ALICE data on the scaled Soft Drop angle $\theta_g$ for $R=0.2$ charged-particle jets and ATLAS data on the Hard Group angle $\Delta R_{12}$ for $R=1$ jets reclustered from skinny $R = 0.2$ inclusive subjets. We find that the narrowing of the $\theta_g$-distribution in PbPb collisions observed by ALICE and the suppression of $R=1$ jets with multiple skinny subjets in PbPb collisions observed by ATLAS rule out $L_{\rm res} = \infty$, where each entire parton shower loses energy to the plasma coherently as if it were a single colored object. We then compare Hybrid Model calculations to ATLAS measurements of $R_{\rm AA}$ of $R=1$ jets reclustered from $R=0.2$ subjets, as a function of the Soft Drop angle $dR_{12}$ obtained by grooming all charged-particle tracks associated with each $R=1$ jet. We demonstrate, for the first time, that the ATLAS data is inconsistent with $L_{\rm res} = 0$, where the plasma resolves every splitting in a parton shower. Our results agree best with the data when QGP possesses a finite, nonzero $L_{\rm res}\sim (1-2)/(\pi T)$.</description>

      <title>Installation and first commissioning results of the JEF lead tungstate calorimeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL), consisting of 1,596 lead tungstate scintillating crystals, has been recently constructed and installed in Experimental Hall D at Jefferson Lab (JLab). The calorimeter is a key component of the JLab Eta Factory Experiment, whose main goal is to measure the decays of eta and eta prime mesons into multi-photon final states. The ECAL replaces the inner part of the former forward lead-glass calorimeter. Scintillation light from each crystal is detected using Hamamatsu R4125 photomultiplier tubes. Calorimeter modules were fabricated and tested in the lab using light from light-emitting diodes before being installed in the detector frame. The detector is currently undergoing commissioning using the light monitoring system and cosmic rays. We will present an overview of the fabrication and testing of the calorimete modules, along with the first detector commissioning results. The ECAL was ready for data-taking in spring 2025.</description>

Abstract: The Beryllium Electron capture in Superconducting Tunnel junctions (BeEST) experiment uses superconducting tunnel junction (STJ) sensors to search for physics beyond the standard model (BSM) with recoil spectroscopy of the $\mathbf{^7}$Be EC decay into $\mathbf{^7}$Li. A pulsed UV laser is used to calibrate the STJs throughout the experiment with $\sim$20 meV precision. Phase-III of the BeEST experiment revealed a systematic calibration discrepancy between STJs. We found these artifacts to be caused by resistive crosstalk and by intensity variations of the calibration laser. For phase-IV of the BeEST experiment, we have removed the crosstalk by designing the STJ array so that each pixel has its own ground wire. We now also use a more stable UV laser for calibration. The new STJ arrays were fabricated at STAR Cryoelectronics and tested at LLNL and FRIB. They have the same high energy resolution of $\sim$1\textendash2~eV in the energy range of interest below 100~eV as before, and they no longer exhibit the earlier calibration artifacts. We discuss the design changes and the STJ array performance for the next phase of the BeEST experiment.</description>

      <title>Flavor, transverse momentum, and azimuthal dependence of charged pion multiplicities in SIDIS with 10.6 GeV electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurements of SIDIS multiplicities for $\pi^+$ and $\pi^-$ from proton and deuteron targets are reported on a grid of hadron kinematic variables $z$, $P_{T}$, and $\phi^{*}$ for leptonic kinematic variables in the range $0.3&lt;x&lt;0.6$ and $3&lt;Q^2&lt;5$ GeV$^2$. Data were acquired in 2018-2019 at Jefferson Lab Hall C with a 10.6~GeV electron beam impinging on 10-cm-long liquid hydrogen and deuterium targets. Scattered electrons and charged pions were detected in the HMS and SHMS spectrometers, respectively. The multiplicities were fitted for each bin in $(x,~Q^2,~z,~P_{t})$ to extract the $\phi^{*}$ independent $M_0$ and the azimuthal modulations $\langle \cos(\phi^{*}) \rangle$ and $\langle \cos(2\phi^{*}) \rangle$. The $P_t$-dependence of the $M_0$ results was found to be remarkably consistent for the four cases studied: $ep\rightarrow e \pi^+ X$, $ep\rightarrow e \pi^- X$, $ed\rightarrow e \pi^+ X$, $ed\rightarrow e \pi^- X$ over the range $0&lt;P_t&lt;0.4$ GeV, as were the multiplicities evaluated near $\phi^* = 180^\circ$ over the extended range $0&lt;P_t&lt;0.7$ GeV. The Gaussian widths of the $P_t$-dependence exhibit a quadratic increase with $z$. The $\cos(\phi^{*})$ modulations were found to be consistent with zero for $\pi^+$, in agreement with previous world data, while the $\pi^-$ moments were, in many cases, significantly greater than zero. The $\cos(2\phi^{*})$ modulations were found to be consistent with zero. The higher statistical precision of this dataset compared to previously published data should allow improved determinations of quark transverse momentum distributions and higher twist contributions.</description>

Abstract: We report on the conversion of the Manitoba II mass spectrometer into a versatile proton beam facility. This infrastruc- ture is adaptable to any detector-under-test (DUT), and has proven itself effective with the characterization of silicon detectors used in subatomic beyond-the-Standard-Model (BSM) searches.

      <title>Lead tungstate calorimeter of the Jefferson Lab Eta Factory experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) consisting of 1596 lead tungstate PbWO$_{\rm 4}$ scintillating crystals has been fabricated and installed in the experimental Hall D at Jefferson Lab (JLab). The high-granularity, high-resolution calorimeter is required by the JLab Eta Factory experiment, whose main physics goal is to study rare decays of eta mesons. The ECAL replaced the inner part of the forward lead glass calorimeter of the GlueX detector. Signals from the detector will be digitized using twelve-bit flash analog-to-digital converters operated at a sampling rate of 250 MHz. The ECAL is integrated into the trigger system of the GlueX detector using electronics modules designed at JLab. The ECAL is currently at the commissioning stage and should be ready for the physics run in January 2025. We will give an overview of the JEF experiment, the design and construction of the ECAL, and the integration of the detector and its infrastructure into the Hall D experimental setup.</description>

      <title>Measurement of $\Lambda$ Polarization in the $\pi^{-}p \to K^{0} \Lambda$ Reaction at $p_{\pi^{-}}=1.33$ GeV/$c$ toward a New $\Lambda p$ Scattering Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18598v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents high-precision experimental data of the polarization of the $\Lambda$ hyperon in the $\pi^{-}p \to K^{0} \Lambda$ reaction, measured in the angular range $0.6&lt;\cos \theta ^{CM}_{K0}&lt;1.0$ with a fine bin width of $d\cos \theta ^{CM}_{K0}=0.05$. The data were obtained from the J-PARC E40 experiment at the K1.8 beamline in the J-PARC Hadron Experimental Facility. The observed average polarization of $\Lambda$ in the range $0.60&lt;\cos \theta ^{CM}_{K0}&lt;0.85$ was $0.932 \pm 0.058 \,(\text{stat}) \pm 0.028 \,(\text{syst})$, demonstrating the successful extraction of precise polarization observables. This result provides essential experimental input for partial wave analysis (PWA) of dynamical coupled-channel (DCC) models, which aim to uncover the underlying mechanisms of $N^{*}$ resonances that emerge in intermediate states of $\pi N$ and $\gamma N$ interactions. Besides, it indicates the feasibility of a strongly polarized $\Lambda$ beam suitable for future $\Lambda p$ scattering experiments (e.g., J-PARC E86).</description>

      <title>$A_{\beta}[E_{\beta}]$ in $^{37}$K decay: new physics with opposite $\beta$ helicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11502v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By extending our analysis and simulations of our $^{37}$K $\beta$-decay data set to allow the $\beta$ asymmetry with respect to nuclear spin to vary with $\beta$ energy $E_{\beta}$, we have gained sensitivity to new physics that depends on a helicity factor for the $\beta$, $m_\beta/E_\beta$.
  In particular, we constrain Lorentz scalar and tensor quark-lepton interaction strengths at a sensitivity complementary to the similar Fierz interference term in neutron $\beta$ decay.
  Our result for that new physics is
  $b_F$ = 0.033 $\pm$ 0.084 (stat) $\pm$ 0.039 (syst),
  consistent with the standard model electroweak interaction value $b_F=0$. We consider presently achieved complementarity to $\beta$-decay and particle physics experiments, along with projectable technical improvements to our method.</description>

      <title>Radiopurity screening of materials for rare event searches by neutron activation at the TRIGA reactor of Pavia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the framework of physics experiments searching for rare events, the selection of extremely radiopure materials is a challenging task, as the signal of interest is often hidden by instrumental background. Neutron activation is a powerful technique to measure trace contaminants with high sensitivity but, to be properly applied, it requires a good characterization of neutron irradiation and $\gamma$-spectroscopy facilities. This paper presents the state-of-the-art workflow adopted by the Radioactivity Laboratory of the University of Milano-Bicocca for radiopurity screening of materials by neutron activation performed at the TRIGA reactor in Pavia. The ultimate sensitivity of the described workflow, in the absence of interfering activation products and without the application of radiochemical and/or active background rejection techniques, is $&lt;10^{-14}$ g/g for $^{40}$K, $&lt;10^{-12}$ g/g for $^{238}$U and of the order of $10^{-12}$ g/g for $^{232}$Th contaminations. Further details are here provided to address systematic uncertainties related to neutron irradiation that may bias results. To this aim, a dedicated neutron activation campaign was performed and the data were analyzed exploiting a Monte Carlo simulation model of the reactor and applying an unfolding technique to obtain a comprehensive characterization of the neutron flux in typical irradiation configurations. The results of this work provide a valuable benchmark for the application of neutron activation in future radiopurity screening campaigns.</description>

      <title>Probing new hadronic forces with heavy exotic atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the potential of precision spectroscopy of heavy exotic atoms where electrons are substituted by negative hadrons to detect new force carriers with hadronic couplings. The selected transitions are unaffected by nuclear contact terms, thus enabling highly accurate calculations using bound-state QED, provided that the nuclear polarization is under control. Alternatively, we demonstrate that the dipole polarizability, a fundamental property of nuclei, can be extracted from the spectroscopy of exotic atoms in a novel way by combining two transitions while maintaining high sensitivity to new physics. Based on existing data, we extracted world-leading bounds on mediator masses ranging from $0.1\,$MeV to $10\,$MeV for two benchmark models and show that forthcoming experiments could enhance the sensitivity to new physics by two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Richardson-Lucy Deconvolution and Data Unfolding with Mean Integrated Square Error Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10283v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two maximum likelihood-based algorithms for unfolding or deconvolution are considered: the Richardson-Lucy method and the Data Unfolding method with Mean Integrated Square Error (MISE) optimization [10]. Unfolding is viewed as a procedure for estimating an unknown probability density function. Both external and internal quality assessment methods can be applied for this purpose. In some cases, external criteria exist to evaluate deconvolution quality. A typical example is the deconvolution of a blurred image, where the sharpness of the restored image serves as an indicator of quality. However, defining such external criteria can be challenging, particularly when a measurement has not been performed previously. In such instances, internal criteria are necessary to assess the quality of the result independently of external information. The article discusses two internal criteria: MISE for the unfolded distribution and the condition number of the correlation matrix of the unfolded distribution. These internal quality criteria are applied to a comparative analysis of the two methods using identical numerical data. The results of the analysis demonstrate the superiority of the Data Unfolding method with MISE optimization over the Richardson-Lucy method.</description>

      <title>Exploring the fluid behavior in p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13 \mathrm{TeV}$ with viscous anisotropic hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The applicability of hydrodynamics in small collision systems remains controversial due to the small size and short lifetime of the system. In this letter, we employ viscous anisotropic hydrodynamics (VAH), which incorporates large pressure anisotropies, to study the collectivity in p+p collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13 \mathrm{TeV}$.VAH provides a good description for $v_{2}\{2\}$ and $v_{3}\{2\}$ over a wide range of multiplicities and correctly reproduces the experimentally observed negative $c_{2}\{4\}$. Traditional second-order viscous hydrodynamics (VH), on the other hand, can describe the measurements, in particular the negative $c_{2}\{4\}$, only with model parameters for which the bulk of the evolution is characterized by large values of the shear Knudsen number. It also can not capture the large longitudinal/transverse pressure anisotropy during the early evolution. These demonstrate the failure of traditional viscous hydrodynamics in small collision systems and establish viscous anisotropic hydrodynamics as a more reliable framework to describe the bulk evolution and the observed anisotropic flow in p-p collisions at the LHC.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive view of nuclear shapes, rotations and vibrations from fully quantum mechanical perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nuclear quadrupole collective states at low excitation energies are described in a novel, fully quantum mechanical and systematic manner as compared to traditional pictures initiated by Aage Bohr. The ellipsoidal shapes are shown to be triaxial in virtually all strongly deformed nuclei, in contrast to the Ansatz of axially symmetric shapes. The rotational bands of such triaxially deformed nuclei are described in a fully quantum mechanical way, i. e., without resorting to quantized free rotation of rigid body. The excitation energies within a rotational band, exhibiting the $J(J+1)$ dependence on angular momentum $J$, are shown to basically represent the change of binding energies due to nuclear forces. This differs from the interpretation \'a la Aage Bohr as rotational kinetic energies. The $K$ quantum numbers are shown to be practically conserved for triaxial ellipsoids, which turned out to be a real but positive surprise to many people in the field. The so-called $\gamma$ bands are shown to be $K$=2$^+$ rotations rather than $\gamma$-vibrations, leading to a nice description of the so-called $\gamma\gamma$ 4$^+$ state as a $K$=4$^+$ rotation. Vibrational modes are also shown to emerge in this study. Thus, the whole picture of low-energy quadrupole collective motion of heavy nuclei has been renewed in a fully quantum mechanical fashion, which differs from the traditional picture but appears to be simpler and more natural.</description>
