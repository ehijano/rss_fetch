      <title>A Polarization Hall Effect in Hydrated DNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how biological soft matter responds to electromagnetic fields under ambient conditions remains a central challenge, as thermal fluctuations are generally expected to suppress long-range organization. Here, we report that hydrated DNA exhibits a reproducible magnetic-field-induced transition characterized by a sharp transverse-voltage threshold (40-50 mV), followed by a regime of regular, phase-stable oscillations in the transverse polarization signal. These features emerge only beyond the threshold and display a pronounced temperature dependence, consistent with the formation of a collective mode within the hydrogen-bond network of the DNA-water interface. Motivated by recent studies of Hall-like responses carried by neutral excitations, including phonons, magnons, and excitons, we interpret the observed transverse signal in terms of coherent polarization dynamics of proton-proton-hole dipoles confined to a quasi-two-dimensional hydrated layer. Within this framework, the transverse response is attributed to a field-organized polarization mode; the measured transverse voltage arises from collective dipolar dynamics rather than steady carrier transport. These results identify hydrated DNA as a soft-matter system in which magnetic field and temperature jointly modulate collective polarization dynamics, providing a biologically relevant platform for exploring coherence and transverse responses in hydrogen-bonded media.</description>

      <title>Noise enhances odor source localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of inferring the location of a target that releases odor in the presence of turbulence. Input for the inference is provided by many sensors scattered within the odor plume. Drawing inspiration from distributed chemosensation in biology, we ask whether the accuracy of the inference is affected by proprioceptive noise, i.e., noise on the perceived location of the sensors. Surprisingly, in the presence of a net fluid flow, proprioceptive noise improves Bayesian inference, rather than degrading it. An optimal noise exists that efficiently leverages additional information hidden within the geometry of the odor plume. Empirical tuning of noise functions well across a range of distances and may be implemented in practice. Other sources of noise also improve accuracy, owing to their ability to break the spatiotemporal correlations of the turbulent plume. These counterintuitive benefits of noise may be leveraged to improve sensory processing in biology and robotics.</description>

      <title>Fluoride doping into SiO2-MgO-CaO bioactive glass nanoparticles: bioactivity, biodegradation and biocompatibility assessments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this research, for the first time, the structure, bioactivity, biodegradation and biocompatibility of SiO2-MgO-CaO glasses doped with different levels of fluoride were studied. The glassy powder samples were synthesized by a coprecipitation method followed by calcination at 500 C, where amorphicity and fluoride incorporation were verified by X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, respectively. The in vitro biomineralization and biodegradation of the samples were also investigated by electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. These assessments revealed that there is an optimum level of fluoride doping to meet the highest bioactivity. Remarkably, the same level of incorporation presented the foremost biocompatibility with respect to osteoblast-like MG-63 human cells, as realized by the MTT assay and cell attachment studies.</description>

      <title>Co-doping of silicate bioceramics as a potential strategy to further enhance mono-doping consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicate bioceramics have attracted significant attention in medical applications, particularly in hard tissue regeneration, because of their controllable chemical, physical, and biological functionalities, while ensuring biocompatibility. The coordination of silicate bioceramics with mono-dopants has been extensively studied to enhance their osteogenesis, angiogenesis, and antibacterial activity. However, the concept of employing dual or multiple co-doping to further enhance these biomaterials still demands more attention. This review paper originally focuses on the effect of chemical interactions among co-dopants and the principal constituents of the silicates, on the bio-behavior of these bioceramics. Additionally, future prospects of co-doped silicate bioceramics are outlined, including in vivo studies, clinical trials, and potential commercialization.</description>

      <title>A Pilot Kinematic Study on the Forehand Reverse Flick: Feasibility of a Novel Short Return Technique in Table Tennis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background Following changes in table tennis ball materials, offensive returns have become more important for initiating sustained topspin offense. However, using the backhand flick (BF) to return forehand short balls often increases the difficulty of recovery and continuity, revealing a technical gap. This study preliminarily verified a novel forehand short return technique, the forehand reverse flick (FRF), and analyzed its similarities and differences with the BF. Methods Four elite athletes completed seven consecutive days of FRF specific training. Infrared motion capture and ultra-high-speed cameras were used to collect data on racket kinematics, movement duration, and ball performance. Results The success rate of the FRF increased steadily, reaching 86%. Racket trajectories of the two techniques were highly similar along the X (r = 1) and Y (r = 0.99) axes but differed along the Z (r = -0.04) axis. Racket and ball velocities were comparable between techniques, whereas the FRF showed lower resultant acceleration (approximately 265.57 m/s) and required about 0.03 s more for movement duration. Ball velocity was comparable between techniques, for the ball spin, the FRF generated lower spin (approximately 76.61 r/s) about 64% of the BF value (approximately 120.13 r/s). The highest participant mean spin rate reached 93 r/s, about 77% of the BF mean. Conclusion Overall, the FRF was found to have favorable learnability and training value, with potential for further optimization and competitive application.</description>

      <title>Contribution of Water to Pressure and Cold Denaturation of Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07594</link>
      <description>arXiv:1505.07594v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mechanisms of cold- and pressure-denaturation of proteins are matter of debate and are commonly understood as due to water-mediated interactions. Here we study several cases of proteins, with or without a unique native state, with or without hydrophilic residues, by means of a coarse-grain protein model in explicit solvent. We show, using Monte Carlo simulations, that taking into account how water at the protein interface changes its hydrogen bond properties and its density fluctuations is enough to predict protein stability regions with elliptic shapes in the temperature-pressure plane, consistent with previous theories. Our results clearly identify the different mechanisms with which water participates to denaturation and open the perspective to develop advanced computational design tools for protein engineering.</description>

      <title>Leak Proof PDBBind: A Reorganized Dataset of Protein-Ligand Complexes for More Generalizable Binding Affinity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09639v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The majority of machine learning scoring functions used in drug discovery for predicting protein-ligand binding poses and affinities have been trained on the PDBBind dataset. However, it is unclear whether these new scoring functions are actually an improvement over traditional models since often the training and test sets are cross-contaminated with proteins and ligands with high similarity, and hence they may not perform comparably well in binding prediction of unrelated protein-ligand complexes. In this work we have carefully prepared a new split of the PDBBind data set to control for data leakage, defined as proteins and ligands with high sequence and structural similarity. The resulting leak-proof (LP)-PDBBind data is used to retrain four popular SFs: AutoDock Vina, Random Forest (RF)-Score, InteractionGraphNet (IGN), and DeepDTA, to better test their capabilities when applied to new protein-ligand complexes. In particular we have formulated a new independent data set, BDB2020+, by matching high quality binding free energies from BindingDB with co-crystalized ligand-protein complexes from the PDB that have been deposited since 2020. Based on all the benchmark results, the retrained models using LP-PDBBind consistently perform better, with IGN especially being recommended for scoring and ranking applications for new protein-ligand systems.</description>

      <title>Pregnancy as a dynamical paradox: robustness, control and birth onset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00956v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The timing of human labor is among the most critical determinants of neonatal survival, yet the mechanisms that govern the transition from uterine quiescence to coordinated contractions remain elusive. Here we present a dynamical-systems framework that models the pregnant uterus as a spatially extended network of electrically excitable cells regulated by sparse adaptive feedback mimicking hormonal and mechanical influences. This approach reveals how stability during gestation and sensitivity near parturition can be simultaneously maintained through the interplay of control, network structure, and noise. Our analysis shows that spontaneous contractions such as Braxton-Hicks and Alvarez waves are not epiphenomena, but functional components that reduce control effort and preserve responsiveness. Moreover, we identify preterm labor as a boundary-crossing phenomenon arising when control fails to correctly interpret early-warning signals. These results establish a unifying mechanistic theory for labor onset, yield testable predictions, and suggest new therapeutic strategies to mitigate preterm birth risk.</description>

      <title>Surface Waves and Axoplasmic Pressure Waves in Action Potential Propagation: Fundamentally Different Physics or Two Sides of the Same Coin?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24580v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this commentary, we argue that El Hady and Machta's "surface wave" model for mechanical waves accompanying action potential (AP) propagation describes the same underlying process as the "axoplasmic pressure wave" model introduced earlier by Rvachev. Both models describe mechanical modes that store potential energy in the elastic components of the axon (axonal membrane, cytoskeleton, bulk axoplasmic deformation), with kinetic energy carried by the axoplasmic fluid and axoplasmic viscosity playing a significant role. The "surface wave" model quantitatively considers driving by the traveling electrical depolarization wave of the AP, whereas the "axoplasmic pressure wave" model qualitatively considers driving not only by the AP's electrical depolarization but also by other mechanisms, such as cytoskeletal actomyosin contractility. In addition, the "axoplasmic pressure wave" model considers mechanisms for synchronizing the depolarization wave and the pressure wave. Although derived using different approaches, the two models yield identical dependencies for the mechanical modes in key limits. The confusion in the literature, which treats these models as describing distinct processes, needs to be resolved to improve comprehensive understanding of the AP phenomenon and to guide future research.</description>

      <title>Irreversibility and symmetry breaking in the creation and annihilation of defects in active living matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active living matter continuously creates and annihilates topological defects in a process that remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate these dynamics in two distinct active living systems: swarming bacteria and human bronchial epithelial cells. Despite their entirely different evolutionary origins, biological functions, and physical scales, both systems exhibit half-integer defects, consistent with the nematic phase. However, in contrast to active nematic theory, we find that defect creation and annihilation undergoes spatial symmetry breaking. We propose that these results stem from a fundamental dualism between nematic structural organization and generated polar forces, which are intrinsic to living systems. Furthermore, estimation of entropy production reveals that creation and annihilation are not reversed processes. Our findings challenge conventional nematic models and emphasize the role of defect-mediated dynamics in non-equilibrium biological systems as a major source of entropy production.</description>

      <title>Volumetric ultrasound imaging with a sparse matrix array and integrated fiber-optic sensing for robust needle tracking in interventional procedures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11310v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate visualization of interventional devices, such as medical needles, is essential for the safe and effective guidance of minimally invasive procedures. Ultrasound (US) imaging is widely used for needle guidance, but the two-dimensional nature of most clinical probes limits accurate three-dimensional (3D) localization, particularly of the needle tip. We present a novel system that integrates volumetric US imaging with 3D needle tracking by combining a fiber-optic hydrophone embedded in the needle and a sparse spiral US array. Real-time volumetric imaging was achieved using plane-wave techniques, while precise needle tip tracking was enabled through communication between the probe and hydrophone. The feasibility of the approach was demonstrated using a nerve block training phantom. This proof-of-concept system enables simultaneous volumetric anatomical imaging and 3D needle tip tracking, with strong potential to enhance the efficacy and safety of image-guided interventional procedures.</description>

      <title>Sub-second A-scan Acquisition Using Marginal Spectral-Domain Quantum Optical Coherence Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report an optimized implementation of spectral-domain quantum optical coherence tomography (SD-QOCT) capable of acquiring axial scans (A-scans) of multilayer samples without in the absence of mechanical scanning, at an unprecedented speed. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept system that integrates a diffraction grating, a high-resolution intensified CCD camera, and a high-flux photon-pair source operating in the VIS-NIR region (810 nm). This configuration enables the acquisition of an entire marginal SD-QOCT interferogram in a single camera exposure, yielding a transverse A-scan with a record acquisition time of 100 ms and a penetration depth of 4 mm. The measured interferometric response shows excellent agreement with the theoretical model. These results represent a decisive step toward the practical deployment of SD-QOCT as a competitive imaging modality for biomedical applications.</description>
