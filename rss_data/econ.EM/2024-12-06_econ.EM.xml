      <title>On Extrapolation of Treatment Effects in Multiple-Cutoff Regression Discontinuity Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regression discontinuity (RD) designs typically identify the treatment effect at a single cutoff point. But when and how can we learn about treatment effects away from the cutoff? This paper addresses this question within a multiple-cutoff RD framework. We begin by examining the plausibility of the constant bias assumption proposed by Cattaneo, Keele, Titiunik, and Vazquez-Bare (2021) through the lens of rational decision-making behavior, which suggests that a kind of similarity between groups and whether individuals can influence the running variable are important factors. We then introduce an alternative set of assumptions and propose a broadly applicable partial identification strategy. The potential applicability and usefulness of the proposed bounds are illustrated through two empirical examples.</description>

      <title>Cubic-based Prediction Approach for Large Volatility Matrix using High-Frequency Financial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel method for predicting future large volatility matrices based on high-dimensional factor-based It\^o processes. Several studies have proposed volatility matrix prediction methods using parametric models to account for volatility dynamics. However, these methods often impose restrictions, such as constant eigenvectors over time. To generalize the factor structure, we construct a cubic (order-3 tensor) form of an integrated volatility matrix process, which can be decomposed into low-rank tensor and idiosyncratic tensor components. To predict conditional expected large volatility matrices, we introduce the Projected Tensor Principal Orthogonal componEnt Thresholding (PT-POET) procedure and establish its asymptotic properties. Finally, the advantages of PT-POET are also verified by a simulation study and illustrated by applying minimum variance portfolio allocation using high-frequency trading data.</description>

      <title>Matrix-based Prediction Approach for Intraday Instantaneous Volatility Vector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel method for predicting intraday instantaneous volatility based on Ito semimartingale models using high-frequency financial data. Several studies have highlighted stylized volatility time series features, such as interday auto-regressive dynamics and the intraday U-shaped pattern. To accommodate these volatility features, we propose an interday-by-intraday instantaneous volatility matrix process that can be decomposed into low-rank conditional expected instantaneous volatility and noise matrices. To predict the low-rank conditional expected instantaneous volatility matrix, we propose the Two-sIde Projected-PCA (TIP-PCA) procedure. We establish asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and conduct a simulation study to assess the finite sample performance of the proposed prediction method. Finally, we apply the TIP-PCA method to an out-of-sample instantaneous volatility vector prediction study using high-frequency data from the S&amp;P 500 index and 11 sector index funds.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Causal Effects in a Nonlinear World: the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Applied macroeconomists frequently use impulse response estimators motivated by linear models. We study whether the estimands of such procedures have a causal interpretation when the true data generating process is in fact nonlinear. We show that vector autoregressions and linear local projections onto observed shocks or proxies identify weighted averages of causal effects regardless of the extent of nonlinearities. By contrast, identification approaches that exploit heteroskedasticity or non-Gaussianity of latent shocks are highly sensitive to departures from linearity. Our analysis is based on new results on the identification of marginal treatment effects through weighted regressions, which may also be of interest to researchers outside macroeconomics.</description>
