      <title>Insights into the Long-term behavior of the optical polarization from the blazar 1ES 1959+650</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A high degree of linear polarization measured in the optical emission is an important observational feature of blazars. It provides strong evidence of the presence of relativistic particles and magnetic field ordering in the non-thermal emission regions of blazars owing to the synchrotron nature of low energy radiation. Thus, the polarization studies of blazars are emerging as a promising approach to probe the particle acceleration and the physical processes involved in their broadband emission. In this work, we investigate the behavior of the optical polarization of the blazar 1ES 1959+650 measured over a decade using the spectropolarimetry (SPOL) at the Steward Observatory. We use measurements of the degree of linear polarization and angle of polarization in the wavelength range 500 - 700 nm available during the period October 1, 2008 and June 30, 2018 (MJD 54739 - 58299) from the SPOL observations. Near simultaneous photometry data in the R and V bands are also used to study the optical emission from the source. The maximum degree of linear polarization, measured as $\sim$ 8.5$\%$, is significantly larger than the long term average value of $\sim$ 4.6$\%$. Analysis of the light curves indicates that the optical emission from the blazar 1ES 1959+650 is highly variable and variability in the degree of linear polarization can be quantified by a fractional variability amplitude of $\sim$ 39$\%$ over the period of about ten years. Long term optical emission in the R and V bands is very weakly anti-correlated with the degree of linear polarization. Modelling of the polarization due to the synchrotron emission suggests that the observed degree of linear polarization can be broadly reproduced by a power law distribution of relativistic electrons gyrating in a spherical emission region permeated with chaotic and ordered magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Rapid far-infrared spectral timing of X-ray binaries with PRIMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most powerful cosmic engines in our universe are fueled by compact objects. These objects accrete large amounts of material and eject matter in the form of jets. Recent groundbreaking discoveries of gravitational waves from merging compact objects and the direct imaging of the black hole shadows with the Event Horizon Telescope represent major steps forward in our understanding of such systems. However, there exists a large population of stellar-mass compact objects in our own Galaxy, present in X-ray binaries (XRBs), which provide better laboratories with which to study the processes of accretion and ejection. XRBs produce highly variable emissions on timescales ranging from milliseconds (for light-travel time in the region close to the compact object) to weeks (governing the mass-inflow process). Therefore, high-time resolution observations can be a powerful tool to study these systems. However, as XRBs emit across the electromagnetic spectrum, a suite of facilities is needed to take full advantage of these techniques. The PRIMA Observatory (PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics) will provide unique access to a wavelength range that has not been sampled in XRBs, representing an exciting new possibility for characterizing rapid time-domain phenomena of XRBs (and potentially other transient sources) in the far-infrared regime.</description>

      <title>L\'evy Flights and Leaky Boxes: Anomalous Diffusion of Cosmic Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In classical diffusion, particle step-sizes have a Gaussian distribution. However, in superdiffusion, they have power-law tails, with transport dominated by rare, long L\'evy flights. Similarly, if the time interval between scattering events has power-law tails, subdiffusion occurs. Both forms of anomalous diffusion are seen in cosmic ray (CR) particle tracking simulations in turbulent magnetic fields. They also likely occur if CRs are scattered by discrete intermittent structures. Anomalous diffusion mimics a scale-dependent diffusion coefficient, with potentially wide-ranging consequences. However, the finite size of galaxies implies an upper bound on step-sizes before CRs escape. This truncation results in eventual convergence to Gaussian statistics by the central limit theorem. Using Monte-Carlo simulations, we show that this occurs in both standard finite-thickness halo models, or when CR diffusion transitions to advection or streaming-dominated regimes. While optically thick intermittent structures produce power-law trapping times and thus subdiffusion, gaussianization also eventually occurs on timescales longer than the maximum trapping time. Anomalous diffusion is a transient, and converges to standard diffusion on the (usually short) timescale of particle escape, either from confining structures (subdiffusion), or the system as a whole (superdiffusion). Thus, standard assumptions of classical diffusion are physically justified in most applications, despite growing simulation evidence for anomalous diffusion. However, if escape times are long, this is no longer true. For instance, anomalous diffusion in the CGM or ICM would change CR pressure profiles. Finally, we show the standard diagnostic for anomalous diffusion, $\langle d^2 \rangle \propto t^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha \neq 1$, is not justified for truncated L\'evy flights, and propose an alternative robust measure.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical Shock Model of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that a hierarchical shock model$\unicode{x2014}$including supernova remnant shocks, galactic wind termination shocks, and accretion shocks around cosmic filaments and galaxy clusters$\unicode{x2014}$can naturally explain the cosmic ray spectrum from ~1 GeV up to ~200 EeV. While this framework applies to the entire cosmic ray spectrum, in this work, we focus on its implications for ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). We perform a hydrodynamic cosmological simulation to investigate the power processed at shocks around clusters and filaments. The downstream flux from nearby shocks around the local filament accounts for the softer, lower-energy extragalactic component around the ankle, and the upstream escaping flux from nearby clusters accounts for the transition to a hard spectral component at the highest energies. This interpretation is in agreement with UHECR observations. We suggest that a combination of early-Universe galactic outflows, cosmic ray streaming instabilities, and a small-scale turbulent dynamo can increase magnetic fields enough to attain the required rigidities. Our simulation suggests that the available volume-averaged power density of accretion shocks exceeds the required UHECR luminosity density by three orders of magnitude. We show that microgauss magnetic fields at these shocks could explain both the origin of UHECRs and the as-yet unidentified source of the diffuse radio synchrotron background below 10 GHz. The shock-accelerated electrons produce a hard radio background without overproducing diffuse inverse Compton emission. These results motivate further observational tests with upcoming facilities to help distinguish accretion shocks from other UHECR sources.</description>

      <title>Blast waves and reverse shocks: from ultra-relativistic GRBs to moderately relativistic X-ray binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blast wave models are commonly used to model relativistic outflows from ultra-relativistic gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), but are also applied to lower Lorentz factor ejections from X-ray binaries (XRBs). Here we revisit the physics of blast waves and reverse shocks in these systems and explore the similarities and differences between the ultra-relativistic ($\Gamma \gg 1$) and moderately relativistic ($\Gamma \sim$ a few) regimes. We first demonstrate that the evolution of the blast wave radius as a function of the observer frame time is recovered in the on-axis ultra-relativistic limit from a general energy and radius blast wave evolution, emphasizing that XRB ejections are off-axis, moderately relativistic cousins of GRB afterglows. We show that, for fixed blast wave or ejecta energy, reverse shocks cross the ejecta much later (earlier) on in the evolution for less (more) relativistic systems, and find that reverse shocks are much longer-lived in XRBs and off-axis GRBs compared to on-axis GRBs. Reverse shock crossing should thus typically finish after $\sim10-100$ days (in the observer frame) in XRB ejections. This characteristic, together with their moderate Lorentz factors and resolvable core separations, makes XRB ejections unique laboratories for shock and particle acceleration physics. We discuss the impact of geometry and lateral spreading on our results, explore how to distinguish between different shock components, and comment on the implications for GRB and XRB environments. Additionally, we argue that identification of reverse shock signatures in XRBs could provide an independent constraint on the ejecta Lorentz factor.</description>

      <title>Joint Radiative and Kinematic Modelling of X-ray Binary Ejecta: Energy Estimate and Reverse Shock Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black hole X-ray binaries in outburst launch discrete, large-scale jet ejections which can propagate to parsec scales. The kinematics of these ejecta appear to be well described by relativistic blast wave models original devised for gamma-ray burst afterglows. In previous kinematic-only modelling, a crucial degeneracy prevented the initial ejecta energy and the interstellar medium density from being accurately determined. In this work, we present the first joint Bayesian modelling of the radiation and kinematics of a large-scale jet ejection from the X-ray binary MAXI J1535-571. We demonstrate that a reverse shock powers the bright, early ejecta emission. The joint model breaks the energetic degeneracy, and we find a conservative initial ejecta energy of $E_{0} \sim 4 \times 10^{43} \, {\rm erg}$, consistent with the disc luminosity integrated over a flare-informed launching timescale, and a low interstellar medium density of $n_{\rm ism} \sim 5 \times 10^{-5} \, {\rm cm^{-3}}$. This work lays the foundation for future parameter estimation studies using all available data of X-ray binary jet ejecta.</description>

      <title>A FLASH on Blazars: Capturing the Radio Realm of 4FGL Blazars with SKAO Pathfinders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the multi-wavelength properties of 165 4FGL blazars from the Fermi-LAT fourth source catalogue, looking for with counterparts in the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) First Large Absorption Survey in HI (FLASH) continuum. Using high-resolution data from FLASH and complementary radio datasets, combined with archival Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations, we perform detailed spectral energy distribution (SED) analyses across cm-to-mm wavelengths. Our findings reveal that most blazars exhibit re-triggered peaked spectra, indicative of emission dominated by a single emitting region. Additionally, we identify strong correlations between radio and gamma-ray luminosities, highlighting the significant role of relativistic jets in these active galactic nuclei. The inclusion of spectroscopic redshifts from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Gaia enables a comprehensive analysis of the evolutionary trends and physical characteristics of the sources. Furthermore, we report a tight Radio-X-ray Correlation for Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars, contrasting with the more scattered behaviour observed in BL-Lacs, reflecting their distinct accretion and jet-driving mechanisms. These results provide critical insights into the physics of blazars and their environments, paving the way for future studies with next-generation facilities like the SKA Observatory (SKAO) for radio observations and Cherenkov Telescope Array for gamma-ray studies.</description>

      <title>Novel Methods for Simulating Astrophysical Plasmas and the Coherent Emission in Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present particle-in-cell simulations of one dimensional relativistic electromagnetic shocks in a uniform magnetic field, for a range of magnetic field strengths, plasma temperatures and numerical initial conditions. We show that the particle energy distributions of these shocks can develop a state of population inversion in the precursor and shock regions, which may allow for synchrotron maser (or maser-like, coherent) emission. Our set-up is applicable to conditions expected in models of fast radio bursts and therefore lends credence to the synchrotron maser model for these transients. We also show, for the first time, how a newly developed ``analytic particle pusher'' for kinetic simulations gives similar results to the commonly-used Boris pusher, but for larger timesteps and without the need to resolve the gyro-radius and gyro-period of the system. This has important implications for modeling astrophysical plasmas in extreme magnetic fields as well as for bridging scales between kinetic and fluid regimes.</description>

      <title>Cygnus X-3 as semi-hidden PeVatron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-mass X-ray binary Cygnus X-3 has been suggested for a long time to be a source of high-energy photons and neutrinos. In view of the increased sensitivity of current experiments, we examine the acceleration and interactions of high-energy cosmic rays (CRs) in this binary system, assuming that the compact object is a black hole. Using a test-particle approach in a Monte-Carlo framework, we employ as the basic CR acceleration mechanisms magnetic reconnection or 2.nd order Fermi acceleration and diffusive shock acceleration. We find that in all three scenarios CRs can be accelerated beyond PeV energies. High-energy photons and neutrinos are produced as secondaries in photo-hadronic interactions of CRs on X-ray photons and in the scattering on gas from the wind of the companion star. Normalising the predicted photon flux to the excess flux observed by LHAASO at energies above PeV in the direction of Cygnus X-3, a CR acceleration efficiency of $10^{-3}$ is sufficient to power the required CR luminosity. Our results suggest that the PeV photon flux from Cygnus X-3 could be in a bright phase significantly increased relative to the average flux of the last years.</description>

      <title>Validating and improving two-fluid simulations of the magnetic field evolution in neutron star cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the evolution of an axially symmetric magnetic field in the core of a neutron star. The matter in the core is modeled as a system of two fluids, namely neutrons and charged particles, with slightly different velocity fields, controlled by their mutual collisional friction. This problem was addressed in our previous work through the so-called ``fictitious friction'' approach. We study the validity of our previous work and improve it by comparing the fictitious friction approach to alternatives, making approximations that allow it to be applied to arbitrary magnetic field strengths and using realistic equations of state. We assume the neutron star crust to be perfectly resistive, so its magnetic field reacts instantaneously to changes in the core, in which we neglect the effects of Cooper pairing. We explore different approaches to solve the equations to obtain the velocities and chemical potential perturbations induced by a given, fixed magnetic field configuration in the core. We also present a new version of our code to perform time-evolving simulations and discuss the results obtained with it. Our calculations without fictitious friction further confirm that bulk velocity is generally much greater than ambipolar velocity, leading to faster evolution. These findings align with those with fictitious friction, validating this approach. We also find that, in the long term, the star evolves towards a barotropic ``Grad-Shafranov equilibrium,'' where the magnetic force is fully balanced by charged particle fluid forces. Qualitatively, the evolution and the final equilibrium are independent of the magnetic field strength $B$ and the equation of state considered. The timescale to reach this equilibrium is proportional to $B^{-2}$ and becomes shorter for equations of state with a smaller gradient of the ratio between the densities of protons and neutrons.</description>

      <title>Recent Highlights from the VERITAS AGN Discovery Program</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: VERITAS began full-scale operations in 2007 and it remains one of the world's most sensitive very-high-energy (VHE; E &gt;100 GeV) gamma-ray observatories. More than 8,300 hours (~50%) of its good-weather data were targeted on active galactic nuclei (AGN). Many of these observations were taken as part of an ongoing comprehensive program to discover new VHE AGN. Upon discovery, the VERITAS collaboration leverages VHE spectral and variability measurements, and accompanying broadband observations to probe the underlying jet-powered processes in AGN. Recent scientific highlights from the VERITAS AGN discovery program, including the VHE discoveries of B2 0912+29, 1ES 1028+511, 1ES 1118+424 and RBS 1366, are presented.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos as a new tool to characterise the Milky Way Centre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), a star-forming region rich in molecular clouds located within hundreds of parsecs from the centre of our Galaxy, converts gas into stars less efficient than anticipated. A key challenge in refining star-formation models is the lack of precise mapping of these dense molecular hydrogen clouds, where traditional tracers often yield inconsistent results due to environmental limitations. We demonstrate how, in the not-so-far future, neutrinos will emerge as a robust mass tracer thanks to advancements in neutrino telescopes. Since neutrinos are produced alongside gamma-rays when cosmic-rays interact with molecular clouds, they offer a complementary, systematics-independent measurement of the gas density. In an optimistic case where most gamma-ray emission from the Galactic Centre region originates from pion decays, we expect several tens of muon neutrinos to be detected in about two decades by KM3NeT, Baikal-GVD, and P-ONE combined, which will enable a better determination of the baryonic content in the Galactic Centre region. The CMZ will serve as a testbed to calibrate conventional tracers against neutrinos, ultimately improving gas measurements in distant galaxies, where neutrinos are undetectable, but traditional tracers remain available.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Future of Soft X-ray Polarimetry: the Capabilities of the REDSoX Instrument for XDINS and Magnetar Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray polarimetry offers a unique window into neutron star physics and can provide answers to questions that cannot otherwise be probed. The up-and-coming REDSoX sounding rocket mission will be the first experiment equipped with a detector able to explore polarized X-rays below 1 keV, observing in the 0.2-0.4 keV range. Although REDSoX will only be capable of short, one-off observations, it will crucially test the instrument performance. In this paper we investigate how a fully-fledged orbital mission with longer lifetime, based on an instrument design similar to REDSoX, will allow us to study thermal emission from the X-ray dim isolated neutron stars (XDINSs) and magnetars, probing their magnetic field and the physics of their outer surface layers, including vacuum effects and QED mode conversion at the vacuum resonance. We discuss the potentially observable features for promising values of the star's surface temperature, magnetic field, and viewing geometry. Assuming emission from the whole surface, we find that, for a source with a magnetic field B=5x10^{13} G and surface temperature T~10^7 K, the instrument can resolve a proton-cyclotron absorption feature in the spectrum with high significance when collecting ~25,000 counts across a single observation. Similarly, for a source with B=10^{14} G and T~10^7 K, a switch in the dominant polarization mode, caused by mode conversion at the vacuum resonance, can be detected by collecting ~25,000 counts, allowing for a long-sought observational test of the presence of QED effects. We then present two case studies for XDINS targets: RX J1856.5-3754 and RX J0720.4-3125.</description>

      <title>Tainted Love: Systematic biases from ignoring environmental tidal effects in gravitational wave observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary black hole systems are typically assumed to evolve in vacuum. However, the environment surrounding the binary components can influence their properties, such as their tidal deformability, affecting the gravitational waveform produced by the binary and its interpretation in gravitational wave data analysis. In this work we focus on next-generation experiments, such as the Einstein Telescope and LISA, and we quantify the systematic biases in gravitational wave observations that arise when tidally deformed binaries are interpreted as occurring in vacuum. We consider binaries over a range of masses and we compare different phenomenological models for the dynamical evolution of the tidal deformability. We find that systematic biases could significantly affect the measurability of the binary parameters if tidal effects are not carefully modeled.</description>

      <title>Parallel Collisionless Shocks in strongly Magnetized Electron-Ion Plasma. I. Temperature anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collisionless electron-ion shocks are fundamental to astrophysical plasmas, yet their behavior in strong magnetic fields remains poorly understood. Using Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations with the SHARP-1D3V code, we investigate the role of the ion magnetization parameter $\sigma_i$ in parallel shock transitions. Strongly magnetized converging flows ($\sigma_i &gt; 1$) exhibit lower density compression ratios ($R \sim 2$), smaller entropy jumps, and suppressed particle acceleration, while maintaining pressure anisotropy stability due to conserved perpendicular temperatures across the shock, alongside increased parallel temperatures. In contrast, weakly magnetized shocks drive downstream mirror and firehose instabilities due to ion temperature anisotropy, which are suppressed in strongly magnetized cases. Additionally, weakly magnetized shocks exhibit the onset of a supra-thermal population induced by shock-drift acceleration, with most of the upstream kinetic energy thermalized for both electrons and ions in the downstream region. Our results demonstrate that perpendicular temperatures for both species are conserved in strongly magnetized cases and highlight deviations from standard ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) behavior. These findings provide critical insights into the role of magnetic fields in parallel collisionless astrophysical shocks.</description>

      <title>Nearly a Decade of Groundbreaking Speckle Interferometry at the International Gemini Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since its inception, speckle interferometry has revolutionized high-resolution astronomical imaging, overcoming atmospheric challenges to achieve the diffraction limits of telescopes. Almost a decade ago, in 2018, a pair of speckle cameras -- 'Alopeke and Zorro -- were installed at the twin 8.1-meter Gemini North and South telescopes, two of the largest apertures in the world, in Hawai'i and Chile. Equipped with dual blue and red channels, 'Alopeke and Zorro deliver high-resolution imaging across optical bandpasses from 350 to 1000 nm, which has led to crucial discoveries in both stellar multiplicity and exoplanetary science. Furthermore, the broad and nonrestrictive access to these instruments, given by each Gemini Observatory partner and via the US NOIRLab open skies policy, has allowed our community to expand the applications of the instruments, supporting a wide range of scientific investigations from Solar System bodies, to morphological studies of stellar remnants, to evolved stars, to transient phenomena. This paper reviews the instrument technology and observational capabilities, and highlights key scientific contributions and discoveries of 'Alopeke and Zorro, emphasizing the enduring importance of speckle interferometry in advancing modern observational astronomy and expanding the frontiers of astronomical research.</description>

      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: The Development of Machine Learning Tools for Detecting Millimeter Sources in Timestream Pre-processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new machine learning algorithm for classifying short-duration features in raw time ordered data (TODs) of cosmic microwave background survey observations. The algorithm, specifically designed for the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), works in conjunction with the previous TOD preprocessing techniques that employ statistical thresholding to indiscriminately remove all large spikes in the data, whether they are due to noise features, cosmic rays, or true astrophysical sources in a process called "data cuts". This has the undesirable effect of excising real astrophysical sources, including transients, from the data. The machine learning algorithm demonstrated in this work uses the output from these data cuts and is able to differentiate between electronic noise, cosmic rays, and point sources, enabling the removal of undesired signals while retaining true astrophysical signals during TOD pre-processing. We achieve an overall accuracy of 90% in categorizing data spikes of different origin and, importantly, 94% for identifying those caused by astrophysical sources. Our algorithm also measures the amplitude of any detected source seen more than once and produces a sub-minute to minute light curve, providing information on its short timescale variability. This automated algorithm for source detection and amplitude estimation will be particularly useful for upcoming surveys with large data volumes, such as the Simons Observatory.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Constraints on SIGW with Future Pulsar Timing Array Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Arrays are playing a crucial role in the ongoing gravitational wave astronomy revolution. The current evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) at nHz frequencies offers an opportunity to discover cosmological signals and threatens the observability of other subdominant GWs. We explore prospects to constrain second-order scalar-induced GWs (SIGWs) associated with enhanced curvature perturbations in the primordial universe, forecasting realistic future PTA datasets. We assess how the currently observed signal could eventually limit future capabilities to search for GW relics of primordial phenomena and associated phenomenological consequences such as primordial black hole (PBH) formation. Given the sensitivity of PBH abundance to spectral parameters, measuring it remains a challenge for realistic signals. However, future observation could still rule out nearly subsolar mass PBHs formed through standard formation scenarios in some cases. Future progress in constraining PBH models is expected to stem from theoretical advancements in PBH computations, which should help resolve the tension between different computational methods. The analysis is based on and extends the Python code $\texttt{fastPTA}$.</description>

      <title>Near-infrared Spectral Properties of Type Ib/Ic Supernova Progenitors and Implications for JWST and NGRST Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While about 20 Type II supernova progenitors have been identified using optical data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), direct detection of type Ib/Ic supernova (SN Ib/Ic) progenitors remains challenging due to their faint optical brightness and highly obscured environments. This study aims to investigate the detection limits and advantages of near-infrared (near-IR) observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (NGRST) for the detection of SN Ib/Ic progenitors. The spectral energy distributions of SN Ib/Ic progenitor models with various masses, chemical compositions, and mass-loss rates are calculated with the non-LTE radiative transfer code CMFGEN. We then assess the detectability of SN Ib/Ic progenitors using near-IR filters from the JWST and the NGRST, comparing the results to the capabilities of the HST. Our analysis indicates that near-IR observations significantly outperform the HST in detecting SN Ib/Ic progenitors when considering the effect of extinction. Near-IR magnitudes also provide better constraints on the mass-loss rates of progenitors because of the free-free emission from the wind matter. Additionally, near-IR magnitudes and color-color diagrams are effective in distinguishing SN Ib/Ic progenitors from possible companion and/or background objects. This study suggests that the JWST and the NGRST can play a crucial role in advancing our understanding of SN Ib/Ic progenitors by improving detectability and offering better constraints on progenitor properties. We emphasize that observations with exposure times exceeding 1 hour would be needed to detect typical SNe Ib/Ic progenitors at distances greater than 10 Mpc.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing by non-self-intersecting vortons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present exact solutions to the Nambu-Goto equations for thin vortons stabilized by chiral currents. The solutions describe a class of non-self-intersecting, stationary loops with arbitrary shapes. In addition to the trivial circular and the Kibble-Turok vortons, we also derive a two-parameter family that incorporates the first, second, and third harmonic modes. We found that, in general, the vorton's constraints allow for constructing families of solutions with arbitrary harmonic modes. We further investigate the gravitational lensing effects associated with these solutions under the weak-field and thin-lens approximations. For circular vortons, the lensing exhibits a sharp discontinuity separating two regions with distinctly different distortions. The corresponding Einstein ring co-exist alongside an almost undistorted source image. This effect is significantly amplified in the case of non-circular vortons, highlighting their potential observational signatures.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning heat flux closure for multi-moment fluid modeling of nonlinear Landau damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear plasma physics problems are usually simulated through comprehensive modeling of phase space. The extreme computational cost of such simulations has motivated the development of multi-moment fluid models. However, a major challenge has been finding a suitable fluid closure for these fluid models. Recent developments in physics-informed machine learning have led to a renewed interest in constructing accurate fluid closure terms. In this study, we take an approach that integrates kinetic physics from the first-principles Vlasov simulations into a fluid model (through the heat flux closure term) using the Fourier neural operator - a neural network architecture. Without resolving the phase space dynamics, this new fluid model is capable of capturing the nonlinear evolution of the Landau damping process that exactly matches the Vlasov simulation results. This machine learning-assisted new approach provides a computationally affordable framework that surpasses previous fluid models in accurately modeling the kinetic evolution of complex plasma systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that alternative theories to the Standard Model allow -- and sometimes require -- fundamental constants, such as the fine-structure constant, $\alpha$, to vary in spacetime. We demonstrate that one way to investigate these variations is through the Mass-Radius relation of compact astrophysical objects, which is inherently affected by $\alpha$ variations. We start by considering the model of a polytropic white dwarf, which we perturb by adding the $\alpha$ variations for a generic class of Grand Unified Theories. We then extend our analysis to neutron stars, building upon the polytropic approach to consider more realistic equations of state, discussing the impact of such variations on mass-radius measurements in neutron stars. We present some constraints on these models based on current data and also outline how future observations might distinguish between extensions of the Standard Model.</description>

Compared to the early atlas release, we have extended the frequency range and have performed follow-up on the outliers. Conducting continuous wave searches is computationally intensive and time-consuming. The atlas facilitates the execution of new searches with relatively minimal computing resources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive scaling laws that connect certain macroscopic observables of strange quark stars with key microscopic properties of self-bound quark matter, such as the energy per baryon at zero pressure and the strength of repulsive interactions. We also identify universal relations linking global properties of strange quark stars - specifically, their moment of inertia, tidal deformability, and both gravitational and baryonic compactness. Remarkably, these relations hold for two substantially different microscopic models - the quark-mass density-dependent model with excluded-volume corrections and the vector MIT bag model - underscoring their robust, model-independent nature. We demonstrate that the universal relations for strange quark stars differ significantly from those previously established for neutron stars composed of hadronic matter, thus enabling discrimination between the two types of objects without requiring detailed knowledge of their equations of state. Moreover, observational constraints on the maximum mass of compact stars could place bounds on both the depth of quark-matter self-binding and the strength of quark repulsive interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axions or axion-like particles (ALPs) are one of the promising dark matter (DM) candidates. A prevalent method to detect axion-like DM is to seek periodic oscillation in the polarization angles (PAs) of linearly polarized light emitted from astrophysical sources. In this work, we use the time-resolved polarization measurements of the hyperactive repeating fast radio burst, FRB 20220912A, detected by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) to search for extragalactic axion-like DM. Given a DM density profile of FRB 20220912A's host, we obtain upper limits on the ALP-photon coupling constant of $g_{a \gamma}&lt;(3.4 \times 10^{-11}-1.9\times 10^{-9})\,\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ for the ALP masses $m_a \sim (1.4\times10^{-21}-5.2\times10^{-20})\,\mathrm{eV}$. Persistent polarimetric observations with FAST would extend the constraints to lower masses. Although the $g_{a \gamma}$ constraints derived from FRBs are less competitive than those from other methods, FRBs offer an alternative way to detect axion-like DM on extragalactic distance scales, complementary to galactic DM probes.</description>

      <title>The NANOGrav 15 yr data set: Posterior predictive checks for gravitational-wave detection with pulsar timing arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pulsar-timing-array experiments have reported evidence for a stochastic background of nanohertz gravitational waves consistent with the signal expected from a population of supermassive--black-hole binaries. Their analyses assume power-law spectra for intrinsic pulsar noise and for the background, as well as a Hellings--Downs cross-correlation pattern among the gravitational-wave--induced residuals across pulsars. These assumptions may not be realized in actuality. We test them in the NANOGrav 15 yr data set using Bayesian posterior predictive checks. After fitting our fiducial model to real data, we generate a population of simulated data-set replications. We use the replications to assess whether the optimal-statistic significance, inter-pulsar correlations, and spectral coefficients are extreme. We recover Hellings--Downs correlations in simulated data sets at significance levels consistent with the correlations measured in the NANOGrav 15 yr data set. A similar test on spectral coefficients shows that their values in real data are not extreme compared to their distributions across replications. We also evaluate the evidence for the stochastic background using posterior-predictive versions of the frequentist optimal statistic and of Bayesian model comparison, and find comparable significance (3.2 $\sigma$ and 3 $\sigma$ respectively) to what was previously reported for the standard statistics. We conclude with novel visualizations of the reconstructed gravitational waveforms that enter the residuals for each pulsar. Our analysis strengthens confidence in the identification and characterization of the gravitational-wave background.</description>

      <title>Light burden of memory: Constraining primordial black holes with high-energy neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07604v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies point out that quantum effects, referred to as "memory burden", may slow down the evaporation of black holes. As a result, a population of light primordial black holes could potentially survive to the present day, thus contributing to the energy density of dark matter. In this work, we focus on light primordial black holes with masses $M_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{9}~{\rm g}$ that, due to the memory burden effect, are currently evaporating, emitting high-energy particles, among which neutrinos, in the local Universe. Analyzing the latest IceCube data, we place novel constraints on the combined parameter space of primordial black holes and the memory burden effect. We also study the projected reach of future neutrino telescopes such as IceCube-Gen2 and GRAND. We find that the neutrino observations are crucial to probe scenarios with highly-suppressed evaporation and light masses for primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Revisiting X-ray Afterglows of Jetted Tidal Disruption Events with the External Reverse Shock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the external reverse shock region of relativistic jets as the origin of X-ray afterglows of jetted tidal disruption events (TDEs) that exhibit luminous jets accompanied by fast-declining non-thermal X-ray emissions. We model the dynamics of jet propagating within an external density medium, accounting for continuous energy injection driven by accretion activities. We compute the time-dependent synchrotron and inverse Compton emissions from the reverse shock region. Our analysis demonstrates that the reverse shock scenario can potentially explain the X-ray light curves and spectra of four jetted TDEs, AT 2022cmc, Swift J1644, Swift J2058, and Swift J1112. Notably, the rapid steepening of the late-stage X-ray light curves can be attributed jointly to the jet break and cessation of the central engine as the accretion rate drops below the Eddington limit. Using parameters obtained from X-ray data fitting, we also discuss the prospects for $\gamma$-ray and neutrino detection.</description>

      <title>Open-source library for performance-portable neutrino reaction rates: Application to neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A realistic and detailed description of neutrinos in binary neutron star (BNS) mergers is essential to build reliable models of such systems. To this end, we present BNS_NURATES, a novel open-source numerical library designed for the efficient on-the-fly computation of neutrino interactions, with particular focus on regimes relevant to BNS mergers. BNS_NURATES targets a higher level of accuracy and realism in the implementation of commonly employed reactions by accounting for relevant microphysics effects on the interactions, such as weak magnetism and mean field effects. It also includes the contributions of inelastic neutrino scattering off electrons and positrons and (inverse) nucleon decays. Finally, it offers a way to reconstruct the neutrino distribution function in the framework of moment-based transport schemes. As a first application, we compute both energy-dependent and energy-integrated neutrino emissivities and opacities for conditions extracted from a BNS merger simulation with M1 transport scheme. We find some qualitative differences in the results when considering the impact of the additional relevant reactions and of microphysics effects. For example, neutrino-electron/positron scattering reactions are important for the energy exchange of heavy-type neutrinos as they do not undergo semileptonic charged-current processes, when $\mu^\pm$ are not accounted for. Moreover, weak magnetism and mean field effects can significantly modify the contribution of $\beta$ processes for electron-type (anti)neutrinos, increasing at the same time the importance of (inverse) neutron decays. The improved treatment for the reaction rates also modifies the conditions at which neutrinos decouple from matter in the system, potentially affecting their emission spectra.</description>

      <title>XRISM reveals low non-thermal pressure in the core of the hot, relaxed galaxy cluster Abell 2029</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present XRISM Resolve observations of the core of the hot, relaxed galaxy cluster Abell 2029. We find that the line-of-sight bulk velocity of the intracluster medium (ICM) within the central 180 kpc is at rest with respect to the Brightest Cluster Galaxy, with a 3-sigma upper limit of |v_bulk| &lt; 100 km/s. We robustly measure the field-integrated ICM velocity dispersion to be sigma_v = 169 +/- 10 km/s, obtaining similar results for both single-temperature and two-temperature plasma models to account for the cluster cool core. This result, if ascribed to isotropic turbulence, implies a subsonic ICM with Mach number M_3D = 0.22 and a non-thermal pressure fraction of 2.6+/-0.3%. The turbulent velocity is similar to what was measured in the core of the Perseus cluster by Hitomi, but here in a more massive cluster with an ICM temperature of 7 keV, the limit on non-thermal pressure fraction is even more stringent. Our result is consistent with expectations from simulations of relaxed clusters, but it is on the low end of the predicted distribution, indicating that Abell 2029 is an exceptionally relaxed cluster with no significant impacts from either a recent minor merger or AGN activity.</description>

      <title>Tracking X-ray Variability in Next Generation EHT LLAGN Targets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a 5 month NICER X-ray monitoring campaign for two low luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs) -- NGC 4594 and IC 1459 -- with complementary Swift and NuSTAR observations. Utilizing an absorbed power law and thermal source model combined with NICER's SCORPEON background model, we demonstrate the effectiveness of joint source/background modeling for constraining emission from faint, background-dominated targets. Both sources are dominated by nuclear power law emission with photon indices $\Gamma \sim 1.5 - 2$, with NGC 4594 being slightly harder than IC 1459. The thermal contribution in both sources is fainter, but constant, with $kT \sim 0.5$ keV ($\sim 5 \times 10^6$ K). The power law flux and $\Gamma$ are strongly anti-correlated in both sources, as has been seen for other LLAGNs with radiatively inefficient accretion flows. NGC 4594 is the brighter source and exhibits significant aperiodic variability. Its variability timescale with an upper limit of $5 - 7$ days indicates emission originating from $&lt; 100 R_{g}$, at the scale of the inner accretion flow. A spectral break found at $\sim 6$ keV, while tentative, could arise from synchrotron/inverse compton emission. This high-cadence LLAGN X-ray monitoring campaign underlines the importance of multi-wavelength variability studies for a sample of LLAGNs to truly understand their accretion and outflow physics.</description>

      <title>Filamentary Ejecta Network in Cassiopeia~A Reveals Fingerprints of the Supernova Explosion Mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: [Abridged] Recent JWST observations have revealed an intricate filamentary network of unshocked ejecta in the young supernova remnant (SNR) Cassiopeia A (Cas A), offering new insights into supernova (SN) explosions and ejecta evolution. We investigate the origin and evolution of this structure by (i) characterizing its 3D morphology and kinematics and (ii) identifying the physical mechanisms driving its formation. Using high-resolution hydrodynamic (HD) and magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, we model the evolution of a neutrino-driven SN from explosion to a remnant age of 1000 years. The initial conditions, set just after shock breakout, are based on a 3D neutrino-driven SN model matching Cas A's basic properties. We find that magnetic fields have little impact on unshocked ejecta evolution, so we focus on HD simulations. A web-like filamentary structure, consistent with JWST observations (down to $\sim 0.01$ pc), naturally forms during the explosion. These filaments arise from early post-collapse processes, including neutrino-heated bubble expansion, hydrodynamic instabilities during blast propagation, and the Ni-bubble effect after shock breakout. The reverse shock later disrupts the filaments via hydrodynamic instabilities, rendering them unobservable by $\sim 700$ years. Our models suggest that JWST-detected filaments in Cas A preserve a 'memory' of early explosion conditions, tracing processes active during and immediately after the SN event. Notably, a filamentary network akin to Cas A's emerges naturally from a neutrino-driven SN explosion.</description>

      <title>Properties of Ultralight Bosons from Spins of Heavy Quasars via Superradiance</title>

Abstract: The mass and the spin of accreting and jetted black holes, at the center of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), can be probed by analyzing their electromagnetic spectra. For this purpose, we use the Spin-Modified Fundamental Plane of black hole activity, which non-linearly connects the following four variables (in the source frame): radio luminosity, X-ray or optical luminosity (via the [OIII] emission line), black hole mass and spin. Taking into account the uncertainties in luminosity measurements, conversion factors, relativistic beaming and physical properties of the AGN system, we derive lower bounds on the spins of a group of heavy, jetted AGNs. Using these results, we study the direct implications on the mass spectrum of the ultra-light particles of scalar (axion-like), vector (dark photon) and tensor types (additional spin-2 particles). We close unexplored gap in the parameter space $10^{-20}-10^{-19}$eV. We obtain upper bounds on the axion decay constant (equivalently lower bounds on the self-interaction strength) considering self-interactions could prevent the axion particles entering the instability, and be the reason for non-observation of superradiance. Assuming axion/scalar is described by mass and decay constant, we obtain upper limits on what fraction of dark matter can be formed by ultra-light particles and find that single spieces axion-like light particle can constitute at most $10\%$ of the dark matter in the mass range: $ 10^{-21} &lt; \mu \, (\mathrm{eV}) &lt; 10^{-17}$. Moreover, we derive similar bounds for vector and spin-2 particles and find that light vector fields can constitute at most $10^{-6}$ of the dark matter in $10^{-21}\, \mathrm{eV} &lt; \mu &lt; 10^{-17} \, \mathrm{eV}$ range, and light spin-2 fields can constitute at most $10^{-9}$ of the dark matter in $10^{-23}\, \mathrm{eV} &lt; \mu &lt; 10^{-17} \, \mathrm{eV}$ range.</description>

      <title>Compact Binary Formation in Open Star Clusters III: Probability of Binary Black Holes Hidden in Gaia Black Hole Binary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03662v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gaia mission and its follow-up observations have discovered a few candidates of non-interacting single black holes (BHs) and visible stars: Gaia BH1, BH2, and BH3. We call them ``astrometric BH binaries'' collectively. This paper addresses the question if some of these candidates may indeed harbor binary BHs (BBHs), namely, they may be ``astrometric BBH triples'' that have not been discovered yet. We focus on open star clusters, one of the promising formation sites of astrometric BH binaries, and estimate the formation rate of such astrometric BBH triples using gravitational $N$-body simulations. We find that formation efficiency of astrometric BBH triples is fairly high if they are in low-metallicity environments; $\sim 10^{-6} {\rm M}_\odot^{-1}$ or $\sim 10$ \% of astrometric BH binaries. On the other hand, no such astrometric BBH triple is formed in the solar-metallicity environments. Most of the astrometric BBH triples in our simulations turn out to be dynamically stable for $10$ Gyrs, indicating that $\sim 10$ \% of astrometric BH binary candidates may indeed harbor inner BBHs if they originate from open star clusters in low-metallicity environments. Astrometric BBH triples can be distinguished from astrometric BH binaries with the radial velocity follow-up of the tertiary star. Our simulated samples statistically suggest that a few percents of astrometric BH binary candidates should exhibit detectable radial velocity modulations due to the inner BBHs. They preferentially have ``outer'' orbital periods of $\gtrsim 10^3$ days, and moderately high ``outer'' orbital eccentricity of $\gtrsim 0.7$. Our current result strongly motivates the search for astrometric BBH triples in the upcoming Gaia final data release.</description>

      <title>Influence of Quantum Correction on Kerr Black Hole in Effective Loop Quantum Gravity via Shadows and EHT Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01308v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a study on shadow of quantum corrected Schwarzschild black hole in loop quantum gravity appeared in [Ye et al., Phys. Lett. B 851, 138566, (2024)] assuming a fixed value of Barbero-Immirzi parameter $\gamma$. Following this approach, we considered its rotating counterpart being a quantum corrected Kerr black hole in effective loop quantum gravity and studied its deviation from Kerr black hole for a fixed value of $\gamma$. We proposed and proved a theorem describing the location of unstable circular null orbits for all such Kerr-like metrics. The deviation between the shadows of the Kerr and quantum corrected Kerr black holes has also been studied, and parameters are constrained by comparison with the EHT results for M87* and Sgr A* to precisely probe the quantity of deviation due to quantum correction. Lastly, we immersed the quantum corrected Kerr black hole in an inhomogeneous plasma and studied its impact on the shadow size. We found that the unstable null orbits for the quantum corrected Kerr black hole are always smaller than the unstable null orbits for Kerr black hole. The effect of Barbero-Immirzi parameter allows the quantum corrected Kerr black hole to mimic Sgr A* with a higher probability than the Kerr black hole. However, the quantum corrected Kerr black hole does not mimic M87*. The plasma reduces the size of the shadow of quantum corrected black hole, and the plasma parameter in the case II is more sensitive than that in case I.</description>

      <title>HERACLES++: A multidimensional Eulerian code for exascale computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of multidimensional astrophysical fluids present considerable challenges. However, the development of exascale computing has significantly enhanced computational capabilities, motivating the development of new codes that can take full advantage of these resources. In this article, we introduce HERACLES++, a new hydrodynamics code with high portability, optimized for exascale machines with different architectures and running efficiently both on CPUs and GPUs. The code is Eulerian and employs a Godunov finite-volume method to solve the hydrodynamics equations, which ensures accuracy in capturing shocks and discontinuities. It includes different Riemann solvers, equations of state, and gravity solvers. It works in Cartesian and spherical coordinates, either in 1D, 2D, or 3D, and uses passive scalars to handle gases with several species. The code accepts a user-supplied heating or cooling term to treat a variety of astrophysical contexts. In addition to the usual series of benchmarking tests, we use HERACLES++ to simulate the propagation of a supernova shock in a red-supergiant star envelope, from minutes after core collapse until shock emergence. In 1D, the results from HERACLES++ are in agreement with those of V1D for the same configuration. In 3D, the Rayleigh-Taylor instability develops and modifies the 1D picture by introducing density and composition fluctuations as well as turbulence. The focus on a wedge, rather than the full solid angle, and the ability to run HERACLES++ with a large number of GPUs allow for long-term simulations of 3D supernova ejecta with a sub-degree resolution. Future developments will extend HERACLES++ to a radiation-hydrodynamics code.</description>
