      <title>On finite extensions of lamplighter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a family of groups consisting of the simplest extensions of lamplighter groups. We use these groups to answer multiple open questions in combinatorial group theory, providing groups that exhibit various combinations of properties: 1) Decidable Subgroup Membership and undecidable Uniform Subgroup Membership Problem, 2) Rational volume growth series and undecidable Word Problem and 3) Recursive (even context-free) language of conjugacy geodesics, decidable Word Problem, and undecidable Conjugacy Problem. We also consider the co-Word Problem, residual finiteness and the Isomorphism Problem within this class.</description>

      <title>Fined-Grained Complexity of Ambiguity Problems on Automata and Directed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two fundamental classes of finite automata are deterministic and nondeterministic ones (DFAs and NFAs). Natural intermediate classes arise from bounds on an NFA's allowed ambiguity, i.e. number of accepting runs per word: unambiguous, finitely ambiguous, and polynomially ambiguous finite automata. It is known that deciding whether a given NFA is unambiguous and whether it is polynomially ambiguous is possible in quadratic time, and deciding finite ambiguity is possible in cubic time. We provide matching lower bounds showing these running times to be optimal, assuming popular fine-grained complexity hypotheses.
  We improve the upper bounds for unary automata, which are essentially directed graphs with a source and a target. In this view, unambiguity asks whether all walks from the source to the target have different lengths. The running time analysis of our algorithm reduces to bounding the entry-wise 1-norm of a GCD matrix, yielding a near-linear upper bound. For finite and polynomial ambiguity, we provide simple linear-time algorithms in the unary case.
  Finally, we study the twins property for weighted automata over the tropical semiring, which characterises the determinisability of unambiguous weighted automata. It occurs naturally in our context as deciding the twins property is an intermediate step in determinisability algorithms for weighted automata with bounded ambiguity. We show that Allauzen and Mohri's quadratic-time algorithm checking the twins property is optimal up to the same fine-grained hypotheses as for unambiguity. For unary automata, we show that the problem can be rephrased to whether all cycles in a weighted directed graph have the same average weight and give a linear-time algorithm.</description>

      <title>Syntax Repair as Language Intersection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new technique for repairing syntax errors in arbitrary context-free languages. This technique models syntax repair as a language intersection problem by defining a finite language that provably generates every syntactically valid repair within a given edit distance. Leveraging a theoretical connection between the Bar-Hillel construction from formal language theory and CFL reachability from program analysis, we show that repairability in a finite number of typographic edits is polylogarithmic parallel time decidable and provide an enumeration algorithm based on the Brzozowski derivative. Finally, we evaluate this algorithm and its implementation, demonstrating state-of-the-art results on a Python syntax repair benchmark.</description>
