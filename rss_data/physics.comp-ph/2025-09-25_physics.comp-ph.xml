      <title>Examining the robustness of Physics-Informed Neural Networks to noise for Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximating solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) is fundamental for the modeling of dynamical systems in science and engineering. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are a recent machine learning-based approach, for which many properties and limitations remain unknown. PINNs are widely accepted as inferior to traditional methods for solving PDEs, such as the finite element method, both with regard to computation time and accuracy. However, PINNs are commonly claimed to show promise in solving inverse problems and handling noisy or incomplete data. We compare the performance of PINNs in solving inverse problems with that of a traditional approach using the finite element method combined with a numerical optimizer. The models are tested on a series of increasingly difficult fluid mechanics problems, with and without noise. We find that while PINNs may require less human effort and specialized knowledge, they are outperformed by the traditional approach. However, the difference appears to decrease with higher dimensions and more data. We identify common failures during training to be addressed if the performance of PINNs on noisy inverse problems is to become more competitive.</description>

      <title>Broadband High-Temperature Multilayer Pyramid-Shaped Metamaterial Thermal Absorber for Thermophotovoltaic applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A broadband, thermally stable absorber is essential for thermophotovoltaic (TPV) systems to simultaneously convert solar and industrial waste heat into usable energy to meet growing power demands. Here, we proposed an ingenious polarization-independent truncated pyramid-shaped symmetric multilayer metamaterial absorber in a metal-insulator-metal-insulator (MIMI) architecture with almost complete absorption over a broad wavelength range. A total of six structures (W/AlN, Mo/AlN, Ta/AlN, Rh/MgO, Rh/SiO2, Re/BN) were designed, and the materials were selected based on their lattice matching to prevent delamination at interfaces between layers. The absorption mechanism was studied at room temperature using the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method, and the structure was optimized through a brute force design approach, which illustrates a best average absorption of 98.2% till 4000 nm and 97.73% till 5072 nm wavelength for the W/AlN structure with metal and dielectric thicknesses of 60 nm and 17.5 nm, respectively. Moreover, W/AlN structure exhibits over 96% average absorption up to 50 degree incident angles irrespective of polarizations. The thermal stability was evaluated using the finite element method (FEM) by determining von Mises stress at elevated temperatures. Thermal analysis revealed that only W/AlN can withstand around 1700 K temperature and 1500 times the incident power before permanent deformation. A temperature-dependent Drude-Lorentz model was used to further analyze the effect of absorption on the optical performance of the highly absorptive and thermally stable W/AlN structure. Additionally, we determined the effect of the concentration factor, and the operating temperature on the system efficiency by considering the emission loss of the heated absorber.</description>

      <title>Generalized mixed variable-pullback scheme with non-ideal Ohm's law for electromagnetic gyrokinetic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, the non-ideal Ohm's law is integrated in the mixed variable-pullback scheme for the gyrokinetic particle simulations. This scheme captures the evolution of the symplectic solution of the gyrokinetic model accurately not only in the MHD limit but also in the electrostatic limit. This scheme also provides a pure symplectic ($v_\shortparallel $) scheme for electromagnetic gyrokinetic particle simulations without causing the traditional cancellation problem in the pure Hamiltonian scheme. Various mixed variable schemes have been comprehensively analyzed for the 1D shear Alfv\`en wave problem with kinetic electrons, with the connection to the traditional pure Hamiltonian scheme and the symplectic scheme. It is demonstrated that the pure $v_\shortparallel $ form with the non-ideal Ohm's law has comparable performance to the widely used mixed variable-pullback scheme with the ideal Ohm's law. The mixed variable-pullback scheme without Ohm's law is also proposed as a feasible improvement of the traditional pure Hamiltonian scheme with minimum modification and considerable performance improvement in terms of a marker number reduction.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic momentum distributions due to radiation recoil in relativistic plasmas with electric and magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction of strong electromagnetic fields with plasma generates radiation accompanied by a recoil force, which can significantly alter the plasma dynamics. In this work, we investigate the development of anisotropic momentum distributions induced by the combined action of electric and magnetic fields on a thermally relativistic plasma. We consider three distinct types of anisotropy. The first arises from a pure magnetic field acting on plasma with either isotropic or anisotropic initial momentum distributions, producing the characteristic ring-shaped momentum profile. The second is driven by a pure electric field, where radiation reaction generates a partial, anisotropic ring distribution in momentum space: significant modifications occur primarily in the 90$^\circ$--180$^\circ$ and 270$^\circ$--360$^\circ$ sectors of the $p_x$--$p_y$ plane, while the remaining quadrants remain largely unaffected. The third case considers the combined effect of electric and magnetic fields. When the cyclotron frequency is very close to the upper hybrid frequency, the azimuthal symmetry of the ring-momentum distribution is broken. Conversely, in the regime where the cyclotron frequency is lower than the upper hybrid frequency, the rapid oscillations of the electric field dominate and preserve the symmetry of the ring-momentum distribution.</description>

      <title>High-order Multiscale Preconditioner for Elasticity of Arbitrary Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a two-level preconditioner for solving linear systems arising from the discretization of the elliptic, linear-elastic deformation equation, in displacement unknowns, over domains that have arbitrary geometric and topological complexity and heterogeneity in material properties (including fractures). The preconditioner is an algebraic translation of the high-order pore-level multiscale method (hPLMM) proposed recently by the authors, wherein a domain is decomposed into non-overlapping subdomains, and local basis functions are numerically computed over the subdomains to construct a high-quality coarse space (or prolongation matrix). The term "high-order" stands in contrast to the recent low-order PLMM preconditioner, where BCs of local basis problems assume rigidity of all interfaces shared between subdomains. In hPLMM, interfaces are allowed to deform, through the use of suitable mortar spaces, thereby capturing local bending/twisting moments under challenging loading conditions. Benchmarked across a wide range of complex (porous) structures and material heterogeneities, we find hPLMM exhibits superior performance in Krylov solvers than PLMM, as well as state-of-the-art Schwarz and multigrid preconditioners. Applications include risk analysis of subsurface CO2/H2 storage and optimizing porous materials for batteries, prosthetics, and aircraft.</description>

      <title>Advancing Universal Deep Learning for Electronic-Structure Hamiltonian Prediction of Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19877v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning methods for electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction has offered significant computational efficiency advantages over traditional DFT methods, yet the diversity of atomic types, structural patterns, and the high-dimensional complexity of Hamiltonians pose substantial challenges to the generalization performance. In this work, we contribute on both the methodology and dataset sides to advance universal deep learning paradigm for Hamiltonian prediction. On the method side, we propose NextHAM, a neural E(3)-symmetry and expressive correction method for efficient and generalizable materials electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction. First, we introduce the zeroth-step Hamiltonians, which can be efficiently constructed by the initial charge density of DFT, as informative descriptors of neural regression model in the input level and initial estimates of the target Hamiltonian in the output level, so that the regression model directly predicts the correction terms to the target ground truths, thereby significantly simplifying the input-output mapping for learning. Second, we present a neural Transformer architecture with strict E(3)-Symmetry and high non-linear expressiveness for Hamiltonian prediction. Third, we propose a novel training objective to ensure the accuracy performance of Hamiltonians in both real space and reciprocal space, preventing error amplification and the occurrence of "ghost states" caused by the large condition number of the overlap matrix. On the dataset side, we curate a high-quality broad-coverage large benchmark, namely Materials-HAM-SOC, comprising 17,000 material structures spanning 68 elements from six rows of the periodic table and explicitly incorporating SOC effects. Experimental results on Materials-HAM-SOC demonstrate that NextHAM achieves excellent accuracy and efficiency in predicting Hamiltonians and band structures.</description>

      <title>Geometric Autoencoder Priors for Bayesian Inversion: Learn First Observe Later</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is paramount for inference in engineering applications. A common inference task is to recover full-field information of physical systems from a small number of noisy observations, a usually highly ill-posed problem. Critically, engineering systems often have complicated and variable geometries prohibiting the use of standard Bayesian UQ. In this work, we introduce Geometric Autoencoders for Bayesian Inversion (GABI), a framework for learning geometry-aware generative models of physical responses that serve as highly informative geometry-conditioned priors for Bayesian inversion. Following a ''learn first, observe later'' paradigm, GABI distills information from large datasets of systems with varying geometries, without requiring knowledge of governing PDEs, boundary conditions, or observation processes, into a rich latent prior. At inference time, this prior is seamlessly combined with the likelihood of the specific observation process, yielding a geometry-adapted posterior distribution. Our proposed framework is architecture agnostic. A creative use of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) sampling yields an efficient implementation that utilizes modern GPU hardware. We test our method on: steady-state heat over rectangular domains; Reynold-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) flow around airfoils; Helmholtz resonance and source localization on 3D car bodies; RANS airflow over terrain. We find: the predictive accuracy to be comparable to deterministic supervised learning approaches in the restricted setting where supervised learning is applicable; UQ to be well calibrated and robust on challenging problems with complex geometries. The method provides a flexible geometry-aware train-once-use-anywhere foundation model which is independent of any particular observation process.</description>

      <title>Exact Solvability and Integrability Signatures in a Periodically Driven Infinite-Range Spin Chain: The Case of Floquet interval $\pi/2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the signatures of quantum integrability (QI) in a spin chain model, having infinite-range Ising interaction and subjected to a periodic pulse of an external magnetic field. We analyze the unitary operator, its eigensystem, the single-qubit reduced density matrix, and the entanglement dynamics for arbitrary initial state for any $N$. The QI in our model can be identified through key signatures such as the periodicity of entanglement dynamics and the time-evolved unitary operator, and highly degenerated spectra or Poisson statistics. In our previous works, these signatures were observed in the model for parameters $\tau=\pi/4$ and $J=1,1/2$, where we provided exact analytical results up to $12$ qubits and numerically for large $N$ [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{110}, 064313,(2024)}; arXiv:2411.16670 (2024)}]. In this paper, we extend the analysis to $\tau=m\pi/2$, and arbitrary $J$ and $N$. We show that the signatures of QI persist for the rational $J$, whereas for irrational $J$, these signatures are absent for any $N$. Further, we perform spectral statistics and find that for irrational $J$, as well as for rational $J$ with perturbations, the spacing distributions of eigenvalues follow Poisson statistics. The average adjacent gap ratio is obtained as $\langle r \rangle=0.386$, consistent with Poisson statistics. Additionally, we compute the ratio of eigenstate entanglement entropy to its maximum value ($\langle S \rangle /S_{Max}$) and find that it remains significantly below $1$ in the limit $N\rightarrow \infty$, which further confirms the QI. We discuss some potential experimental realizations of our model.</description>

      <title>Refine coherent control of atomic qubits via wave-function approach conditioned on no-decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a fundamental phenomenon in quantum systems, spontaneous emission constitutes an inevitable source of error, which ultimately degrades the fidelity of quantum logic gates. A successful quantum logic gate needs to operate on the condition that no decay event, such as spontaneous emission, occurs. Such successes can be ensured by post-selection based on syndrome extraction according to the theory of quantum error correction or quantum error mitigation. In this case, the wave function of qubits remains a pure state but is subject to additional influences from spontaneous emission, even without actual decay events. Therefore, such a process must be appropriately described by a modified version of Schr\"odinger equation for the dynamics conditioned on no-decay. Calculations reveal that this effect must be seriously taken into consideration for the design of high-fidelity quantum logic gates. With respect to realistic experimental conditions, even if the coherence is well preserved, improving the fidelity of manipulating physical qubits requires careful consideration of the subtle influences of decay processes such as spontaneous emission. Specifically, the gate and readout processes in the atomic qubit platform are discussed.</description>

      <title>Lateral disorder in Langmuir monolayers: theoretical derivations and grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies of the self-assembly of Langmuir monolayers have revealed novel forms of lateral molecular ordering. Such studies typically involve the use of grazing-incidence synchrotron radiation scattering, and the lateral order manifests itself as distinct diffraction patterns. The more intricate the molecular organization, the more complicated the corresponding diffraction pattern is. To the point where standard analysis, i.e., identifying peak positions and solving the crystal structure, is insufficient to describe the system. In such cases, a physics-based simulation of the diffraction is required. In this article, we present a versatile theoretical framework for simulating complex structural molecular ordering in Langmuir monolayers. We begin by applying the formalism to a simple case of solid-state monolayers and extend the analysis to describe the structural organization in the collapsed state. The applicability of the method is validated through comparison with experimental data collected at the bending magnet synchrotron beamline.</description>

      <title>Massive Discovery of Low-Dimensional Materials from Universal Computational Strategy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-dimensional materials have attractive properties that drive intense efforts for novel materials discovery. However, experiments are tedious for systematic discovery, and present computational methods are often tuned to two-dimensional (2D) materials, overlooking other low-dimensional materials. Here, we combined universal machine-learning interatomic potentials (UMLIPs) and an advanced, interatomic force constant (FC) -based dimensionality classification method to make a massive discovery of novel low-dimensional materials. We first benchmarked UMLIPs' first-principles-level accuracy in quantifying FCs and calculated phonons for 35,689 materials from the Materials Project database. We then used the FC-based method for dimensionality classification to discover 9139 low-dimensional materials, including 1838 0D clusters, 1760 1D chains, 3057 2D sheets/layers, and 2484 mixed-dimensionality materials, all of which conventional geometric descriptors have not recognized. By calculating the binding energies for the discovered 2D materials, we also identified 960 sheets that could be easily or potentially exfoliated from their parent bulk structures.</description>

      <title>Efficient Gillespie algorithms for spreading phenomena in large and heterogeneous higher-order networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-order dynamics refer to mechanisms where collective mutual or synchronous interactions differ fundamentally from their pairwise counterparts through the concept of many-body interactions. Phenomena absent in pairwise models, such as catastrophic activation, hysteresis, and hybrid transitions, emerge naturally in higher-order interacting systems. Thus, the simulation of contagion dynamics on higher-order structures is algorithmically and computationally challenging due to the complexity of propagation through hyperedges of arbitrary order. To address this issue, optimized Gillespie algorithms were constructed for higher-order structures by means of phantom processes: events that do not change the state of the system but still account for time progression. We investigate the algorithm's performance considering the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic model with critical mass thresholds on hypergraphs. Optimizations were assessed on networks of different sizes and levels of heterogeneity in both connectivity and order interactions, in a high epidemic prevalence regime. Algorithms with phantom processes are shown to outperform standard approaches by several orders of magnitude in the limit of large sizes. Indeed, a high computational complexity scaling $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ with system size $N$ of the standard algorithms is improved to low complexity scaling nearly as $\mathcal{O}(N)$. The optimized methods allow for the simulation of highly heterogeneous networks with millions of nodes within affordable computation costs, significantly surpassing the size range and order heterogeneity currently considered.</description>

Abstract: The mechanism of resistive switching in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor-based memristors is intriguing, and our conventional knowledge of bulk-oxide based memristors does not apply to these devices. Experimental data indicate that the genesis of resistive switching may be intrinsic to the 2D semiconducting active layer, as well as resulting from the movement of electrode atoms. Employing reactive-force field (ReaxFF) molecular dynamics simulations, we introduced the "sulphur atom popping model" [npj 2D Mater. Appl. 5, 33 (2021)] to elucidate the intrinsic nature of non-volatile resistive switching in 2D molybdenum disulfide-based memristors. In this paper we provide additional perspective to this model using density functional theory. We also discuss the limitations of universal machine learning interatomic potentials in reproducing ReaxFF simulation results.</description>

      <title>Thermal resilience of the ITER tungsten first wall to runaway electron impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fast volumetric deposition of multi-MeV high current runaway electron (RE) beams constitutes the most critical issue for the ITER tungsten (W) first wall (FW) longevity. Such relativistic electron beams could generate extreme volumetric power densities inside the FW armour which lead to significant vaporization, deep melting and even material explosions, as well as to elevated temperatures at the bond interface with the cooling substrate that could cause rupture and water leaks. Here the thermal response of the ITER FW is modeled with a three-stage, one-way coupled workflow focusing on assessments of the extent of the wall damage and the increase of the bond interface temperature for varying W thickness. Increased W thickness is found to be essential for wall protection against intense RE dissipation events in terms of both W tile damage and cooling system integrity.</description>

      <title>Molecular polariton dynamics in realistic cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The large number of degrees of freedom involved in polaritonic chemistry processes considerably restricts the systems that can be described by any ab initio approach, due to the resulting high computational cost. Semiclassical methods that treat light classically offer a promising route for overcoming these limitations. In this work, we present a new implementation that combines the numerical propagation of Maxwell's equations to simulate realistic cavities with quantum electron dynamics at the density functional tight-binding (DFTB) theory level. This implementation allows for the simulation of a large number of molecules described at the atomistic level, interacting with cavity modes obtained by numerically solving Maxwell's equations. By mimicking experimental setups, our approach enables the calculation of transmission spectra, in which we observe the corresponding polaritonic signals. In addition, we have access to local information, revealing complex responses of individual molecules that depend on the number, geometry, position, and orientation of the molecules inside the cavity.</description>

      <title>Secure numerical simulations using fully homomorphic encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21824v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data privacy is a significant concern when using numerical simulations for sensitive information such as medical, financial, or engineering data -- especially in untrusted environments like public cloud infrastructures. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) offers a promising solution for achieving data privacy by enabling secure computations directly on encrypted data. Aimed at computational scientists, this work explores the viability of FHE-based, privacy-preserving numerical simulations of partial differential equations. The presented approach utilizes the Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) scheme, a widely used FHE method for approximate arithmetic on real numbers. Two Julia packages are introduced, OpenFHE$.$jl and SecureArithmetic$.$jl, which wrap the OpenFHE C++ library to provide a convenient interface for secure arithmetic operations. With these tools, the accuracy and performance of key FHE operations in OpenFHE are evaluated, and implementations of finite difference schemes for solving the linear advection equation with encrypted data are demonstrated. The results show that cryptographically secure numerical simulations are possible, but that careful consideration must be given to the computational overhead and the numerical errors introduced by using FHE. An analysis of the algorithmic restrictions imposed by FHE highlights potential challenges and solutions for extending the approach to other models and methods. While it remains uncertain how broadly the approach can be generalized to more complex algorithms due to CKKS limitations, these findings lay the groundwork for further research on privacy-preserving scientific computing.</description>

      <title>Lifelong Machine Learning Potentials for Chemical Reaction Network Explorations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in computational chemistry facilitate the automated quantum chemical exploration of chemical reaction networks for the in-silico prediction of synthesis pathways, yield, and selectivity. However, the underlying quantum chemical energy calculations require vast computational resources, limiting these explorations severely in practice. Machine learning potentials (MLPs) offer a solution to increase computational efficiency, while retaining the accuracy of reliable first-principles data used for their training. Unfortunately, MLPs will be limited in their generalization ability within chemical (reaction) space, if the underlying training data are not representative for a given application. Within the framework of automated reaction network exploration, where new reactants or reagents composed of any elements from the periodic table can be introduced, this lack of generalizability will be the rule rather than the exception. Here, we therefore evaluate the benefits of the lifelong MLP concept in this context. Lifelong MLPs push their adaptability by efficient continual learning of additional data. We propose an improved learning algorithm for lifelong adaptive data selection yielding efficient integration of new data while previous expertise is preserved. In this way, we can reach chemical accuracy in reaction search trials.</description>

      <title>Accurate crystal field Hamiltonians of single-ion magnets at mean-field cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effective crystal field Hamiltonian provides the key description of the electronic properties of single-ion magnets, but obtaining its parameters from ab initio computation is challenging. We introduce a simple approach to derive the effective crystal field Hamiltonian through density functional calculations of randomly rotated mean-field states within the low-energy manifold. In benchmarks on five lanthanide-based complexes, we find that we compute with mean-field cost an effective crystal field Hamiltonian that matches the state-of-the-art from much more expensive multi-configurational quantum chemistry methods. In addition, we are able to reproduce the experimental low-energy spectrum and magnetic properties with an accuracy exceeding prior attempts. Due to its low cost, our approach provides a crucial ingredient in the computational design of single-ion magnets with tailored physical properties and low-energy spectra.</description>

      <title>Next-generation EDIpack: A Lanczos-based package for quantum impurity models featuring general broken-symmetry phases, flexible bath topologies and multi-platform interoperability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a next-generation version of EDIpack, a flexible, high-performance numerical library using Lanczos-based exact diagonalization to solve generic quantum impurity problems, such as those introduced in Dynamical Mean-Field Theory to describe extended strongly correlated materials. This new release efficiently solves impurity problems allowing for different broken-symmetry solutions, including superconductivity, featuring local spin-orbit coupling and/or electron-phonon coupling. It provides quick access to dynamical correlation functions on the entire complex frequency plane at zero and low-temperatures. The modular architecture of the software not only provides Fortran APIs but also includes bindings to C/C++, interfaces with Python and Julia or with TRIQS and w2dynamics research platforms, thus ensuring unprecedented level of inter-operability. The outlook includes further extensions to study quantum materials and cold atoms quantum simulators, as well as quantum information applications.</description>

      <title>A unified gas-kinetic framework from Boltzmann to Navier-Stokes scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neither molecular kinetics nor continuum fluid dynamics alone is adequate to describe multiscale gas flows across different regimes. Bridging these regimes within a single self-consistent framework has long been a central challenge in fluid mechanics. We propose a unified gas kinetic framework that classifies molecules by their collision histories over an observation timescale. This formulation recovers the Boltzmann and Navier-Stokes equations as limiting cases, providing a transparent connection between kinetic and hydrodynamic descriptions. Beyond practical advantages for multiscale modeling, this framework offers a new perspective on Hilbert's sixth problem by linking microscopic dynamics to continuum mechanics through a tunable observational scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since its inception in 1995, LAMMPS has grown to be a world-class molecular dynamics code, with thousands of users, over one million lines of code, and multi-scale simulation capabilities. We discuss how LAMMPS has adapted to the modern heterogeneous computing landscape by integrating the Kokkos performance portability library into the existing C++ code. We investigate performance portability of simple pairwise, many-body reactive, and machine-learned force-field interatomic potentials. We present results on GPUs across different vendors and generations, and analyze performance trends, probing FLOPS throughput, memory bandwidths, cache capabilities, and thread-atomic operation performance. Finally, we demonstrate strong scaling on three exascale machines -- OLCF Frontier, ALCF Aurora, and NNSA El Capitan -- as well as on the CSCS Alps supercomputer, for the three potentials.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Time Propagators for Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) is a widely used method to investigate electron dynamics under external time-dependent perturbations such as laser fields. In this work, we present a machine learning approach to accelerate electron dynamics simulations based on real time TDDFT using autoregressive neural operators as time-propagators for the electron density. By leveraging physics-informed constraints and featurization, and high-resolution training data, our model achieves superior accuracy and computational speed compared to traditional numerical solvers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a class of one-dimensional diatomic molecules under the influence of a range of laser parameters. This method has potential in enabling on-the-fly modeling of laser-irradiated molecules and materials by utilizing fast machine learning predictions in a large space of varying experimental parameters of the laser.</description>
