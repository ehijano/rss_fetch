      <title>Conduction band resonant states absorption for quantum dot infrared detectors operating at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long Wavelenght infrared devices, despite growing interest due to a wide range of applications in commercial, public, and academic sectors, are still struggling to achieve significant improvements over well-established technologies like HgCdTe detectors. Devices based on quantum nanostructures remain non competitive due to unresolved drawbacks, the most significant being the need to cool down to liquid nitrogen temperatures to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. In this work, we demonstrate an innovative solution to surpass the current generation of quantum dot-based detectors by exploiting the absorption from quantum dot localized states to resonant states in the continuum, that is states in the semiconductor conduction band with an enhanced probability density in the quantum dot region. This unprecedented approach takes advantage of the unique properties of such states to massively enhance carrier extraction, allowing to overcome one of the most crucial drawbacks of quantum dot-based infrared detectors. This innovative solution is discussed here from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. The measured room temperature operation with high detectivity demonstrates that exploiting resonant states absorption in quantum dots offers the long-sought solution for the next generation of infrared photodetectors.</description>

      <title>Lensless fiber endomicroscopic phase imaging with speckle-conditioned diffusion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lensless fiber endomicroscope is an emerging tool for in-vivo microscopic imaging, where quantitative phase imaging (QPI) can be utilized as a label-free method to enhance image contrast. However, existing single-shot phase reconstruction methods through lensless fiber endomicroscope typically perform well on simple images but struggle with complex microscopic structures. Here, we propose a speckle-conditioned diffusion model (SpecDiffusion), which reconstructs phase images directly from speckles captured at the detection side of a multi-core fiber (MCF). Unlike conventional neural networks, SpecDiffusion employs iterative phase denoising steps for speckle-driven phase reconstruction. The iteration scheme allows SpecDiffusion to break down the phase reconstruction process into multiple steps, gradually building up to the final phase image. This attribute alleviates the computation challenge at each step and enables the reconstruction of rich details in complex microscopic images. To validate its efficacy, we build an optical system to capture speckles from MCF and construct a dataset consisting of 100,000 paired images. SpecDiffusion provides high-fidelity phase reconstruction results and shows powerful generalization capacity for unseen objects, such as test charts and biological tissues, reducing the average mean absolute error of the reconstructed tissue images by 7 times. Furthermore, the reconstructed tissue images using SpecDiffusion shows higher accuracy in zero-shot cell segmentation tasks compared to the conventional method, demonstrating the potential for further cell morphology analysis through the learning-based lensless fiber endomicroscope. SpecDiffusion offers a precise and generalized method to phase reconstruction through scattering media, including MCFs, opening new perspective in lensless fiber endomicroscopic imaging.</description>

      <title>Octave-spanning supercontinuum coherent soft X-ray for producing a single-cycle soft X-ray pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study demonstrates the potential to generate a soft X-ray single-cycle attosecond pulse using a single-cycle mid-infrared pulse from the advanced dual-chirped optical parametric amplification. Supercontinuum high harmonic (HH) spectrum was generated in argon (80 eV - 160 eV) and neon (150 eV - 270 eV). The experimental spectra reasonably agree with those calculated by the strong-field approximation model and Maxwell's equations. In addition, simulation results indicate that the dispersion of HHs in argon can be compensated using a 207-nm Zr filter to obtain 40 as pulses (1.1 cycles at 118 eV). For neon, a 278-nm Sn filter can compensate for dispersion of HH and create 23 as pulses (1.1 cycles at 206 eV). This soft X-ray single-cycle attosecond pulse is expected to be highly valuable for ultrafast science and applications in quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Steering laser-produced THz radiation in air with superluminal ionization fronts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a single-color ultrashort optical pulse propagating in air can emit THz radiation along any direction with respect to its propagation axis. The emission angle can be adjusted by the flying focus technique which determines the speed and direction of the ionization front. When the ionization front velocity becomes superluminal, the THz emission corresponds to classical Cherenkov radiation.</description>

      <title>Optical absorption spectrum reveals gaseous chlorine in anti-resonant hollow core fibres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have observed unexpected spectral attenuation of ultraviolet light in freshly drawn hollow core optical fibres. When the fibre ends are left open to atmosphere, this loss feature dissipates over time. The loss matches the absorption spectrum of gaseous (molecular) chlorine and, given enough time, the transmission spectrum of the fibre recovers to that expected from the morphological structure of the fibre. Our measurements indicate an initial chlorine concentration of 0.45 $\mu$ mol/cm$^{3}$ in the hollow core, equivalent to 1.1 mol% Cl$_{2}$ at atmospheric pressure.</description>

      <title>Experimentally mapping the scattering phases and amplitudes of a finite object by optical mutual scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mutual scattering arises when multiple waves intersect within a finite scattering object, resulting in cross-interference between the incident and scattered waves. By measuring mutual scattering, we determine the complex-valued scattering amplitude $f$ - both amplitude and phase - of the finite object, which holds information on its scattering properties by linking incident and outgoing waves from any arbitrary direction. Mutual scattering is present for any coherent wave - acoustic, electromagnetic, particle - and we here demonstrate the effect using optical experiments. We propose an experimental technique for characterization that utilizes mutual scattering and we present our results for four distinct finite objects: a polystyrene sphere (diameter $59\ \mu$m), a single black human hair (diameter $92\ \mu$m), a strip of pultruded carbon (edge length $140\ \mu$m), and a block of ZnO$_2$ (edge length $64\ \mu$m). Our measurements exhibit qualitative agreement with Mie scattering calculations where the model is applicable. Deviations from the model indicate the complexity of the objects, both in terms of their geometrical structure and scattering properties. Our results offer new insights into mutual scattering and have significant implications for future applications of sample characterization in fields such as metrology, microscopy, and nanofabrication.</description>

      <title>3D Orbital Angular Momentum Nonlinear Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital angular momentum (OAM), due to its theoretically orthogonal and unbounded helical phase index, has been utilized as an independent physical degree of freedom for ultrahigh-capacity information encryption. However, the imaging distance of an OAM hologram is typically inflexible and determined by the focal length of the Fourier transform lens placed behind the hologram. Here, 3D orbital angular momentum holography is proposed and implemented. The Fourier transform between the holographic plane and imaging plane is performed by superimposing Fresnel zone plates (FZP) onto the computer-generated holograms (CGH). The CGH is binarized and fabricated on the birefringence lithium niobate crystal by femtosecond laser micromachining. Experimental verification demonstrates the feasibility of the encoding method. Moreover, by superimposing FZPs with different focal lengths into various OAM channels, OAM-multiplexing holograms are constructed. Target images are separately projected to different planes, thereby enabling 3D multi-plane holographic imaging with low crosstalk. The interval between adjacent imaging planes can be uniform and minimal, free from depth of field constraints, thus achieving high longitudinal resolution. This work achieves OAM holography in a more compact manner and further expands its applicability.</description>

      <title>Deep learning for dynamic modeling and coded information storage of vector-soliton pulsations in mode-locked fiber lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soliton pulsations are ubiquitous feature of non-stationary soliton dynamics in mode-locked lasers and many other physical systems. To overcome difficulties related to huge amount of necessary computations and low efficiency of traditional numerical methods in modeling the evolution of non-stationary solitons, we propose a two-parallel bidirectional long short-term memory recurrent neural network, with the main objective to predict dynamics of vector-soliton pulsations in various complex states, whose real-time dynamics is verified by experiments. Besides, the scheme of coded information storage based on the TP-Bi_LSTM RNN, instead of actual pulse signals, is realized too. The findings offer new applications of deep learning to ultrafast optics and information storage.</description>

      <title>Switching, Amplifying, and Chirping Diode Lasers with Current Pulses for High Bandwidth Quantum Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A series of simple and low-cost devices for switching, amplifying, and chirping diode lasers based on current modulation are presented. Direct modulation of diode laser currents is rarely sufficient to establish precise amplitude and phase control over light, as its effects on these parameters are not independent. These devices overcome this limitation by exploiting amplifier saturation and dramatically outperform commonly used external modulators in key figures of merit for quantum technological applications. Semiconductor optical amplifiers operated on either rubidium D line are recast as intensity switches and shown to achieve ON:OFF ratios $&gt;10^6$ in as little as 50 ns. Current is switched to a 795 nm wavelength (Rb D1) tapered amplifier to produce optical pulses of few nanosecond duration and peak powers of 3 W at a similar extinction ratio. Fast rf pulses are applied directly to a laser diode to shift its emission frequency by up to 300 MHz in either direction and at a maximum chirp rate of 150 MHz/ns. Finally, the latter components are combined, yielding a system that produces watt-level optical pulses with arbitrary frequency chirps in the given range and &lt;2% residual intensity variation, all within 65 ns upon asynchronous demand. Such systems have broad application in atomic, molecular, and optical physics, and are of particular interest to fast experiments simultaneously requiring high power and low noise, for example quantum memory experiments with atomic vapors.</description>

      <title>Correcting for objective sample refractive index mismatch in extended field of view selective plane illumination microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM) is an optical sectioning imaging approach based on orthogonal light pathways for excitation and detection. The excitation pathway has an inverse relation between the optical sectioning strength and the effective field of view (FOV). Multiple approaches exist to extend the effective FOV, and here we focus on remote focusing to axially scan the light sheet, synchronized with a CMOS camera's rolling shutter. A typical axially scanned SPIM configuration for imaging large samples utilizes a tunable optic for remote focusing, paired with air objectives focused into higher refractive index media. To quantitatively explore the effect of remote focus choices and sample space refractive index mismatch on light sheet intensity distributions, we developed a computational model integrating ray tracing and field propagation. We validate our model's performance against experimental light sheet profiles for various SPIM configurations. Our findings indicate that optimizing the position of the sample chamber relative to the excitation optics can enhance image quality by balancing aberrations induced by refractive index mismatch. We validate this prediction using a homebuilt, large sample axially scanned SPIM configuration and calibration samples.</description>

      <title>Non-chiral non-Bloch invariants and topological phase diagram in non-unitary quantum dynamics without chiral symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Bloch topology leads to the emergence of various counter-intuitive phenomena in non-Hermitian systems under the open boundary condition (OBC), which can not find a counterpart in Hermitian systems. However, in the non-Hermitian system without chiral symmetry, being ubiquitous in nature, exploring its non-Bloch topology has so far eluded experimental effort. Here by introducing the concept of non-chiral non-Bloch invariants, we theoretically predict and experimentally identify the non-Bloch topological phase diagram of a one-dimensional (1D) non-Hermitian system without chiral symmetry in discrete-time non-unitary quantum walks of single photons. Interestingly, we find that such topological invariants not only can distinguish topologically distinct gapped phases, but also faithfully capture the corresponding gap closing in open-boundary spectrum at the phase boundary. Different topological regions are experimentally identified by measuring the featured discontinuities of the higher moments of the walker's displacement, which amazingly match excellently with our defined non-Bloch invariants. Our work provides a useful platform to study the interplay among topology, symmetries and the non-Hermiticity.</description>

      <title>Diverging shift current responses in the gapless limit of two-dimensional systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The shift current responses of two-dimensional systems in the gapless limit are investigated. As the energy gap becomes smaller, the interband transition probability becomes larger at the band edges. We found the divergence of the shift current response in a manner proportional to the inverse of the gap size when the system becomes a two-dimensional Weyl semimetal in the gapless limit. This behavior is different from that for electric polarization, which has a jump across the gapless case. It means that the quantitative relationship between electric polarizations and shift currents is broken in this gapless limit.</description>

      <title>Disentangling thermal birefringence and strain in the all-optical switching of ferroelectric polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated that the optical excitation of crystalline materials with intense narrow-band infrared pulses, tailored to match the frequencies at which the crystal's permittivity approaches close to zero, can drive a permanent reversal of magnetic and ferroelectric ordering. However, the physical mechanism that microscopically underpins this effect remains unclear, as well as the precise role of laser-induced heating and macroscopic strains. Here, we explore how infrared pulses can simultaneously give rise to strong temperature-dependent birefringence and strain in ferroelectric barium titanate. We develop a model of these two coexisting effects, allowing us to use polarization microscopy to disentangle them through their spatial distributions, temporal evolutions and spectral dependencies. We experimentally observe strain-induced patterns that are an order of magnitude larger than that which can be accounted for by laser-induced heating alone, suggesting that non-thermal effects must also play a role. Our results reveal the distinct fingerprints of heat- and strain-induced birefringence, shedding new light on the process of all-optical switching of order parameters in the epsilon-near-zero regime.</description>

      <title>Vector Magnetometry Using Shallow Implanted NV Centers in Diamond with Waveguide-Assisted Dipole Excitation and Readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On-chip magnetic field sensing with Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond requires scalable integration of 3D waveguides into diamond substrates. Here, we develop a sensing array device with an ensemble of shallow implanted NV centers integrated with arrays of laser-written waveguides for excitation and readout of NV signals. Our approach enables an easy-to-operate on-chip magnetometer with a pixel size proportional to the Gaussian mode area of each waveguide. The performed continuous wave optically detected magnetic resonance on each waveguide gives an average dc-sensitivity value of $195 \pm 3 {nT}/\sqrt{Hz}$, which can be improved with lock-in-detection or pulsed-microwave sequences. We apply a magnetic field to separate the four NV crystallographic orientations of the magnetic resonance and then utilize a DC current through a straight wire antenna close to the waveguide to prove the sensor capabilities of our device. We reconstruct the complete vector magnetic field in the NV crystal frame using three different NV crystallographic orientations. By knowing the polarization axis of the waveguide mode, we project the magnetic field vector into the lab frame.</description>

      <title>Knotted optical fields: Seifert fibrations, braided open books and topological constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for studying knotted and braided configurations of optical fields, moving beyond the conventional Hopfion solution based on the Hopf fibration. By employing the Seifert fibration, a preferred framing is introduced to characterize the ``knottiness" of tubular neighbourhoods of knots embedded in the 3-sphere. This approach yields a specific presentation of Seifert surfaces and facilitates the description of knotted optical fields, drawing on an enriched version of Ra\~{n}ada's formulation. The relation between knots and braids enables one to explore the connections between configurations generated experimentally through the controlled over- and under-crossings of light beams, and concepts from geometric group theory and algebraic topology. This framework, emphasizing the significance of ``braided open books", sheds light on topological constraints inherent in classes of braids suitable for representing interlaced optical fields. These constraints primarily pertain to braids with $n\leq3$ strands -- aligning with existing experimental implementations -- and homogeneous braids with any number of strands. This paper establishes a theoretical foundation for understanding and manipulating knotted optical fields, suggesting potential applications and avenues for further research in this domain.</description>

Abstract: techniques can be considered as an attractive alternative to the often-cumbersome traditional manufacturing routes. With the use of high-power lasers, localized hot zones that are necessary for glass making can be obtained rapidly. For instance, Laser-Powder-Deposition enables rapid fabrication of short, high gain fibers used in e.g., distributed feedback fiber lasers (DFFL). DFFLs offer sought after performance suitable for a broad range of applications in modern photonics i.e., superior stability and narrower, single-frequency linewidth compared to conventional fiber lasers. Tunable, narrow laser sources with output in eye-safe spectrum are desired for sensing, signal multiplexing, LIDAR systems, quantum applications etc. In this work we present DFFL obtained using Laser-Powder-Deposition made Er-doped silica fiber. Milliwatt level, narrow line lasing (&lt; 704 kHz, equipment limited) was obtained using a phaseshifted grating written in 16 mm long fiber. The backward slope efficiency was as high as 24% when pumping at 976 nm. The results presented in this work showcase new possibilities in fiber fabrication that were unlocked through laser-assisted additive manufacturing. This fiber laser sets the stage for the future of rapid fabrication of advanced fiber devices through unconventional manufacturing routes.</description>

      <title>On-chip near-infrared spectroscopic sensing with over 520nm bandwidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated spectrometers hold great promise for in-situ, in vitro, and even in vivo near-infrared (NIR) sensing applications. However, practical NIR applications require fine resolution, high accuracy, and mostly importantly, ultra-wide observation window that spans multiple overtone regions, for capturing spectral fingerprints. In this paper, we present an integrated reconstructive spectrometer utilizing dispersion-engineered ring resonators, achieving an over 520 nm operational bandwidth together with a superior resolution of less than 8 pm. This translates into an over 65,000 bandwidth-to-resolution ratio that represents a significant record breakthrough for miniaturized spectrometers. Moreover, we showcase a packaged spectrometer chip with auxiliary electronics, creating a fully functional NIR spectroscopic sensor. Various bandwidth-demanding NIR sensing applications are examined, including the classification of different types of solid substances and the concentration test of aqueous and organic solutions, all achieving approximately 100% accuracy. Specifically, we test the sensor's detection limit using glucose solutions and successfully identify concentrations as low as 0.1% (i.e. 100 mg/dL), which matches that of the commercial benchtop counterparts and sets up a new benchmark for miniaturized spectroscopic sensors.</description>

      <title>Sub-2 Kelvin characterization of nitrogen-vacancy centers in silicon carbide nanopillars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of efficient quantum communication technologies depends on the innovation in multiple layers of its implementation, a challenge we address from the fundamental properties of the physical system at the nano-scale to the instrumentation level at the macro-scale. We select a promising near infrared quantum emitter, the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in 4H-SiC, and integrate it, at an ensemble level, with nanopillar structures that enhance photon collection efficiency into an objective lens. To characterize NV center properties at the unprecedented sub-2 Kelvin temperatures, we incorporate compatible superconducting nanowire single photon detectors inside the chamber of an optical cryostat and create the ICECAP, the Integrated Cryogenic system for Emission, Collection And Photon-detection. ICECAP measurements show no significant linewidth broadening of NV ensemble emission and up to 28-fold enhancement in collected emission. With additional filtering, we measure emitter lifetimes of NV centers in a basal ($hk$) and an axial ($kk$) orientation unveiling their cryogenic values of 2.21 ns and 2.86 ns.</description>
