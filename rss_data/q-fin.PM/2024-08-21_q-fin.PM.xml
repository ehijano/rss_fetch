      <title>Network-based diversification of stock and cryptocurrency portfolios</title>

Abstract: Maintaining a balance between returns and volatility is a common strategy for portfolio diversification, whether investing in traditional equities or digital assets like cryptocurrencies. One approach for diversification is the application of community detection or clustering, using a network representing the relationships between assets. We examine two network representations, one based on a standard distance matrix based on correlation, and another based on mutual information. The Louvain and Affinity propagation algorithms were employed for finding the network communities (clusters) based on annual data. Furthermore, we examine building assets' co-occurrence networks, where communities are detected for each month throughout a whole year and then the links represent how often assets belong to the same community. Portfolios are then constructed by selecting several assets from each community based on local properties (degree centrality), global properties (closeness centrality), or explained variance (Principal component analysis), with three value ranges (max, med, min), calculated on a maximal spanning tree or a fully connected community sub-graph. We explored these various strategies on data from the S\&amp;P 500 and the Top 203 cryptocurrencies with a market cap above 2M USD in the period from Jan 2019 to Sep 2022. Moreover, we study into more details the periods of the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak and the start of the war in Ukraine. The results confirm some of the previous findings already known for traditional stock markets and provide some further insights, while they reveal an opposing trend in the crypto-assets market.</description>

      <title>Less is more: AI Decision-Making using Dynamic Deep Neural Networks for Short-Term Stock Index Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a multi-agent deep-learning method which trades in the Futures markets based on the US S&amp;P 500 index. The method (referred to as Model A) is an innovation founded on existing well-established machine-learning models which sample market prices and associated derivatives in order to decide whether the investment should be long/short or closed (zero exposure), on a day-to-day decision. We compare the predictions with some conventional machine-learning methods namely, Long Short-Term Memory, Random Forest and Gradient-Boosted-Trees. Results are benchmarked against a passive model in which the Futures contracts are held (long) continuously with the same exposure (level of investment). Historical tests are based on daily daytime trading carried out over a period of 6 calendar years (2018-23). We find that Model A outperforms the passive investment in key performance metrics, placing it within the top quartile performance of US Large Cap active fund managers. Model A also outperforms the three machine-learning classification comparators over this period. We observe that Model A is extremely efficient (doing less and getting more) with an exposure to the market of only 41.95% compared to the 100% market exposure of the passive investment, and thus provides increased profitability with reduced risk.</description>
