      <title>Difference-in-Differences Estimators for Treatments Continuously Distributed at Every Period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.06898v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose difference-in-differences (DID) estimators in designs where the treatment is continuously distributed in every period, as is often the case when one studies the effects of taxes, tariffs, or prices. We assume that between consecutive periods, the treatment of some units, the switchers, changes, while the treatment of other units, the stayers, remains constant. We show that under a parallel-trends assumption, weighted averages of the slopes of switchers' potential outcomes are nonparametrically identified by difference-in-differences estimands comparing the outcome evolutions of switchers and stayers with the same baseline treatment. Controlling for the baseline treatment ensures that our estimands remain valid if the treatment's effect changes over time. We highlight two possible ways of weighting switcher's slopes, and discuss their respective advantages. For each weighted average of slopes, we propose a doubly-robust, nonparametric, $\sqrt{n}$-consistent, and asymptotically normal estimator. We generalize our results to the instrumental-variable case. Finally, we apply our method to estimate the price-elasticity of gasoline consumption.</description>

      <title>Testing linearity of spatial interaction functions \`a la Ramsey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a computationally straightforward test for the linearity of a spatial interaction function. Such functions arise commonly, either as practitioner imposed specifications or due to optimizing behaviour by agents. Our conditional heteroskedasticity robust test is nonparametric, but based on the Lagrange Multiplier principle and reminiscent of the Ramsey RESET approach. This entails estimation only under the null hypothesis, which yields an easy to estimate linear spatial autoregressive model. Monte Carlo simulations show excellent size control and power. An empirical study with Finnish data illustrates the test's practical usefulness, shedding light on debates on the presence of tax competition among neighbouring municipalities.</description>

      <title>Policy Learning with Distributional Welfare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15878v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore optimal treatment allocation policies that target distributional welfare. Most literature on treatment choice has considered utilitarian welfare based on the conditional average treatment effect (ATE). While average welfare is intuitive, it may yield undesirable allocations especially when individuals are heterogeneous (e.g., with outliers) - the very reason individualized treatments were introduced in the first place. This observation motivates us to propose an optimal policy that allocates the treatment based on the conditional quantile of individual treatment effects (QoTE). Depending on the choice of the quantile probability, this criterion can accommodate a policymaker who is either prudent or negligent. The challenge of identifying the QoTE lies in its requirement for knowledge of the joint distribution of the counterfactual outcomes, which is not generally point-identified. We introduce minimax policies that are robust to this model uncertainty. A range of identifying assumptions can be used to yield more informative policies. For both stochastic and deterministic policies, we establish the asymptotic bound on the regret of implementing the proposed policies. The framework can be generalized to any setting where welfare is defined as a functional of the joint distribution of the potential outcomes.</description>
