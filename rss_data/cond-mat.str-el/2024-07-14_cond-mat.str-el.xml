      <title>Hydrodynamics as the effective field theory of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the hunt for new phases of matter in quantum mixed states, it has recently been proposed that the equivalence of microcanonical and canonical ensembles in statistical mechanics is a manifestation of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) in an underlying many-body quantum description. Here, we build an effective field theory for SWSSB of a global U(1) symmetry; the answer exactly reproduces the Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theory of diffusion for the conserved charge. We conclude that hydrodynamics can be understood as a theory of "superfluidity" for the broken strong symmetry: a non-vanishing susceptibility is a measurable order parameter for SWSSB, the diffusion mode is the Goldstone boson of the spontaneously broken continuous symmetry, and a generalization of Goldstone's Theorem implies that the diffusion mode is always long-lived. This perspective provides a transparent physical explanation for the unusual "reparameterization" symmetries which are a necessary ingredient of Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theories for "normal fluids".</description>

      <title>Breakdown of order-fractionalization in the CPT model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the half-filled CPT model, an analytically tractable Kondo lattice model with Yao-Lee spin-spin interactions on a 3D hyperoctagon lattice, proposed by Coleman, Panigrahi, and Tsvelik. Previous studies have established that the CPT model exhibits odd-frequency triplet superconductivity and order fractionalization. Through asymptotic analyses in the small $J$ and large $J$ Kondo coupling limits, we identify a quantum critical point at $J_c$, marking a transition from a superconductor to a Kondo insulator. By estimating the vison gap energy to account for thermal gauge fluctuations, we determine the energy scales governing the thermal breakdown of order fractionalization. Moreover, at large $J$ the Kondo insulator undergoes orbital decoupling, leading to the formation of a decoupled Kitaev orbital liquid. These findings and analogies with the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauged $XY$ model lead us to propose a tentative phase diagram for the CPT model at half-filling.</description>

      <title>Exciton condensation driven by bound states of Green's functions zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction driven transition between quantum spin-Hall and Mott insulators in the Bernevig, Hughes and Zhang model is studied by dynamical cluster approximation, and found to be accompanied by the emergence of Green's function zeros already in the quantum spin-Hall regime. The non-trivial interplay between Green's function poles and zeros leads to an exotic quantum spin-Hall insulator exhibiting two chiral branches of edge Green's function poles and one of zeros. When symmetry breaking is allowed, a non-topological excitonic insulator is found to intrude between quantum spin-Hall and Mott insulators. We find evidence that excitons in the Mott insulator, which become soft at the transition to the excitonic insulator, are actually bound states between valence and conduction bands of Green's function zeros, rather than between lower and upper Hubbard bands.</description>

      <title>Magnetic properties and field-induced phenomena in the Jeff = 1/2 distorted kagome antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intertwining between competing degrees of freedom, anisotropy, and frustration-induced quantum fluctuations offers an ideal ground to realize exotic quantum phenomena in the rare-earth-based kagome lattice. The magnetic susceptibility reveals the presence of two energy scales in agreement with the INS results. The higher energy state is dominated by CEF excitations, where the lowest Kramers ground-state doublet is well separated from the excited state suggesting that the compound realizes a low-energy state at low temperatures. The second energy scale is witnessed via thermodynamic results that reveal an anomaly at 0.3 K typical of a phase transition, which is attributed to the presence of complex magnetic ordering phenomena. The broad maximum in the specific heat well above 0.3 K indicates the presence of short-range spin correlations that is corroborated by muon spin relaxation rate results. The isothermal magnetization reveals a field-induced 1/3 magnetization plateau at low temperatures. muSR relaxation rate experiments, on the other hand, neither show the signature of a phase transition nor spin-freezing down to 34 mK. The ZF muSR relaxation is governed by the Orbach process and reveals the presence of a fluctuating state owing to the depopulation of crystal field levels reflected as a constant value of relaxation rate in the temperature range 0.4-10 K. NMR results indicate the presence of fluctuating Nd3+ moments down to 1.8 K consistent with muSR experiments. Our comprehensive results reveal that a field-induced quantum critical phenomenon is at play in this frustrated kagome magnet and enable us to construct a phase diagram exemplifying the proximity effect of competing magnetic states. This sets the stage to investigate the broad RE3BWO9 family of rare-earth kagome magnets promising to host exotic quantum states driven by spin-orbit coupling and geometrical frustration.</description>

      <title>Kekul\'e valence bond order in the honeycomb lattice optical Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Model and its relevance to Graphen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform sign-problem-free determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the optical Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model on a half-filled honeycomb lattice. In particular, we investigate the model's semi-metal (SM) to Kekul{\'e} Valence Bond Solid (KVBS) phase transition at zero and finite temperatures as a function of phonon energy and interaction strength. Using hybrid Monte Carlo sampling methods we can simulate the model near the adiabatic regime, allowing us to access regions of parameter space relevant to graphene. Our simulations suggest that the SM-KVBS transition is weakly first-order at all temperatures, with graphene situated close to the phase boundary in the SM region of the phase diagram. Our results highlight the important role bond-stretching phonon modes play in the formation of KVBS order in strained graphene-derived systems.</description>

      <title>Taming spin susceptibilities in frustrated quantum magnets: Mean-field form and approximate nature of the quantum-to-classical correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In frustrated quantum magnets the empirically found quantum-to-classical correspondence (QCC) matches the real-space static susceptibility pattern of a quantum spin-$1/2$ model with its classical counterpart computed at a certain elevated temperature. This puzzling relation was observed via bold line diagrammatic Monte Carlo simulations in dimensions two and three, where the matching was within error bars and seemed valid down to the lowest accessible temperatures $T$ about an order of magnitude smaller than the exchange coupling $J$. Here we employ resummed spin diagrammatic perturbation theory to show analytically that the QCC breaks at fourth order in $J/T$ and provide the approximate mapping between classical and quantum temperatures. Our treatment further reveals that QCC is an indication of the surprising accuracy with which static correlators can be approximated by a simple renormalized mean-field form. We illustrate this for all models discussed in the context of QCC so far, including a recent example of the $S=1$ material $\mathrm{K}_2\mathrm{Ni}_2(\mathrm{SO}_4)_3$. The success of the mean-field form is traced back to partial diagrammatic cancellations.</description>

      <title>Beyond the instanton gas approach: dominant thimbles approximation for the Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To each complex saddle point of an action, one can attach a Lefschetz thimble on which the imaginary part of the action is constant. Cauchy theorem states that summation over a set of thimbles produces the exact result. This reorganization of the path integral, is an appealing starting point for various approximations: In the realm of auxiliary quantum Monte Carlo methods it provides a framework to alleviate the negative sign problem. Here, we suggest to constrain the integration to the \textit{dominant} thimbles: the thimbles attached to the saddle points with the largest statistical weight. For the Hubbard model, in a formulation where the the Hubbard Stratonovitch field couples to the charge, this provides a \textit{symmetry} consistent approximation to the physics of the Hubbard model: constraining the integration domain does not explicitly break a symmetry. We can test this approach for the Hubbard model at half-filling on a bipartite lattice. The paper builds on the previously developed instanton gas approach, where an exhaustive saddle point approximation was constructed. We present results, showing that the dominant thimbles approximation provides results that are in remarkable agreement with the exact results for various fermionic observables including spin and charge order parameters and single electron spectral functions. We discuss implications of our results for simulations away of half filling.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic mixed-state SPT from modulated symmetries and hierarchical structure of anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of intrinsic symmetry-protected topological mixed-state(mSPT) in open quantum systems that feature modulated symmetries, such as dipole and subsystem symmetries. Intriguingly, these mSPT phases cannot be realized as the ground states of a gapped Hamiltonian under thermal equilibrium. The microscopic form of the density matrix characterizing these intrinsic mixed-state SPT ensembles is constructed using solvable coupled-wire models that incorporate quenched disorder or quantum channels. A detailed comparison of the hierarchical structure of boundary anomalies in both pure and mixed states is presented, utilizing flux insertion and Laughlin's charge pumping arguments. Finally, we explore the salient features of boundary anomalies in the mixed-state ensemble, which can be detected through the Renyi-N correlation function of charged observables.</description>

      <title>Chern Bands' Optimally Localized Wannier Functions and Fractional Chern Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent development on fractional Chern insulators and proximate phases call for a real space representation of isolated Chern bands. Here we propose a new method for a general construction of optimally localized Wannier functions from such Chern bands. We do so through an optimal gauge choice of the Bloch states of a Chern band with the singularity placed at any desired position in momentum space. We apply this method to construct the optimally localized Wannier functions for kagome lattice, and use it to identify channels of interactions that are favorable to the development of fractional Chern insulators. Implications of the approach for the interplay between correlations and topology in broader contexts are discussed.</description>

      <title>Reference CC3 Excitation Energies for Organic Chromophores: Benchmarking TD-DFT, BSE/$GW$ and Wave Function Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To expand the QUEST database of highly-accurate vertical transition energies, we consider a series of large organic chromogens ubiquitous in dye chemistry, such as anthraquinone, azobenzene, BODIPY, and naphthalimide. We compute, at the CC3 level of theory, the singlet and triplet vertical transition energies associated with the low-lying excited states. This leads to a collection of more than 120 new highly-accurate excitation energies. Subsequently, we employ these reference values to benchmark a series of lower-order wave function approaches, including the popular ADC(2) and CC2 schemes, as well as time-dependent density-functional theory (TD-DFT), both with and without applying the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA). At the TD-DFT level, we evaluate a large panel of global, range-separated, local, and double hybrid functionals. Additionally, we assess the performance of the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) formalism relying on both $G_0W_0$ and ev$GW$ quasiparticle energies evaluated from various starting points. It turns out that CC2 and ADC(2.5) are the most accurate models amongst those with respective $\mathcal{O}(N^5)$ and $\mathcal{O}(N^6)$ scalings with system size. In contrast, CCSD does not outperform CC2. The best performing exchange-correlation functionals include BMK, M06-2X, M06-SX, CAM-B3LYP, $\omega$B97X-D, and LH20t, with average deviations of approximately 0.20 eV or slightly below. Errors on vertical excitation energies can be further reduced by considering double hybrids. Both SOS-$\omega$B88PP86 and SOS-$\omega$PBEPP86 exhibit particularly attractive performances with overall quality on par with CC2, whereas PBE0-DH and PBE-QIDH are only slightly less efficient. BSE/ev$GW$ calculations based on Kohn-Sham starting points have been found to be particularly effective for singlet transitions, but much less for their triplet counterparts.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing quantum transport from wave function snapshots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study nonequilibrium quantum dynamics of spin chains by employing principal component analysis (PCA) on data sets of wave function snapshots and examine how information propagates within these data sets. The quantities we employ are derived from the spectrum of the sample second moment matrix, built directly from data sets. Our investigations on several interacting spin chains featuring distinct spin or energy transport reveal that the growth of data information spreading follows the same dynamical exponents as that of the underlying quantum transport of spin or energy. Specifically, our approach enables an easy, data-driven, and importantly interpretable diagnostic to track energy transport with a limited number of samples, which is usually challenging without any assumption on the Hamiltonian form. These observations are obtained at a modest finite size and evolution time, which aligns with experimental and numerical constraints. Our framework directly applies to experimental quantum simulator data sets of dynamics in higher-dimensional systems, where classical simulation methods usually face significant limitations and apply equally to both near- and far-from-equilibrium quenches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the entire energy spectrum of an electron droplet in the lowest Landau level. By exact diagonalization calculations, we find highly excited states in the middle of the spectrum that display unexpected density distribution and pair correlation. We show that these exceptional excited states contain tightly bound electron bubbles with local filling $\nu = 1$ that form various ordered structures. Remarkably, these bubble excited states are shown to exist for both the $1/r$ Coulomb interaction and the $1/r^3$ dipole interaction. The experimental realization of bubble excited states in moir\'e materials under a magnetic field is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Bonding states underpinning structural transitions in IrTe$_2$ observed with micro-ARPES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Competing interactions in low-dimensional materials can produce nearly degenerate electronic and structural phases. We investigate the staircase of structural phase transitions in layered IrTe$_2$ for which a number of potential transition mechanisms have been postulated. The spatial coexistence of multiple phases on the micron scale has prevented a detailed analysis of the electronic structure. By exploiting micro-ARPES obtained with synchrotron radiation we extract the electronic structure of the multiple structural phases in IrTe$_2$ in order to address the mechanism underlying the phase transitions. We find direct evidence of lowered energy states that appear in the low-temperature phases, states previously predicted by \textit{ab initio} calculations and extended here. Our results validate a proposed scenario of bonding and anti-bonding states as the driver of the phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trillium lattices formed by corner-shared triangular units are the platform for magnetic frustration in three dimensions. Herein, we report structural and magnetic properties of the Cr-based double trillium lattice material KBaCr$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$ studied by x-ray diffraction, magnetization, heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and $^{31}$P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements complemented by density-functional band-structure calculations. Heat capacity and $^{31}$P NMR measurements reveal the magnetic transition at $T_{\rm N1} \simeq 13.5$ K in zero field followed by another transition at $T_{\rm N2} \simeq 7$ K in weak applied fields. The NMR sublattice magnetization confirms that the transition at $T_{\rm N1}$ is 3D in nature. The $^{31}$P spin-lattice relaxation rate in the ordered state follows the $T^3$ behavior indicative of the two-magnon Raman process. The spin lattice of KBaCr$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$ comprises two crystallographically nonequivalent ferromagnetic sublattices that are coupled antiferromagnetically, thus eliminating frustration in this trillium network.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review recent progress regarding the double scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and other $p$-local quantum mechanical random Hamiltonians. These models exhibit an expansion using chord diagrams, which can be solved by combinatorial methods. We describe exact results in these models, including their spectrum, correlation functions, and Lyapunov exponent. In a certain limit, these techniques manifest the relation to the Schwarzian quantum mechanics, a theory of quantum gravity in $AdS_2$. More generally, the theory is controlled by a rigid algebraic structure of a quantum group, suggesting a theory of quantum gravity on non-commutative $q$-deformed $AdS_2$. We conclude with discussion of related universality classes, and survey some of the current research directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.14918v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Van der Waals heterostructures have recently emerged as an exciting platform for investigating the effects of strong electronic correlations, including various forms of magnetic or electrical orders. Here, we perform an unbiased exact diagonalization study of the effects of interactions on topological flat bands of twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) at odd integer fillings. For hole-filling $\nu_h = 1$, we find that Chern insulator phases, expected from interaction-induced spin-valley polarization of the bare bands, are quite fragile, and give way to spontaneous multiferroic order -- coexisting ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism, in presence of long-range Coulomb repulsion. We provide a simple real-space picture to understand the phase diagram as a function of interaction range and strength. Our findings establish twisted TMDs as a novel and highly tunable platform for multiferroicity, and we outline a potential route towards electrical control of magnetism in the multiferroic phase.</description>

      <title>Revisitation of the lock-in transition in one-dimensional charge-density waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.11525v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We studied the lock-in transition of charge-density waves of one-dimensional conductors. Though this phenomenon has been known for decades, there are still discrepancies between the theories and the experiments. We focused on the pioneering study of this phenomenon by McMillan and revisited, in particular, his numerical calculations. We first reproduced his results by providing unwritten information in the article. The obtained critical point was in good agreement with the previous study, as well as the analytical solution proposed later. We found a simple power-law behavior of the free energy in the critical regime, leading to the power-law divergence of the specific heat. We also introduced the concept of stiffness, equivalent to helicity modulus, which also showed a power-law behavior. These results allowed us to propose a new perspective on the lock-in transition.</description>

      <title>De Haas-van Alphen effect and a giant temperature peak in heavy fermion SmB$_6$ compound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13565v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we suggest a possible explanation of the giant temperature peak in the amplitude of the de Haas-van Alphen oscillations observed at very low temperatures in insulating SmB$_6$ system. Our theoretical model consists of two fermions with particle-like dispersion but with different masses, one much heavier than the other, which hybridize with each other to open up a gap at their degeneracy point. As a result of the hybridization a heavy-fermion hybrid appears at the Fermi level. Our results strongly suggest that it is exactly this heavy-fermion hybrid which results in the giant temperature peak. In addition we propose a scenario when this hybrid has edge states.</description>

      <title>Delay Update in determinant quantum Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12005v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) is a widely used unbiased numerical method for simulating strongly correlated electron systems. However, the update process in DQMC is often a bottleneck for its efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a generalized delay update scheme that can handle both onsite and extended interactions. Our delay update scheme can be implemented in both zero-temperature and finite-temperature versions of DQMC. We apply the delay update scheme to various strongly correlated electron models and evaluate its efficiency under different conditions. Our results demonstrate that the proposed delay update scheme significantly improves the efficiency of DQMC simulations, enable it to simulate larger system size.</description>

      <title>New Approach to Strong Correlation: Twisting Hubbard into the Orbital Hatsugai-Kohmoto Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08746v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the $n$-orbital extension of the Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) model to the orbital HK (OHK) model which obtains by covering the Brillouin zone with $N/n$ Hubbard clusters each containing $n$-sites all connected via twisted boundary conditions. We show that this defines a systematic computational scheme to go from $n=1$ ``band'' HK to the full Hubbard model. Further, through powerful scaling arguments, we show that the convergence to Hubbard goes as $1/n^{2d}$ for $n^d$-orbital HK on a $d$-dimensional system implying that all the fluctuations vanish in $d=\infty$. As evidence for the above, we employ exact diagonalization and DMRG to show that the OHK model matches the exact (from Bethe ansatz) ground state energy of the 1d Hubbard model within 1$\%$ with just $n=10$ orbitals. For a square lattice, we recover an insulating state regardless of the strength of the interactions, double occupancy in agreement with state of the art simulations, dynamical spectral weight transfer, short-range antiferromagnetic correlations and charge neutral excitations leading to the algebraic temperature dependence of the specific heat, all with a fraction of the computational time of more advanced cluster methods and making it possible to obtain analytical insights. The success of OHK and its rapid convergence to the Hubbard model reiterates that a fixed point controls the physics. Consequently, the $n$-orbital HK model offers a new tool for strongly correlated quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Deconfined Fermi liquid to Fermi liquid transition and superconducting instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deconfined quantum critical points (DQCP) have attracted lots of attentions in the past decades, but were mainly restricted to incompressible phases. On the other hand, various experimental puzzles call for new theory of unconventional quantum criticality between metals at a generic density. Here we explore the possibility of a deconfined transition between two symmetric Fermi liquids in a bilayer model tuned by inter-layer antiferromagnetic spin-spin coupling $J_\perp$. Across the transition the Fermi surface volume per flavor jumps by $1/2$ of the Brillouin zone (BZ), similar to the small to large Fermi surface transitions in heavy Fermion systems and maybe also in the high Tc cuprates. But in the bilayer case the small Fermi surface phase (dubbed as sFL) has neither symmetry breaking nor fractionalization, akin to the symmetric mass generation (SMG) discussed in high energy physics. We formulate a deconfined critical theory where the two Fermi liquids correspond to higgs and/or confined phases of a $U(1)\times U(1)$ gauge theory. We show that this deconfined FL to FL transition (DFFT) fixed point is unstable to pairing and thus a superconductor dome is expected at low temperature. At finite temperature above the pairing scale, microscopic electron is a three particle bound state of the deconfined fractional fermions in the critical theory. We also introduce another parameter which can suppress the pairing instability, leading to a deconfined tri-critical point stable to zero temperature. We also provide numerical results of the bilayer model in one dimension, with a Luther-Emery liquid between two different Luttinger liquids, similar to the phase diagram from the field theory in two dimension. Our work opens a new direction to exploring deconfined metallic criticality and new pairing mechanism from critical gauge field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The properties of kagome metals are governed by the interdependence of band topology and electronic correlations resulting in remarkably rich phase diagrams. Here, we study the temperature evolution of the bulk electronic structure of the antiferromagnetic kagome metal FeGe using infrared spectroscopy. We uncover drastic changes in the low-energy interband absorption at the 100 K structural phase transition that has been linked to a charge-density-wave (CDW) instability. We explain this effect by the minuscule Fe displacement in the kagome plane, which results in parallel bands in the vicinity of the Fermi level. In contrast to conventional CDW materials, however, the spectral weight shifts to low energies, ruling out the opening of a CDW gap in FeGe.</description>

      <title>Critical behavior of Fredenhagen-Marcu string order parameters at topological phase transitions with emergent higher-form symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A nonlocal string order parameter detecting topological order and deconfinement has been proposed by Fredenhagen and Marcu (FM). However, due to the lack of exact internal symmetries for lattice models and the nonlinear dependence of the FM string order parameter on ground states, it is a priori not guaranteed that it is a genuine order parameter for topological phase transitions. In this work, we find that the FM string order parameter exhibits universal scaling behavior near critical points of charge condensation transitions, by directly evaluating the FM string order parameter in the infinite string-length limit using infinite Projected Entangled Pair States (iPEPS) for the toric code in a magnetic field. Our results thus demonstrate that the FM string order parameter represents a quantitatively well-behaved order parameter. We find that only in the presence of an emergent 1-form symmetry the corresponding FM string order parameter can faithfully detect topological transitions.</description>

      <title>Disorder-Free Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models: Integrability and Quantum Chaos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce two disorder-free variants of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, demonstrate their integrability, and study their static and dynamical properties. Unlike diagrammatic techniques, the integrability of these models allows us to obtain dynamical correlation functions even when the number of Majorana fermions is finite. From the solutions, we find that out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) in these models exhibit exponential growth at early times, resembling that of quantum chaotic systems such as those with disorder or external kick terms. Conversely, our analysis shows no evidence of random-matrix behavior in level statistics or the spectral form factor. Our findings illustrate that the clean versions of the SYK models represent simple but nontrivial examples of disorder-free quantum many-body systems displaying chaos-like behavior of OTOCs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10347v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a variational wave function to represent quantum skyrmions as bosonic operators. The operator faithfully reproduces two fundamental features of quantum skyrmions: their classical magnetic order and a "quantum cloud" of local spin-flip excitations. Using exact numerical simulations of the ground states of a 2D chiral magnetic model, we find two regions in the single-skyrmion state diagram distinguished by their leading quantum corrections. We use matrix product state simulations of the adiabatic braiding of two skyrmions to verify that the operator representation of skyrmions is valid at large inter-skyrmion distances. Our work demonstrates that skyrmions can be approximately coarse-grained and represented by bosonic quasiparticles, which paves the way toward a field theory of many-skyrmion quantum phases and, unlike other approaches, incorporates the microscopic quantum fluctuations of individual skyrmions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09396v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically simulate a non-Abelian lattice gauge theory in two spatial dimensions, with tensor networks (TN), up to intermediate sizes (&gt;30 matter sites) well beyond exact diagonalization. We focus on the SU(2) Yang-Mills model in Hamiltonian formulation, with dynamical matter and minimally truncated gauge field (hardcore gluon). Thanks to the TN sign-problem-free approach, we characterize the phase diagram of the model at zero and finite baryon number as a function of the quark bare mass and color charge. At intermediate system sizes, we detect a liquid phase of quark-pair bound-state quasiparticles (baryons), whose mass is finite towards the continuum limit. Interesting phenomena arise at the transition boundary where color-electric and color-magnetic terms are maximally frustrated: For low quark masses, we see traces of potential deconfinement, while for high masses, signatures of a possible topological order.</description>

      <title>Higher-Matter and Landau-Ginzburg Theory of Higher-Group Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher-matter is defined by higher-representation of a symmetry algebra, such as the $p$-form symmetries, higher-group symmetries or higher-categorical symmetries. In this paper, we focus on the cases of higher-group symmetries, which are formulated in terms of the strictification of weak higher-groups. We systematically investigate higher-matter charged under 2-group symmetries, defined by automorphism 2-representations. Furthermore, we construct a Lagrangian formulation of such higher-matter fields coupled to 2-group gauge fields in the path space of the spacetime manifold. We interpret such model as the Landau-Ginzburg theory for 2-group symmetries, and discuss the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of 2-group symmetries under this framework. Examples of discrete and continuous 2-groups are discussed. Interestingly, we find that a non-split 2-group symmetry can admit an SSB to a split 2-group symmetry, where the Postnikov class is trivialized. We also briefly discuss the strictification of weak 3-groups, weak 3-group gauge fields and 3-representations in special cases.</description>

Abstract: We consider the hydrodynamic origin of anomalous current fluctuations in a family of stochastic charged cellular automata. Using ballistic macroscopic fluctuation theory, we study both typical and large fluctuations of the charge current and reproduce microscopic results which are available for the deterministic single-file limit of the models. Our results indicate that in general initial fluctuations propagated by Euler equations fully characterize both scales of anomalous fluctuations. For stochastic dynamics, we find an additional contribution to typical fluctuations and conjecture the functional form of the typical probability distribution, which we confirm by numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: The identification of topological Weyl semimetals has recently gained considerable attention. Here, we report the results of density-functional theory calculations regarding the magnetic properties, the electronic structure, and the intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity of the title compound, which was synthesized already 50 years ago but received little attention, hitherto. We found Cs$_{2}$Co$_{3}$S$_4$ to be a ferrimagnetic half-metal with a total spin magnetic moment of about 3 $\mu_B$ per formula unit. It shows energy band gap of 0.36 eV in the majority-spin channel and a pseudo-gap at the Fermi level in the minority-spin channel. We identified several sets of low-energy Weyl points and traced their dependence on the direction of magnetization. The intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity is predicted to reach a magnitude up to 500 $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$, which is comparable to values obtained in other celebrated Weyl semimetals.</description>
