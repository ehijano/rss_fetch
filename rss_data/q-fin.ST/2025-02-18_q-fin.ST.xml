      <title>Generalized Factor Neural Network Model for High-dimensional Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We tackle the challenges of modeling high-dimensional data sets, particularly those with latent low-dimensional structures hidden within complex, non-linear, and noisy relationships. Our approach enables a seamless integration of concepts from non-parametric regression, factor models, and neural networks for high-dimensional regression. Our approach introduces PCA and Soft PCA layers, which can be embedded at any stage of a neural network architecture, allowing the model to alternate between factor modeling and non-linear transformations. This flexibility makes our method especially effective for processing hierarchical compositional data. We explore ours and other techniques for imposing low-rank structures on neural networks and examine how architectural design impacts model performance. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through simulation studies, as well as applications to forecasting future price movements of equity ETF indices and nowcasting with macroeconomic data.</description>

      <title>Generalization of the Alpha-Stable Distribution with the Degree of Freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Wright function based framework is proposed to combine and extend several distribution families. The $\alpha$-stable distribution is generalized by adding the degree of freedom parameter. The PDF of this two-sided super distribution family subsumes those of the original $\alpha$-stable, Student's t distributions, as well as the exponential power distribution and the modified Bessel function of the second kind. Its CDF leads to a fractional extension of the Gauss hypergeometric function. The degree of freedom makes possible for valid variance, skewness, and kurtosis, just like Student's t. The original $\alpha$-stable distribution is viewed as having one degree of freedom, that explains why it lacks most of the moments. A skew-Gaussian kernel is derived from the characteristic function of the $\alpha$-stable law, which maximally preserves the law in the new framework. To facilitate such framework, the stable count distribution is generalized as the fractional extension of the generalized gamma distribution. It provides rich subordination capabilities, one of which is the fractional $\chi$ distribution that supplies the needed 'degree of freedom' parameter. Hence, the "new" $\alpha$-stable distribution is a "ratio distribution" of the skew-Gaussian kernel and the fractional $\chi$ distribution. Mathematically, it is a new form of higher transcendental function under the Wright function family. Last, the new univariate symmetric distribution is extended to the multivariate elliptical distribution successfully.</description>
