      <title>Ergodicity and Law-of-large numbers for the Volterra Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Volterra Volterra Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process on $\mathbb{R}_+$ and its stationary version. Based on a fine asymptotic analysis of the corresponding Volterra Riccati equation combined with the affine transformation formula, we first show that the finite-dimensional distributions of this process are asymptotically independent. Afterwards, we prove a law-of-large numbers in $L^p$(\Omega)$ with $p \geq 2$ and show that the stationary process is ergodic. As an application, we prove the consistency of the method of moments and study the maximum-likelihood estimation for continuous and discrete high-frequency observations.</description>

      <title>Semi-analytical pricing of options written on SOFR futures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a semi-analytical approach to pricing options on SOFR futures where the underlying SOFR follows a time-dependent CEV model. By definition, these options change their type at the beginning of the reference period: before this time, this is an American option written on a SOFR forward price as an underlying, and after this point, this is an arithmetic Asian option with an American style exercise written on the daily SOFR rates. We develop a new version of the GIT method and solve both problems semi-analytically, obtaining the option price, the exercise boundary, and the option Greeks. This work is intended to address the concern that the transfer from LIBOR to SOFR has resulted in a situation in which the options of the key money market (i.e., futures on the reference rate) are options without any pricing model available. Therefore, the trading in options on 3M SOFR futures currently ends before their reference quarter starts, to eliminate the final metamorphosis into exotic options.</description>

      <title>Risk measures on incomplete markets: a new non-solid paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The abstract theory of risk measures is well-developed for certain classes of solid subspaces of $L^{0}$. We provide an example to illustrate that this framework is insufficient to deal with the subtleties of incomplete markets. To remedy this problem, we consider risk measures on the subspace generated by a closed, absolutely convex, and bounded subset $K\subset L^{0}$, which represents the attainable securities. In this context, we introduce the equicontinuous Fatou property. Under the existence of a certain topology $\tau$ on $\mathrm{span}(K)$, interpreted as a generalized weak-star topology, we obtain an equivalence between the equicontinuous Fatou property, and lower semicontinuity with respect to $\tau$. As a corollary, we obtain tractable dual representations for such risk measures, which subsumes essentially all known results on weak-star representations of risk measures. This dual representation allows one to prove that all risk measures of this form extend, in a maximal way, to the ideal generated by $\mathrm{span}(K)$ while preserving a Fatou-like property.</description>

      <title>Aggregation of financial markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a formal framework for the aggregation of financial markets mediated by arbitrage. Our main tool is to characterize markets via utility functions and to employ a one-to-one correspondence to limit order book states. Inspired by the theory of thermodynamics, we argue that the arbitrage-mediated aggregation mechanism gives rise to a market-dynamical entropy, which quantifies the loss of liquidity caused by aggregation. As a concrete guiding example, we illustrate our general approach with the Uniswap v2 automated market maker protocol used in decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges, which we characterize as a so-called ideal market. We derive its equivalent limit order book representation and explicitly compute the arbitrage-mediated aggregation of two liquidity pools of the same asset pair with different marginal prices. We also discuss future directions of research in this emerging theory of market dynamics.</description>

      <title>Portfolio optimisation with options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.12658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new analysis for portfolio optimisation with options, tackling the three fundamental issues with this problem: asymmetric options' distributions, high dimensionality and dependence structure. To do so, we propose a new dependency matrix, built upon conditional probabilities between options' payoffs, and show how it can be computed in closed form given a copula structure of the underlying asset prices. The empirical evidence we provide highlights that this approach is efficient, fast and easily scalable to large portfolios of (mixed) options.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional indefinite stochastic Riccati equations and zero-sum stochastic linear-quadratic differential games with non-Markovian regime switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with zero-sum stochastic linear-quadratic differential games in a regime switching model. The coefficients of the games depend on the underlying noises, so it is a non-Markovian regime switching model. Based on the solutions of a new kind of multidimensional indefinite stochastic Riccati equation (SRE) and a multidimensional linear backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) with unbounded coefficients, we provide closed-loop optimal feedback control-strategy pairs for the two players. The main contribution of this paper, which is of great importance in its own right from the BSDE theory point of view, is to prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the new kind of SRE. Notably, the first component of the solution (as a process) is capable of taking positive and negative values simultaneously. For homogeneous systems, we obtain the optimal feedback control-strategy pairs under general closed convex cone control constraints. Finally, these results are applied to portfolio selection games with full or partial no-shorting constraint in a regime switching market with random coefficients.</description>

      <title>Learning to Optimally Stop Diffusion Processes, with Financial Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study optimal stopping for diffusion processes with unknown model primitives within the continuous-time reinforcement learning (RL) framework developed by Wang et al. (2020), and present applications to option pricing and portfolio choice. By penalizing the corresponding variational inequality formulation, we transform the stopping problem into a stochastic optimal control problem with two actions. We then randomize controls into Bernoulli distributions and add an entropy regularizer to encourage exploration. We derive a semi-analytical optimal Bernoulli distribution, based on which we devise RL algorithms using the martingale approach established in Jia and Zhou (2022a), and prove a policy improvement theorem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithms in pricing finite-horizon American put options and in solving Merton's problem with transaction costs, and show that both the offline and online algorithms achieve high accuracy in learning the value functions and characterizing the associated free boundaries.</description>
