      <title>An asymptotically optimal algorithm for generating bin cardinalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the balls-into-bins setting, $n$ balls are thrown uniformly at random into $n$ bins. The na\"{i}ve way to generate the final load vector takes $\Theta(n)$ time. However, it is well-known that this load vector has with high probability bin cardinalities of size $\Theta(\frac{\log n}{\log \log n})$. Here, we present an algorithm in the RAM model that generates the bin cardinalities of the final load vector in the optimal $\Theta(\frac{\log n}{\log \log n})$ time in expectation and with high probability.
  Further, the algorithm that we present is still optimal for any $m \in [n, n \log n]$ balls and can also be used as a building block to efficiently simulate more involved load balancing algorithms. In particular, for the Two-Choice algorithm, which samples two bins in each step and allocates to the least-loaded of the two, we obtain roughly a quadratic speed-up over the na\"{i}ve simulation.</description>

      <title>Exploring Repetitiveness Measures for Two-Dimensional Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting and measuring repetitiveness of strings is a problem that has been extensively studied in data compression and text indexing. However, when the data are structured in a non-linear way, like in the context of two-dimensional strings, inherent redundancy offers a rich source for compression, yet systematic studies on repetitiveness measures are still lacking. In the paper we introduce extensions of repetitiveness measures to general two-dimensional strings. In particular, we propose a new extension of the measures $\delta$ and $\gamma$, diverging from previous square based definitions proposed in [Carfagna and Manzini, SPIRE 2023]. We further consider generalizations of macro schemes and straight line programs for the 2D setting and show that, in contrast to what happens on strings, 2D macro schemes and 2D SLPs can be both asymptotically smaller than $\delta$ and $\gamma$. The results of the paper can be easily extended to $d$-dimensional strings with $d &gt; 2$.</description>

      <title>On the existence of $\delta$-temporal cliques in random simple temporal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider random simple temporal graphs in which every edge of the complete graph $K_n$ appears once within the time interval [0,1] independently and uniformly at random. Our main result is a sharp threshold on the size of any maximum $\delta$-clique (namely a clique with edges appearing at most $\delta$ apart within [0,1]) in random instances of this model, for any constant~$\delta$. In particular, using the probabilistic method, we prove that the size of a maximum $\delta$-clique is approximately $\frac{2\log{n}}{\log{\frac{1}{\delta}}}$ with high probability (whp). What seems surprising is that, even though the random simple temporal graph contains $\Theta(n^2)$ overlapping $\delta$-windows, which (when viewed separately) correspond to different random instances of the Erdos-Renyi random graphs model, the size of the maximum $\delta$-clique in the former model and the maximum clique size of the latter are approximately the same. Furthermore, we show that the minimum interval containing a $\delta$-clique is $\delta-o(\delta)$ whp. We use this result to show that any polynomial time algorithm for $\delta$-TEMPORAL CLIQUE is unlikely to have very large probability of success.</description>

      <title>Polygonal corona limit on multigrid dual tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growth pattern of an invasive cell-to-cell propagation (called the successive coronas) on the square grid is a tilted square. On the triangular and hexagonal grids, it is an hexagon. It is remarkable that, on the aperiodic structure of Penrose tilings, this cell-to-cell diffusion process tends to a regular decagon (at the limit). In this article we generalize this result to any regular multigrid dual tiling, by defining the characteristic polygon of a multigrid and its dual tiling. Exploiting this elegant duality allows to fully understand why such surprising phenomena, of seeing highly regular polygonal shapes emerge from aperiodic underlying structures, happen.</description>

      <title>Linear versus centred chromatic numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.15096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $\DeclareMathOperator{\chicen}{\chi_{\mathrm{cen}}}\DeclareMathOperator{\chilin}{\chi_{\mathrm{lin}}}$ A centred colouring of a graph is a vertex colouring in which every connected subgraph contains a vertex whose colour is unique and a \emph{linear colouring} is a vertex colouring in which every (not-necessarily induced) path contains a vertex whose colour is unique. For a graph $G$, the centred chromatic number $\chicen(G)$ and the linear chromatic number $\chilin(G)$ denote the minimum number of distinct colours required for a centred, respectively, linear colouring of $G$. From these definitions, it follows immediately that $\chilin(G)\le \chicen(G)$ for every graph $G$. The centred chromatic number is equivalent to treedepth and has been studied extensively. Much less is known about linear colouring. Kun et al [Algorithmica 83(1)] prove that $\chicen(G) \le \tilde{O}(\chilin(G)^{190})$ for any graph $G$ and conjecture that $\chicen(G)\le 2\chilin(G)$. Their upper bound was subsequently improved by Czerwinski et al [SIDMA 35(2)] to $\chicen(G)\le\tilde{O}(\chilin(G)^{19})$. The proof of both upper bounds relies on establishing a lower bound on the linear chromatic number of pseudogrids, which appear in the proof due to their critical relationship to treewidth. Specifically, Kun et al prove that $k\times k$ pseudogrids have linear chromatic number $\Omega(\sqrt{k})$. Our main contribution is establishing a tight bound on the linear chromatic number of pseudogrids, specifically $\chilin(G)\ge \Omega(k)$ for every $k\times k$ pseudogrid $G$. As a consequence we improve the general bound for all graphs to $\chicen(G)\le \tilde{O}(\chilin(G)^{10})$. In addition, this tight bound gives further evidence in support of Kun et al's conjecture (above) that the centred chromatic number of any graph is upper bounded by a linear function of its linear chromatic number.</description>

      <title>Canonical decompositions of 3-connected graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We offer a new structural basis for the theory of 3-connected graphs, providing a unique decomposition of every such graph into parts that are either quasi 4-connected, wheels, or thickened $K_{3,m}$'s. Our construction is explicit, canonical, and has the following applications: we obtain a new theorem characterising all Cayley graphs as either essentially 4-connected, cycles, or complete graphs on at most four vertices, and we provide an automatic proof of Tutte's wheel theorem.</description>
