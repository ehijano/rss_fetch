      <title>MS_ATpV-FWI: Full Waveform Inversion based on Multi-scale Structural Similarity Index Measure and Anisotropic Total p-Variation Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full waveform inversion (FWI) is a high-resolution seismic inversion technique popularly used in oil and gas exploration. Traditional FWI employs the $l_2$ norm measurement to minimize the misfit between observed and predicted seismic data. However, when the background velocity is inaccurate or the seismic data lacks low-frequency components, the conventional FWI suffers from cycle skipping, leading to inaccurate inversion results. This paper introduces a multiscale structural similarity index measure (M-SSIM) objective function for FWI. We also incorporate anisotropic total p-variation regularization (ATpV) to further improve the accuracy of FWI. M-SSIM extracts multi-scale structural features of seismic data in terms of both phase and amplitude. These features can reduce the risk of cycle skipping and improve the stability of FWI. Additionally, ATpV applies structural constraints to the velocity gradients, which helps suppress artifacts and preserve the sharp boundaries of geological formations. We propose to use the automatic differentiation (AD) to efficiently and stably optimize this novelly introduced FWI objective function. Both synthetic and field seismic data demonstrate that the proposed method accurately characterizes complex subsurface velocity structures, even when the background velocity is crude, the data lacks low-frequency components, or contains noise.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Acoustic Turbulence: Weak Versus Strong</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct numerical simulation of three-dimensional acoustic turbulence has been performed for both weak and strong regimes. Within the weak turbulence, we demonstrate the existence of the Zakharov-Sagdeev spectrum $\propto k^{-3/2}$ not only for weak dispersion but in the non-dispersion (ND) case as well. Such spectra in the $k$-space are accompanied by jets in the form of narrow cones. These distributions are realized due to small nonlinearity compared with both dispersion/diffraction. Increasing pumping in the ND case due to dominant nonlinear effects leads to the formation of shocks. As a result, the acoustic turbulence turns into an ensemble of random shocks with the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili spectrum.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric dynamics of first steps toward terraforming Mars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Warming Mars' surface could be a step toward making it suitable for life, but would represent a major science and engineering challenge. To warm Mars using engineered aerosol, particles released locally must disperse globally. The winds that transport aerosol respond to the aerosol's radiative forcing, implying strong radiative-dynamical feedbacks. Using a plume-tracking climate model without a water cycle, we investigate radiative-dynamical feedback from surface release of two particle compositions: graphene (which attenuates UV) and aluminum. Both compositions can give fast global warming of ~30 K. We infer that 2 liters/second release rate of graphene made from Mars' atmosphere via CO2-electrolysis could double Mars' greenhouse effect (+5 K). Self-lofting helps particles rise and spread. The Hadley cell strengthens under warming, aiding mixing. Warming can be focused in latitude by tuning particle size. Within our model, Mars radiative-dynamical feedbacks enable engineered-aerosol warming. Challenges remain, including functionalization, agglomeration, dry-deposition experiments, and modeling water cycle feedbacks.</description>

      <title>Electrical and seismic refraction methods: fundamental concepts, current trends, and emerging machine learning prospects -- A review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This comprehensive review examines electrical and seismic refraction methods, emphasizing their advanced applications in electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and seismic refraction tomography (SRT). These techniques are crucial for understanding surface-subsurface crustal dynamics, offering critical insights into resistivity and velocity structures for geological and geohazard assessments. The review also explores the induced polarization (IP) and self-potential (SP) methods as complementary approaches. Despite their effectiveness, ERT and SRT face challenges due to lithological heterogeneities, complex geological processes, and geophysical data uncertainties, necessitating multidisciplinary solutions such as methodological advancements and data integration strategies. Recently, machine learning (ML) techniques have been increasingly applied to joint ERT and SRT analyses, optimizing nonlinear inversion processes and improving the characterization of complex subsurface lithologies. The case studies presented in this review evaluate how supervised and unsupervised ML techniques enhance ERT and SRT by improving data interpretation, refining inversion accuracy, automating lithological differentiation, and predicting seismic velocity from resistivity data. The findings underscore the importance of integrating traditional geophysical methods with advanced data-driven approaches to improve subsurface investigations. Continued innovations in ERT and SRT methodologies, along with emerging computational tools and ML applications, will further enhance their effectiveness in geological, hydrological, environmental, and hazard assessments.</description>

      <title>Groningen: Spatial Prediction of Rock Gas Saturation by Leveraging Selected and Augmented Well and Seismic Data with Classifier Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a proof of concept for spatial prediction of rock saturation probability using classifier ensemble methods on the example of the giant Groningen gas field. The stages of generating 1481 seismic field attributes and selecting 63 significant attributes are described. The effectiveness of the proposed method of augmentation of well and seismic data is shown, which increased the training sample by 9 times. On a test sample of 42 wells (blind well test), the results demonstrate good accuracy in predicting the ensemble of classifiers: the Matthews correlation coefficient is 0.7689, and the F1-score for the "gas reservoir" class is 0.7949. Prediction of gas reservoir thicknesses within the field and adjacent areas is made.</description>

      <title>Guiding-centre Lagrangian and quasi-symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A charged particle in a suitably strong magnetic field spirals along the field lines while slowly drifting transversely. This note provides a brief derivation of an effective Lagrangian formulation for the guiding-centre approximation that captures this dynamics without resolving the gyro motion. It also explains how the effective Lagrangian may, for special magnetic fields, admit a 'quasi-symmetry' which can give rise to a conserved quantity helpful for plasma confinement in fields lacking a geometric isometry. The aim of this note is to offer a pedagogical introduction and some perspectives on this well-established subject.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Forward and Inverse Problems in Subsurface Imaging using Latent Space Translations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11247v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In subsurface imaging, learning the mapping from velocity maps to seismic waveforms (forward problem) and waveforms to velocity (inverse problem) is important for several applications. While traditional techniques for solving forward and inverse problems are computationally prohibitive, there is a growing interest in leveraging recent advances in deep learning to learn the mapping between velocity maps and seismic waveform images directly from data. Despite the variety of architectures explored in previous works, several open questions still remain unanswered such as the effect of latent space sizes, the importance of manifold learning, the complexity of translation models, and the value of jointly solving forward and inverse problems. We propose a unified framework to systematically characterize prior research in this area termed the Generalized Forward-Inverse (GFI) framework, building on the assumption of manifolds and latent space translations. We show that GFI encompasses previous works in deep learning for subsurface imaging, which can be viewed as specific instantiations of GFI. We also propose two new model architectures within the framework of GFI: Latent U-Net and Invertible X-Net, leveraging the power of U-Nets for domain translation and the ability of IU-Nets to simultaneously learn forward and inverse translations, respectively. We show that our proposed models achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for forward and inverse problems on a wide range of synthetic datasets, and also investigate their zero-shot effectiveness on two real-world-like datasets.
