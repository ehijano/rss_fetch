      <title>Optimizing Sales Forecasts through Automated Integration of Market Indicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recognizing that traditional forecasting models often rely solely on historical demand, this work investigates the potential of data-driven techniques to automatically select and integrate market indicators for improving customer demand predictions. By adopting an exploratory methodology, we integrate macroeconomic time series, such as national GDP growth, from the \textit{Eurostat} database into \textit{Neural Prophet} and \textit{SARIMAX} forecasting models. Suitable time series are automatically identified through different state-of-the-art feature selection methods and applied to sales data from our industrial partner. It could be shown that forecasts can be significantly enhanced by incorporating external information. Notably, the potential of feature selection methods stands out, especially due to their capability for automation without expert knowledge and manual selection effort. In particular, the Forward Feature Selection technique consistently yielded superior forecasting accuracy for both SARIMAX and Neural Prophet across different company sales datasets. In the comparative analysis of the errors of the selected forecasting models, namely Neural Prophet and SARIMAX, it is observed that neither model demonstrates a significant superiority over the other.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Beliefs Model of Stock Market Predictability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a theory of stock market predictability patterns based on a model of heterogeneous beliefs. In a discrete finite time framework, some agents receive news about an asset's fundamental value through a noisy signal. The investors are heterogeneous in that they have different beliefs about the stochastic supply. A momentum in the stock price arises from those agents who incorrectly underestimate the signal accuracy, dampening the initial price impact of the signal. A reversal in price occurs because the price reverts to the fundamental value in the long run. An extension of the model to multiple assets case predicts co-movement and lead-lag effect, in addition to cross-sectional momentum and reversal. The heterogeneous beliefs of investors about news demonstrate how the main predictability anomalies arise endogenously in a model of bounded rationality.</description>

      <title>Visibility graph analysis of crude oil futures markets: Insights from the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia-Ukraine conflict</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18903v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Drawing inspiration from the significant impact of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and the recent COVID-19 pandemic on global financial markets, this study conducts a thorough analysis of three key crude oil futures markets: WTI, Brent, and Shanghai (SC). Employing the visibility graph (VG) methodology, we examine both static and dynamic characteristics using daily and high-frequency data. We identified a clear power-law decay in most VG degree distributions and highlighted the pronounced clustering tendencies within crude oil futures VGs. Our results also confirm an inverse correlation between clustering coefficient and node degree and further reveal that all VGs not only adhere to the small-world property but also exhibit intricate assortative mixing. Through the time-varying characteristics of VGs, we found that WTI and Brent demonstrate aligned behavior, while the SC market, with its unique trading mechanics, deviates. The 5-minute VGs' assortativity coefficient provides a deeper understanding of these markets' reactions to the pandemic and geopolitical events. Furthermore, the differential responses during the COVID-19 and Russia-Ukraine conflict underline the unique sensitivities of each market to global disruptions. Overall, this research offers profound insights into the structure, dynamics, and adaptability of these essential commodities markets in the face of worldwide challenges.</description>
