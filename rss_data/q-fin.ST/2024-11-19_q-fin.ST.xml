      <title>Review of the EU ETS Literature: A Bibliometric Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01739v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study conducts a bibliometric review of scientific literature on the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) from 2004 to 2024, using research articles from the Scopus database. Using the Bibliometrix R package, we analyze publication trends, key themes, influential authors, and prominent journals related to the EU ETS. Our results indicate a notable increase in research activity over the past two decades, particularly during significant policy changes and economic events affecting carbon markets. Key research focuses include carbon pricing, market volatility, and economic impacts, highlighting a shift toward financial analysis and policy implications. Thematic mapping shows cap-and-trade systems, and carbon leakage as central topics linking various research areas. Additionally, we observe key areas where further research could be beneficial, such as expanding non-parametric methodologies, deepening the exploration of macroeconomic factors, and enhancing the examination of financial market connections. Moreover, we highlight recent and innovative papers that contribute new insights, showcasing emerging trends and cutting-edge approaches within the field. This review provides insights for researchers and policymakers, highlighting the evolving landscape of EU ETS research and its relevance to global climate strategies.</description>

      <title>Zero-Coupon Treasury Yield Curve with VIX as Stochastic Volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a multivariate autoregressive stochastic volatility model for the first 3 principal components (level, slope, curvature) of 10 series of zero-coupon Treasury bond rates with maturities from 1 to 10 years. We fit this model using monthly data from 1990. Next, we prove long-term stability for this discrete-time model and its continuous-time version. Unlike classic models with hidden stochastic volatility, here it is observed as VIX: the volatility index for the S\&amp;P 500 stock market index. It is surprising that this volatility, created for the stock market, also works for Treasury bonds. Since total returns of zero-coupon bonds can be easily found from these principal components, we prove long-term stability for total returns in discrete time.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks for Financial Fraud Detection: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The landscape of financial transactions has grown increasingly complex due to the expansion of global economic integration and advancements in information technology. This complexity poses greater challenges in detecting and managing financial fraud. This review explores the role of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in addressing these challenges by proposing a unified framework that categorizes existing GNN methodologies applied to financial fraud detection. Specifically, by examining a series of detailed research questions, this review delves into the suitability of GNNs for financial fraud detection, their deployment in real-world scenarios, and the design considerations that enhance their effectiveness. This review reveals that GNNs are exceptionally adept at capturing complex relational patterns and dynamics within financial networks, significantly outperforming traditional fraud detection methods. Unlike previous surveys that often overlook the specific potentials of GNNs or address them only superficially, our review provides a comprehensive, structured analysis, distinctly focusing on the multifaceted applications and deployments of GNNs in financial fraud detection. This review not only highlights the potential of GNNs to improve fraud detection mechanisms but also identifies current gaps and outlines future research directions to enhance their deployment in financial systems. Through a structured review of over 100 studies, this review paper contributes to the understanding of GNN applications in financial fraud detection, offering insights into their adaptability and potential integration strategies.</description>
