      <title>Reconfigurable Non-Hermitian Soliton Combs using Dissipative Couplings and Topological Windings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of dissipative Kerr solitons (DKS) in nonlinear resonators has revolutionized the generation of on-chip coherent optical frequency combs. The formation of DKS in conventional single resonators hinges on balancing the resonator dissipation against the parametric gain and balancing the resonator dispersion against the resonance frequency shifts introduced by the Kerr nonlinearity. Here, we theoretically introduce a new class of non-Hermitian soliton combs that are enabled by engineering the dissipation and dispersion of a coupled resonator array with nonreciprocal couplings. We show that these non-Hermitian soliton combs allow unprecedented post-fabrication agile reconfigurability of the soliton comb spectrum, where the number of comb lines, as well as their frequency spacing, can be drastically tuned by simply tuning the hopping phases between resonators. Such reconfigurable non-Hermitian combs generated using coupled resonator arrays could enable new functionalities for a multitude of comb applications.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Control of Momentum-Polarization Photoluminescence States with Liquid-Crystal-tuned Nanocavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic control of light, and in particular beam steering, is pivotal in various optical applications, including telecommunications, LiDAR, and biomedical imaging. Traditional approaches achieve this by interfacing a tunable modulating device with an external light source, facing challenges in achieving compact devices. Here, we introduce a dynamic photoluminescence (PL) modulating device, with which the properties of light directly emitted by a quasi-two-dimensional perovskite (in particular its directionality and polarization) can be modified continuously and over a large range. The device is based on a liquid-crystal-tunable Fabry-Perot (FP) nanocavity and uses the FP energy-momentum dispersion and spin-orbit coupling between the excitons and the cavity modes to enable this dynamic control over the emitted radiation. With this device, we achieve electrically-controlled, continuous and variable emission angles up to a maximum of 28{\deg}, as well as manipulation of the PL polarization state, enabling both the creation of polarization gradients and the achievement of polarization conversion at specific emission angles. Moreover, due to its resonant character, a 3-fold increase in the emission intensity is observed, as confirmed through time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements. Our approach leverages the unique properties of actively tunable birefringent nanocavities to improve emission directivity, angle tunability and polarization control, presenting a promising solution for next-generation, deeply integrated beam steering devices.</description>

      <title>Energy Time Ptychography for one-dimensional phase retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase retrieval is at the heart of adaptive optics and modern high-resolution imaging. Without phase information, optical systems are limited to intensity-only measurements, hindering full reconstruction of object structures and wavefront dynamics essential for advanced applications. Here, we address a one-dimensional phase problem linking energy and time, which arises in X-ray scattering from ultrasharp nuclear resonances. We leverage the M\"ossbauer effect, where nuclei scatter radiation without energy loss to the lattice, and are sensitive to their magneto-chemical environments. Rather than using traditional spectroscopy with radioactive gamma-ray sources, we measure nuclear forward scattering of synchrotron X-ray pulses in the time domain, providing superior sensitivity and faster data acquisition. Extracting spectral information from a single measurement is challenging due to the missing phase information, typically requiring extensive modeling. Instead, we use multiple energetically overlapping measurements to retrieve both the transmission spectrum and the phase of the scattering response, similar to ptychographic phase retrieval in imaging. Our robust approach can overcome the bandwidth limitations of gamma-ray sources, opening new research directions with modern X-ray sources and M\"ossbauer isotopes.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive study on beam dynamics inside symmetrically chirped waveguide array mimicking the graded index media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we theoretically investigate the beam dynamics inside symmetrically chirped nonlinear waveguide arrays, while taking into account two different chirping schemes, namely linear and quadratic. We propose realistic structure of chirped waveguide array that opens up new avenues in controlling the light flow. The beam dynamics inside such waveguides are modeled by adopting a continuous approximation of the discrete nonlinear Schrodinger equation (DNLSE) that usually governs the beam propagating in a discrete system which facilitates us in applying the semi-analytical variational method to grasp the beam dynamics. Our analytical treatment reveals that the symmetrically chirped waveguide array unambiguously mimics the graded index system where coupling coefficient with transverse variation play an equivalent role to that of the refractive index in continuous dispersive media. Exploiting the results of variational treatment we obtain state solutions and examine their robustness from the linear stability analysis. We reveal, that a symmetrically chirped waveguide array offers an oscillatory path for an input Gaussian beam exactly like a parabolic index media, along with self-focusing and imaging of the beam under Kerr-nonlinearity. We demonstrate that, under nonlinearity, discrete solitons with sech-type shape are formed. These discrete solitons are robust and flow inside the waveguide array with an unique oscillatory trajectory as exactly predicted in our theoretical calculations. We perform a rigorous analysis to unfold the propagation characteristics of the beams in both linear and nonlinear regimes in the proposed systems and validate our results with full numerical simulations. Our investigation shed light on the complex dynamics of an optical beam and its manipulation inside a geometrically engineered chirped waveguide array.</description>

      <title>Multiple-order differential imaging based on two types of topological singularity in one dimensional photonic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The differential imaging have garnered significant attention owing to its boundary detection capabilities in image processing. However, to date, there has been scant research investigating the relationship between the differential imaging effect and the topological properties of a one dimensional(1D) system. In this work, we systematically investigate the multiple-order differential imaging based on two types of topological singularity in 1D photonic crystals(PhCs). For both oblique and normal incidences , We conduct a detailed investigation of differential imaging effect. For the oblique incident cases, the first type topological singularities support first-order differential imaging in both x and y directions. Meanwhile, based on the second type topological singularities, $\partial^2 /\partial x \partial y$-type differential imaging can be achieved. For the normal incident cases, the first type topological singularities can support radial second-order and fourth-order differential imaging and the second type topological singularities can support radial fourth-order differential imaging without the need for fine tuning of the structural parameters. We further demonstrates the realization of these differential imaging effects in the deep subwavelength region by shifting the first type topological singularities into this region. This research connects the topological properties of PhCs with optical differential imaging, paving the way for the development of multiple-order differential imaging devices with improved robustness and functionality.</description>

      <title>Phase Matching Free Sensing with Undetected Light Using a Nonlinear Metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we report classical sensing with undetected light using octave spanning stimulated four-wave mixing from a plasmonic metasurface. The bidirectional nonlinear scattering due to inherent reflections from such thin nonlinear materials modifies their operation within a nonlinear interferometer. The theoretical model for visibility accounting for such bidirectionality as well as pulsed illumination accurately predicts visibility in the system as a function of transmission in the near-infrared seed (idler) arm. Spectrally resolving the visible signal emission evaluates the total dispersion within the interferometer, highlighting the prospect of ultrafast sensing with undetected photons.</description>

      <title>Polariton Chern Bands in 2D Photonic Crystals Beyond Dirac Cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polaritons, formed by strong light-matter interactions, open new avenues for studying topological phases, where the spatial and time symmetries can be controlled via the light and matter components, respectively. However, most research on topological polaritons has been confined to hexagonal photonic lattices featuring Dirac cones at large wavenumbers. This restricts key topological properties and device performance, including sub-meV gap sizes that hinder further experimental investigations and future applications of polariton Chern insulator systems. In this study, we move beyond the traditional Dirac cone framework and introduce two alternative band structures in photonic crystals (PhCs) as promising platforms for realizing polariton Chern bands: bands with symmetry-protected bound states in the continuum (BICs) and bands with symmetry-protected degeneracies at the $\Gamma$ points. These band structures are prevalent in various PhC lattices and have features crucial for experimental studies. We show examples of higher Chern number bands, more uniform Berry curvature distributions, and an experimentally feasible system capable of achieving a large topological gap. Our findings show the broad applicability of polariton Chern bands in 2D PhCs, provide design principles for enhancing the functionality and performance of topological photonic devices, opening up exciting possibilities for better understanding and using topological physics.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Control of Nonlinear Emission by Exciton-Photon Coupling in WS2 Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have demonstrated significant potential as versatile quantum materials for light absorption and emission. Their unique properties are primarily governed by exciton-photon interactions, which can be substantially enhanced through coupling with resonant photonic structures. For example, nonlinear light emission, such as second harmonic generation (SHG) is doubly enhanced when the incident wave is resonant simultaneously with the excitonic and photonic resonance. However, the excitonic absorption of incident waves can significantly dump the SHG emission. Here, we propose and demonstrate a tunable enhancement of SHG by leveraging virtual coupling effects between quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBIC) optical resonances and tunable excitons in arrays of high-index WS2 crescent metaatoms. These crescent metaatoms excites a pure magnetic type qBIC resonance, enabling dynamic control and enhancement of nonlinear optical processes in visible spectrum. Our findings demonstrate that an array of WS2 crescent metaatoms, exhibiting qBIC resonance at half the exciton energy, enhances SHG efficiency by more than 98-fold compared to monolayer WS2 (1L-WS2) and four orders of magnitude relative to unpatterned WS2 film. This substantial SHG enhancement is tunable as a function of temperature and polarization angle of incident light, allowing us to obtain control of the virtual coupling and SHG efficiency in the visible spectrum (600-650 nm). Our work opens new avenues toward next-generation reconfigurable meta-optics devices.</description>

      <title>2D material exciton-polariton transport on 2D photonic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transport of elementary excitations is a fundamental property of 2D semiconductors, important for wide-ranging emergent phenomena and device applications. While exciton transport reported in 2D materials barely exceeds 1-2 $\mu$m, coherent coupling of excitons with photons to form polaritons allows not only greatly enhanced transport length, but also the potential to leverage photonic mode engineering for novel transport properties. However, conventional vertical cavity or waveguide polaritons are difficult to tune or integrate into photonic circuits. Here, we report the transport of transition-metal dichalcogenide polaritons in slab 2D photonic crystals that are highly versatile for tuning, mode-engineering and integration. We show an order-of-magnitude enhancement of the transport length compared to that of bare excitons. We further show the dependence of transport on the polariton dispersion and population dynamics, which we control by varying the photonic crystal design and pumping intensity. Stimulated relaxation observed in the system suggests the potential for forming superfluid polaritons with frictionless transport. These results demonstrate the 2D photonic crystal polariton system as a versatile platform to enhance and manipulate energy transport for novel photonic technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surface figure of x-ray mirrors can be improved by differential deposition of thin films. To achieve the required corrections, WSi2 layers of variable thickness were deposited through beam-defining apertures of different openings. The substrates were moved in front of the particle source with specific velocity profiles that were calculated with a deconvolution algorithm. Two different DC magnetron sputter systems were used to investigate the correction process. Height errors were evaluated before and after each iteration using off-line visible light surface metrology. Four 300 mm long flat Si mirrors were used to study the impact of the initial shape errors on the performance of the correction approach. The shape errors were routinely reduced by a factor of 20-30 down to levels below 0.5 nm RMS.</description>

      <title>Unwrapping photonic reservoirs: enhanced expressivity via random Fourier encoding over stretched domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic Reservoir Computing (RC) systems leverage the complex propagation and nonlinear interaction of optical waves to perform information processing tasks. These systems employ a combination of optical data encoding (in the field amplitude and/or phase), random scattering, and nonlinear detection to generate nonlinear features that can be processed via a linear readout layer. In this work, we propose a novel scattering-assisted photonic reservoir encoding scheme where the input phase is deliberately wrapped multiple times beyond the natural period of the optical waves $[0,2\pi)$. We demonstrate that, rather than hindering nonlinear separability through loss of bijectivity, wrapping significantly improves the reservoir's prediction performance across regression and classification tasks that are unattainable within the canonical $2\pi$ period. We demonstrate that this counterintuitive effect stems from the nonlinear interference between sets of random synthetic frequencies introduced by the encoding, which generates a rich feature space spanning both the feature and sample dimensions of the data. Our results highlight the potential of engineered phase wrapping as a computational resource in RC systems based on phase encoding, paving the way for novel approaches to designing and optimizing physical computing platforms based on topological and geometric stretching.</description>

      <title>Doppler Pulse Amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to amplify ultrashort pulses has revolutionized modern laser science, driving advances in various fields such as ultrafast optics and spectroscopy. A pivotal development in this field is chirped pulse amplification (CPA), which stretches, amplifies and recompresses ultrashort optical pulses using dispersive elements to overcome amplification limits. However, CPA faces limitations due to gain narrowing, restricting the final pulse duration. Here, we propose Doppler pulse amplification (DoPA), a novel approach for amplifying ultrashort pulses. While DoPA shares similarities with CPA in that it also stretches, amplifies and recompresses pulses, it differs in how it achieves temporal compansion. Unlike CPA, DoPA exploits Doppler shifts induced by space-time modulated interfaces through a space-time wedge implementation without chirping. We show that DoPA dynamically shifts the pulse spectrum, effectively mitigating the gain narrowing issue of CPA. Additionally, we show that DoPA enables more compact amplification systems via a space-time Fresnel implementation, enabling amplification of picosecond and femtosecond pulses. This approach may pave the way for more efficient, high-intensity laser systems and expand the potential for applications in both laboratory research and practical environments.</description>

      <title>Resonant states of structured photonic time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic time crystals (PTCs) are spatially uniform media with periodic modulation in time, enabling momentum bandgaps and the parametric amplification of light. While their potential in optical systems is very promising, practical implementations require temporally modulating nanostructures of finite size, for which the physics is no longer governed by bulk properties but by resonant states, or quasinormal modes. Despite their importance, a quantitative theory describing the dynamics of these modes has been missing -- a gap we address here by developing a comprehensive resonant state theory for PTCs with arbitrary geometry. Our framework provides a detailed understanding of the resonant behavior of "structured" PTCs and uncovers several fundamental phenomena. For weak modulations, we find a universal quadratic dependence of the eigenfrequencies on the modulation amplitude. Moreover, each static resonant state gives rise to an infinite ladder of new eigenmodes, spaced by integer multiples of the modulation frequency. Crucially, we show that parametric amplification in these systems arises from a fundamentally resonant process, not captured by the momentum bandgap picture of "bulk" PTCs. We apply our theory to a realistic Bragg microcavity, demonstrating the design of tailored parametric resonances. Due to its generality and predictive power, our approach lays the foundation for the systematic study and engineering of structured PTCs, advancing the emerging field of space-time optics.</description>

Abstract: We present a two-colour fully fibre-coupled balanced optical cross-correlator (BOXC) based on sum-frequency generation (SFG) between 1560 nm and 800 nm laser pulses using waveguides implemented in type-0 phase-matched periodically poled LiNbO$_{3}$ (PPLN) crystals. The interaction has an effective nonlinear coefficient of $d_{eff}$ = 16.1 pm/V, many times higher than comparable nonlinear crystals used for this SFG interaction such as barium borate (BBO). The resulting sensitivity of the cross-correlator is measured to be 5.11 mV/fs, five times greater than current bulk-optic BOXCs after accounting for differences in transimpedance gain and photodetector responsivity, with the potential for significantly higher sensitivity after optimisations to the cross-correlator design.</description>

      <title>Inverse Microparticle Design for Enhanced Optical Trapping and Detection Efficiency in All Six Degrees of Freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving quantum-limited motional control of optically trapped particles beyond the sub-micrometer scale is an outstanding problem in levitated optomechanics. A key obstacle is solving the light scattering problem and identifying particle geometries that allow stable trapping and efficient motional detection of their center of mass and rotational motion in three dimensions. Here, we present a computational framework that combines an efficient electromagnetic scattering solver with the adjoint method to inversely design printable microparticles tailored for levitated optomechanics. Our method allows identifying optimized geometries, characterized by enhanced optical trapping and detection efficiencies compared to conventional microspheres. This improves the feasibility of quantum-limited motional control of all translational and rotational degrees of freedom in a standard standing-wave optical trap.</description>

      <title>Low Spontaneous Brillouin Scattering in Anti-Resonant Hollow-Core Fibers in GHz Frequency Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brillouin light scattering (BLS) is a powerful experimental tool that can be used to get insights into the fundamental and applied properties of matter, like dispersions of quasiparticles in a solid, as well as their spatio-temporal dynamics. Many applications of light scattering favor the use of optical fibers in place of free-space optics. In this work, we compare the performance of anti-resonant hollow core fibers to that of conventional solid core fused silica fibers for BLS experiments in the GHz frequency range. Conventional fibers are barely suitable for low-noise measurements because of the spontaneous scattering of the photons on various phononic modes present in the core and cladding. In the case of the hollow-core fiber, we identify a range of discrete phononic modes and associate them with the various acoustic modes of the structure surrounding the hollow core using finite-element numerical simulations. The measured relative intensity of the spontaneous BLS signal from these modes is orders of magnitude smaller than that of a solid-core fiber, making anti-resonant hollow-core fibers one of the best solutions for the single-mode light guidance for BLS and potentially other low-noise photonic experiments.</description>

      <title>Influence of a magnetic field on the frequency of a laser stabilized to molecular iodine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the effect of a weak magnetic field applied on an iodine cell used to frequency stabilize a laser. A 1.5$~\mu$m laser is frequency tripled in order to excite the molecular transitions at 0.51$~\mu$m and frequency locked on a hyperfine line. With this frequency reference, we report short-term stability about $3\,\times\,10^{-14}~\tau^{-1/2}$, with a minimum value of $4\,\times\,10^{-15}$ at 200~s. The lower part of $10^{-15}$ frequency stability domain is reached, in our case, only by adding an efficient magnetic shield around the sealed quartz iodine cell. In order to quantify the Zeeman effect, we applied magnetic fields of several $\,\times\,10^{-4}$~T on the cell containing the iodine vapour. The Zeeman effect affects the lineshape transition in such a way that we observe a modification of the laser frequency. We have measured this linear Zeeman shift at $(1062\pm6)\,\times\,10^{4}$~Hz/T for the $a1$ hyperfine component of the R(34)~44-0 transition, near 514~nm by applying a magnetic field along the cell. Thus, in case of uncontrolled magnetic fields of an order of magnitude of 1$\,\times\,10^{-4}$~T, the frequency stability is limited in the upper of the $10^{-14}$ domain.</description>

      <title>Manipulation of Photonic Spin Hall Effect via Interacting Rydberg Atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study demonstrating enhanced tunability of the photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) using a strongly interacting Rydberg atomic medium under electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) conditions. In contrast to conventional approaches that rely on static refractiveindex profiles or metamaterials, here the PSHE is controlled via a nonlocal third-order nonlinear susceptibility arising from long range Rydberg-Rydberg interactions. We show that this nonlocal nonlinearity enables dynamic modulation of spin-dependent light trajectories, amplifying the normally weak PSHE into a readily observable and adjustable effect. These results pave the way for new capabilities in photonic information processing and sensing. In particular, an adjustable PSHE may enable beam steering based on photon spin, improve the sensitivity of precision measurements, and support photonic devices whose functionality can be reconfigured in real time.</description>

      <title>The Bloch Equation Generator -- SimuF\'isica</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction between multilevel quantum systems and coherent radiation underlies several phenomena in modern atomic optics. The formulation and solution of the Bloch equations, which describe the dynamics of such systems, become complex as the number of levels increases. In this work, we present the Bloch Equation Generator, a free, browser-based computational tool developed to automate the generation and numerical solution of Bloch equations for systems with up to 30 levels. Users can configure the level diagram, select allowed transitions, define decay rates, and choose whether or not to apply the rotating wave approximation. The software automatically generates the complete set of equations and provides C source code for numerical solutions in both the time and frequency domains. To illustrate its applicability, we present three examples: (i) a two-level system, (ii) a $\Lambda$-type system with analysis of CPT, EIT, and the Autler-Townes effect, and (iii) a realistic 12-level system based on the Zeeman-resolved $5S_{1/2} \to 5P_{3/2}$ transition of rubidium-87.</description>

      <title>Efficient fiber coupling of telecom single-photons from circular Bragg gratings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deterministic sources of quantum light are becoming increasingly relevant in the development of quantum communication, particularly in deployed fiber networks. Therefore, efficient fiber-coupled sources at telecom wavelength are highly sought after. With this goal in mind, we systematically investigate the fiber coupling performance of quantum dots in optical resonators under three experimental configurations. We quantify coupling efficiency and sensitivity to spatial displacement for single-mode fibers with 3D printed optics on their tip, and benchmark their behavior over a commercial cleaved-cut fiber and a standard optical setup. The reduction of the required optical elements when operating with a lensed or a bare fiber allows for an increased end-to-end efficiency by a factor of up to 3.0 +/- 0.2 over a standard setup. For the perspective of realizing a mechanically stable fiber-coupled source, we precisely quantify the spatial tolerance to fiber-cavity misalignment, observing less than 50 % count rate drop for several micrometers displacement. These results will play a key role in the future development of fiber-coupled sources of quantum light.</description>

      <title>Reaching extreme fields in laser-electron beam collisions with XUV laser light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasma-based particle accelerators promise to extend the revolutionary work performed with conventional particle accelerators to studies with smaller footprints, lower costs, and higher energies. Here, we propose a new approach to access an unexplored regime of strong-field quantum electrodynamics by plasma wakefield acceleration of both charged particles and photons. Instead of using increasingly powerful accelerators and lasers, we show that photon acceleration of optical pulses into the extreme ultraviolet allows multi-GeV electrons to reach quantum nonlinearity parameters $\chi_e \gg 10$ with a high probability due to the reduced radiative losses. A significant fraction of photons produced in high-$\chi_e$ regions will propagate to detectors without generating pairs because of the reduction in the quantum rates. The photon spectra obtained may be used to characterize the predicted breakdown of strong-field quantum electrodynamics theory as it enters the fully non-perturbative regime.</description>

      <title>Electro-optic sampling of the electric-field operator for ultrabroadband pulses of Gaussian quantum light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum light pulses (QLPs) can be described by spatio-temporal modes, each of which is associated with a quantum state. In the mid-infrared spectral range, electro-optic sampling (EOS) provides a means to characterize quantum fluctuations in the electric field of such light pulses. Here, we present a protocol based on the two-port EOS technique that enables the complete characterization of multimode Gaussian quantum light, demonstrating robustness to both the shot noise and cascading effects. We validate this approach theoretically by reconstructing a multimode squeezed state of light generated in a thin nonlinear crystal driven by a single-cycle pulse. Our findings establish the two-port EOS technique as a versatile tool for characterizing ultrafast multimode quantum light, thereby broadening the reach of quantum state tomography. Potential applications include the characterization of complex quantum structures, such as correlations and entanglement in light and matter. Further, extensions to study multimode non-Gaussian QLPs can be envisaged.</description>

Abstract: We present a Machine Learning approach based on Symbolic Regression to derive, from either numerically generated or experimentally measured spectral data, closed-form expressions that model the optical properties of biological materials. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we consider three case studies with the aim of retrieving the refractive index of the materials that constitute the biological structures considered. The results obtained show that, in addition to retrieving readable and dimensionally homogeneous dispersion models, the expressions found have a physical meaning and their algebraic form is similar to that of the models used to characterize the dispersive behavior of transparent dielectrics in the visible region.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we present the implementation of all-optical method for directly measuring electron pulse duration in an ultrafast scanning electron microscope. Our approach is based on the interaction of electrons with the ponderomotive potential of an optical standing wave and provides a precise in situ technique to characterize femtosecond electron pulses at the interaction region across a wide range of electron energies (1-30 keV). By using single-photon photoemission of electrons by ultraviolet femtosecond laser pulses from a Schottky emitter we achieve electron pulse durations ranging from 0.5 ps at 30 keV to 2.7 ps at 5.5 keV under optimal conditions where Coulomb interactions are negligible. Additionally, we demonstrate that reducing the photon energy of the femtosecond pulses used for photoemission from 4.8 eV (257.5 nm) to 2.4 eV (515 nm) decreases the initial energy spread of emitted electrons, leading to significantly shorter pulse durations, particularly at lower electron energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Improving the efficiency of photothermal (PT) therapies and photoacoustic (PA) imaging at the microscopic scale hinges on developing multiphoton-absorbing photothermal molecules or contrast agents that operate in the near-infrared (NIR) range. These advanced agents or molecules will enable excitation with NIR lasers, in an improved transparency range for biological tissues, while enabling minute, highly localized spatial control of the excitation area. However, progress in this field requires innovative experimental techniques to characterize photothermal and photoacoustic effects under multiphoton excitation. In this article, we showcase a study of a model organometallic molecular compound excited via two-photon absorption (2PA) using femtosecond laser pulses. Based on a time-domain Brillouin scattering technique, well adapted for investigating ultrafast nonlinear optical absorption processes in ultrathin films on substrates, we determine the effective nonlinear absorption coefficients of the compound directly linked to PT/PA. Our findings provide a practical approach for exploring and optimizing nonlinear PT/PA absorbers and contrast agents.</description>

Abstract: The computational correction of defocus and aberrations in optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a promising approach to achieve high-resolution imaging with deep imaging depth without hardware costs. However, the techniques are not well understood due to the lack of an accurate theoretical model and investigation tools. The image formation theory of optical coherence tomography (OCT) with optical aberrations is formulated. Based on the theory, a numerical simulation method is developed and computational refocusing (CR) and aberration correction (CAC) methods are designed. The newly designed CAC method is applied to the OCT images of a microparticle phantom and in vivo human retina. The results show that the CAC method can correct the optical aberrations and improve the image quality. The theoretical model-based approach is a powerful tool for understanding the OCT imaging properties and designing new processing methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are non-Hermitian degeneracies where eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce, giving rise to unusual physical effects across scientific disciplines. The concept of EPs has recently been extended to nonlinear physical systems. We theoretically demonstrate a universal topology in the nonlinear parameter space for a large class of physical systems that support $2^\mathrm{nd}$ order EPs in the linear regime. Knowledge of this topology (called elliptic umbilic singularity in bifurcation theory) deepens our understanding of $2^\mathrm{nd}$ order linear EPs, which here emerge as coalescence of 4 nonlinear eigenvectors. This helps guide future experimental discovery of nonlinear EPs and their classification, and helps envision and optimize technological applications of nonlinear EPs. Our theoretical approach is general and can be extended to nonlinear perturbations of $3^\mathrm{rd}$ and higher-order EPs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temporal optics has attracted much attention due to its ability for lossless stretching of ultrafast temporal pulses. At the same time, spatial SU(1,1) interferometers have been widely used because of their high sensitivity to phase changes. On this basis, we studied a temporal SU(1,1) interferometer based on a temporal Fourier transform system and injected broadband squeezing light into the interferometer for research. The results show that the output spectral characteristics of the interferometer depend on the ratio of the focal group velocity dispersion (GDD) of the two temporal lenses (this ratio is defined as the scaling factor $M$) and the phase derivative of the applied phase. The scaling factor $M$ significantly affects the bandwidth and squeezing degree of the output spectrum. The phase derivative induces a frequency-shift effect, and the magnitude of the shift exhibits a linear relationship to the phase derivative. Furthermore, in the output squeezed-state spectrum, the distribution of squeezing degree concentrates at the center frequency and at positions where frequency shifts occur. As the value of scaling factor $M$ increases, the proportion of squeezing degree allocated at the center frequency correspondingly increases. This temporal SU(1,1) interferometer architecture opens new avenues for the control of non-classical fields in the time-frequency domain and quantum information processing applications.</description>

With the advancement of intelligent object detectors towards higher integration and miniaturization, their portability and adaptability to a broader range of scenarios have been significantly enhanced. However, this progress comes at the cost of reduced detection quality and narrower field-of-view, which severely impacts overall performances. Here we present a neural nanophotonic object detector based on a metalens array, capable of delivering high-quality imaging with an ultra-wide field-of-view of 135{\deg}. The combined neural network not only further improves the imaging quality, but also enables the detector to achieve high-precision target recognition and localization. Moreover, we integrated the neural nanophotonic object detector into a miniature unmanned aerial vehicle to enable wide-angle imaging and intelligent recognition of various real-world dynamic objects, demonstrating the high mobility and flexibility of our neural nanophotonic object detector. Our study presents a systematic framework for advancing revolutionary intelligent detection systems, offering significant potential for a wide range of future applications.</description>

Abstract: The mid-infrared spectral range holds great promise for applications such as molecular spectroscopy and telecommunications. Many key molecules exhibit strong absorption features in this range, and free-space optical communication benefits from reduced atmospheric attenuation and low transmission losses in specific wavelength bands spanning from 3 to 14 $\mu m$. Recent progress in MIR photonics has been fuelled by the rapid development of efficient light sources and detectors. However, further advancement is hindered by the lack of low-loss, high-performance integrated photonic platforms and modulators. Lithium niobate on sapphire is a promising candidate, operating across a broad spectral range from 0.4 $\mu m$ to 4.5 $\mu m$. We demonstrate a broadband, high-speed lithium niobate on sapphire Mach-Zehnder electro-optic modulator operating from 3.95 to 4.3 $\mu m$. The device achieves a 3 dB bandwidth exceeding 20 GHz, an extinction ratio of 34 dB, and a half-wave voltage of 22 V$\cdot$cm, delivering optical output power at the half-milliwatt level. These properties are leveraged to demonstrate data transmission at 10 Gbit/s. The modulator is also used to generate a frequency comb with a width of 80 GHz. Furthermore, we demonstrate full $\pi$-phase modulation in the MIR, representing a key milestone for integrated MIR photonics. These results establish a pathway toward high-speed, energy-efficient MIR photonic systems for applications in telecommunications, sensing, and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Gain-assisted control of the photonic spin Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the photonic spin Hall effect (SHE), also known as the transverse shift, incident light photons with opposite spins are spatially separated in the transverse direction due to the spin-orbit interaction of light. Here, we propose a gain-assisted model to control the SHE in the reflected probe light. In this model, a probe light is incident on a cavity containing a three-level dilute gaseous atomic medium, where the interaction between the atom and the control field follows two-photon Raman transitions. We show that the direction of photonic spin accumulations can be switched between positive and negative values across the Brewster angle in both the anomalous and normal dispersion regimes. For the same magnitude of control fields, the peak value of the photonic SHE is higher in the anomalous dispersion region compared to the normal dispersion regime. Additionally, the angular range around the Brewster angle is wider in the normal dispersion regime than in the anomalous dispersion region. Furthermore, the peak value of the photonic SHE and the angular range can be controlled by changing the Rabi frequencies of the control fields and the probe field detuning. The measurement of photonic SHE based on gain assistance may enable spin-related applications such as optical sensing.</description>

      <title>Symmetry induced pairing in dark excitonic condensate at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bose Einstein condensate of dark intervalley excitons must be inherently multi-component because of crystalline symmetries. Since valleys hosting such excitons are separated by large quasi-momenta, a minimal inter-component Josephson-type coupling can only be established between pairs of excitons from the time-reversed valleys. As a result, a paired condensate can emerge at finite temperature, that is, the off-diagonal order exists for the pairs from the time-reversed valleys, while the individual valleys are disordered. This prediction follows from the elementary mean field analysis regardless of the dimensionality. However, as Monte Carlo simulations show, no such a phase exists in 3D crystals. Instead, the multi-component condensation proceeds as the Ist order transition from the normal state. The paired phase does exist in 2D for the number of the components $N_v\geq 6$. It forms by Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition from the high temperature (normal) phase. The multi-component condensate appears upon further lowering of temperature.</description>

      <title>Classical-to-quantum transfer of geometric phase for non-interferometric phase measurement and manipulation of quantum state</title>

Abstract: The geometric phase, originating from the cyclic evolution of a state, such as polarization on the Poincar\'e sphere, is typically measured through interferometric approaches that often include unwanted contributions from the dynamic phase. Here, we present a non-interferometric technique based on quantum correlation of pair photons to measure the geometric phase of a classical beam. The transfer of geometric phase of the classical pump beam arising from the cyclic evolution of its polarization state on the Poincar\'e sphere onto the polarization-entangled pair photons generated via spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a Sagnac interferometer enables easy control over the quantum state. Characterization of the generated quantum states reveals that the geometric phase of the pump beam controls the coincidence counts, entanglement visibility, Bell's parameter, quantum state tomography, and fidelity in close agreement with theoretical predictions. We observe sinusoidal modulation of the Bell's parameter and state fidelity with changes in the geometric phase, resulting in transitions between orthogonal Bell states and Bell-like maximally entangled states. Our results establish the geometric phase of the classical pump as a tunable parameter for quantum state control, offering a compact, passive platform for phase manipulation in quantum photonic systems, enabling geometric phase-based quantum gates, and compensating unwanted phase acquired by the quantum state on propagation.</description>

      <title>Spin polarized enantio-sensitive multipolar photoelectron currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) manifests as a forward-backward asymmetry of electron emission in the direction orthogonal to the light polarization plane via one-photon ionization of chiral molecules with circularly polarized light. Multi-polar `PECD' currents, i.e., currents resolved along multiple directions, have also been predicted using two mutually-orthogonal linearly polarized light with carrier frequencies $\omega$ and $2\omega$. These currents arise from the interference between the one- and two-photon transitions. Here, we will show that photoelectron spin detection reveals enantio-sensitive multi-polar currents already in the one-photon regime since the two axes can be marked by the photoelectron momentum and spin-detection axis. Specifically, we consider one-photon ionization of an isotropic ensemble of randomly oriented chiral molecules via circularly polarized light and show that the resulting spin-resolved current has three components whose magnitudes are comparable and can be larger than PECD: (i) a spin-polarization vortex in the plane of light polarization that rotates in opposite directions for opposite enantiomers, (ii) either a spin-sink or source in the plane of light polarization for opposite enantiomers, and (iii) a spin analog of photoelectron vortex dichroism (\href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.129.233201}{Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{129}, 233201, 2022}) wherein the detected photoelectron spin encodes molecular chirality.</description>
