      <title>Definiteness properties of first-order schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper aims to establish a convenient formal framework for investigating the phenomenon of scheme definiteness, exemplified by first-order internal categoricity as studied by V\"a\"an\"anen, among others. To this end, we introduce the notion of $\Phi$-definiteness, thereby refining and extending the conceptual landscape that underlies various first-order categoricity notions in the literature (internal categoricity, strong internal categoricity, intolerance). We provide arguments for the robustness of our definition and present examples of schemes that separate different categoricity- and completeness-like notions. Finally, we offer a brief glimpse into the issue of the definiteness of two canonical foundational schemes - the induction scheme and the replacement scheme.</description>

      <title>Connexive logics and connexive semi-Heyting algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we define and investigate a connexive logic, called 'Connexive semi-Heyting logic' (\mathcal{CSH} for short) and a new subvariety CSH of the variety SH of semi-Heyting algebras. It is shown that the logic \mathcal{CSH} is implicative in the sense of Rasiowa, and is algebraizable with CSH as an equivalent algebraic semantics (in the sense of Blok and Pigozzi). We also introduce the logics \mathcal{AT}i and \mathcal{BT}i, i = 1, 2, along with the subvarieties ATi and BTi, i = 1, 2, of SH. It is then shown that AT1 = AT2 and CSH = BT1 \subset BT2 \subset AT1. A 3-valued connexive semi-Heyting logic \mathcal{CSH}3 and its equivalent algebraic semantics CSH3 are introduced and axiomatized; and it is then shown that CSH3 is deductively equivalent to the 3-valued intuitionistic logic. New characterizations of anti-Boolean semi-Heyting algebras are given. We show that BT2 \cap SHc = V(2), and SHc \subset AT1, where SHc is defined by x \to y = y \to x. It is proved that the identity (AT1) is equivalent to the identity x* \to y* = y* \to x* (* being the pseudocomplement) in StSH and also is equivalent to 0 \to 1 = 0 in SH. We show that AT1 \cap EX \subset BT1, where EX is defined by x \to (y \to z) = y \to (x \to z). The paper concludes with some further remarks, mentions some open problems for future research and proposes two new principles to be considered as Connexive Theses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are exactly two maximal schematic extensions of the relevant logic R with the variable sharing property. We establish that one of them has a strong form of interpolation for deducibility, thereby giving an example of a well-known relevant logic with interpolation.</description>

      <title>Cross-Sections of Divisible Abelian $o$-Groups via Tame Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that images of cross-sections of surjective morphisms $f: \Gamma \longrightarrow \Delta$ of divisible abelian $o$-groups are exactly divisible, tame (equivalently, relative Dedekind complete) and cofinal subgroups of $\Gamma$ compatible with $f$ in a suitable sense. The note concludes with an application to real closed valued fields.</description>

      <title>Contrasting the Halves of an Ahmad Pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Ahmad pairs in the $\Sigma^0_2$ enumeration degrees. $(A,B)$ is an Ahmad pair if $A \not \leq_e B$ and every $Z &lt;_e A$ satisfies $Z \leq_e B$. We characterize the degrees that are the left halves of an Ahmad pair as those that are $\lowww$ and join irreducible. We then show that the right half has to be $\highh$ giving a natural separation between the two halves which is a significant strengthening of previous work. We define a hierarchy of join irreducibility notions using which we characterize the left halves of Ahmad $n$-pairs as those that are $\lowww$ and $n$-join irreducible, while the right halves are $\highh$. This allows us to extend and clarify previous work to show that for any $n$, there is a set $A$ which is the left half of an Ahmad $n$-pair but not of an Ahmad $(n+1)$-pair. These results have new implications about the $\forall \exists$-theory of the $\Sigma^0_2$ e-degrees as a partial order and also provide a new $\Pi_3$ definition of $\lowww$ as well as $\highh$.</description>

      <title>The Equations $2^n \pm 2^m \pm 1 = x^2$ in the Arithmetic of the Even and Odd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The title equations were originally solved by making use of certain results on hypergeometric functions. Aside from these results, the classifications of the solutions uses very elementary arithmetic. The goal of this is to show that these solutions hold in a weak fragment of arithmetic; one strong enough to express the notions of even and odd that has been extended to make use of the results on hypergeometric functions.</description>

Abstract: We work with the *-product introduced in [GHK25] and f-generic types to describe the minimal ideals of invariant types and to classify ergodic Keisler measures in amenable NIP theories. Moreover, we analyze the situation around the so-called Idempotent Measure Conjecture studied in [CGK24] and [GHK25].</description>

      <title>Nested Sequents for Intuitionistic Multi-Modal Logics: Cut-Elimination and Lyndon Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study single-conclusioned nested sequent calculi for a broad class of intuitionistic multi-modal logics known as intuitionistic grammar logics (IGLs). These logics serve as the intuitionistic counterparts of classical grammar logics, and subsume standard intuitionistic modal and tense logics, including IK and IKt extended with combinations of the T, B, 4, 5, and D axioms. We analyze fundamental invertibility and admissibility properties of our calculi and introduce a novel structural rule, called the shift rule, which unifies standard structural rules arising from modal frame conditions into a single rule. This rule enables a purely syntactic proof of cut-admissibility that is uniform over all IGLs, and yields completeness of our nested calculi as a corollary. Finally, we define an interpolation algorithm that operates over single-conclusioned nested sequent proofs. This gives constructive proofs of both the Lyndon interpolation property (LIP) and Beth definability property (BDP) for all IGLs and for all intuitionistic modal and tense logics they subsume. To the best of the author's knowledge, this style of interpolation algorithm (that acts on single-conclusioned nested sequent proofs) and the resulting LIP and BDP results are new.</description>

      <title>Infinitary Logics and Abstract Elementary Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.02145v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that every abstract elementary class (a.e.c.) with LST number $\kappa$ and vocabulary $\tau$ of cardinality $\leq \kappa$ can be axiomatized in the logic ${\mathbb L}_{\beth_2(\kappa)^{+++},\kappa^+}(\tau)$. In this logic an a.e.c. is therefore an EC class rather than merely a PC class. This constitutes a major improvement on the level of definability previously given by the Presentation Theorem. As part of our proof, we define the \emph{canonical tree} $\mathcal S={\mathcal S}_{\mathcal K}$ of an a.e.c. $\mathcal K$. This turns out to be an interesting combinatorial object of the class, beyond the aim of our theorem. Furthermore, we study a connection between the sentences defining an a.e.c. and the relatively new infinitary logic $L^1_\lambda$.}</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Answering a question of Ketonen from the late 1970's, it is proved that a weakly compact cardinal carrying an indecomposable ultrafilter need not be measurable.
  The result is obtained by analyzing the limit of a decreasing sequence of models of ZFC. The utility of this proof technique is demonstrated further in this paper, where a problem by Bagaria and Magidor concerning strong compactness, and a problem by Lambie-Hanson and Rinot concerning the $C$-sequence number are solved as well.</description>

      <title>Modal Logic for Reasoning About Uncertainty and Confusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02548v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a modal logic that can formalise statements about uncertainty and beliefs such as `I think that my wallet is in the drawer rather than elsewhere' or `I am confused whether my appointment is on Monday or Tuesday'. To do that, we expand G\"odel modal logic KG with the involutive negation ~ defined as v(~A,w)=1-v(A,w). We provide semantics with the finite model property for our new logic that we call KG_inv and show its equivalence to the standard semantics over [0,1]-valued Kripke models. Namely, we show that a formula is valid in the standard semantics of KG_inv iff it is valid in the new semantics. Using this new semantics, we construct a constraint tableaux calculus for KG_inv that allows for an explicit extraction of countermodels from complete open branches and then employ the tableaux calculus to obtain the PSPACE-completeness of the validity in KG_inv.</description>

Abstract: For a given d-minimal expansion $\mathfrak R$ of the ordered real field, we consider the expansion $\mathfrak R^\natural$ of $\mathfrak R$ generated by the sets of the form $\bigcup_{S \in \mathcal C}S$, where $\mathcal C$ is a subfamily of the collection of connected components of an $\mathfrak R$-definable set. We prove that $\mathfrak R^{\natural}$ is d-minimal. A similar assertion holds for almost o-minimal expansions of ordered groups.</description>

      <title>A type-theoretic definition of lax $(\infty,\infty)$-limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a purely syntactic notion of lax cones and $(\infty,\infty)$-limits on finite computads in \texttt{CaTT}, a type theory for $(\infty,\infty)$-categories due to Finster and Mimram. Conveniently, finite computads are precisely the contexts in \texttt{CaTT}. We define a cone over a context to be a context, which is obtained by induction over the list of variables of the underlying context. In the case where the underlying context is globular we give an explicit description of the cone and conjecture that an analogous description continues to hold also for general contexts. We use the cone to control the types of the term constructors for the universal cone. The implementation of the universal property follows a similar line of ideas. Starting with a cone as a context, a set of context extension rules produce a context with the shape of a transfor between cones, i.e.~a higher morphism between cones. As in the case of cones, we use this context as a template to control the types of the term constructor required for universal property.</description>
