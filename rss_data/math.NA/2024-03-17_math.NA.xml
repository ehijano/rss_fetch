      <title>Finite element approximation for a convective Brinkman--Forchheimer problem coupled with a heat equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a convective Brinkman--Forchheimer problem coupled with a heat transfer equation. The investigated model considers thermal diffusion and viscosity depending on the temperature. We prove the existence of a solution without restriction on the data and uniqueness when the solution is slightly smoother and the data is suitably restricted. We propose a finite element discretization scheme for the considered model and derive convergence results and a priori error estimates. Finally, we illustrate the theory with numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Tensor Deli: Tensor Completion for Low CP-Rank Tensors via Random Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose two provably accurate methods for low CP-rank tensor completion - one using adaptive sampling and one using nonadaptive sampling. Both of our algorithms combine matrix completion techniques for a small number of slices along with Jennrich's algorithm to learn the factors corresponding to the first two modes, and then solve systems of linear equations to learn the factors corresponding to the remaining modes. For order-$3$ tensors, our algorithms follow a "sandwich" sampling strategy that more densely samples a few outer slices (the bread), and then more sparsely samples additional inner slices (the bbq-braised tofu) for the final completion. For an order-$d$, CP-rank $r$ tensor of size $n \times \cdots \times n$ that satisfies mild assumptions, our adaptive sampling algorithm recovers the CP-decomposition with high probability while using at most $O(nr\log r + dnr)$ samples and $O(n^2r^2+dnr^2)$ operations. Our nonadaptive sampling algorithm recovers the CP-decomposition with high probability while using at most $O(dnr^2\log n + nr\log^2 n)$ samples and runs in polynomial time. Numerical experiments demonstrate that both of our methods work well on noisy synthetic data as well as on real world data.</description>

      <title>Effective polygonal mesh generation and refinement for VEM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work we introduce a novel refinement algorithm for two-dimensional elliptic partial differential equations discretized with Virtual Element Method (VEM). The algorithm improves the numerical solution accuracy and the mesh quality through a controlled refinement strategy applied to the generic polygonal elements of the domain tessellation. The numerical results show that the outlined strategy proves to be versatile and applicable to any two-dimensional problem where polygonal meshes offer advantages. In particular, we focus on the simulation of flow in fractured media, specifically using the Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) model. A residual a-posteriori error estimator tailored for the DFN case is employed. We chose this particular application to emphasize the effectiveness of the algorithm in handling complex geometries. All the numerical tests demonstrate optimal convergence rates for all the tested VEM orders.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of Stationary Doubly Diffusive Flows on Two and Three Dimensional Bounded Lipschitz Domains: Numerical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose fully nonconforming, locally exactly divergence-free discretizations based on lowest order Crouziex-Raviart finite element and piecewise constant spaces to study the optimal control of stationary double diffusion model presented in [B\"urger, M\'endez, Ruiz-Baier, SINUM (2019), 57:1318-1343]. The well-posedness of the discrete uncontrolled state and adjoint equations are discussed using discrete lifting and fixed point arguments, and convergence results are derived rigorously under minimal regularity. Building upon our recent work [Tushar, Khan, Mohan arXiv (2023)], we prove the local optimality of a reference control using second-order sufficient optimality condition for the control problem, and use it along with an optimize-then-discretize approach to prove optimal order a priori error estimates for the control, state and adjoint variables upto the regularity of the solution. The optimal control is computed using a primal-dual active set strategy as a semi-smooth Newton method and computational tests validate the predicted error decay rates and illustrate the proposed scheme's applicability to optimal control of thermohaline circulation problems.</description>

      <title>Boundary parameter matching for isogeometric analysis using Schwarz-Christoffel mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isogeometric analysis has brought a paradigm shift in integrating computational simulations with geometric designs across engineering disciplines. This technique necessitates analysis-suitable parameterization of physical domains to fully harness the synergy between Computer-Aided Design and Computer-Aided Engineering analyses. The existing methods often fix boundary parameters, leading to challenges in elongated geometries such as fluid channels and tubular reactors. This paper presents an innovative solution for the boundary parameter matching problem, specifically designed for analysis-suitable parameterizations. We employ a sophisticated Schwarz-Christoffel mapping technique, which is instrumental in computing boundary correspondences. A refined boundary curve reparameterization process complements this. Our dual-strategy approach maintains the geometric exactness and continuity of input physical domains, overcoming limitations often encountered with the existing reparameterization techniques. By employing our proposed boundary parameter method, we show that even a simple linear interpolation approach can effectively construct a satisfactory analysis-suitable parameterization. Our methodology offers significant improvements over traditional practices, enabling the generation of analysis-suitable and geometrically precise models, which is crucial for ensuring accurate simulation results. Numerical experiments show the capacity of the proposed method to enhance the quality and reliability of isogeometric analysis workflows.</description>

      <title>Supplement Matrix and a Practical Method for Computing Eigenvalues of a Dual Hermitian Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study dual number symmetric matrices, dual complex Hermitian matrices and dual quaternion Hermitian matrices in a unified frame of dual Hermitian matrices. Suppose we have a ring, which can be the real field, the complex field, or the quaternion ring. Then an $n \times n$ dual Hermitian matrix has $n$ dual number eigenvalues.
  We define supplement matrices for a dual Hermitian matrix. Supplement matrices are Hermitian matrices in the original ring. The standard parts of the eigenvalues of that dual Hermitian matrix are the eigenvalues of the standard part Hermitian matrix in the original ring, while the dual parts of the eigenvalues of that dual Hermitian matrix are the eigenvalues of those {supplement} matrices. Hence, by apply any practical method for computing eigenvalues of Hermitian matrices in the original ring, we have a practical method for computing eigenvalues of a dual Hermitian matrix. We call this method the supplement matrix method.
  Applications to low rank approximation and generalized inverses of dual matrices, dual least squares problem and formation control are discussed.
  Numerical experiments are reported.</description>

      <title>Resolving Full-Wave Through-Wall Transmission Effects in Multi-Static Synthetic Aperture Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through-wall synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging is of significant interest for security purposes, in particular when using multi-static SAR systems consisting of multiple distributed radar transmitters and receivers to improve resolution and the ability to recognise objects. Yet there is a significant challenge in forming focused, useful images due to multiple scattering effects through walls, whereas standard SAR imaging has an inherent single scattering assumption. This may be exacerbated with multi-static collections, since different scattering events will be observed from each angle and the data may not coherently combine well in a naive manner. To overcome this, we propose an image formation method which resolves full-wave effects through an approximately known wall or other arbitrary obstacle, which itself has some unknown "nuisance" parameters that are determined as part of the reconstruction to provide well focused images. The method is more flexible and realistic than existing methods which treat a single wall as a flat layered medium, whilst being significantly computationally cheaper than full-wave methods, strongly motivated by practical considerations for through-wall SAR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new framework of Hessian-free force-gradient integrators that do not require the analytical expression of the force-gradient term based on the Hessian of the potential. Due to that the new class of decomposition algorithms for separable Hamiltonian systems with quadratic kinetic energy may be particularly useful when applied to Hamiltonian systems where an evaluation of the Hessian is significantly more expensive than an evaluation of its gradient, e.g. in molecular dynamics simulations of classical systems. Numerical experiments of an N-body problem, as well as applications to the molecular dynamics step in the Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm for lattice simulations of the Schwinger model and Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) verify these expectations.</description>

      <title>Existence and uniqueness for the solutions of non-autonomous stochastic differential algebraic equations with locally Lipschitz coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the well-posedness and regularity of non-autonomous stochastic differential algebraic equations (SDAEs) with nonlinear, locally Lipschitz and monotone (2) coefficients of the form (1). The main difficulty is the fact that the operator A(.) is non-autonomous, i.~e. depends on t and the matrix $A(t)$ is singular for all $t\in \left[0,T\right]$. Our interest is in SDAE of index-1. This means that in order to solve the problem, we can transform the initial SDAEs into an ordinary stochastic differential equation with algebraic constraints. Under appropriate hypothesizes, the main result establishes the existence and uniqueness of the solution in $\mathcal{M}^p(\left[0, T\right], \mathbb{R}^n)$, $p\geq 2$, $p\in \mathbb{N}$. Several strong estimations and regularity results are also provided. Note that, in this paper, we use various techniques such as It\^o's lemma, Burkholder-Davis-Gundy inequality, and Young inequality.</description>

      <title>Overcoming the cohesive zone limit in the modelling of composites delamination with TUBA cohesive elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The wide adoption of composite structures in the aerospace industry requires reliable numerical methods to account for the effects of various damage mechanisms, including delamination. Cohesive elements are a versatile and physically representative way of modelling delamination. However, using their standard form which conforms to solid substrate elements, multiple elements are required in the narrow cohesive zone, thereby requiring an excessively fine mesh and hindering the applicability in practical scenarios. The present work focuses on the implementation and testing of triangular thin plate substrate elements and compatible cohesive elements, which satisfy C1-continuity in the domain. The improved regularity meets the continuity requirement coming from the Kirchhoff Plate Theory and the triangular shape allows for conformity to complex geometries. The overall model is validated for mode I delamination, the case with the smallest cohesive zone. Very accurate predictions of the limit load and crack propagation phase are achieved, using elements as large as 11 times the cohesive zone.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve constrained optimal transport problems between the laws of solutions of stochastic differential equations (SDEs). We consider SDEs with irregular coefficients, making only minimal regularity assumptions. We show that the so-called synchronous coupling is optimal among bicausal couplings, that is couplings that respect the flow of information encoded in the stochastic processes. Our results provide a method to numerically compute the adapted Wasserstein distance between laws of SDEs with irregular coefficients. Moreover, we introduce a transformation-based semi-implicit numerical scheme and establish the first strong convergence result for SDEs with exponentially growing and discontinuous drift.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuits for partial differential equations via Schr\"odingerisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing has emerged as a promising avenue for achieving significant speedup, particularly in large-scale PDE simulations, compared to classical computing. One of the main quantum approaches involves utilizing Hamiltonian simulation, which is directly applicable only to Schr\"odinger-type equations. To address this limitation, Schr\"odingerisation techniques have been developed, employing the warped transformation to convert general linear PDEs into Schr\"odinger-type equations. However, despite the development of Schr\"odingerisation techniques, the explicit implementation of the corresponding quantum circuit for solving general PDEs remains to be designed. In this paper, we present detailed implementation of a quantum algorithm for general PDEs using Schr\"odingerisation techniques. We provide examples of the heat equation, and the advection equation approximated by the upwind scheme, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Complexity analysis is also carried out to demonstrate the quantum advantages of these algorithms in high dimensions over their classical counterparts.</description>

      <title>Structural Preprocessing Method for Nonlinear Differential-Algebraic Equations Using Linear Symbolic Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) have been used in modeling various dynamical systems in science and engineering. Several preprocessing methods for DAEs, such as consistent initialization and index reduction, use structural information on DAEs. Unfortunately, these methods may fail when the system Jacobian, which is a functional matrix, derived from the DAE is singular.
  To transform a DAE with a singular system Jacobian into a nonsingular system, several regularization methods have been proposed. Most of all existing regularization methods rely on symbolic computation to eliminate the system Jacobian for finding a certificate of singularity, resulting in much computational time. Iwata--Oki--Takamatsu (2019) proposed a method (IOT-method) to find a certificate without symbolic computations. The IOT method approximates the system Jacobian by a simpler symbolic matrix, called a layered mixed matrix, which admits a fast combinatorial algorithm for singularity testing. However, it often overlooks the singularity of the system Jacobian since the approximation largely discards algebraic relationships among entries in the original system Jacobian.
  In this study, we propose a new regularization method extending the idea of the IOT method. Instead of layered mixed matrices, our method approximates the system Jacobian by more expressive symbolic matrices, called rank-1 coefficient mixed (1CM) matrices. This makes our method more widely applicable. We give a fast combinatorial algorithm for finding a singularity certificate of 1CM-matrices, which is free from symbolic elimination. Our method is also advantageous in that it globally preserves the solution set to the DAE. Through numerical experiments, we confirmed that our method runs fast for large-scale DAEs from real instances.</description>

      <title>Model free collision aggregation for the computation of escape distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a heat radiative transport equation, we consider a particle undergoing collisions in a space-time domain and propose a method to sample its escape time, space and direction from the domain. The first step of the procedure is an estimation of how many elementary collisions is safe to take before chances of exiting the domain are too high; then these collisions are aggregated into a single movement. The method does not use any model nor any particular regime of parameters. We give theoretical results both under the normal approximation and without it and test the method on some benchmarks from the literature. The results confirm the theoretical predictions and show that the proposal is an efficient method to sample the escape distribution of the particle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2010.07282v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The monotonicity of discrete Laplacian, i.e., inverse positivity of stiffness matrix, implies discrete maximum principle, which is in general not true for high order accurate schemes on unstructured meshes. On the other hand, it is possible to construct high order accurate monotone schemes on structured meshes. All previously known high order accurate inverse positive schemes are fourth order accurate schemes, which is either an M-matrix or a product of two M-matrices. For the $Q^3$ spectral element method for the two-dimensional Laplacian, we prove its stiffness matrix is a product of four M-matrices thus it is monotone. Such a scheme can be regarded as a fifth order accurate finite difference scheme.</description>

      <title>Locally supported, quasi-interpolatory bases for the approximation of functions on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.02256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.02256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph-based approximation methods are of growing interest in many areas, including transportation, biological and chemical networks, financial models, image processing, network flows, and more. In these applications, often a basis for the approximation space is not available analytically and must be computed. We propose perturbations of Lagrange bases on graphs, where the Lagrange functions come from a class of functions analogous to classical splines. The basis functions we consider have local support, with each basis function obtained by solving a small energy minimization problem related to a differential operator on the graph. We present $\ell_\infty$ error estimates between the local basis and the corresponding interpolatory Lagrange basis functions in cases where the underlying graph satisfies a mild assumption on the connections of vertices where the function is not known, and the theoretical bounds are examined further in numerical experiments. Included in our analysis is a mixed-norm inequality for positive definite matrices that is tighter than the general estimate $\|A\|_{\infty} \leq \sqrt{n} \|A\|_{2}$.</description>

Abstract: Solutions to differential equations, which are used to model physical systems, are computed numerically by solving a set of discretized equations. This set of discretized equations is reduced to a large linear system, whose solution is typically found using an iterative solver. We start with an initial guess, $x_0$, and iterate the algorithm to obtain a sequence of solution vectors, $x_k$, which are approximations to the exact solution of the linear system, $x$. The iterative algorithm is said to converge to $x$, in the field of reals, if and only if $x_k$ converges to $x$ in the limit of $k \to \infty$.
  In this paper, we formally prove the asymptotic convergence of a particular class of iterative methods called the stationary iterative methods, in the Coq theorem prover. We formalize the necessary and sufficient conditions required for the iterative convergence, and extend this result to two classical iterative methods: the Gauss--Seidel method and the Jacobi method. For the Gauss--Seidel method, we also formalize a set of easily testable conditions for iterative convergence, called the Reich theorem, for a particular matrix structure, and apply this on a model problem of the one-dimensional heat equation. We also apply the main theorem of iterative convergence to prove convergence of the Jacobi method on the model problem.</description>

      <title>Energy-Conserving Neural Network for Turbulence Closure Modeling</title>

Abstract: In turbulence modeling, we are concerned with finding closure models that represent the effect of the subgrid scales on the resolved scales. Recent approaches gravitate towards machine learning techniques to construct such models. However, the stability of machine-learned closure models and their abidance by physical structure (e.g. symmetries, conservation laws) are still open problems. To tackle both issues, we take the `discretize first, filter next' approach. In this approach we apply a spatial averaging filter to existing fine-grid discretizations. The main novelty is that we introduce an additional set of equations which dynamically model the energy of the subgrid scales. Having an estimate of the energy of the subgrid scales, we can use the concept of energy conservation to derive stability. The subgrid energy containing variables are determined via a data-driven technique. The closure model is used to model the interaction between the filtered quantities and the subgrid energy. Therefore the total energy should be conserved. Abiding by this conservation law yields guaranteed stability of the system. In this work, we propose a novel skew-symmetric convolutional neural network architecture that satisfies this law. The result is that stability is guaranteed, independent of the weights and biases of the network. Importantly, as our framework allows for energy exchange between resolved and subgrid scales it can model backscatter. To model dissipative systems (e.g. viscous flows), the framework is extended with a diffusive component. The introduced neural network architecture is constructed such that it also satisfies momentum conservation. We apply the new methodology to both the viscous Burgers' equation and the Korteweg-De Vries equation in 1D. The novel architecture displays superior stability properties when compared to a vanilla convolutional neural network.</description>

      <title>A New Div-Div-Conforming Symmetric Tensor Finite Element Space with Applications to the Biharmonic Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11356v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new $H(\textrm{divdiv})$-conforming finite element is presented, which avoids the need for super-smoothness by redistributing the degrees of freedom to edges and faces. This leads to a hybridizable mixed method with superconvergence for the biharmonic equation. Moreover, new finite element divdiv complexes are established. Finally, new weak Galerkin and $C^0$ discontinuous Galerkin methods for the biharmonic equation are derived.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Neural Networks for Indirect Measurements</title>

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning techniques have shown great success in various tasks related to inverse problems, where a target quantity of interest can only be observed through indirect measurements by a forward operator. Common approaches apply deep neural networks in a post-processing step to the reconstructions obtained by classical reconstruction methods. However, the latter methods can be computationally expensive and introduce artifacts that are not present in the measured data and, in turn, can deteriorate the performance on the given task. To overcome these limitations, we propose a class of equivariant neural networks that can be directly applied to the measurements to solve the desired task. To this end, we build appropriate network structures by developing layers that are equivariant with respect to data transformations induced by well-known symmetries in the domain of the forward operator. We rigorously analyze the relation between the measurement operator and the resulting group representations and prove a representer theorem that characterizes the class of linear operators that translate between a given pair of group actions. Based on this theory, we extend the existing concepts of Lie group equivariant deep learning to inverse problems and introduce new representations that result from the involved measurement operations. This allows us to efficiently solve classification, regression or even reconstruction tasks based on indirect measurements also for very sparse data problems, where a classical reconstruction-based approach may be hard or even impossible. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach in numerical experiments and compare with existing methods.</description>

      <title>A unified framework for multiscale spectral generalized FEMs and low-rank approximations to multiscale PDEs</title>

Abstract: This work presents an abstract framework for the design, implementation, and analysis of the multiscale spectral generalized finite element method (MS-GFEM), a particular numerical multiscale method originally proposed in [I. Babuska and R. Lipton, Multiscale Model.\;\,Simul., 9 (2011), pp.~373--406]. MS-GFEM is a partition of unity method employing optimal local approximation spaces constructed from local spectral problems. We establish a general local approximation theory demonstrating exponential convergence with respect to local degrees of freedom under certain assumptions, with explicit dependence on key problem parameters. Our framework applies to a broad class of multiscale PDEs with $L^{\infty}$-coefficients in both continuous and discrete, finite element settings, including highly indefinite problems (convection-dominated diffusion, as well as the high-frequency Helmholtz, Maxwell and elastic wave equations with impedance boundary conditions), and higher-order problems. Notably, we prove a local convergence rate of $O(e^{-cn^{1/d}})$ for MS-GFEM for all these problems, improving upon the $O(e^{-cn^{1/(d+1)}})$ rate shown by Babuska and Lipton.
  Moreover, based on the abstract local approximation theory for MS-GFEM, we establish a unified framework for showing low-rank approximations to multiscale PDEs. This framework applies to the aforementioned problems, proving that the associated Green's functions admit an $O(|\log\epsilon|^{d})$-term separable approximation on well-separated domains with error $\epsilon&gt;0$. Our analysis improves and generalizes the result in [M. Bebendorf and W. Hackbusch, Numerische Mathematik, 95 (2003), pp.~1-28] where an $O(|\log\epsilon|^{d+1})$-term separable approximation was proved for Poisson-type problems.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Adaptive Sampling: Unify PINN and Optimal Transport for the Approximation of PDEs</title>

Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) is a central task in scientific computing. Recently, neural network approximation of PDEs has received increasing attention due to its flexible meshless discretization and its potential for high-dimensional problems. One fundamental numerical difficulty is that random samples in the training set introduce statistical errors into the discretization of loss functional which may become the dominant error in the final approximation, and therefore overshadow the modeling capability of the neural network. In this work, we propose a new minmax formulation to optimize simultaneously the approximate solution, given by a neural network model, and the random samples in the training set, provided by a deep generative model. The key idea is to use a deep generative model to adjust random samples in the training set such that the residual induced by the approximate PDE solution can maintain a smooth profile when it is being minimized. Such an idea is achieved by implicitly embedding the Wasserstein distance between the residual-induced distribution and the uniform distribution into the loss, which is then minimized together with the residual. A nearly uniform residual profile means that its variance is small for any normalized weight function such that the Monte Carlo approximation error of the loss functional is reduced significantly for a certain sample size. The adversarial adaptive sampling (AAS) approach proposed in this work is the first attempt to formulate two essential components, minimizing the residual and seeking the optimal training set, into one minmax objective functional for the neural network approximation of PDEs.</description>

      <title>Deep Regularized Compound Gaussian Network for Solving Linear Inverse Problems</title>

Abstract: Incorporating prior information into inverse problems, e.g. via maximum-a-posteriori estimation, is an important technique for facilitating robust inverse problem solutions. In this paper, we devise two novel approaches for linear inverse problems that permit problem-specific statistical prior selections within the compound Gaussian (CG) class of distributions. The CG class subsumes many commonly used priors in signal and image reconstruction methods including those of sparsity-based approaches. The first method developed is an iterative algorithm, called generalized compound Gaussian least squares (G-CG-LS), that minimizes a regularized least squares objective function where the regularization enforces a CG prior. G-CG-LS is then unrolled, or unfolded, to furnish our second method, which is a novel deep regularized (DR) neural network, called DR-CG-Net, that learns the prior information. A detailed computational theory on convergence properties of G-CG-LS and thorough numerical experiments for DR-CG-Net are provided. Due to the comprehensive nature of the CG prior, these experiments show that DR-CG-Net outperforms competitive prior art methods in tomographic imaging and compressive sensing, especially in challenging low-training scenarios.</description>

      <title>Learning Semilinear Neural Operators : A Unified Recursive Framework For Prediction And Data Assimilation</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in the theory of Neural Operators (NOs) have enabled fast and accurate computation of the solutions to complex systems described by partial differential equations (PDEs). Despite their great success, current NO-based solutions face important challenges when dealing with spatio-temporal PDEs over long time scales. Specifically, the current theory of NOs does not present a systematic framework to perform data assimilation and efficiently correct the evolution of PDE solutions over time based on sparsely sampled noisy measurements. In this paper, we propose a learning-based state-space approach to compute the solution operators to infinite-dimensional semilinear PDEs. Exploiting the structure of semilinear PDEs and the theory of nonlinear observers in function spaces, we develop a flexible recursive method that allows for both prediction and data assimilation by combining prediction and correction operations. The proposed framework is capable of producing fast and accurate predictions over long time horizons, dealing with irregularly sampled noisy measurements to correct the solution, and benefits from the decoupling between the spatial and temporal dynamics of this class of PDEs. We show through experiments on the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky, Navier-Stokes and Korteweg-de Vries equations that the proposed model is robust to noise and can leverage arbitrary amounts of measurements to correct its prediction over a long time horizon with little computational overhead.</description>
