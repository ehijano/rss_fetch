      <title>Well-to-Tank Carbon Intensity Variability of Fossil Marine Fuels: A Country-Level Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition toward a low-carbon maritime transportation requires understanding lifecycle carbon intensity (CI) of marine fuels. While well-to-tank emissions significantly contribute to total greenhouse gas emissions, many studies lack global perspective in accounting for upstream operations, transportation, refining, and distribution. This study evaluates well-to-tank CI of High Sulphur Fuel Oil (HSFO) and well-to-refinery exit CI of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) worldwide at asset level. HSFO represents traditional marine fuel, while LPG serves as potential transition fuel due to lower tank-to-wake emissions and compatibility with low-carbon fuels. Using OPGEE and PRELIM tools with R-based geospatial methods, we derive country-level CI values for 72 countries (HSFO) and 74 countries (LPG), covering 98% of global production. Results show significant variation in climate impacts globally. HSFO upstream CI ranges 1-22.7 gCO2e/MJ, refining CI 1.2-12.6 gCO2e/MJ, with global volume-weighted-average well-to-tank CI of 12.4 gCO2e/MJ. Upstream and refining account for 55% and 32% of HSFO well-to-tank CI, with large exporters and intensive refining practices showing higher emissions. For LPG, upstream CI ranges 0.9-22.7 gCO2e/MJ, refining CI 2.8-13.9 gCO2e/MJ, with volume-weighted-average well-to-refinery CI of 15.6 gCO2e/MJ. Refining comprises 49% of LPG well-to-refinery CI, while upstream and transport represent 44% and 6%. Major players include China, United States and Russia. These findings reveal significant CI variability across countries and supply chains, offering opportunities for targeted emission reduction policies.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-LAM: Probabilistic Limited Area Weather Forecasting with Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning methods have been shown to be effective for weather forecasting, based on the speed and accuracy compared to traditional numerical models. While early efforts primarily concentrated on deterministic predictions, the field has increasingly shifted toward probabilistic forecasting to better capture the forecast uncertainty. Most machine learning-based models have been designed for global-scale predictions, with only limited work targeting regional or limited area forecasting, which allows more specialized and flexible modeling for specific locations. This work introduces Diffusion-LAM, a probabilistic limited area weather model leveraging conditional diffusion. By conditioning on boundary data from surrounding regions, our approach generates forecasts within a defined area. Experimental results on the MEPS limited area dataset demonstrate the potential of Diffusion-LAM to deliver accurate probabilistic forecasts, highlighting its promise for limited-area weather prediction.</description>

      <title>Regional Weather Variable Predictions by Machine Learning with Near-Surface Observational and Atmospheric Numerical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate and timely regional weather prediction is vital for sectors dependent on weather-related decisions. Traditional prediction methods, based on atmospheric equations, often struggle with coarse temporal resolutions and inaccuracies. This paper presents a novel machine learning (ML) model, called MiMa (short for Micro-Macro), that integrates both near-surface observational data from Kentucky Mesonet stations (collected every five minutes, known as Micro data) and hourly atmospheric numerical outputs (termed as Macro data) for fine-resolution weather forecasting. The MiMa model employs an encoder-decoder transformer structure, with two encoders for processing multivariate data from both datasets and a decoder for forecasting weather variables over short time horizons. Each instance of the MiMa model, called a modelet, predicts the values of a specific weather parameter at an individual Mesonet station. The approach is extended with Re-MiMa modelets, which are designed to predict weather variables at ungauged locations by training on multivariate data from a few representative stations in a region, tagged with their elevations. Re-MiMa (short for Regional-MiMa) can provide highly accurate predictions across an entire region, even in areas without observational stations. Experimental results show that MiMa significantly outperforms current models, with Re-MiMa offering precise short-term forecasts for ungauged locations, marking a significant advancement in weather forecasting accuracy and applicability.</description>

      <title>Data Assimilation with Machine Learning Surrogate Models: A Case Study with FourCastNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern data-driven surrogate models for weather forecasting provide accurate short-term predictions but inaccurate and nonphysical long-term forecasts. This paper investigates online weather prediction using machine learning surrogates supplemented with partial and noisy observations. We empirically demonstrate and theoretically justify that, despite the long-time instability of the surrogates and the sparsity of the observations, filtering estimates can remain accurate in the long-time horizon. As a case study, we integrate FourCastNet, a weather surrogate model, within a variational data assimilation framework using partial, noisy ERA5 data. Our results show that filtering estimates remain accurate over a year-long assimilation window and provide effective initial conditions for forecasting tasks, including extreme event prediction.</description>

      <title>Ensemble quantile-based deep learning framework for streamflow and flood prediction in Australian catchments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, climate extremes such as floods have created significant environmental and economic hazards for Australia. Deep learning methods have been promising for predicting extreme climate events; however, large flooding events present a critical challenge due to factors such as model calibration and missing data. We present an ensemble quantile-based deep learning framework that addresses large-scale streamflow forecasts using quantile regression for uncertainty projections in prediction. We evaluate selected univariate and multivariate deep learning models and catchment strategies. Furthermore, we implement a multistep time-series prediction model using the CAMELS dataset for selected catchments across Australia. The ensemble model employs a set of quantile deep learning models for streamflow determined by historical streamflow data. We utilise the streamflow prediction and obtain flood probability using flood frequency analysis and compare it with historical flooding events for selected catchments. Our results demonstrate notable efficacy and uncertainties in streamflow forecasts with varied catchment properties. Our flood probability estimates show good accuracy in capturing the historical floods from the selected catchments. This underscores the potential for our deep learning framework to revolutionise flood forecasting across diverse regions and be implemented as an early warning system.</description>
