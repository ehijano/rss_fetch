      <title>Procedural Mixture Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper characterizes the Shannon (1948) and Tsallis (1988) entropies in a standard framework of decision theory, mixture sets. Procedural mixture sets are introduced as a variant of mixture sets in which it is not necessarily true that a mixture of two identical elements yields the same element. This allows the process of mixing itself to have an intrinsic value. The paper proves the surprising result that simply imposing the standard axioms of von Neumann-Morgenstern on preferences on a procedural mixture set yields the entropy as a representation of procedural value. An application of the theorem to decision processes and the relation between choice probabilities and decision times elucidates the difficulty of extending the drift-diffusion model to multi-alternative choice.</description>

      <title>Anonymous voting in a heterogeneous society</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the design of voting mechanisms in a binary social choice environment where agents' cardinal valuations are independent but not necessarily identically distributed. The mechanism must be anonymous -- the outcome is invariant to permutations of the reported values. We show that if there are two agents then expected welfare is always maximized by an ordinal majority rule, but with three or more agents there are environments in which cardinal mechanisms that take into account preference intensities outperform any ordinal mechanism.</description>

      <title>Maximizing Social Welfare with Side Payments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine normal-form games in which players may \emph{pre-commit} to outcome-contingent transfers before choosing their actions. In the one-shot version of this model, Jackson and Wilkie showed that side contracting can backfire: even a game with a Pareto-optimal Nash equilibrium can devolve into inefficient equilibria once unbounded, simultaneous commitments are allowed. The root cause is a prisoner's dilemma effect, where each player can exploit her commitment power to reshape the equilibrium in her favor, harming overall welfare.
  To circumvent this problem we introduce a \emph{staged-commitment} protocol. Players may pledge transfers only in small, capped increments over multiple rounds, and the phase continues only with unanimous consent. We prove that, starting from any finite game $\Gamma$ with a non-degenerate Nash equilibrium $\vec{\sigma}$, this protocol implements every welfare-maximizing payoff profile that \emph{strictly} Pareto-improves $\vec{\sigma}$. Thus, gradual and bounded commitments restore the full efficiency potential of side payments while avoiding the inefficiencies identified by Jackson and Wilkie.</description>

      <title>Persuasion in Networks: Can the Sender Do Better than Using Public Signals?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18965v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Political and advertising campaigns increasingly exploit social networks to spread information and persuade people. This paper studies a persuasion model to examine whether such a strategy is better than simply sending public signals. Receivers in the model have heterogeneous priors and will pass on a signal if they are persuaded by it to take sender's preferred action. I show that a risk-neutral or risk-loving sender prefers to use public signals, unless the more sceptical receivers are sufficiently more connected in the network. This result still holds when the network exhibits homophily. When the sender is risk averse or has a threshold function as payoff function, I characterise conditions under which the sender prefers to exploit the network. An important factor identified by these conditions is whether the less sceptical receivers are sufficiently connected.</description>

      <title>Matching Design with Algorithms and Applications to Foster Care</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12860v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of an organization that matches agents to objects where agents have preference rankings over objects and the organization uses algorithms to construct a ranking over objects on behalf of each agent. Our new framework carries the interpretation that the organization and its agents may be misaligned in pursuing some underlying matching goal. We design matching mechanisms that integrate agent decision-making and the algorithm by prioritizing matches that are unanimously agreeable between the two parties. Our mechanisms also satisfy restricted efficiency properties. Subsequently, we prove that no unanimous mechanism is strategy-proof but that ours can be non-obviously manipulable. We generalize our framework to allow for any preference aggregation rules and extend the famed Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem to our setting. We apply our framework to place foster children in foster homes to maximize welfare. Using a machine learning model that predicts child welfare in placements and a novel "elicited preferences" experiment that extracts real caseworkers' preferences, we empirically demonstrate that there are important match-specific welfare gains that our mechanisms extract that are not realized under the status quo.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transfer Mechanism for Municipal Soft-Budget Constraints in Newfoundland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02171v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Newfoundland and Labrador's municipalities face severe soft budget pressures due to narrow tax bases, high fixed service costs, and volatile resource revenues. We develop a Stackelberg style mechanism design model in which the province commits at t = 0 to an ex ante grant schedule and an ex post bailout rule. Municipalities privately observe their fiscal need type, choose effort, investment, and debt, and may receive bailouts when deficits exceed a statutory threshold. Under convexity and single crossing, the problem reduces to one dimensional screening and admits a tractable transfer mechanism with quadratic bailout costs and a statutory cap. The optimal ex ante rule is threshold-cap; under discretionary rescue at t = 2, it becomes threshold-linear-cap. A knife-edge inequality yields a self-consistent no bailout regime, and an explicit discount factor threshold renders hard budgets dynamically credible. We emphasize a class of monotone threshold signal rules; under this class, grant crowd out is null almost everywhere, which justifies the constant grant weight used in closed form expressions. The closed form characterization provides a policy template that maps to Newfoundland's institutions and clarifies the micro-data required for future calibration.</description>

      <title>A Frame for Communication Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are experiencing the rise of ChatGPT-like systems or LLMs in political turbulent times. We assume the need to regulate their use because of their bubble-shaping and polarizing potential. To regulate, we need a language that allows interests and compromises to be discussed. In this context, we can think of such a shared language as a jargon, a specialized vocabulary for law-making. To the extent that such a jargon exists, it is now being corrupted by LLMs. This situation appears paradoxical. The issue includes persistent communication failures, between disciplines that cannot translate their technical vocabulary into accessible terms, and between political movements that operate in incompatible worldviews. We show that a frame integrating four specialist languages, those of governance, economy, community and science, is able to address these failures case-wise, which we consider helpful. However, for reasons noted, we cannot create the more generic jargon needed on our own. We conclude that our frame provides the knowledge to design and apply RAG-LLM architectures for researching their jargon generating potential in a future project. We show its feasibility in the appendix.</description>

      <title>Inequality in the Age of Pseudonymity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04668v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inequality measures such as the Gini coefficient are used to inform and motivate policymaking, and are increasingly applied to digital platforms. We analyze how measures fare in pseudonymous settings that are common in the digital age. One key challenge of such environments is the ability of actors to create fake identities under fictitious false names, also known as ``Sybils.'' While some actors may do so to preserve their privacy, we show that this can inadvertently hamper inequality measurements. As we prove, it is impossible for measures satisfying the literature's canonical set of desired properties to assess the inequality of an economy that may harbor Sybils. We characterize the class of all Sybil-proof measures, and prove that they must satisfy relaxed version of the aforementioned properties. Furthermore, we show that the structure imposed restricts the ability to assess inequality at a fine-grained level. By applying our results, we prove that large classes of popular measures are not Sybil-proof, with the famous Gini coefficient being but one example out of many. Finally, we examine the dynamics leading to the creation of Sybils in digital and traditional settings.</description>
