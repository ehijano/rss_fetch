      <title>A General Framework for Gradient-Based Optimization of Superconducting Quantum Circuits using Qubit Discovery as a Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Engineering the Hamiltonian of a quantum system is fundamental to the design of quantum systems. Automating Hamiltonian design through gradient-based optimization can dramatically accelerate this process. However, computing the gradients of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a Hamiltonian--a large, sparse matrix--relative to system properties poses a significant challenge, especially for arbitrary systems. Superconducting quantum circuits offer substantial flexibility in Hamiltonian design, making them an ideal platform for this task. In this work, we present a comprehensive framework for the gradient-based optimization of superconducting quantum circuits, leveraging the SQcircuit software package. By addressing the challenge of calculating the gradient of the eigensystem for large, sparse Hamiltonians and integrating automatic differentiation within SQcircuit, our framework enables efficient and precise computation of gradients for various circuit properties or custom-defined metrics, streamlining the optimization process. We apply this framework to the qubit discovery problem, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying qubit designs with superior performance metrics. The optimized circuits show improvements in a heuristic measure of gate count, upper bounds on gate speed, decoherence time, and resilience to noise and fabrication errors compared to existing qubits. While this methodology is showcased through qubit optimization and discovery, it is versatile and can be extended to tackle other optimization challenges in superconducting quantum hardware design.</description>

      <title>Anti-correlation between excitations and locally-favored structures in glass-forming systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamics that are microscopic in space and time, so-called excitations, are considered the elementary unit of relaxation in the Dynamic Facilitation (DF) theory of the glass transition. Meanwhile, geometric motifs known as locally favored structures (LFS) are associated with vitrification in many glassformers. Recent work indicates that the probability of particles both found in locally favored structures (LFS) and excitations decreases significantly upon supercooling suggesting that there is an anti-correlation between them. [Ortlieb et al, Nature Commun. 14, 2621 (2023)]. However, the spatial relationship between excitations and LFS remains unclear. By employing state-of-the-art GPU computer simulations and colloid experiments, we analyze this relationship between LFS and excitations in model glassformers. We demonstrate that there is a spatial separation between the two in deeply supercooled liquids. This may be due to the fact that LFS are well-packed, thus they are solid and stable.</description>

      <title>Attractive-repulsive interaction in coupled quantum oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the emergent dynamics of quantum self-sustained oscillators induced by the simultaneous presence of attraction and repulsion in the coupling path. We consider quantum Stuart-Landau oscillators under attractive-repulsive coupling and construct the corresponding quantum master equation in the Lindblad form. We discover an interesting symmetry-breaking transition from quantum limit cycle oscillation to quantum inhomogeneous steady state; This transition is contrary to the previously known symmetry-breaking transition from quantum homogeneous to inhomogeneous steady state. The result is supported by the analysis on the noisy classical model of the quantum system in the weak quantum regime. Remarkably, we find the generation of entanglement associated with the symmetry-breaking transition that has no analogue in the classical domain. This study will enrich our understanding of the collective behaviors shown by coupled oscillators in the quantum domain.</description>

      <title>Energy-efficient field-free unconventional spin-orbit torque magnetization switching dynamics in van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure of emerging two-dimensional (2D) quantum materials, with control over their quantum geometries, crystal symmetries, spin-orbit coupling, and magnetic anisotropies, provides a new platform for generating unconventional nonlinear Hall effects, spin polarization and efficiently controlling the magnetization dynamics for non-volatile spin-based computing. However, so far, the generation of a large out-of-plane spin polarization is limited to achieve energy-efficient field-free magnetization switching and spin dynamics measurements in all-2D vdW heterostructure are so far missing, where the interplay between spins and magnetization dynamics should enable the design of ultrafast spintronic devices. Here, we demonstrate magnetization dynamics and energy-efficient field-free spin-orbit torque (SOT) switching of out-of-plane magnet Fe3GaTe2 due to unconventional Berry curvature-induced out-of-plane spin polarization from a topological Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4 in a vdW heterostructure at room temperature. We observed a large non-linear 2nd harmonic Hall signal at room temperature and evaluated the SOT-induced magnetization dynamics with a large damping-like torque. Deterministic field-free SOT magnetization switching in vdW heterostructure of TaIrTe4/Fe3GaTe2 is observed at room temperature with a low current and power density, which is an order of magnitude better than that of conventional systems. From the magnetization switching experiments, a large SOT efficiency and a very large spin Hall conductivity. These findings on all-vdW heterostructures offer a promising route to energy-efficient and external field-free ultrafast spintronic technologies.</description>

      <title>Modeling scale-up of particle coating by atomic layer deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a promising technique to functionalize particle surfaces for energy applications including energy storage, catalysis, and decarbonization. In this work, we present a set of models of ALD particle coating to explore the transition from lab scale to manufacturing. Our models encompass the main particle coating manufacturing approaches including rotary bed, fluidized bed, and continuously vibrating reactors. These models provide key metrics, such as throughput and precursor utilization, required to evaluate the scalability of ALD manufacturing approaches and their feasibility in the context of energy applications. Our results show that designs that force the precursor to flow through fluidized particles transition faster to a transport-limited regime where throughput is maximized. They also exhibit higher precursor utilization. In the context of continuous processes, our models indicate that it is possible to achieve self-extinguishing processes with almost 100% precursor utilization. A comparison with past experimental results of ALD in fluidized bed reactors shows excellent qualitative and quantitative agreement.</description>

      <title>Optical activation function using a metamaterial waveguide for an all-optical neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we experimentally demonstrated that the nonlinear optical coefficient of the original Si can be enhanced by incorporating a metamaterial structure into an existing silicon waveguide. The two-photon absorption coefficient enhanced by the metamaterial structure was 424 cm/GW, which is 1.2x10^3 times higher than that of Si. Using this metamaterial waveguide-based nonlinear optical activation function, we achieved a high inference accuracy of 98.36% in the handwritten character recognition task, comparable to that obtained with the ReLU function as the activation function. Therefore, our approach can contribute to the realization of more power-efficient and compact all-optical neural networks.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of the enhanced photonic spin Hall effect in a subwavelength grating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) in surface plasmon resonance (SPR) structures has great potential for various polarization-sensitive applications and devices. Here, using optical weak measurement, we observe spin-dependent and spin-independent angular shifts of the reflected beam, enhanced by SPR in a subwavelength nickel grating. An enhanced in-plane photonic spin Hall effect manifested in the angular splitting of circularly polarized photons with opposite helicity signs is demonstrated. We theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that angular in-plane shifts can be changed from spin-independent (Goos-Hanchen shift) to spin-dependent (PSHE) when the incident beam polarization state changes. The SPR-induced depolarization of light and the mixing of polarization states are analyzed. High purity of spin separation and a high degree of circular polarization are achieved with an optimal polarization state (preselection angle) and a resonance angle of incidence. The spineless spatial separation of two orthogonal components of the field with diagonal linear polarizations is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Isolation and characterization of atomically thin mica phyllosilicates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the roadblocks to employing two-dimensional (2D) materials in next generation devices is the lack of high quality insulators. Insulating layered materials with inert and atomically flat surfaces are ideal for high performance transistors and this has been exemplified with commonly used boron nitride. While the list of insulating 2D materials is limited, the earth-abundant phyllosilicates are particularly attractive candidates. Here, we investigate the properties of atomically thin biotite and muscovite, the most common and commercially important micas from the rock-forming minerals. From a group of five natural bulk samples, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy is used to classify exfoliated flakes into three types of biotite, including the phlogopite endmember, and two muscovites. We provide a catalog of RGB contrast values for exfoliated flakes ranging from bilayer to approximately 175 nm. Additionally, we report the complex index of refraction for all investigated materials based on micro-reflectance measurements. Our findings suggest that earth-abundant phyllosilicates could serve as scalable insulators for logic devices employing 2D materials, potentially overcoming current limitations in the field.</description>

      <title>Terahertz phonon engineering with van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phononic engineering at gigahertz (GHz) frequencies form the foundation of microwave acoustic filters, acousto-optic modulators, and quantum transducers. Terahertz (THz) phononic engineering could lead to acoustic filters and modulators at higher bandwidth and speed, as well as quantum circuits operating at higher temperatures. Despite its potential, methods for engineering THz phonons have been limited due to the challenges of achieving the required material control at sub-nanometer precision and efficient phonon coupling at THz frequencies. Here, we demonstrate efficient generation, detection, and manipulation of THz phonons through precise integration of atomically thin layers in van der Waals heterostructures. We employ few-layer graphene (FLG) as an ultrabroadband phonon transducer, converting femtosecond near-infrared pulses to acoustic phonon pulses with spectral content up to 3 THz. A monolayer WSe$_2$ is used as a sensor, where high-fidelity readout is enabled by the exciton-phonon coupling and strong light-matter interactions. Combining these capabilities in a single heterostructure and detecting responses to incident mechanical waves, we perform THz phononic spectroscopy. Using this platform, we demonstrate high-Q THz phononic cavities and show that a monolayer WSe$_2$ embedded in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) can efficiently block the transmission of THz phonons. By comparing our measurements to a nanomechanical model, we obtain the force constants at the heterointerfaces. Our results could enable THz phononic metamaterials for ultrabroadband acoustic filters and modulators, and open novel routes for thermal engineering.</description>

      <title>Thermal Conductivity Predictions with Foundation Atomistic Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have led to foundation models for atomistic materials chemistry, enabling quantum-accurate descriptions of interatomic forces across diverse materials at reduced computational cost. These models are currently benchmarked on harmonic phonons and related quantities, leaving their reliability for complex, technologically relevant anharmonic heat-conduction properties uncertain. Here, we introduce a framework that leverages foundation models and the Wigner formulation of heat transport to automatically predict anharmonic vibrational properties and thermal conductivity in solids with arbitrary compositions and structures. We employ this framework with the foundation models M3GNet, CHGNet, MACE-MP-0, and SevenNET to analyze 103 diverse compounds, comparing predictions against first-principles references. Thus, we introduce a benchmark metric based on conductivity, and discuss data-efficient fine-tuning protocols to achieve first-principles accuracy. Our framework enables physics-aware, accurate predictions of vibrational and thermal properties, paving the way to discover materials that violate semiclassical Boltzmann transport and exhibit record-high heat-shielding or thermoelectric performance.</description>
