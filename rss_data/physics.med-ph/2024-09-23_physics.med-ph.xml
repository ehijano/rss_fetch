      <title>Biophysical modeling of low-energy ion irradiations with NanOx</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Targeted radiotherapies with low-energy ions show interesting possibilities for the selective irradiation of tumor cells, a strategy particularly appropriate for the treatment of disseminated cancer. Two promising examples are boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) and targeted radionuclide therapy with alpha-particle emitters (TAT). The successful clinical translation of these radiotherapies requires the implementation of accurate radiation dosimetry approaches able to take into account the impact on treatments of the biological effectiveness of ions and the heterogeneity in the therapeutic agent distribution inside the tumor cells. To this end, biophysical models can be applied to translate the interactions of radiations with matter into biological endpoints, such as cell survival. Purpose: The NanOx model was initially developed for predicting the cell survival fractions resulting from irradiations with the high-energy ion beams encountered in hadrontherapy. We present in this work a new implementation of the model that extends its application to irradiations with low-energy ions, as the ones found in TAT and BNCT. Methods: The NanOx model was adapted to consider the energy loss of primary ions within the sensitive volume (i.e., the cell nucleus). Additional assumptions were introduced to simplify the practical implementation of the model and reduce computation time. In particular, for low-energy ions the narrow-track approximation allowed to neglect the energy deposited by secondary electrons outside the sensitive volume, increasing significantly the performance of simulations. Calculations were performed to compare the original hadrontherapy implementation of the NanOx model with the present one in terms of the inactivation cross sections of human salivary gland cells as a function of the kinetic energy of incident alpha-particles. Results: The predictions of the previous and current versions of NanOx agreed for incident energies higher than 1 MeV/n. For lower energies, the new NanOx implementation predicted a decrease in the inactivation cross sections that depended on the length of the sensitive volume. Conclusions: We reported in this work an extension of the NanOx biophysical model to consider irradiations with low-energy ions, such as the ones found in TAT and BNCT. The excellent agreement observed at intermediate and high energies between the original hadrontherapy implementation and the present one showed that NanOx offers a consistent, self-integrated framework for describing the biological effects induced by ion irradiations. Future work will focus on the application of the latest version of NanOx to cases closer to the clinical setting.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Model for Complete Reconstruction of Diagnostic Polarimetric Images from partial Mueller polarimetry data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The translation of imaging Mueller polarimetry to clinical practice is often hindered by large footprint and relatively slow acquisition speed of the existing instruments. Using polarization-sensitive camera as a detector may reduce instrument dimensions and allow data streaming at video rate. However, only the first three rows of a complete 4x4 Mueller matrix can be measured. To overcome this hurdle we developed a machine learning approach using sequential neural network algorithm for the reconstruction of missing elements of a Mueller matrix from the measured elements of the first three rows. The algorithm was trained and tested on the dataset of polarimetric images of various excised human tissues (uterine cervix, colon, skin, brain) acquired with two different imaging Mueller polarimeters operating in either reflection (wide-field imaging system) or transmission (microscope) configurations at different wavelengths of 550 nm and 385 nm, respectively. The reconstruction performance was evaluated using various error metrics, all of which confirmed low error values. The execution time of the trained neural network algorithm was about 300 microseconds for a single image pixel. It suggests that a machine learning approach with parallel processing of all image pixels combined with the partial Mueller polarimeter operating at video rate can effectively substitute for the complete Mueller polarimeter and produce accurate maps of depolarization, linear retardance and orientation of the optical axis of biological tissues, which can be used for medical diagnosis in clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Sine Wave Normalization for Deep Learning-Based Tumor Segmentation in CT/PET Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report presents a normalization block for automated tumor segmentation in CT/PET scans, developed for the autoPET III Challenge. The key innovation is the introduction of the SineNormal, which applies periodic sine transformations to PET data to enhance lesion detection. By highlighting intensity variations and producing concentric ring patterns in PET highlighted regions, the model aims to improve segmentation accuracy, particularly for challenging multitracer PET datasets. The code for this project is available on GitHub (https://github.com/BBQtime/Sine-Wave-Normalization-for-Deep-Learning-Based-Tumor-Segmentation-in-CT-PET).</description>

      <title>A Plug-and-Play Method for Guided Multi-contrast MRI Reconstruction based on Content/Style Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since multiple MRI contrasts of the same anatomy contain redundant information, one contrast can be used as a prior for guiding the reconstruction of an undersampled subsequent contrast. To this end, several learning-based guided reconstruction methods have been proposed. However, two key challenges remain - (a) the requirement of large paired training datasets and (b) the lack of intuitive understanding of the model's internal representation and utilization of the shared information. We propose a modular two-stage approach for guided reconstruction, addressing these challenges. A content/style model of two-contrast image data is learned in a largely unpaired manner and is subsequently applied as a plug-and-play operator in iterative reconstruction. The disentanglement of content and style allows explicit representation of contrast-independent and contrast-specific factors. Based on this, incorporating prior information into the reconstruction reduces to simply replacing the aliased reconstruction content with clean content derived from the reference scan. We name this novel approach PnP-MUNIT. Various aspects like interpretability and convergence are explored via simulations. Furthermore, its practicality is demonstrated on the NYU fastMRI DICOM dataset and two in-house raw datasets, obtaining up to 32.6% more acceleration over learning-based non-guided reconstruction for a given SSIM. In a radiological task, PnP-MUNIT allowed 33.3% more acceleration over clinical reconstruction at diagnostic quality.</description>

      <title>A Practical Guide to Transcranial Ultrasonic Stimulation from the IFCN-endorsed ITRUSST Consortium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-intensity Transcranial Ultrasonic Stimulation (TUS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique enabling cortical and deep brain targeting with unprecedented spatial accuracy. Given the high rate of adoption by new users with varying levels of expertise and interdisciplinary backgrounds, practical guidelines are needed to ensure state-of-the-art TUS application and reproducible outcomes. Therefore, the International Transcranial Ultrasonic Stimulation Safety and Standards (ITRUSST) consortium has formed a subcommittee, endorsed by the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology (IFCN), to develop recommendations for best practice in TUS applications in humans. The practical guide presented here provides a brief introduction into ultrasound physics and sonication parameters. It explains the requirements of TUS lab equipment and transducer selection and discusses experimental design and procedures alongside potential confounds and control conditions. Finally, the guide elaborates on essential steps of application planning for stimulation safety and efficacy, as well as considerations when combining TUS with neuroimaging, electrophysiology, or other brain stimulation techniques. We hope that this practical guide to TUS will assist both novice and experienced users in planning and conducting high-quality studies and provide a solid foundation for further advancements in this promising field.</description>
