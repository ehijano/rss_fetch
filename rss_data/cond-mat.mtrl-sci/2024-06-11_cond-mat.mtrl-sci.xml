      <title>Hierarchical Bayesian approach for adaptive integration of Bragg peaks in time-of-flight neutron scattering data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) operates in the event mode. Time-of-flight (TOF) information about each detected neutron is collected separately and saved as a descriptive entry in a database enabling unprecedented accuracy of the collected experimental data. Nevertheless, the common data processing pipeline still involves the binning of data to perform analysis and feature extraction. For weak reflections, improper binning leads to sparse histograms with low signal-to-noise ratios, rendering them uninformative. In this study, we propose the Bayesian approach for the identification of Bragg peaks in TOF diffraction data. The method is capable of adaptively handling the varying sampling rates found in different regions of the reciprocal space. Unlike histogram fitting methods, our approach focuses on estimating the true neutron flux function. We accomplish this by employing a profile fitting algorithm based on the event-level likelihood, along with a multiresolution histogram-level prior. By using this approach, we ensure that there is no loss of information due to data reduction in strong reflections and that the search space is appropriately restricted for weak reflections. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model, we apply it to real experimental data collected at the TOPAZ single crystal diffractometer at SNS.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Driven Optimization of TPMS Architected Materials Using Simulated Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The research paper presents a novel approach to optimizing the tensile stress of Triply Periodic Minimal Surface (TPMS) structures through machine learning and Simulated Annealing (SA). The study evaluates the performance of Random Forest, Decision Tree, and XGBoost models in predicting tensile stress, using a dataset generated from finite element analysis of TPMS models. The objective function minimized the negative R-squared value on the validation set to enhance model accuracy. The SA-XGBoost model outperformed the others, achieving an R-squared value of 0.96. In contrast, the SA-Random Forest model achieved an R squared value of 0.89 while the SA-Decision Tree model exhibited greater fluctuations in validation scores. This demonstrates that the SA-XGBoost model is most effective in capturing the complex relationships within the data. The integration of SA helps in optimizing the hyperparameters of these machine learning models, thereby enhancing their predictive capabilities.</description>

      <title>Determining Domain of Machine Learning Models using Kernel Density Estimates: Applications in Materials Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge of the domain of applicability of a machine learning model is essential to ensuring accurate and reliable model predictions. In this work, we develop a new approach of assessing model domain and demonstrate that our approach provides accurate and meaningful designation of in-domain versus out-of-domain when applied across multiple model types and material property data sets. Our approach assesses the distance between a test and training data point in feature space by using kernel density estimation and shows that this distance provides an effective tool for domain determination. We show that chemical groups considered unrelated based on established chemical knowledge exhibit significant dissimilarities by our measure. We also show that high measures of dissimilarity are associated with poor model performance (i.e., high residual magnitudes) and poor estimates of model uncertainty (i.e., unreliable uncertainty estimation). Automated tools are provided to enable researchers to establish acceptable dissimilarity thresholds to identify whether new predictions of their own machine learning models are in-domain versus out-of-domain.</description>

      <title>Simulating flow-induced reconfiguration by coupling corotational plate finite elements with a simplified pressure drag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing engineering systems that rely on flow-induced reconfiguration, the phenomenon where a structure deforms under flow to reduce its drag, requires design tools that can predict the behavior of these flexible structures. Current methods include using fully coupled computational fluid dynamics and finite element analysis solvers or highly specialized theories for specific geometries. Coupled numerical methods are computationally expensive to use and non-trivial to setup, while specialized theories are difficult to generalize and take a long time to develop. A compromise between speed, accuracy, and versatility is required to be implemented into the design cycle of flexible structures under flow. This paper offers a new numerical implementation of the pressure drag in the context of a corotational finite element formulation on MATLAB. The presented software is verified against different semi-analytical theories applied to slender plates and disks cut along their radii as well as validated against experiments on kirigami sheets and draping disks.</description>

      <title>The regulation of symmetry-breaking-dependent electronic structures in ReSeS monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the excellent physical properties, two dimensional materials have attracted widespread attention from researchers. In this article, we discuss a transition metal dichalcogenide, ReSeS monolayer with 1T" phase, with extremely low symmetry through the first principles calculation. It belongs to the space group P1 and has Jauns structure. Due to the broken of the central inversion symmetry. Raman and infrared active modes in the vibrational spectrum no longer mutually exclusive, which has become a spectral fingerprint of this material. First principles calculation indicates that the bandgap decreases when the material has geometric deformation, and we propose two models to explain this phenomenon and provide the physical pictures. The first model requires constructing a low symmetry Wannier analytically simplify Hamiltonian to obtain 4 energy levels of mixed orbital, Then the changes of bandgap can be qualitatively described through the difference between these energy levels; The second model analyzes the variations of bandgap through the bonding or antibonding characteristics of the valence and conduction band. We point out that it is a "saturation effect", where the energy of the valence and conduction band has difficulties in further changing under the deformation, resulting in the reduction of the bandgap under both compression and tensile deformation. Meanwhile, we discuss a metallic phase of ReSeS, called 1T' phase, to explain the formation of the bandgap. Compared to the 1T" phase, it has higher symmetry. Semi-filled d-orbital bands in 1T' phases will become unstable and split into bonding and antibonding bands, leading to the opening of bandgap. This process is also known as Peierls phase transition. Finally, we calculated the effective mass of electron and the absorption spectrum. Results point out the potential of ReSeS in the preparation of electrical or optical devices.</description>

      <title>Cross-scale covariance for material property prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simulation can stand its ground against experiment only if its prediction uncertainty is known. The unknown accuracy of interatomic potentials (IPs) is a major source of prediction uncertainty, severely limiting the use of large-scale classical atomistic simulations in a wide range of scientific and engineering applications. Here we explore covariance between predictions of metal plasticity, from 178 large-scale ($\sim 10^8$ atoms) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and a variety of indicator properties computed at small-scales ($\leq 10^2$ atoms). All simulations use the same 178 IPs. In a manner similar to statistical studies in public health, we analyze correlations of strength with indicators, identify the best predictor properties, and build a cross-scale ``strength-on-predictors'' regression model. This model is then used to quantify uncertainty over the statistical pool of IPs. Small-scale predictors found to be highly covariant with strength are computed using expensive quantum-accurate calculations and used to predict flow strength, within the uncertainty bounds established in our statistical study.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Overdamped Phonons on the Fundamental Band Gap of Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anharmonic atomic motions can strongly influence the optoelectronic properties of materials but how these effects are connected to the underlying phonon band structure is not understood well. We investigate how the electronic band gap is influenced by overdamped phonons, which occur in an intriguing regime of phonon-phonon interactions where vibrational lifetimes fall below one oscillation period. We contrast the anharmonic halide perovskite CsPbBr$_3$, known to exhibit overdamped phonons in its cubic phase, with the anharmonic oxide perovskite SrTiO$_3$ where the phonons are underdamped at sufficiently high temperatures. Our results show that overdamped phonons strongly impact the band gap and cause slow dynamic fluctuations of electronic levels that have been implicated in the unique optoelectronic properties of halide perovskites. This finding is enabled by developing augmented stochastic Monte Carlo methods accounting for phonon renormalization and imaginary modes that are typically neglected. Our work provides guidelines for capturing anharmonic effects in theoretical calculations of materials.</description>

      <title>Trends in hot carrier distribution for disordered noble-transition metal alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed and tested an approach for predicting trends for efficient hot carrier generation among disordered metal alloys. We provide a simple argument for the importance of indirect transitions in the presence of disorder, thus justifying the use of Joint Density of States (JDOS)-like quantities for exploring these trends. We introduce a new JDOS-like quantity, JDOSK, which heuristically accounts for longer lifetimes of quasiparticles close to the Fermi energy. To demonstrate the efficacy of this new quantity, we apply it to the study of Cu50X50 where X = Ag, Au, Pd and Y50Pd50 where Y = Au, Ni. We predict that Ni50Pd50 produces the most hot carriers among the alloys considered. The improvement in the density of excited photocarriers over the base alloy used, Cu50Ag50, is 3.4 times for 800 nm and 19 times for 1550 nm light. This boost in hot-carrier generation is consequence of the ferromagnetic nature of the Ni alloy. We argue that our method allows efficient material-specific predictions for low bias photoconductivity of alloys.</description>

      <title>Phonon-induced renormalization of exchange interactions in metallic 2D magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of spin-polarized charge carriers in metallic magnets provides a mechanism for spin-lattice interactions mediated by electron-phonon coupling. Here, we present a theory of this mechanism used to estimate its effect on the exchange interactions in 2D magnets. Starting from a square lattice model at half filling, we show that the presence of electron-phonon coupling with equilibrium phonon distribution leads to a notable suppression of exchange interactions with temperature. We then apply our approach to the prototypical 2D metallic ferromagnet, Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$, with moderate electron-phonon coupling. We find that the exchange interactions undergo a renormalization, leading to a softening of the magnon modes, and suppression of the Curie temperature by $\sim$10\%. We expect that this effect can be further enhanced in systems with strong electron-phonon coupling, as well as for non-equilibrium distribution of phonons induced by strong laser fields or charge currents.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Grain Size Distribution on the Defect Generation Mechanism of 0201 Passives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent advancements in electronics manufacturing has necessitated the demand for miniaturization of electronic components. In particular, the product sizes for passive components have evolved from 1005 (1.0x0.5mm) which is roughly the size of a grain of sand to 0201 (0.25x0.125mm) which is 1/16th the size of a grain of sand. Grain size distribution and composition play a vital role in tailoring the demands for reliably shrinking dimension of passives. The study focuses on analyzing the effect of grain size and composition, which plays a significant role in maintaining high yield output during the manufacturing processes. The objective of this study is to compare the grain morphology and its effect on defect generation mechanism for 0201 resistors. The experimental setup was prepared to evaluate the grain structure as per ASTM E112-3 test standards. The 0201 resistor samples from three different vendors were assembled on test vehicle PCB (Printed Circuit Board). The resulting observations of the study showed that tombstoning defect was observed during the reflow process for Vendor A. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) results showed the presence of microstructural difference in the tin grain size of resistors. The tin grain size for Vendor A was observed to be 2 microns, whereas the grain size for Vendors B and C were 4 and 5 microns, respectively. Furthermore, the results of grain size measurements performed using the intercept method showed that a grain size number of 13 and 13.6 was observed for Vendors B and C, whereas a grain size number of 15 was observed for Vendor A. The second phase of the study focuses on techniques for improving the grain size number to mitigate the tombstoning defect. It was observed that using an alternate plating solution during the manufacturing of passives resulted in decreased grain size number while containing the tombstoning issue.</description>

      <title>A model of thermodynamic stabilization of nanocrystalline grain boundaries in alloy systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanocrystalline (NC) materials are intrinsically unstable against grain growth. Significant research efforts have been dedicated to suppressing the grain growth by solute segregation, including the pursuit of a special NC structure that minimizes the total free energy and completely eliminates the driving force for grain growth. This fully stabilized state has been predicted theoretically and by simulations but is yet to be confirmed experimentally. To better understand the nature of the full stabilization, we propose a simple two-dimensional model capturing the coupled processes of grain boundary (GB) migration and solute diffusion. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations based on this model reproduce the fully stabilized polycrystalline state and link it to the condition of zero GB free energy. The simulations demonstrate the emergence of a fully stabilized state by the divergence of capillary wave amplitudes on planar GBs and by fragmentation of a large grain into a stable ensemble of smaller grains. The role of solute diffusion in the full stabilization is examined. Possible extensions of the model are discussed.</description>

      <title>Modelling effects of moisture on mechanical properties of crosslinked polyurethane adhesives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crosslinked polyurethane adhesives show large deformation viscoelastic behaviour and age under the moisture influence because of their hygroscopic behaviour. The viscoelastic behaviour of the material is modelled with the micromechanical network model. The micromechanical model considers the shorter and longer chains with a probability distribution function. The network evolution concept is used to model softening of material due to the breakage of the shorter chains with an increase in deformation. The moisture diffusion in the polyurethane adhesive is behaviour, therefore Langmuir-type diffusion model is used to model moisture diffusion. The transported moisture in the material leads to an exponential decay in the mechanical properties causing the ageing of the material. The micromechanical model needs to be coupled with the Langmuir-type diffusion model to analyse the ageing process, where the mechanical properties are considered as the function of the local moisture concentration.</description>

      <title>Observation of floating surface state in obstructed atomic insulator candidate NiP$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obstructed atomic insulator is recently proposed as an unconventional material, in which electric charge centers localized at sites away from the atoms. A half-filling surface state would emerge at specific interfaces cutting through these charge centers and avoid intersecting any atoms. In this article, we utilized angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations to study one of the obstructed atomic insulator candidates, NiP$_2$. A floating surface state with large effective mass that is isolated from all bulk states is resolved on the (100) cleavage plane, distinct from previously reported surface states in obstructed atomic insulators that are merged into bulk bands. Density functional theory calculation results elucidate that this floating surface state is originated from the obstructed Wannier charge centers, albeit underwent surface reconstruction that splits the half-filled obstructed surface state. Our findings not only shed lights on the spectroscopy study of obstructed atomic insulators and obstructed surface states, but also provide possible route for development of new catalysts.</description>

      <title>Hybridizing anomalous Nernst effect in artificially tilted multilayer based on magnetic topological material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transverse thermoelectric conversion holds significant potential in addressing complex challenges faced by classical Seebeck/Peltier modules. A promising transverse thermoelectric phenomenon is the anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) originating from nontrivial band structures in magnetic topological materials. However, the currently reported performance for ANE in topological materials, e.g., Co$_2$MnGa, remains insufficient for practical thermoelectric applications. Here, we unveil a new availability for ANE by integrating magnetic topological materials into artificially tilted multilayers (ATMLs), known to exhibit the structure-induced transverse thermoelectric conversion due to the off-diagonal Seebeck effect. Our experiments reveal that the transverse thermoelectric performance in Co$_2$MnGa-based ATMLs is improved through the hybrid action of ANE and the off-diagonal Seebeck effect, with the modulation of performance dependent on magnetization being significantly greater than the performance achievable with ANE alone. This unconventional synergy underscores the importance of hybrid transverse thermoelectric conversion and paves a way for advancing thermoelectric applications using magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Probing Ferroelectric Phase Transitions in Barium Titanate Single Crystals via $\it{in-situ}$ Second Harmonic Generation Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric materials play a crucial role in a broad range of technologies due to their unique properties that are deeply connected to the pattern and behavior of their ferroelectric (FE) domains. Chief among them, barium titanate (BaTiO$_3$; BTO) sees widespread applications such as in electronics but equally is a ferroelectric model system for fundamental research, e.g., to study the interplay of such FE domains, the domain walls (DWs), and their macroscopic properties, owed to BTO's multiple and experimentally accessible phase transitions. Here, we employ Second Harmonic Generation Microscopy (SHGM) to $\it{in-situ}$ investigate the cubic-to-tetragonal (at $\sim$126$^\circ$C) and the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic (at $\sim$5$^\circ$C) phase transition in single-crystalline BTO via 3-dimensional (3D) DW mapping. We demonstrate that SHGM imaging provides the direct visualization of FE domain switching as well as the domain dynamics in 3D, shedding light on the interplay of the domain structure and the phase transition. These results allow us to extract the different transition temperatures locally, to unveil the hysteresis behavior, and to determine the type of phase transition at play (1st/2nd order) from the recorded SHGM data. The capabilities of SHGM in uncovering these crucial phenomena can easily be applied to other ferroelectrics to provide new possibilities for $\it{in-situ}$ engineering of advanced ferroic devices.</description>

      <title>Polaron-assisted dielectric relaxation processes in donor-doped BaTiO3-based ceramics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perovskite structure materials based on the Ba1-xGdxTiO3 system, where x = 0, 0.001, 0.002, 0.003 and 0.005, were prepared via the Pechini chemical synthesis route. The dielectric properties have been analyzed over a wide temperature and frequency range, revealing a significant contribution of the conduction mechanisms in the dielectric response of the studied ceramics. In fact, by using the Davidson-Cole formalism, the observed electrical behavior was found to be associated with relaxation processes related to intrinsic defects mobility promoted by a thermally-activated polaronic mechanism. The obtained values of the activation energy for the relaxation processes, estimated from the Arrhenius law for the mean relaxation time, revealed a decrease from 0.29 up to 0.21 eV as the Gd-doping concentration increases, which suggests the conduction process to be associated with the polaronic effects due to the coexistence of Ti4+ and Ti3+ ions in the structure. Analysis from the conductivity formalism, by using the Jonscher universal power-law, confirmed the polaron-type conduction mechanism for the dielectric dispersion, as suggested by the dielectric analysis, being the nature of the hopping mechanism governed by small polaron hopping (SPH) charge transport in the studied Ba1-xGdxTiO3 ceramics.</description>

      <title>Ab-initio investigations of novel potential all-d metal Heusler alloys Co2MnNb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we employ the Wien2k code to conduct ab-initio study of a novel potential all-d-metal Heusler alloy Co 2 MnNb. The analysis utilizes the comparison of local spin density approximations (LDA) with Perdew-Burke-Ernzerh parameterized Generalized Gradient Approximation (PBE-GGA) for structural optimization while modified Becke-Jones potential (mBJ) exchange-correlation potentials to examine various characteristic properties of the alloy under study. Employing Birch-Murnaghan equation of state, we construct the energy-versus-volume curve, facilitating the determination of stable phases and structural parameters of the investigated alloys. Structural optimization in both non-magnetic (NM) and spin-polarized (FM) states reveals the stability of the alloy in the FM state. The compound exhibits metallic behavior in bulk, with notable anisotropic semiconducting behavior for down spin while pure metallic behavior for up spin electrons. Partial density of states of each element of the composition is also analysed to compare their respective contribution towards the observed band structure. The anisotropic behavior of Co 2 MnNb for a specific spin state could be of importance in future spintronic and other thin films device applications.</description>

Abstract: Using the WIEN2K code, the hydrogen storage capabilities of lithium-based KXH3 (X = Zn, Co) hydrides perovskites are examined. To verify the stability of these hydrides, first-principles simulations are employed to examine their structural, electronic, and hydrogen storage capabilities. These compositions' structural investigation shows that the hydrides are stable and part of the cubic space group (221 Pm-3m). We have examined several aspects of these composition's features throughout, using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation. The study identifies stable phases and structural parameters of hydrides using B-E equations, assessing thermodynamic stability in terms of hydrogen storage capacities. The metallic nature of these hydrides is confirmed through band structure and density calculations using WIEN2K.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the WIEN2K code, the hydrogen storage capabilities of lithium compositions like LiXH 3 (X = Pd, Ag, Cd) hydrides are examined. Structural, electrical, mechanical, thermoelectric, and hydrogen storage properties of these hydrides are analyzed using first-principles simulations to verify their stability. Structural analysis of these compositions reveals that the hydrides are stable and belong to the cubic space group number (221 Pm-3m). The thermodynamic stability of these hydrides are given in terms of gravimetric hydrogen storage capacities. The purpose of the study is to calculate heating of formation and breakdown temperature to determine stability of these hydrides. The metallic nature of all compositions are confirmed by band plots and density of states. The elastic properties such as elastic constant, Pugh's ratio, bulk modulus, Poisson's ratio and anisotropy factor are calculated to check the applicability of these compositions for applications involving hydrogen storage. The present paper represents the initial theoretical approach toward the future exploration of these materials for hydrogen storage applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: V-based XVH 3 (X = Li,K) hydrides perovskites are investigated for their hydrogen storage capacity using the WIEN2K code. To verify the stability of these hydrides, first-principles investigations are employed to examine their structural, electronic and hydrogen storage properties. According to structural studies these compositions hydrides are stable and part of the cubic space group (221 Pm-3m). We have examined many aspects of these compositions throughout, using the PBE-GGA exchange correlation potential. We obtained the energy versus volume curve and found the stable phase and structural parameter of these hyrides using equation of state given by Birch-Murnaghan's. These hydrides thermodynamic stability is expressed in terms of their gravimetric hydrogen storage capacity.The goal of this study is to compute the standard enthalpy of formation and thermal desorption to ascertain the stability of these hydrides. Based on band structure and density of state plots it is found that these compositions are metallic in nature. The study presents a preliminary theoretical approach for hydrogen storage applications of thermoelectric compositions, revealing their strong thermoelectric responses and potential for green energy sources.</description>

      <title>Cold Seeded Epitaxy and Flexomagnetism in Smooth GdAuGe Membranes Exfoliated from graphene/Ge(111)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote and van der Waals epitaxy are promising approaches for synthesizing single crystalline membranes for flexible electronics and discovery of new properties via extreme strain; however, a fundamental challenge is that most materials do not wet the graphene surface. We develop a cold seed approach for synthesizing smooth intermetallic films on graphene that can be exfoliated to form few nanometer thick single crystalline membranes. Our seeded GdAuGe films have narrow x-ray rocking curve widths of 9-24 arc seconds, which is two orders of magnitude lower than their counterparts grown by typical high temperature methods, and have atomically sharp interfaces observed by transmission electron microscopy. Upon exfoliation and rippling, strain gradients in GdAuGe membranes induce an antiferromagnetic to ferri/ferromagnetic transition. Our smooth, ultrathin membranes provide a clean platform for discovering new flexomagnetic effects in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Chern insulator phase realized in dual-gate-tuned MnBi2Te4 thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intrinsic magnetic order, large topological-magnetic gap and rich topological phases make MnBi2Te4 a wonderful platform to study exotic topological quantum states such as axion insulator and Chern insulator. To realize and manipulate these topological phases in a MnBi2Te4 thin film, precise manipulation of the electric field across the film is essential, which requires a dual-gate structure. In this work, we achieve dual-gate tuning of MnBi2Te4 thin films grown with molecular beam epitaxy on SrTiO3(111) substrates by applying the substrate and an AlOx layer as the gate dielectrics of bottom and top gates, respectively. Under magnetic field of 9T and temperature of 20 mK, the Hall and longitudinal resistivities of the films show inversed gate-voltage dependence, for both top- and bottom-gates, signifying the existence of the dissipationless edge state contributed by Chern insulator phase in the ferromagnetic configuration. The maximum of the Hall resistivity only reaches 0.8 h/e2, even with dual-gate tuning, probably due to the high density of bulk carriers introduced by secondary phases. In the antiferromagnetic state under zero magnetic field, the films show normal insulator behavior. The dual-gated MnBi2Te4 thin films lay the foundation for developing devices based on electrically tunable topological quantum states.</description>

      <title>Realtime observation of a tungsten-promoted size regulation mechanism in a rhodium catalyst at atomic resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The static and genuine structure of small rhodium and rhodium/tungsten nanoparticles on an alumina support can be imaged with atomic resolution even if single digit atom clusters are investigated. Low dose rate electron microscopy is key to the achievement and can generally be applied to investigate any similar material. In such conditions it becomes feasible to identify the chemical composition of nanocrystals from quantitative contrast analyses alone by counting atoms. The ability to fully characterize an unaltered, initial state of the objects allows targeting structural excitations or conformational changes induced by the electron beam itself. For the specific case of catalytic Rh:W particles we stimulate a tungsten-promoted size regulation mechanism in real time that is driven by Oswald ripening and can be understood by a strong binding of tungsten atoms to the oxygen atoms of the support, which builds up strain as the cluster sizes increase.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic second-order topological insulators in two-dimensional polymorphic graphyne with sublattice approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In two dimensions, intrinsic second-order topological insulators (SOTIs) are characterized by topological corner states that emerge at the intersections of distinct edges with reversed mass signs, enforced by spatial symmetries. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation within the class BDI to clarify the symmetry conditions ensuring the presence of intrinsic SOTIs in two dimensions. We reveal that the (anti-)commutation relationship between spatial symmetries and chiral symmetry is a reliable indicator of intrinsic corner states. Through first-principles calculations, we identify several ideal candidates within carbon-based polymorphic graphyne structures for realizing intrinsic SOTIs under sublattice approximation. Furthermore, we show that the corner states in these materials persist even in the absence of sublattice approximation. Our findings not only deepen the understanding of higher-order topological phases but also open new pathways for realizing topological corner states that are readily observable.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Nitrogen Doped Barium Zirconate Using Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using density functional theory (DFT), this work explores barium zirconate doped with nitrogen. In addition, we used density functional theory (DFT) to study the BaZrO$_3$'s electrical, optical, and structural properties, and we found that the BaZrO$_3$ has intrinsic vacancy defects by employing the supercell approach. Integrating testability into hardware devices is the goal of testing design, an approach to integrated circuit design that draws on density functional theory. This technology simplifies production testing and implementation. The study strategy incorporates the following methods: LSDA+U, Exchange Correlation Approximations, Hohenberg Kohn Theorem, and Local Spin Density Approximation. We tracked the evolution of barium zirconate's protonic, nitrogen ionic, and electronic conductivities using Density Functional Theory (DFT). We found low electrical conductivity despite the fact that nitrogen doping successfully lowered energy barriers for oxygen and proton ion migration. The conductivity of barium zirconate increased in proportion to the supercell's nitrogen content. Furthermore, we investigated the local arrangements of octahedral sites in Pm3m cubic frameworks and utilized Density Functional Theory to dope BaZrO$_3$. Nitrogen doping caused a lot of changes to oxygen sites, revealing three groups of oxygen atoms with different structural properties.</description>

      <title>Integrative Modeling and Engineering of ZnO Grain Boundaries: A Pathway to Enhanced Thermoelectric Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving higher performance in zinc oxide (ZnO) at room and mid-temperatures is crucial for applications requiring high energy conversion efficiency. This study focuses on grain boundary engineering techniques and an innovative modeling approach to optimize the thermoelectric properties of ZnO materials. An analysis was conducted to investigate the influence of grain boundaries on ZnO and evaluate its performance at mid-temperatures using the quality factor B as a descriptor.The findings indicate that the thermoelectric performance of ZnO could be significantly enhanced at low and mid-range temperatures if polycrystalline samples with engineered grain boundaries achieve low lattice thermal conductivity. An integrative model was developed to analytically examine the impact of barrier height , mean free path of carriers, and effective mass of carriers on charge mobility. Simulation results show that reducing from 0.5 eV to 0.1 eV resulted in a 45% increase in electron mobility, facilitating the overcoming of energy barriers that impede charge transport. Increasing the mean free path from 5 nm to 25 nm significantly increased charge carrier mobility, indicating fewer scattering events and higher velocities over longer distances.The study also shows that as the effective mass increases from 0.8 to 1.0, electron mobility peaks at 1.0 , suggesting an optimal balance where electron mobility is maximized. This implies an intricate interplay between carrier mass and lattice interaction forces within the material. Drawing on these insights, strategies aimed at improving the figure of merit were proposed, including microstructural engineering, advanced doping techniques, and passivation of grain boundaries. These findings provide a systematic approach to grain boundary engineering, potentially transforming ZnO into efficient materials for thermoelectric applications.</description>

      <title>Above room-temperature two-dimensional ferromagnetic half-metals in Mn-based Janus magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnets and their heterostructures offer fertile grounds for designing fascinating functionalities in ultra-thin spintronic devices. Here, by first-principles calculations, we report the discovery of energetically and thermodynamically stable 2D ferromagnets with very strong inplane magnetic anisotropy in MnXY (X = S, and Se; Y = Cl, Br and I) monolayers. Remarkably, we find that the Curie temperatures of the ferromagnetic MnSBr, MnSI, MnSeCl, and MnSeI monolayers are as high as 271, 273, 231 and 418 K, respectively. In addition, we demonstrate that these ferromagnetic monolayers are intrinsic half-metals with large spin band gaps ranging from 2.5 eV to 3.2 eV. When spin-orbit coupling is considered in these ferromagnetic monolayers, the nature of their half-metal is almost unaffected. Finally, the strong inplane magnetic anisotropy of MnSY (Y = Br, I) and MnSeY (Y = Cl, I) monolayers originate mainly from halogen and chalcogen atoms, respectively. Our work shows 2D Janus Mn-based ferromagnetic half-metals may have appealing functionalities in high-performance spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Carrier-induced transition from antiferromagnetic insulator to ferromagnetic metal in the layered phosphide EuZn$_2$P$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: EuZn$_2$P$_2$ was reported to be an insulating antiferromagnet with $T_\mathrm{N}$ of 23.5 K. In this study, single crystals of EuZn$_2$P$_2$ exhibiting metallic behavior and a ferromagnetic order of 72 K ($T_\mathrm{C}$) are successfully synthesized via a salt flux method. The presence of hole carriers induced by the Eu vacancies in the lattice is found to be crucial for the drastic changes in magnetism and electrical transport. The carriers mediate the interlayer ferromagnetic interaction, and the coupling strength is directly related to $T_\mathrm{C}$, as evidenced by the linear dependence of $T_\mathrm{C}$ and the fitted Curie-Weiss temperatures on the Eu-layer distances for ferromagnetic Eu$M_2X_2$ ($M$ = Zn, Cd; $X$ = P, As). The ferromagnetic EuZn$_2$P$_2$ shows conspicuous negative magnetoresistance (MR) near $T_\mathrm{C}$, owing to strong magnetic scattering. The MR behavior is consistent with the Majumdar-Littlewood model, indicating that the MR can be enhanced by decreasing the carrier density. Our findings suggest that Eu$M_2X_2$ has highly tunable magnetism and charge transport, making it a promising material family for potential applications in spintronics.</description>

      <title>Manipulating magnetism and transport properties of EuCd$_2$P$_2$ with a low carrier concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials that exhibit strongly coupled magnetic order and electronic properties are crucial for both fundamental research and technological applications. However, finding a material that not only shows remarkable magnetoresistive responses but also has an easily tunable ground state remains a challenge. Here, we report successful manipulation of the magnetic and transport properties of EuCd$_2$P$_2$, which is transformed from an A-type antiferromagnet ($T_\mathrm{N}$ = 11 K) exhibiting colossal magnetoresistance into a ferromagnet ($T_\mathrm{C}$ = 47 K) with metallic behavior. The dramatic alteration results from a low hole concentration of $10^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$ induced by changing the growth conditions. Electronic structure and total energy calculations confirm the tunability of magnetism with a small carrier concentration for EuCd$_2$P$_2$. It is feasible to switch between the magnetic states by using field-effect to control the carrier density, thereby changing the magneto-electronic response. The controllable magnetism and electrical transport of EuCd$_2$P$_2$ make it a potential candidate for spintronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic, structural, optical, and thermoelectric properties of the Cs2O cubic structure have been investigated using density functional theory (DFT). The calculations utilize a full relativistic version of the full-potential augmented plane-wave plus local orbitals method, which is based on density functional theory, employing both the GGA and LDA approximations. Additionally, we employed the GGA proposed by Trans-Blaha (GGA-mBJ) for band structure computations, revealing the indirect band gap nature of Cs2O. The optical properties are also addressed by computing the refractive index, extinction coefficient, and complex dielectric tensor. The electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity exhibit temperature-dependent variations, indicating the formation of a thermoelectric material. Our findings indicate that the compound under investigation is categorized as a p-type semiconductor, with the majority of charge carriers responsible for conduction being holes rather than electrons.</description>

Abstract: Monolayer $\mathrm{MoS_2}$ under strain has many interesting properties and possible applications in technology. A recent experimental study examined the effect of strain on the bandgap of monolayer $\mathrm{MoS_2}$ on a mildly curved graphite surface, reporting that under biaxial strain with a Poisson's ratio of 0.44, the bandgap decreases at a rate of 400 meV/% strain. In this work, we performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations for a free-standing $\mathrm{MoS_2}$ monolayer, using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) PBE, the hybrid functional HSE06, and many-body perturbation theory with the GW approximation using PBE wavefunctions (G0W0@PBE). We found that under biaxial strain with the experimental Poisson's ratio, the bandgap decreases at rates of 63 meV/% strain (PBE), 73 meV/% strain (HSE06), and 43 meV/% strain (G0W0@PBE), which are significantly smaller than the experimental rate. We also found that PBE predicts a similarly smaller rate (90 meV/% strain) for a different Poisson's ratio of 0.25. Spin-orbit correction (SOC) has little effect on the gap or its strain dependence. Additionally, we observed a semiconductor-to-metal transition under an equal tensile biaxial strain of 10% and a transition from a direct to an indirect bandgap, consistent with previous theoretical work.</description>

      <title>Correlated electrons of the flat band in charge density wave state of 4Hb-TaSexS2-x</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many intriguing quantum states of matter, such as unconventional superconductivity, magnetic phases and fractional quantum Hall physics, emergent from the spatially-correlated localized electrons in the flat band of solid materials. By using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS), we report the real-space investigation of correlated electrons in the flat band of superlattice 4Hb-TaSexS2-x. In contrast with the pristine 4Hb-TaS2, the selenium (Se) substitutions significantly affect the interfacial transfer of correlated electrons between the CDW states of 1T- and 1H-TaS2 layers, and contribute a real-space fractional electron-filling configurations with the distributed electron-filled and -void SoD clusters of 1T-layer. The site-specific STS spectra directly reveal their respective prominent spectra weight above EF and symmetric Mott-like spectra. In addition, the spatial distributions of these electron-filled SoDs in the 1T-layer of 4Hb-TaSe0.7S1.3 demonstrate different local short-range patterning, clearly indicating the complex neighboring interactions among the localized electrons in the flat band of 1T-layer. Our results not only provide an in-depth insight of correlated electrons in the flat CDW band, and provide a simple platform to manipulate the electron-correlation-related quantum states.</description>

      <title>Phonon Drag Effect in Nernst and Thermal Hall Effects: General Theory and Application to Dilute Metal SrTiO$_{3-\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In magnetic fields, thermal gradient-induced effects such as the Nernst and thermal Hall effects are significantly influenced by phonon drag, which works in conjunction with the Lorentz force on electrons. We introduce a method to calculate Nernst and thermal Hall conductivities influenced by phonon drag using linear response theory to treat the magnetic field as a first-order perturbation. Our formula is general enough to apply to any system as long as the Green's functions of electrons and phonons are given. We apply the obtained general theory to the recent experiments of dilute metal SrTiO$_{3-\delta}$, known for strong Nernst and thermal Hall effects due to phonon drag. We find good agreement even quantitatively. This is notable as all model parameters are derived from experimental data without adjustable parameters.</description>

      <title>Upper Bound Estimate of the Electronic Scattering Potential of a Weakly Interacting Molecular Film on a Metal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin organic films and two-dimensional (2D) molecular assemblies on solid surfaces yield the potential for applications in molecular electronics, optoelectronics, catalysis, and sensing. These applications rely on the intrinsic electronic properties of the hybrid organic/inorganic interface. Here, we investigate the energy dispersion of 2D electronic states at the interface between an atomically thin self-assembled molecular film, comprised of flat, noncovalently bonded 9,10-dicyanoanthracene (DCA) molecules, and a Ag(111) surface. Using Fourier-transformed scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (FT-STS), we determined that the 2D electronic wave functions with wavevectors within ~80% of the first Brillouin zone (BZ) area close to the Gamma-point are free-electron-like, suggesting a weak electronic interaction between the 2D molecular film and the metal surface. Via a perturbative second-order correction to the free electron energy dispersion, we further established an upper bound for the amplitude of the scattering potential resulting from the self-assembled molecular film that the interface electrons are subject to, on the order of 1.5 eV. Our approach allows for quantifying electronic interactions at hybrid 2D interfaces and heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Exploring Altermagnetism in Orthorhombic $Pnma$ structure through Group Theory and DFT Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetism, initially considered interesting but useless, recently emerged as one of the most promising magnetic phases for technology. Recently, a low symmetry antiferromagnetic phase, known as altermagnetic phase, have been discovered, where no time reversal ($\mathcal{T}$) symmetry is observed in spite of a vanishing net magnetization, leading to non-degenerate bands from the opposite magnetic sublattices. In this work, we consider two representatives of orthorhombic $Pnma$ space group, namely, BiFeO$_3$ and CaMnO$_3$ and find altermagnetic lowest energy phase in both from our density functional theory calculations. We find a substantial spin-splitting in both systems along a high-symmetry path in the Brillouin zone without considering the spin-orbit interaction (SOI). Detailed features of the band dispersion obtained from our calculation confirm the lifting of sublattice spin degeneracy only in the $k_y$-$k_z$ plane while preserving the spin degeneracy in the other planes of the Brillouin zone. We provide a comprehensive symmetry analysis based on the magnetic space group (MSG) to explain our DFT findings and an insightful symmetry-allowed model Hamiltonian, which qualitatively agrees with our results. Additionally, we extend our symmetry analysis to encompass two other potential MSGs within the $Pnma$ space group that may host the spin-splitting phenomenon without considering SOI and the likely form of their Hamiltonian. These detailed studies pave the way for a deeper understanding of the spin-splitting phenomena within the $Pnma$ space group, offering insights into the intricate interplay between symmetry and electronic as well as magnetic properties.</description>

      <title>Large Out-of-Plane Piezoelectric Effect in Janus Ferromagnetic Semiconductor Monolayer of CrOFBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploitation of piezoelectric ferromagnetism (PFM) in two-dimensional (2D) materials with large out-of-plane piezoelectric response is motivated not only by technological applications but also scientific interest. In this study, the CrONM monolayer family (N=F, Cl; M=Br, Cl) was investigated using first-principles calculations, revealing that the Janus CrOFBr monolayer exhibits intrinsic ferromagnetic semiconductor behavior along with a significant out-of-plane piezoelectric effect. The calculated out-of-plane piezoelectric strain coefficients d$_{31}$ and d$_{32}$ are up to 1.21 and 0.63 pm/V, respectively. These values are greater than those of the majority of 2D materials. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that applying tensile strain can enhance the out-of-plane piezoelectric response, leading to a respective 27% and 67% augmentation in the piezoelectric strain coefficients d$_{31}$ and d$_{32}$ compared to the unstrained configurations. This discovery holds great potential for propelling the field of nanoelectronics forward and facilitating the development of multifunctional semiconductor spintronic applications. Finally, by comparing d$_{31}$ and d$_{32}$ of the CrONM monolayer family (N=F, Cl; M=Br, Cl), we find that the magnitudes of d$_{31}$ and d$_{32}$ are correlated with the electronegativity difference between the M and N atoms. These findings provide valuable insights for the design of 2D piezoelectric materials with enhanced vertical piezoelectric responses.</description>

      <title>Improving the long-term stability of new-generation perovskite-based TCO using binary and ternary oxides capping layers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the impact of capping layers on vanadate based transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) to prolong the thermal stability with a minimal loss of resistivity during heat treatment in ambient environment. In the present study, various protecting layers (amorphous Al2O3, LaAlO3 (LAO), TiO2 grown in base pressure and TiO2 deposited under oxygen partial pressure) are grown in-situ on polycrystalline perovskite SrVO3 (SVO) thin films using Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD). The results show that amorphous LaAlO3 is the most promising protection layer among the oxide layers, to preserve both electrical and optical properties of perovskite SVO films from natural as well as artificial aging. Our present approach for a capping layer on SVO may address the long-term stability issues of correlated TCOs and would open an opportunity for the future oxide electronics applications.</description>

      <title>Structural, magnetic and x-ray absorption spectroscopy studies of new Cr-based low, medium and high-entropy spinel oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of high-entropy oxides has spurred significant research interest in recent times. These compounds exhibit exotic functional properties that often transcend simple linear combinations of their constituent elements. Herein, we present a new series of Cr-based low, medium, and high entropy spinel oxides with composition NiCr2O4, [Ni0.5Mn0.5]Cr2O4, [Ni0.33Mn0.33Co0.33]Cr2O4, [Ni0.25Mn0.25Co0.25Cu0.25]Cr2O4, [Ni0.2Mn0.2Co0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2]Cr2O4, and [Ni0.2Mg0.2Co0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2]Cr2O4. We conducted detailed structural (X-ray and Neutron diffraction), microstructural, Raman spectroscopy, magnetic, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements on these materials. Our study reveals that the incorporation of multiple cations at the A-site of the structure (AB2O4) significantly modulates the magnetic properties. These compounds exhibit transitions from complex ferrimagnetic ([Ni0.2Mn0.2Co0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2]Cr2O4) to antiferromagnetic ([Ni0.2Mg0.2Co0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2]Cr2O4) states, with remarkable coercivity variations, demonstrating the ability to tailor magnetic responses through compositional design.</description>

      <title>The first-order structural phase transition at low-temperature in GaPt$_{5}$P and its rapid enhancement with pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single crystals of XPt$_{5}$P (X = Al, Ga, and In) were grown from a Pt-P solution at high temperatures, and ambient-pressure measurements of temperature-dependent magnetization, resistivity, and X-ray diffraction were made. Also, the ambient-pressure Hall resistivity and temperature-dependent resistance under pressure were measured on GaPt$_{5}$P. All three compounds have tetragonal $P4/mmm$ crystal structure at room-temperature with metallic transport and weak diamagnetism over the $2-300$~K temperature range. Surprisingly, at ambient pressure, both the transport and magnetization measurements on GaPt$_{5}$P show a step-like feature in $70-90$~K region suggesting a possible structural phase transition, and no such features were observed in (Al/In)Pt$_{5}$P. Both the hysteretic nature and sharpness of the feature suggest the first-order transition, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction measurements provided further details of the structural transition with a crystal symmetry likely different than $P4/mmm$ below transition. The transition is characterized by anisotropic changes in the lattice parameters, a volume collapse, and satellite peaks at two distinct wave-vectors. Density functional theory calculations present phonon softening as a possible driving mechanism. Additionally, the structural transition temperature increases rapidly with increasing pressure, reaching room temperature by $\sim 2.2$~GPa, highlighting the high degree of pressure sensitivity and fragile nature of GaPt$_{5}$P room-temperature structure. Although the volume collapse and extreme pressure sensitivity suggest chemical pressure should drive a similar structural change in AlPt$_{5}$P, with smaller unit cell dimensions and volume, its structure is found to be $P4/mmm$ as well. Overall, GaPt$_{5}$P stands out as a sole member of the 1-5-1 family of compounds with a temperature-driven structural change.</description>

      <title>Large dynamical magnetic effective charges and anti-magnetoelectricity from spin and orbital origin in multiferroic BiCoO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using first-principles calculations, we explore the magnetoelectric properties of the room-temperature multiferroic crystal BiCoO$_3$. We use both applied magnetic field and finite-difference techniques to show that BiCoO$_3$ is anti-magnetoelectric at the linear level. The calculation of the dynamical effective charges reveals that the total magnetoelectric response is zero due to the compensating non-zero magnetoelectric response of each magnetic sublattice. This calculation also highlights that the the orbital contribution to the response is remarkably larger than the spin one and that each sublattice has a rather large total magnetoelectric response of 85 ps/m. Furthermore, we provide an intuitive recipe to visualize the dynamical magnetic effective charge, allowing to examine its multipolar nature which we confirm by means of ab initio calculations. Given the large value of the local response, we investigate the ferromagnetic phase as well, which gives a giant magnetoelectric response of about 1000 ps/m and coming mainly from the spin contribution this time. Finally, we discuss the possible reasons for such a large magnetoelectric response in BiCoO3 and propose possible strategies to unveil this potentially large response.</description>

      <title>Evidence of 3$d$-4$f$ antiferromagnetic coupling in strain-tuned PrCo$_{0.5}$Ni$_{0.5}$O$_{3-\delta}$ epitaxial films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strong exchange interaction between 3$d$-4$f$ magnetic sublattice in rare-earth perovskites introduces a variety of complex magnetic states hosting fascinating electronic ground states with exotic properties. Especially when it comes to rare-earth nickelate and cobaltite perovskites, tuning their rich magnetic phase diagram and spin-state transitions make them potential candidates for spintronic applications. Here, we report the observation of antiferromagnetic coupling between Pr 4$f$ and Ni/Co 3$d$ magnetic sublattices and its tunability with strain in PrCo$_{0.5}$Ni$_{0.5}$O$_{3-\delta}$ (PCNO) thin films. SQUID magnetization measurements reveal ferromagnetic (FM) ordering around 25 K, followed by a spin glass transition at low temperatures subject to spin reorientation. Competing magnetic interactions arise owing to the 3$d$-4$f$ antiferromagnetic (AFM) coupling between Pr and Co/Ni sublattice as revealed by the X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) at the Pr $M_{4,5}$ and Co/Ni $L_{2,3}$ absorption edges. Strain dependence on these AFM coupling reveals an increase (decrease) in the AFM exchange interaction for tensile (compressive) strained films, leading to a net decrease (increase) in the magnetization of PCNO films at low temperatures. The relative increase in low-temperature negative magnetoresistance for compressively strained films also reflects the enhanced ferromagnetic ordering in the system. The angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements reveal a two-fold anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) in tensile strained PCNO films. In contrast, temperature-dependent switching of AMR accompanied by a two- to four-fold symmetry crossover is observed for LaAlO$_3$-grown compressive strained films.</description>

      <title>Probing out-of-distribution generalization in machine learning for materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific machine learning (ML) endeavors to develop generalizable models with broad applicability. However, the assessment of generalizability is often based on heuristics. Here, we demonstrate in the materials science setting that heuristics based evaluations lead to substantially biased conclusions of ML generalizability and benefits of neural scaling. We evaluate generalization performance in over 700 out-of-distribution tasks that features new chemistry or structural symmetry not present in the training data. Surprisingly, good performance is found in most tasks and across various ML models including simple boosted trees. Analysis of the materials representation space reveals that most tasks contain test data that lie in regions well covered by training data, while poorly-performing tasks contain mainly test data outside the training domain. For the latter case, increasing training set size or training time has marginal or even adverse effects on the generalization performance, contrary to what the neural scaling paradigm assumes. Our findings show that most heuristically-defined out-of-distribution tests are not genuinely difficult and evaluate only the ability to interpolate. Evaluating on such tasks rather than the truly challenging ones can lead to an overestimation of generalizability and benefits of scaling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Device architectures and dimensions are now at an unimaginable level not thought possible even 10 years ago. The continued downscaling, following the so-called Moore's law, has motivated the development and use of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography scanners with specialized photoresists. Since the quality and precision of the transferred circuit pattern is determined by the EUV induced chemical changes in the photoresist, having a deep understanding of these chemical changes is of pivotal importance. For this purpose, several spectroscopic and material characterization techniques have already been employed so far. Among them, photoemission can be essential as it not only allows direct probing of chemical bonds in a quantitative way but also provides useful information regarding the generation and distribution of primary and secondary electrons. However, since high energy photons are being employed for characterization of a photosensitive material, modification of the sample during the measurement is possible and this must be considered when investigating the chemical changes in the photoresist before and after exposure to EUV light.</description>

      <title>Spin and lattice dynamics of a van der Waals antiferromagnet MnPSe$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic van der Waals family $\rm \textit{M}P\textit{X}_{3}\ (M=Fe,\ Mn,\ Co,\text{ and}\ Ni; X=S\text{ and}\ Se)$ have attracted significant research attention due to the possibility of realizing long-range magnetic order down to the monolayer limit. Here, we perform inelastic neutron scattering measurements on single crystal samples of MnPSe$_3$, a member of the $\rm \textit{M}P\textit{X}_{3}$ family, to study the spin dynamics and determine the effective spin model. The excited magnon bands are well characterized by a spin model, which includes a Heisenberg term with three intraplane exchange parameters ($J_{1}=-0.73$~meV, $J_{2}=-0.014$~meV, $J_{3}=-0.43$~meV) and one interplane parameter ($J_{c}=-0.054$~meV), and an easy-plane single-ion anisotropy term ($D=-0.035$~meV). Additionally, we observe the intersection of the magnon and phonon bands but no anomalous spectral features induced by the formation of magnon-phonon hybrid excitations at the intersecting region. We discuss possible reasons for the absence of such hybrid excitations in MnPSe$_3$.</description>

      <title>Pyroresistive response of percolating conductive polymer composites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pyroresistive response of conductive polymer composites (CPCs) has attracted much interest because of its potential applications in many electronic devices requiring a significant responsiveness to changes in external physical parameters such as temperature or electric fields. Although extensive research has been conducted to study how the properties of the polymeric matrix and conductive fillers affect the positive temperature coefficient pyroresistive effect, the understanding of the microscopic mechanism governing such a phenomenon is still incomplete. In particular, to date, there is little body of theoretical research devoted to investigating the effect of the polymer thermal expansion on the electrical connectivity of the conductive phase. Here, we present the results of simulations of model CPCs in which rigid conductive fillers are dispersed in an insulating amorphous matrix. By employing a meshless algorithm to analyze the thermoelastic response of the system, we couple the computed strain field to the electrical connectedness of the percolating conductive particles. We show that the electrical conductivity responds to the local strains that are generated by the mismatch between the thermal expansion of the polymeric and conductive phases and that the conductor-insulator transition is caused by a sudden and global disconnection of the electrical contacts forming the percolating network.</description>

      <title>Janus graphene nanoribbons with a single ferromagnetic zigzag edge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological design of pi-electrons in zigzag-edged graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) leads to a wealth of magnetic quantum phenomena and exotic quantum phases. Symmetric ZGNRs typically exhibit antiferromagnetically coupled spin-ordered edge states. Eliminating cross-edge magnetic coupling in ZGNRs not only enables the realization of a new class of ferromagnetic quantum spin chains, enabling the exploration of quantum spin physics and entanglement of multiple qubits in the 1D limit, but also establishes a long-sought carbon-based ferromagnetic transport channel, pivotal for ultimate scaling of GNR-based quantum electronics. However, designing such GNRs entails overcoming daunting challenges, including simultaneous breaking of structural and spin symmetries, and designing elegant precursors for asymmetric fabrication of reactive zigzag edges. Here, we report a general approach for designing and fabricating such ferromagnetic GNRs in the form of Janus GNRs with two distinct edge configurations. Guided by Lieb's theorem and topological classification theory, we devised two JGNRs by asymmetrically introduced a topological defect array of benzene motifs to one zigzag edge, while keeping the opposing zigzag edge unchanged. This breaks structural symmetry and creates a sublattice imbalance within each unit cell, initiating a spin symmetry breaking. Three Z-shape precursors are designed to fabricate one parent ZGNR and two JGNRs with an optimal lattice spacing of the defect array for a complete quench of the magnetic edge states at the defective edge. Characterization via scanning probe microscopy/spectroscopy and first-principles density functional theory confirms the successful fabrication of Janus GNRs with ferromagnetic ground state delocalised along the pristine zigzag edge.</description>

      <title>Visualizing uniform lattice-scale pair density wave in single-layer FeSe/SrTiO3 films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Typical BCS superconductors are microscopically homogeneous in real space governed by the coherent Cooper pairs with high phase stiffness of superfluid density, which is characterized by a coherence length. However, a periodic oscillation of superconducting order parameter may develop driven by breaking the time-reversal or translational invariance. To date, such modulated orders were specific to each material systems, with a periodicity much larger than the lattice constant. Here we report the direct observation of a uniform lattice-scale pair density wave (PDW) in single-layer FeSe/SrTiO3 films, enforced by peculiar interfacial structure of crystal symmetries breaking. Our spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy unravels a spatial modulation of Cooper-pairing gap within a single unit-cell, depending on inequivalent atomic sites. Prominent periodic variation of superfluid density is visualized via Josephson current by a superconducting tip, indicating a real-space oscillation of phase stiffness. Such a lattice-scale superconducting modulation, which coexists with a larger length scale of PDW order, indicates the lattice-scale variation of both pairing strength and phase stiffness. Our findings provide new insights into the intertwined density-wave orders of quasiparticle character in correlated electronic systems, and provoke future studies on the unconventional paring interaction and phase stiffness in the two-dimensional limit.</description>

      <title>Hybrid terahertz emitter for pulse shaping and chirality control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) radiation, spanning from 0.3 to 3x10^12 Hz, fills the crucial gap between the microwave and infrared spectral range. THz technology has found applications in various fields, from imaging and sensing to telecommunication and biosensing. However, the full potential of these applications is often hindered by the need for precise control and manipulation of the frequency and polarization state, which typically requires external THz modulators. Here, we demonstrate a hybrid THz source that overcomes this limitation. Our device consists of two THz emitters integrated into one single device, enabling pulse shaping and chirality control of the emitted radiation without additional external components. The two sources are a spintronic emitter and a semiconductor photoconductive antenna (PCA). Using a combination of dual-wavelength excitation, allowing for control of the relative time delay between the two laser excitation pulses, and tuning external parameters for each emitter (i.e., biasing voltage for the PCA and magnetic field for the spintronic THz emitter) enables precise control of the mixing of the two signals and results in frequency, polarization, and chirality control of the overall THz radiation. This on-chip hybrid emitter provides an essential platform for engineered THz radiation with wide-ranging potential applications.</description>

      <title>Photoinduced non-reciprocal magnetism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Out of equilibrium, the action-reaction symmetry of the interactions is often broken, leading to the emergence of various collective phenomena with no equilibrium counterparts. Although ubiquitous in classical active systems, implementing such non-reciprocal interactions in solid-state systems has remained challenging, as the known quantum schemes require precise control over the system on a single-site level. Here, we propose a novel dissipation-engineering protocol to induce non-reciprocal interactions in solid-state platforms with light, which we expect to be achievable with state-of-the-art experimental techniques. Focusing on magnetic metals for concreteness, we show microscopically that a light injection that introduces the decay channel to a virtually excited state gives rise to non-reciprocal interactions between localized spins. One can even realize a situation where spin A tries to align with spin B but the B tries the opposite, resulting in a chase-and-runaway dynamics. Applying our scheme to layered ferromagnets, we show that a non-reciprocal phase transition from a static to a many-body time-dependent chiral phase emerges. Our work paves the way to bring solid-state systems to the realm of non-reciprocal science, providing yet another possibility to control quantum matter with light.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing Solution-Substrate Interaction of Perovskite Ink on PEDOT:PSS for Scalable Blade Coated Narrow Bandgap Perovskite Solar Modules by Gas Quenching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of scalable 1.25 eV mixed Pb-Sn perovskite solar modules by blade coating lags behind Pb-based perovskites due to limited understanding of solution-substrate interaction of the perovskite ink on PEDOT:PSS and subsequent gas quenching. To address this challenge, we systematically studied the wet film deposition and quenching process to better understand narrow bandgap perovskite film formation on PEDOT:PSS. We found, the wetting of Pb-Sn perovskite ink on PEDOT:PSS is highly unstable over relevant coating time scales, causing the contact angles to decrease rapidly from 42{\deg} to 16{\deg} within seconds. This instability leads to localized irregularities in the wet film, resulting in uneven solvent extraction and inhomogeneous nuclei density. As a result, rough perovskite films with voids at the buried interface are obtained. To overcome this problem, we developed a quasi-static wetting process by reducing the blade coating speed, thereby stabilizing the wetting behavior of Pb-Sn perovskite precursor ink on PEDOT:PSS. This optimized process facilitates the deposition of high-quality, void-free Pb-Sn perovskite films with uniform thickness over 8 cm of coating length using moderate (1.4 bar) N2 quenching. We achieved 20 % efficient narrow bandgap perovskite solar cells and mini-modules with 15.8 % active area efficiency on 15.9 cm2.</description>

      <title>Significant dependence of the efficiency of energy-saving thermochromic VO$_2$ on slight changes of its properties in the visible due to strain and/or vacancies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are worldwide efforts to maximize the energy saving achieved by VO$_2$-based thermochromic coatings. In particular, there are very different values of the modulation of integral solar energy transmittance, reported by various laboratories on various templates even for seemingly very similar coatings. A detailed analysis reveals that this is largely due to the combination of the intentional and well understood transmittance modulation in the infrared (always beneficial) with not yet understood slight transmittance modulation in the visible (sometimes beneficial, sometimes harmful, and always multiplied by strong solar irradiance). Ab-initio calculations are used to examine the hypothesis that the transmittance modulation in the visible can be controlled by lattice strain and/or slightly off-stoichiometric [O]/[V] ratio. The presented phenomenon opens a pathway which may lead, in a case of reproducible preparation of correctly altered VO$_2$, to significantly enhanced energy saving.</description>

      <title>Discovering classical spin liquids by topological search of high symmetry nets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin liquids are a paradigmatic example of a non-trivial state of matter, and the search for new spin liquids is a key direction of physics, chemistry, and materials science. Geometric frustration -- where the geometry of the net that the spins occupy precludes the generation of a simple ordered state -- is a particularly fruitful way to generate these intrinsically disordered states. A particular focus has been on a handful of high symmetry nets. There are, however, many three-dimensional nets, each of which has the potential to form unique states. In this paper, we investigate the high symmetry nets -- those which are both node- and edge-transitive -- for the simplest possible interaction sets: nearest-neighbour couplings of antiferromagnetic Heisenberg and Ising spins. While the well-known crs (pyrochlore) net is the only nearest-neighbour Heisenberg antiferromagnet which does not order, we identify two new frustrated nets (lcx and thp) that possess finite temperature Heisenberg spin-liquid states with strongly suppressed magnetic ordering and non-collinear ground states. With Ising spins, we identify four new classical spin liquids that do not order down to $T/J = 10^{-2}$. We highlight materials that contain these high symmetry nets, and which could, if substituted with appropriate magnetic ions, potentially host these unusual states. Our systematic survey will guide searches for novel magnetic phases.</description>

      <title>Magnetic ordering phase transition and abnormal brittleness in dilute Fe-Mn solid solution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.11882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experiments showed that solute Mn in bcc iron is in antiferromagnetic (AFM) coupling with iron neighbours below 2 at.% Mn, but is in ferromagnetic (FM) coupling at higher concentrations. Surprisingly, although Mn is an important alloying element in high-strength steels, it induces brittleness just at around 2 at.% Mn and higher concentrations. However, the mechanisms for the magnetic ordering phase transition and the abnormal brittleness remain unclear. Based on magnetism-constrained/unconstrained calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations within density functional theory, we show that while the AFM phase prevails at low Mn contents, the FM phase becomes dominant at 1.85 at.% Mn and elevated temperatures. Our results suggest that the AFM-FM phase transition with increasing Mn concentration can be ascribed to the thermal effect. Furthermore, we find that the brittleness of the Fe-Mn alloys at intermediate Mn content might be related to the stress variations within the grains accompanying the local magnetic ordering changes.</description>

      <title>A method to measure the embedded crack length and position in high-density polyethylene using microseconds ultrasound time signal</title>

Abstract: High-density polyethylene (HDPE) is used in applications ranging from cooling water pipelines in nuclear power plants and distribution pipelines for natural gas and hydrogen to biomedical implants. Embedded crack-like flaws form within HDPE during fabrication or operations. Non-visible flaws can cause catastrophic failure if undetected. Large structures such as HDPE pipelines require a fast, non-destructive evaluation (NDE) method where the sensor can move rapidly across the structure. This is only possible if the flaw is evaluated using microseconds of time signal. We propose and show the accuracy of a machine learning-based Ultrasound NDE method that can rapidly and accurately predict embedded crack length and position simultaneously in HDPE with only tens of microseconds of time signal sensing. A method to quantify crack size in HDPE and other polymers using a very short Ultrasound time signal is lacking. We propose that an optimally trained machine learning model can decipher the crack characteristics using short measures of time signal, but a lack of large, well-distributed, and labeled datasets to train machine learning models continues to be a major limitation. To overcome this limitation, we have conducted computer simulations of ultrasound on HDPE to develop training data. We show that fully simulations trained convolutional neural network (CNN) can accurately predict crack lengths and positions in HDPE from experimentally measured ultrasound A-scan microsecond signals. Our method is based on the 1D time amplitude signal acquired over a very short time period and not based on 2D image analysis. The proposed methodology presents a pathway for training CNN using computationally generated data and applying the trained CNN in the field to quantify hidden cracks in large HDPE or other polymer structures.</description>

Abstract: We present a theory of geodynamics in a spacetime crystal based on an event wavepacket constructed from the Floquet-Bloch waves, which not only involve a scalar dispersion function but also a Berry curvature tensor in the phase space manifold of spacetime and the reciprocal quasi energy-momentum. In the presence of structural deformation, this theory is naturally extended into a covariant form with the introduction of a lattice connection constructed out of the gradients of the local lattice vectors. The geodesic equation for a free particle involves not only the lattice connection but also higher-order corrections from spacetime inhomogeneity of Berry curvatures and quasi energy-momentum dispersion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While first-principles methods have been successfully applied to characterize individual properties of multi-principal element alloys (MPEA), their use to search for optimal trade-offs between competing properties is hampered by high computational demands. In this work, we present a novel framework to explore Pareto-optimal compositions by integrating advanced ab initio-based techniques into a Bayesian multi-objective optimization workflow complemented with a simple analytical model providing straightforward analysis of trends. We benchmark the framework by applying it to solid solution strengthening and ductility of refractory MPEAs, with the parameters of the strengthening and ductility models being efficiently computed using a combination of the coherent-potential approximation method, accounting for finite-temperature effects, and actively-learned moment-tensor potentials parameterized with ab initio data. Properties obtained from ab initio calculations are subsequently used to extend predictions of all relevant material properties to a large class of refractory alloys with the help of the analytical model validated by the data and relying on a few element-specific parameters and universal functions that describe bonding between elements. Our findings offer new crucial insights into the traditional strength-vs-ductility dilemma of refractory MPEAs. The proposed framework is versatile and can be extended to other materials and properties of interest, enabling a predictive and tractable high-throughput screening of Pareto-optimal MPEAs over the entire composition space.</description>

      <title>Directly observing atomic-scale relaxations of a glass forming liquid using femtosecond X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Glass forming liquids exhibit structural relaxation behaviors, reflecting underlying atomic rearrangements on a wide range of timescales. These behaviors play a crucial role in determining many material properties. However, the relaxation processes on the atomic scale are not well understood due to the experimental difficulties in directly characterizing the evolving correlations of atomic order in disordered systems. Here, taking the model system Ge15Te85, we demonstrate an experimental approach that probes the relaxation dynamics by scattering the coherent X-ray pulses with femtosecond duration produced by X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs). By collecting the summed speckle patterns from two rapidly successive, nearly identical X-ray pulses generated using a split-delay system, we can extract the contrast decay of speckle patterns originating from sample dynamics and observe the full decorrelation of local order on the sub-picosecond timescale. This provides the direct atomic-level evidence of fragile liquid behavior of Ge15Te85. Our results demonstrate the strategy for XFEL-based X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS), attaining femtosecond temporal and atomic-scale spatial resolutions. This twelve orders of magnitude extension from the millisecond regime of synchrotron-based XPCS opens a new avenue of experimental studies of relaxation dynamics in liquids, glasses, and other highly disordered systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of spin-orbit coupling or non-collinear magnetic spin states can have dramatic effects on the ground-state and spectral properties of materials, in particular on the band structure. Here, we develop non-collinear Koopmans-compliant functionals based on Wannier functions and density-functional perturbation theory, targeting accurate spectral properties in the quasiparticle approximation. Our non-collinear Koopmans-compliant theory involves functionals of four-component orbitals densities, that can be obtained from the charge and spin-vector densities of Wannier functions. We validate our approach on four emblematic non-magnetic and magnetic semiconductors where the effect of spin-orbit coupling goes from small to very large: the III-IV semiconductor GaAs, the transition-metal dichalcogenide WSe$_2$, the cubic perovskite CsPbBr$_3$, and the ferromagnetic semiconductor CrI$_3$. The predicted band gaps are comparable in accuracy to state-of-the-art many-body perturbation theory and include spin-dependent interactions and screening effects that are missing in standard diagrammatic approaches based on the random phase approximation. While the inclusion of orbital- and spin-dependent interactions in many-body perturbation theory requires self-screening or vertex corrections, they emerge naturally in the Koopmans-functionals framework.</description>

      <title>Unified Differentiable Learning of Electric Response</title>

Abstract: Predicting response of materials to external stimuli is a primary objective of computational materials science. However, current methods are limited to small-scale simulations due to the unfavorable scaling of computational costs. Here, we implement an equivariant machine-learning framework where response properties stem from exact differential relationships between a generalized potential function and applied external fields. Focusing on responses to electric fields, the method predicts electric enthalpy, forces, polarization, Born charges, and polarizability within a unified model enforcing the full set of exact physical constraints, symmetries and conservation laws. Through application to $\alpha$-SiO$_2$, we demonstrate that our approach can be used for predicting vibrational and dielectric properties of materials, and for conducting large-scale dynamics under arbitrary electric fields at unprecedented accuracy and scale. We apply our method to ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$ and capture the temperature-dependence and time evolution of hysteresis, revealing the underlying microscopic mechanisms of nucleation and growth that govern ferroelectric domain switching.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Framework for the Prediction of Grain Boundary Segregation in Chemically Complex Environments</title>

Abstract: The discovery of complex concentrated alloys has unveiled materials with diverse atomic environments, prompting the exploration of solute segregation beyond dilute alloys. Data-driven methods offer promising for modeling segregation in such chemically complex environments, and are employed in this study to understand segregation behavior of a refractory complex concentrated alloy, NbMoTaW. A flexible methodology is developed that uses composable computational modules, with different arrangements of these modules employed to obtain site availabilities at absolute zero and the corresponding density of states beyond the dilute limit, resulting in an extremely large dataset containing 10 million data points. The artificial neural network developed here can rely solely on descriptions of local atomic environments to predict behavior at the dilute limit with very small errors, while the addition of negative segregation instance classification allows any solute concentration from zero up to the equiatomic concentration for ternary or quaternary alloys to be modeled at room temperature. The machine learning model thus achieves a significant speed advantage over traditional atomistic simulations, being four orders of magnitude faster, while only experiencing a minimal reduction in accuracy. This efficiency presents a powerful tool for rapid microstructural and interfacial design in unseen domains. Scientifically, our approach reveals a transition in the segregation behavior of Mo from unfavorable in simple systems to favorable in complex environments. Additionally, increasing solute concentration was observed to cause anti-segregation sites to begin to fill, challenging conventional understanding and highlighting the complexity of segregation dynamics in chemically complex environments.</description>

      <title>Ineffectiveness of Formamidine in Suppressing Ultralow Thermal Conductivity in Cubic Hybrid Perovskite FAPbI3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fundamentally understanding the lattice dynamics and microscopic mechanisms of thermal transport in cubic hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites remains elusive, primarily due to their strong anharmonicity and frequent phase transitions. In this work, we comprehensively investigate the thermal transport behavior in cubic hybrid perovskite FAPbI3, integrating first principles-based anharmonic lattice dynamics with a linearized Wigner transport formula. The Temperature Dependent Effective Potential (TDEP) technique allows us to stabilize the negative soft modes, primarily dominated by organic cations, at finite temperatures in cubic FAPbI3. We then predict an ultra-low thermal conductivity of ~0.63 Wm^(-1) K^(-1) in cubic FAPbI3 at 300 K, with a temperature dependence of T^(-0.740), suggesting a good crystalline nature of phonon transport. Notably, the ultra-low thermal conductivity in cubic FAPbI3 is primarily attributed to the [PbI3]1- units, challenging the conventional focus on organic FA+ cations. This shift in focus is due to the presence of Pb(s)-I(p) anti-bonding sates within the [PbI3]1- units. Furthermore, thermal transport in cubic FAPbI3 is predominantly governed by the particle-like phonon propagation channel across the entire temperature range of 300-500 K, a result of diminished suppression of low-frequency phonons by FA+ cations and large inter-branch spacings. Finally, our findings underscore that the anharmonic force constants are highly temperature-sensitive, leading to underestimations of thermal conductivity when relying on 0-K anharmonic force constants. Our study not only elucidates the microscopic mechanisms of thermal transport in cubic FAPbI3 but also provides a crucial framework for the discovery, design, and understanding of hybrid organic-inorganic compounds with ultra-low thermal conductivity.</description>

      <title>Observation of terahertz second harmonic generation from Dirac surface states in the topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.05271v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the observation of second harmonic generation with high conversion efficiency $\sim 0.005\%$ in the terahertz regime from thin films of the topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ that exhibit the linear photogalvanic effect, measured via time-domain terahertz spectroscopy and terahertz emission, respectively. As neither phenomena is observable from topologically trivial In-doped Bi$_2$Se$_3$, and since no enhancement is observed when subject to band bending, the efficient thickness-independent nonliear responses are attributable to the Dirac fermions of topological surface states of Bi$_2$Se$_3$. This observation of intrinsic terahertz second harmonic generation in an equilibrium system unlocks the full suite of both even and odd harmonic orders in the terahertz regime and opens new pathways to probing quantum geometry via intraband nonlinear processes. We hope our work will motivate the theoretical development of a full treatment of second harmonic generation for probing the quantum geometry in various inversion-breaking topological and twisted materials.</description>

      <title>Elastic solids with strain-gradient elastic boundary surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.13744v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent works have shown that in contrast to classical linear elastic fracture mechanics, endowing crack fronts in a brittle Green-elastic solid with Steigmann-Ogden surface elasticity yields a model that predicts bounded stresses and strains at the crack tips for plane-strain problems. However, singularities persist for anti-plane shear (mode-III fracture) under far-field loading, even when Steigmann-Ogden surface elasticity is incorporated.
  This work is motivated by obtaining a model of brittle fracture capable of predicting bounded stresses and strains for all modes of loading. We formulate an exact general theory of a three-dimensional solid containing a boundary surface with strain-gradient surface elasticity. For planar reference surfaces parameterized by flat coordinates, the form of surface elasticity reduces to that introduced by Hilgers and Pipkin, and when the surface energy is independent of the surface covariant derivative of the stretching, the theory reduces to that of Steigmann and Ogden. We discuss material symmetry using Murdoch and Cohen's extension of Noll's theory. We present a model small-strain surface energy that incorporates resistance to geodesic distortion, satisfies strong ellipticity, and requires the same material constants found in the Steigmann-Ogden theory.
  Finally, we derive and apply the linearized theory to mode-III fracture in an infinite plate under far-field loading. We prove that there always exists a unique classical solution to the governing integro-differential equation, and in contrast to using Steigmann-Ogden surface elasticity, our model is consistent with the linearization assumption in predicting finite stresses and strains at the crack tips.</description>

      <title>Symmetry constraints and spectral crossing in a Mott insulator with Green's function zeros</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.13870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lattice symmetries are central to the characterization of electronic topology. Recently, it was shown that Green's function eigenvectors form a representation of the space group. This formulation has allowed the identification of gapless topological states even when quasiparticles are absent. Here we demonstrate the profundity of the framework in the extreme case, when interactions lead to a Mott insulator, through a solvable model with long-range interactions. We find that both Mott poles and zeros are subject to the symmetry constraints, and relate the symmetry-enforced spectral crossings to degeneracies of the original non-interacting eigenstates. Our results lead to new understandings of topological quantum materials and highlight the utility of interacting Green's functions toward their symmetry-based design.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical transport in two-dimensional Dirac materials with spatially variable tilt</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.06030v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use Boltzmann theory to study the semi-classical dynamics of electrons in a two-dimensional (2D) tilted Dirac material in which the tilt varies in space. The spatial variation of the tilt parameter induces a non-trivial spacetime geometry on the background of which the electrons roam about. As the first manifestation of graivto-electric phenomena, we find a geometric planar Hall effect according to which a current flows in a direction transverse to the chemical potential gradient and is proportional to $g^{xy}$ component of the emergent spacetime structure. The longitudinal conductivity contains information about the gravitational red-shift factors. Furthermore, in the absence of externally applied electric field there can be "free-fall" or zero-bias currents that can be used as detectors of terahertz radiation.</description>

      <title>Physical Signatures of Fermion-Coupled Axion Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the presence of axion dark matter, fermion spins experience an "axion wind" torque and an "axioelectric" force. We investigate new experimental probes of these effects and find that magnetized analogs of multilayer dielectric haloscopes can explore orders of magnitude of new parameter space for the axion-electron coupling. We also revisit the calculation of axion absorption into in-medium excitations, showing that axioelectric absorption is screened in spin-polarized targets, and axion wind absorption can be characterized in terms of a magnetic energy loss function. Finally, our detailed theoretical treatment allows us to critically examine recent claims in the literature. We find that axioelectric corrections to electronic energy levels are smaller than previously estimated and that the purported electron electric dipole moment due to a constant axion field is entirely spurious.</description>

Abstract: Akali superoxides AO2 (A=Na, K, Rb, Cs), due to an open p shell of the oxygen ion O2^- with degenerate pi orbitals, have spin and orbital degrees of freedom. The complex magnetic, orbital, and structural phase transitions observed experimentally in this family of materials are only partially understood. Based on density functional theory, we derive a strong-coupling effective model for the isostructural compounds AO2 (A=K, Rb, Cs) from a two-orbital Hubbard model. We find that CsO2 has highly frustrated exchange interactions in the a-b plane, while the frustration is weaker for RbO2 and KO2. We solve the resulting Kugel-Khomskii model in the mean-field approximation. We show that CsO2 exhibits an antiferro-orbital (AFO) order with the ordering vector q=(1,0,0) and a stripe antiferromagnetic order with q=(1/2,0,0), which is consistent with recent neutron scattering experiments. We discuss the role of the pi-orbital degrees of freedom for the experimentally observed magnetic transitions and interpret the as-yet-unidentified T_s2=70K transition in CsO2 as an orbital ordering transition.</description>

      <title>Granular aqueous suspensions with controlled inter-particular friction and adhesion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a simple route to obtain large quantities of suspensions of non-Brownian particles with stimuli-responsive surface properties to study the relation between their flow and interparticle interactions. We perform an alkaline hydrolysis reaction on poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) particles to obtain poly(sodium methacrylate) (PMAA-Na) particles. We characterize the quasi-static macroscopic frictional response of their aqueous suspensions using a rotating drum. The suspensions are frictionless when the particles are dispersed in pure water. We relate this state to the presence of electrosteric repulsion between the charged surfaces of the ionized PMAA-Na particles in water. Then we add monovalent and multivalent ions (Na+, Ca2+, La3+) and we observe that the suspensions become frictional whatever the valency. For divalent and trivalent ions, the quasi-static avalanche angle {\theta}c at large ionic strength is greater than that of frictional PMMA particles in water, suggesting the presence of adhesion. Finally, a decrease in the pH of the suspending solution leads to a transition between a frictionless plateau and a frictional one. We perform Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) to relate our macroscopic observations to the surface features of the particles. In particular, we show that the increase in friction in the presence of multivalent ions or under acidic conditions is driven by a nanoscopic phase separation and the bundling of polyelectrolyte chains at the surface of the particle. Our results highlight the importance of surface interactions in the rheology of granular suspensions. Our particles provide a simple, yet flexible platform to study frictional suspension flows.</description>

      <title>Twisted MoSe2 Homobilayer Behaving as a Heterobilayer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heterostructures (HSs) formed by the transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) materials have shown great promise in next-generation optoelectronic and photonic applications. An artificially twisted HS, allows us to manipulate the optical, and electronic properties. With this work, we introduce the understanding of the complex energy transfer (ET) process governed by the dipolar interaction in a twisted molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) homobilayer without any charge-blocking interlayer. We fabricated an unconventional homobilayer (i.e., HS) with a large twist angle by combining the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and mechanical exfoliation (Exf.) techniques to fully exploit the lattice parameters mismatch and indirect/direct (CVD/Exf.) bandgap nature. This effectively weaken the charge transfer (CT) process and allows the ET process to take over the carrier recombination channels. We utilize a series of optical and electron spectroscopy techniques complementing by the density functional theory calculations, to describe a massive photoluminescence enhancement from the HS area due to an efficient ET process. Our results show that the electronically decoupled MoSe2 homobilayer is coupled by the ET process, mimicking a 'true' heterobilayer nature.</description>

      <title>Constructing vortex functions and basis states of Chern insulators: ideal condition, inequality from index theorem, and coherent-like states on von Neumann lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of fractional Chern insulators, a great deal of effort has been devoted to characterizing Chern bands that exhibit properties similar to the Landau levels. Among them, the concept of the vortex function, which generalizes the complex coordinate used for the symmetric-gauge Landau-level basis, allows for a concise description. In this paper, we develop a theory of constructing the vortex function and basis states of Chern insulators in the tight-binding formalism. In the first half, we consider the optimization process of the vortex function, which minimizes an indicator that measures the difference from the ideal Chern insulators. In particular, we focus on the sublattice position dependence of the vortex function or the quantum geometric tensor. This degree of freedom serves as a discrete analog of the non-uniformity in the spatial metric and magnetic field in a continuous model. In the second half, we construct two types of basis sets for a given vortex function: radially localized basis set and coherent-like basis set. The former basis set is defined as the eigenstates of an analogy of the angular momentum operator. Remarkably, one can always find exact zero mode(s) for this operator, which is explained by the celebrated Atiyah-Singer index theorem. As a byproduct, we propose an inequality rooted in the band topology. We also discuss the subtle differences between our formalism and the previous works about the momentum-space Landau level. The latter basis set generalizes the concept of coherent states on von Neumann lattice. While this basis set is not orthogonal, it is useful to compare the LLL and the given Chern insulator directly in the Brillouin zone. These basis sets are expected to be useful for many-body calculations of fractional Chern insulators.</description>
