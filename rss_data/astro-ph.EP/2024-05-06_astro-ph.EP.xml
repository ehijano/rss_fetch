      <title>Properties of electrons accelerated by the Ganymede-magnetosphere interaction: survey of Juno high-latitude observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The encounter between the Jovian co-rotating plasma and Ganymede gives rise to electromagnetic waves that propagate along the magnetic field lines and accelerate particles by resonant or non-resonant wave-particle interaction. They ultimately precipitate into Jupiter's atmosphere and trigger auroral emissions. In this study, we use Juno/JADE, Juno/UVS data, and magnetic field line tracing to characterize the properties of electrons accelerated by the Ganymede-magnetosphere interaction in the far-field region. We show that the precipitating energy flux exhibits an exponential decay as a function of downtail distance from the moon, with an e-folding value of 29{\deg}, consistent with previous UV observations from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We characterize the electron energy distributions and show that two distributions exist. Electrons creating the Main Alfv\'en Wing (MAW) spot and the auroral tail always have broadband distribution and a mean characteristic energy of 2.2 keV while in the region connected to the Transhemispheric Electron Beam (TEB) spot the electrons are distributed non-monotonically, with a higher characteristic energy above 10 keV. Based on the observation of bidirectional electron beams, we suggest that Juno was located within the acceleration region during the 11 observations reported. We thus estimate that the acceleration region is extended, at least, between an altitude of 0.5 and 1.3 Jupiter radius above the 1-bar surface. Finally, we estimate the size of the interaction region in the Ganymede orbital plane using far-field measurements. These observations provide important insights for the study of particle acceleration processes involved in moon-magnetosphere interactions.</description>

      <title>Dark Kinetic Heating of Exoplanets and Brown Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark kinetic heating of neutron stars has been previously studied as a promising dark matter detection avenue. Kinetic heating occurs when dark matter is sped up to relativistic speeds in the gravitational well of high-escape velocity objects, and deposits kinetic energy after becoming captured by the object, thereby increasing its temperature. We show that dark kinetic heating can be significant even in objects with low-escape velocities, such as exoplanets and brown dwarfs, increasing the discovery potential of such searches. This can occur if there is a long-range dark force, creating a "dark escape velocity", leading to heating rates substantially larger than those expected from neutron stars. We consequently set constraints on dark sector parameters using Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer and JWST data on Super-Jupiter WISE 0855-0714, and map out future sensitivity to the dark matter scattering cross section below $10^{-40}~{\rm cm}^2$. We compare dark kinetic heating rates of other lower escape velocity objects such as the Earth, Sun, and white dwarfs, finding complementary kinetic heating signals are possible depending on particle physics parameters.</description>

      <title>The Implications of Thermal Hydrodynamic Atmospheric Escape on the TRAPPIST-1 Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST observations of the 7-planet TRAPPIST-1 system will provide an excellent opportunity to test outcomes of stellar-driven evolution of terrestrial planetary atmospheres, including atmospheric escape, ocean loss and abiotic oxygen production. While most previous studies use a single luminosity evolution for the host star, we incorporate observational uncertainties in stellar mass, luminosity evolution, system age, and planetary parameters to statistically explore the plausible range of planetary atmospheric escape outcomes. We present probabilistic distributions of total water loss and oxygen production as a function of initial water content, for planets with initially pure water atmospheres and no interior-atmosphere exchange. We find that the interior planets are desiccated for initial water contents below 50 Earth oceans. For TRAPPIST-1e, f, g, and h, we report maximum water loss ranges of 8.0$^{+1.3}_{-0.9}$, 4.8$^{+0.6}_{-0.4}$, 3.4$^{+0.3}_{-0.3}$, and 0.8$^{+0.2}_{-0.1}$ Earth oceans, respectively, with corresponding maximum oxygen retention of 1290$^{+75}_{-75}$, 800$^{+40}_{-40}$, 560$^{+30}_{-25}$, and 90$^{+10}_{-10}$ bars. We explore statistical constraints on initial water content imposed by current water content, which could inform evolutionary history and planet formation. If TRAPPIST-1b is airless while TRAPPIST-1c possesses a tenuous oxygen atmosphere, as initial JWST observations suggest, then our models predict an initial surface water content of 8.2$^{+1.5}_{-1.0}$ Earth oceans for these worlds, leading to the outer planets retaining $&gt;$1.5 Earth oceans after entering the habitable zone. Even if TRAPPIST-1c is airless, surface water on the outer planets would not be precluded.</description>

      <title>Exomoons &amp; Exorings with the Habitable Worlds Observatory I: On the Detection of Earth-Moon Analog Shadows &amp; Eclipses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The highest priority recommendation of the Astro2020 Decadal Survey for space-based astronomy was the construction of an observatory capable of characterizing habitable worlds. In this paper series we explore the detectability of and interference from exomoons and exorings serendipitously observed with the proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) as it seeks to characterize exoplanets, starting in this manuscript with Earth-Moon analog mutual events. Unlike transits, which only occur in systems viewed near edge-on, shadow (i.e., solar eclipse) and lunar eclipse mutual events occur in almost every star-planet-moon system. The cadence of these events can vary widely from ~yearly to multiple events per day, as was the case in our younger Earth-Moon system. Leveraging previous space-based (EPOXI) lightcurves of a Moon transit and performance predictions from the LUVOIR-B concept, we derive the detectability of Moon analogs with HWO. We determine that Earth-Moon analogs are detectable with observation of ~2-20 mutual events for systems within 10pc, and larger moons should remain detectable out to 20pc. We explore the extent to which exomoon mutual events can mimic planet features and weather. We find that HWO wavelength coverage in the near-IR, specifically in the 1.4 micron water band where large moons can outshine their host planet, will aid in differentiating exomoon signals from exoplanet variability. Finally, we predict that exomoons formed through collision processes akin to our Moon are more likely to be detected in younger systems, where shorter orbital periods and favorable geometry enhance the probability and frequency of mutual events.</description>

      <title>Observations of Titan's Stratosphere During Northern Summer: Temperatures, CH3CN and CH3D Abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Titan's atmospheric composition and dynamical state have previously been studied over numerous epochs by both ground- and space-based facilities. However, stratospheric measurements remain sparse during Titan's northern summer and fall. The lack of seasonal symmetry in observations of Titan's temperature field and chemical abundances raises questions about the nature of the middle atmosphere's meridional circulation and evolution over Titan's 29-yr seasonal cycle that can only be answered through long-term monitoring campaigns. Here, we present maps of Titan's stratospheric temperature, acetonitrile (or methyl cyanide; CH$_3$CN), and monodeuterated methane (CH$_3$D) abundances following Titan's northern summer solstice obtained with Band 9 ($\sim0.43$ mm) ALMA observations. We find that increasing temperatures towards high-southern latitudes, currently in winter, resemble those observed during Titan's northern winter by the Cassini mission. Acetonitrile abundances have changed significantly since previous (sub)millimeter observations, and we find that the species is now highly concentrated at high-southern latitudes. The stratospheric CH$_3$D content is found to range between 4-8 ppm in these observations, and we infer the CH$_4$ abundance to vary between $\sim0.9-1.6\%$ through conversion with previously measured D/H values. A global value of CH$_4=1.15\%$ was retrieved, lending further evidence to the temporal and spatial variability of Titan's stratospheric methane when compared with previous measurements. Additional observations are required to determine the cause and magnitude of stratospheric enhancements in methane during these poorly understood seasons on Titan.</description>

      <title>MARTIANS (MARs2020, TIANwen and So on) would see more potentially hazardous asteroids than Earthlings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs) are a special subset of Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) that can come close to the Earth and are large enough to cause significant damage in the event of an impact. Observations and researches of Earth-PHAs have been underway for decades. Here, we extend the concept of PHAs to Mars and study the feasibility of detecting Mars-PHAs in the near future. We focus on PHAs that truly undergo close approaches with a planet (dubbed CAPHAs) and aim to compare the actual quantities of Earth-CAPHAs and Mars-CAPHAs by conducting numerical simulations incorporating the Yarkovsky effect, based on observed data of the main asteroid belt. The estimated number of Earth-CAPHAs and Mars-CAPHAs are 4675 and 16910, respectively. The occurrence frequency of Mars-CAPHAs is about 52 per year, which is 2.6 times that of Earth-CAPHAs, indicating significant potential for future Mars-based observations. Furthermore, a few Mars-CAPHAs are predicted to be observable even from Earth around the time of next Mars opposition in 2025.</description>

      <title>Information content of JWST spectra of WASP-39b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WASP-39b was observed using several different JWST instrument modes and the spectra were published in a series of papers by the ERS team. The current study examines the information content of these spectra measured using the different instrument modes, focusing on the complexity of the temperature-pressure profiles and number of chemical species warranted by the data. We examine if H2O, CO, CO2, K, H2S, CH4, and SO2 are detected in each of the instrument modes. Two Bayesian inference methods are used to perform atmospheric retrievals: standard nested sampling and supervised machine learning of the random forest (trained on a model grid). For nested sampling, Bayesian model comparison is used as a guide to identify the set of models with the required complexity to explain the data. Generally, non-isothermal transit chords are needed to fit the transmission spectra of WASP-39b, although the complexity of the Tp-profile required is mode-dependent. The minimal set of chemical species needed to fit a spectrum is mode-dependent as well, and also depends on whether grey or non-grey clouds are assumed. When a non-grey cloud model is used to fit the G395H spectrum, it generates a spectral continuum that compensates for the H2O opacity. The same compensation is absent when fitting the non-grey cloud model to the PRISM spectrum (which has broader wavelength coverage), suggesting that it is spurious. The interplay between the cloud spectral continuum and the H2O opacity determines if SO2 is needed to fit either spectrum. The inferred elemental abundances of carbon and oxygen and the carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratios are all mode- and model-dependent, and should be interpreted with caution. Bayesian model comparison does not always offer a clear path forward for favouring specific retrieval models (e.g. grey versus non-grey clouds) and thus for enabling unambiguous interpretations of exoplanet spectra.</description>

      <title>Spectro-photometry of Phobos simulants: I. Detectability of hydrated minerals and organic bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous observations of Phobos and Deimos, the moons of Mars, have improved our understanding of these small bodies. However, their formation and composition remain poorly constrained. Physical and spectral properties suggest that Phobos may be a weakly thermal-altered captured asteroid but the dynamical properties of the martian system suggest a formation by giant collision similar to the Earth moon. In 2027, the JAXA's MMX mission aims to address these outstanding questions. We undertook measurements with a new simulant called OPPS (Observatory of Paris Phobos Simulant) which closely matches Phobos spectra in the visible to the mid-infrared range. The simulant was synthesized using a mixture of olivine, saponite, anthracite, and coal. Since observation geometry is a crucial aspect of planetary surface remote sensing exploration, we evaluated the parameters obtained by modeling the phase curves -- obtained through laboratory measurements -- of two different Phobos simulants (UTPS-TB and OPPS) using Hapke IMSA model. Our results show that the photometric properties of Phobos simulants are not fully consistent with those of Tagish Lake, Allende, or the NWA 4766 shergottite. We also investigated the detection of volatiles/organic compounds and hydrated minerals, as the presence of such components is expected on Phobos in the hypothesis of a captured primitive asteroid. The results indicate that a significant amount of organic compounds is required for the detection of C-H bands at 3.4 $\mu$m. In contrast, the 2.7 $\mu$m absorption band, due to hydrated minerals, is much deeper and easier to detect than C-H organic features at the same concentration levels. Posing limits on detectability of some possible key components of Phobos surface will be pivotal to prepare and interpret future observations of the MIRS spectrometer onboard MMX mission.</description>

      <title>Statistical Equivalence of Metrics for Meteor Dynamical Association</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We statistically evaluate and compare four orbital similarity criteria within five-dimensional parameter space ($D_{SH}$, $D_D$, $D_H$, and $\varrho_2$) to study dynamical associations using the already classified meteors (manually by a human) in CAMS database as a benchmark. In addition, we assess various distance metrics typically used in Machine Learning with two different vectors: ORBIT, grounded in heliocentric orbital elements, and GEO, predicated on geocentric observational parameters. Additionally, we compute the optimal cut-offs for all methods for distinguishing sporadic background events. Our findings demonstrate the superior performance of the sEuclidean metric in conjunction with the GEO vector. Within the scope of D-criteria, $D_{SH}$ emerged as the preeminent metric, closely followed by $\varrho_2$. $\varrho_2$ stands out as the most equivalence to the distance metrics when utilizing the GEO vector and the most compatible with GEO and ORBIT simultaneously, whereas $D_D$ aligns more closely when using the ORBIT vector. The stark contrast in $D_D$'s behavior compared to other D-criteria highlights potential inequivalence. Geocentric features provide a more robust basis than orbital elements for meteor dynamical association. Most distance metrics associated with the GEO vector surpass the D-criteria when differentiating the meteoroid background. Accuracy displayed a dependence on solar longitude with a pronounced decrease around 180$^\circ$ matching an apparent increase in the meteoroid background activity, tentatively associated with the transition from the Perseids to the Orionids. Considering lately identified meteor showers, $\sim$27\% of meteors in CAMS would have different associations. This work unveils that Machine Learning distance metrics can rival or even exceed the performance of tailored orbital similarity criteria for meteor dynamical association.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate a minimalist model capable of accurately replicating the forced librations of an icy moon with a subsurface ocean. The model holds potential to predict the presence of a subsurface ocean through analysis of longitudinal librations. We demonstrate that a two-layered model, with a prestressed icy crust and a fixed mantle cavity, can effectively model the librational behavior of icy moons. The proposed model is applied to model the longitudinal libration of Enceladus and Mimas, two medium-sized icy moons of Saturn.</description>

      <title>Three-temperature radiation hydrodynamics with PLUTO: Thermal and kinematic signatures of accreting protoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In circumstellar disks around young stars, the gravitational influence of nascent planets produces telltale patterns in density, temperature, and kinematics. To better understand these signatures, we first performed 3D hydrodynamical simulations of a 0.012 $M_{\odot}$ disk, with a Saturn-mass planet orbiting circularly in-plane at 40 au. We tested four different disk thermodynamic prescriptions (in increasing order of complexity, local isothermality, $\beta$-cooling, two-temperature radiation hydrodynamics, and three-temperature radiation hydrodynamics), finding that $\beta$-cooling offers a reasonable approximation for the three-temperature approach when the planet is not massive or luminous enough to substantially alter the background temperature and density structure. Thereafter, using the three-temperature scheme, we relaxed this assumption, simulating a range of different planet masses (Neptune-mass, Saturn-mass, Jupiter-mass) and accretion luminosities (0, $10^{-3} L_{\odot}$) in the same disk. Our investigation revealed that signatures of disk-planet interaction strengthen with increasing planet mass, with circumplanetary flows becoming prominent in the high-planet-mass regime. Accretion luminosity, which adds pressure support around the planet, was found to weaken the midplane Doppler-flip, potentially visible in optically thin tracers like C$^{18}$O, while strengthening the spiral signature, particularly in upper disk layers sensitive to thicker lines, like those of $^{12}$CO.</description>

      <title>Impact of Planetary Parameters on Water Clouds Microphysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Potentially habitable exoplanets are targets of great interest for the James Webb Space Telescope and upcoming mission concepts such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory. Clouds strongly affect climate and habitability, but predicting their properties is difficult. In Global Climate Models (GCMs), especially those aiming at simulating Earth, cloud microphysics is often crudely approximated by assuming that all cloud particles have a single, constant size or a prescribed size distribution and that all clouds in a grid cell are identical. For exoplanets that range over a large phase space of planetary properties, this method could result in large errors. In this work, our goal is to determine how cloud microphysics on terrestrial exoplanets, whose condensable is mainly water vapor, depend on aerosol properties and planetary parameters such as surface pressure, surface gravity, and incident stellar radiation. We use the Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres as a 1D microphysical model to simulate the formation and evolution of clouds including the processes of nucleation, condensation, evaporation, coagulation, and vertical transfer. In these 1D idealized experiments, we find that the parameters that determine the macrophysical thermal structure of the atmospheres, including surface pressure and stellar flux, impact cloud radiative effect (CRE) most significantly. Parameters such as gravity and number density of aerosols working as cloud condensation nuclei affect the microphysical processes of cloud formation, including activation and vertical transfer. They also have a significant, though weaker effect on CRE. This work motivates the development of more accurate GCM cloud schemes and should aid in the interpretation of future observations.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Space Weather Events through Analysis of Active Region Magnetograms using Convolutional Neural Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although space weather events may not directly affect human life, they have the potential to inflict significant harm upon our communities. Harmful space weather events can trigger atmospheric changes that result in physical and economic damages on a global scale. In 1989, Earth experienced the effects of a powerful geomagnetic storm that caused satellites to malfunction, while triggering power blackouts in Canada, along with electricity disturbances in the United States and Europe. With the solar cycle peak rapidly approaching, there is an ever-increasing need to prepare and prevent the damages that can occur, especially to modern-day technology, calling for the need of a comprehensive prediction system. This study aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict instances of space weather (solar flares, coronal mass ejections, geomagnetic storms), based on active region magnetograms of the Sun. This was done through the use of the NASA DONKI service to determine when these solar events occur, then using data from the NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory to compile a dataset that includes magnetograms of active regions of the Sun 24 hours before the events. By inputting the magnetograms into a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained from this dataset, it can serve to predict whether a space weather event will occur, and what type of event it will be. The model was designed using a custom architecture CNN, and returned an accuracy of 90.27%, a precision of 85.83%, a recall of 91.78%, and an average F1 score of 92.14% across each class (Solar flare [Flare], geomagnetic storm [GMS], coronal mass ejection [CME]). Our results show that using magnetogram data as an input for a CNN is a viable method to space weather prediction. Future work can involve prediction of the magnitude of solar events.</description>

      <title>Stellar X-ray activity and habitability revealed by ROSAT sky survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the homogeneous X-ray catalog from ROSAT observations, we conducted a comprehensive investigation into stellar X-ray activity-rotation relations for both single and binary stars. Generally, the relation for single stars consists of two distinct regions: a weak decay region, indicating a continued dependence of the magnetic dynamo on stellar rotation rather than a saturation regime with constant activity, and a rapid decay region, where X-ray activity is strongly correlated with the Rossby number. Detailed analysis reveals more fine structures within the relation: in the extremely fast rotating regime, a decrease in X-ray activity was observed with increasing rotation rate, referred to as super-saturation, while in the extremely slow rotating region, the relation flattens, mainly due to the scattering of F stars. This scattering may result from intrinsic variability in stellar activities over one stellar cycle or the presence of different dynamo mechanisms. Binaries exhibit a similar relation to that of single stars while the limited sample size prevented the identification of fine structures in the relation for binaries. We calculated the mass loss rates of planetary atmosphere triggered by X-ray emissions from host stars. Our findings indicate that for an Earth-like planet within the stellar habitable zone, it would easily lose its entire primordial H/He envelope (equating to about 1% of the planetary mass).</description>

      <title>FlexKalmanNet: A Modular AI-Enhanced Kalman Filter Framework Applied to Spacecraft Motion Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The estimation of relative motion between spacecraft increasingly relies on feature-matching computer vision, which feeds data into a recursive filtering algorithm. Kalman filters, although efficient in noise compensation, demand extensive tuning of system and noise models. This paper introduces FlexKalmanNet, a novel modular framework that bridges this gap by integrating a deep fully connected neural network with Kalman filter-based motion estimation algorithms. FlexKalmanNet's core innovation is its ability to learn any Kalman filter parameter directly from measurement data, coupled with the flexibility to utilize various Kalman filter variants. This is achieved through a notable design decision to outsource the sequential computation from the neural network to the Kalman filter variant, enabling a purely feedforward neural network architecture. This architecture, proficient at handling complex, nonlinear features without the dependency on recurrent network modules, captures global data patterns more effectively. Empirical evaluation using data from NASA's Astrobee simulation environment focuses on learning unknown parameters of an Extended Kalman filter for spacecraft pose and twist estimation. The results demonstrate FlexKalmanNet's rapid training convergence, high accuracy, and superior performance against manually tuned Extended Kalman filters.</description>

      <title>Ephemeris Matching Reveals False Positive Validated and Candidate Planets from the K2 Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data from the Kepler space telescope have led to the discovery of thousands of planet candidates. Most of these candidates are likely to be real exoplanets, but a significant number of false positives still contaminate the sample, especially in candidate lists from the K2 mission. Identifying and rejecting the false positives lurking in the planet candidates sample is important for prioritizing follow-up resources and measuring the most accurate population statistics. Here, we identify false positives in the K2 planet candidate sample using a technique called "ephemeris matching," in which we compare the period and transit time of different signals. When signals from different stars show the same period and time of transit, we can conclude that at least one of the two signals is contamination. We identify 43 false positives among published K2 planet candidates (nearly 2% of the complete list), one of which (K2-256 b) was previously validated as genuine exoplanet. This work increases the reliability of the K2 planet sample and helps boost confidence in the surviving planet candidates.</description>

      <title>Constraints on PDS 70 b and c from the dust continuum emission of the circumplanetary discs considering in situ dust evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The young T Tauri star PDS 70 has two gas accreting planets sharing one large gap in a pre-transitional disc. Dust continuum emission from PDS 70 c has been detected by Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 7, considered as the evidence of a circumplanetary disc, but the emission from PDS 70 b has not. We constrain the planet mass and the gas accretion rate of the planets by introducing a model of dust evolution in the CPDs and reproducing the detection and non-detection. We first develop a 1D steady gas disc model of the CPDs reflecting the planet properties. We then calculate the radial distribution of the dust profiles considering the dust evolution in the gas disc and calculate the total flux density of dust thermal emission from the CPDs. We find positive correlations between the flux density and three planet properties, the planet mass, gas accretion rate, and their product called "MMdot". We then find that the MMdot of PDS 70 c is larger than 0.4 MJ^2/Myr, and the planet mass and the gas accretion rate are larger than 5MJ and 0.02 MJ/Myr, respectively. This is the first case to succeed in obtaining constraints on planet properties from the flux density of dust continuum from a CPD. We also find some loose constraints on the properties of PDS 70 b from the non-detection. We propose possible scenarios for the planets explaining the non-detection respectively detection of the dust emission. The first explanation is that planet c has larger planet mass and/or larger gas accretion rate than planet b. The other possibility is that the CPD of planet c has a larger amount of dust supply and/or weaker turbulence than that of planet b. If the dust supply to planet c is larger than b due to its closeness to the outer dust ring, it is also quantitatively consistent with that planet c has weaker H-alpha line emission than planet b considering the dust extinction effect.</description>

      <title>Speed of sound in methane under conditions of planetary interiors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present direct observations of acoustic waves in warm dense matter. We analyze wave-number- and energy-resolved x-ray spectra taken from warm dense methane created by laser heating a cryogenic liquid jet. X-ray diffraction and inelastic free-electron scattering yield sample conditions of 0.3$\pm$0.1 eV and 0.8$\pm$0.1 g/cm$^3$, corresponding to a pressure of $\sim$13 GPa. Inelastic x-ray scattering was used to observe the collective oscillations of the ions. With a highly improved energy resolution of $\sim$50 meV, we could clearly distinguish the Brillouin peaks from the quasielastic Rayleigh feature. Data at different wave numbers were utilized to derive a sound speed of 5.9$\pm$0.5 km/s, marking a high-temperature data point for methane and demonstrating consistency with Birch's law in this parameter regime.</description>

      <title>The Basic Iterative Deconvolution: A fast instrumental point-spread function deconvolution method that corrects for light that is scattered out of the field of view of a detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11784v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A point-spread function describes the optics of an imaging system and can be used to correct collected images for instrumental effects. The state of the art for deconvolving images with the point-spread function is the Richardson-Lucy algorithm; however, despite its high fidelity, it is slow and cannot account for light scattered out of the field of view of the detector. We reinstate the Basic Iterative Deconvolution (BID) algorithm, a deconvolution algorithm that considers photons scattered out of the field of view of the detector, and extend it for image subregion deconvolutions. Its runtime is 1.8 to 7.1 faster than the Richardson-Lucy algorithm for 4096 x 4096 pixels images and up to an additional factor of 150 for subregions of 250 x 250 pixels. We test the extended BID algorithm for solar images taken by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), and find that the deviations between the reconstructed intensities of BID and the Richardson-Lucy algorithm are smaller than 1%.</description>
