      <title>The JWST/NIRISS Deep Spectroscopic Survey for Young Brown Dwarfs and Free-Floating Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery and characterization of free-floating planetary-mass objects (FFPMOs) is fundamental to our understanding of star and planet formation. Here we report results from an extremely deep spectroscopic survey of the young star cluster NGC1333 using NIRISS WFSS on the James Webb Space Telescope. The survey is photometrically complete to K~21, and includes useful spectra for objects as faint as K~20.5. The observations cover 19 known brown dwarfs, for most of which we confirm spectral types using NIRISS spectra. We discover six new candidates with L-dwarf spectral types that are plausible planetary-mass members of NGC1333, with estimated masses between 5-15 MJup. One, at ~5 MJup, shows clear infrared excess emission and is a good candidate to be the lowest mass object known to have a disk. We do not find any objects later than mid-L spectral type (M &lt; ~4 MJup). The paucity of Jupiter-mass objects, despite the survey's unprecedented sensitivity, suggests that our observations reach the lowest mass objects formed like stars in NGC1333. Our findings put the fraction of FFPMOs in NGC1333 at ~10% of the number of cluster members, significantly more than expected from the typical log-normal stellar mass function. We also search for wide binaries in our images and report a young brown dwarf with a planetary-mass companion.</description>

      <title>Gas permeability and mechanical properties of dust grain aggregates at hyper- and zero-gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle-particle and particle-gas processes significantly impact planetary precursors such as dust aggregates and planetesimals. We investigate gas permeability ($\kappa$) in 12 granular samples, mimicking planetesimal dust regoliths. Using parabolic flights, this study assesses how gravitational compression -- and lack thereof -- influences gas permeation, impacting the equilibrium state of low-gravity objects. Transitioning between micro- and hyper-gravity induces granular sedimentation dynamics, revealing collective dust-grain aerodynamics. Our experiments measure $\kappa$ across Knudsen number (Kn) ranges, reflecting transitional flow. Using mass and momentum conservation, we derive $\kappa$ and calculate pressure gradients within the granular matrix. Key findings: 1. As confinement pressure increases with gravitational load and mass flow, $\kappa$ and average pore space decrease. This implies that a planetesimal's unique dust-compaction history limits sub-surface volatile outflows. 2. The derived pressure gradient enables tensile strength determination for asteroid regolith simulants with cohesion. This offers a unique approach to studying dust-layer properties when suspended in confinement pressures comparable to the equilibrium state on planetesimals surfaces, which will be valuable for modelling their collisional evolution. 3. We observe a dynamical flow symmetry breaking when granular material moves against the pressure gradient. This occurs even at low Reynolds numbers, suggesting that Stokes numbers for drifting dust aggregates near the Stokes-Epstein transition require a drag force modification based on permeability.</description>

      <title>Lunar response to gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been suggested to use seismic detectors on the Moon as a tool to search for gravitational waves in an intermediate frequency range between mHz and Hz. Employing three different spherically symmetric models for the lunar interior, we investigate the response of the Moon to gravitational waves in Einstein and Jordan-Brans-Dicke gravity. We find that the first eigenfrequencies of the different models depend only weakly on the model details, with the fundamental frequency $\nu_1$ close to 1\,ms both for spheroidal and toroidal oscillations. In contrast, the resulting displacement varies up to a factor two, being in the range $(2.7-5.6)\times 10^{11}/h_0$ cm for spheroidal oscillations with amplitude $h_0$. Toroidal oscillations are suppressed by a factor $2\pi\nu R/c$, both in Einstein gravity and in general scalar-tensor theories.</description>

      <title>On the Age and Metallicity of Planet-hosting Triple Star Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a statistical analysis of the ages and metallicities of triple stellar systems that are known to host exoplanets. With controversial cases disregarded, so far 27 of those systems have been identified. Our analysis, based on an exploratory approach, shows that those systems are on average notably younger than stars situated in the solar neighborhood. Though the statistical significance of this result is not fully established, the most plausible explanation is a possible double selection effect due to the relatively high mass of planet-hosting stars of those systems (which spend less time on the main-sequence than low-mass stars) and that planets in triple stellar systems may be long-term orbitally unstable. The stellar metallicities are on average solar-like; however, owing to the limited number of data, this result is not inconsistent with the previous finding that stars with planets tend to be metal-rich as the deduced metallicity distribution is relatively broad.</description>
