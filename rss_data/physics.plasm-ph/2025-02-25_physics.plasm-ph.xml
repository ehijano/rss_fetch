      <title>Electric Power Enhancement using Spin-Polarized Fuel in Fusion Power Plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a range of fusion power plant (FPP) concepts, we demonstrate that spin-polarized fuel (SPF) can significantly enhance net electric power output, often by many multiples. Notably, the electric power gain from SPF generally exceeds the corresponding increase in thermal fusion power. Plants close to engineering breakeven stand to benefit most, where even modest boosts in fusion power produce disproportionately larger gains in net electricity. As a representative example, a 25% increase in fusion power via SPF could allow an ITER-like device (with an added turbine to recover thermal fusion power) to achieve engineering breakeven. These findings strongly motivate the development of spin-polarized fuel for FPPs.</description>

      <title>First observation of shock waves induced by laser-accelerated proton beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate, for the first time, that laser-accelerated protons can induce shock waves in materials. The ultra-short pulse width of laser-driven protons enables them to deposit energy instantaneously, leading to an intense thermodynamic effect that heats and pressurizes materials violently, thereby generating shock waves. In contrast, laser-accelerated electrons do not possess this capability. Our simulations and experiments reveal that the flow intensity of the proton beam, which includes information on both the proton number and pulse width, directly correlates with shock waves. This finding not only provides a new method for characterizing the high flow intensity of laser-driven protons but also expands their applications in studying extreme states of matter.</description>

      <title>Discharge structure hierarchy of highly electronegative plasma and the implication on nuclear fusion at low pressure and quasi-cold ions approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the discharge structure of an Ar/SF6 inductively coupled plasma (ICP) at the low pressure, 10 mTorr, is investigated by the fluid simulation at the quasi-cold ions approximation, i.e., room temperature. The structure is found to be hierarchal and in this simulated hierarchy, the stratification, the parabola profile in the stratified core, the double layer, and the coagulated profile in the core center are examined. This fluid simulation version and a quasi-fluid simulation of an Ar/CF4 ICP given by the HPEM code, cooperatively enlighten the discharge structure of highly electronegative ICPs and meanwhile suggest the potential applications of them. It is found that when the ions are cold the hierarchy is predicted and when the ions are thermalized the simple discharge structure appears. In the simulated hierarchy, the double layer formed at the interface of halo and core is given by the ionic and acoustic vibrations. The simulated cations flux and potential at the two sides of the double layer are double-valued and the simulated double layer is modelled as the dipole microscopically and as the capacitor macroscopically. The evolution of discharge structure hierarchy is presented, in which the harmony among many processes in the hierarchy are achieved and the charm of self-coagulation is exhibited, i.e., the bigger is the coagulated volume, the denser is the coagulated mass. This provides insights for creating possibly the free nuclear fusion by means of self-coagulation, and this type of nuclear fusion without the inertial and magnetic constrictions is achieved by means of the compressible heating scheme. The self-coagulation helps people re-recognize the anions Boltzmann balance, and meanwhile it turns the discharging and collisional plasmas into the collisionless and astrophysical plasmas, in which the double layer and ionization instability occur.</description>

      <title>Boltzsim: A fast solver for the 1D-space electron Boltzmann equation with applications to radio-frequency glow discharge plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for solving the one-dimensional space collisional Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) for electrons in low-temperature plasmas (LTPs). Modeling LTPs is useful in many applications, including advanced manufacturing, material processing, and hypersonic flows, to name a few. The proposed BTE solver is based on an Eulerian formulation. It uses Chebyshev collocation method in physical space and a combination of Galerkin and discrete ordinates in velocity space. We present self-convergence results and cross-code verification studies compared to an in-house particle-in-cell (PIC) direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) code. Boltzsim is our open source implementation of the solver. Furthermore, we use Boltzsim to simulate radio-frequency glow discharge plasmas (RF-GDPs) and compare with an existing methodology that approximates the electron BTE. We compare these two approaches and quantify their differences as a function of the discharge pressure. The two approaches show an 80x, 3x, 1.6x, and 0.98x difference between cycle-averaged time periodic electron number density profiles at 0.1 Torr, 0.5 Torr, 1 Torr, and 2 Torr discharge pressures, respectively. As expected, these differences are significant at low pressures, for example less than 1 Torr.</description>

      <title>Electron-scale Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in magnetized shear flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron-scale Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities (ESKHI) are found in several astrophysical scenarios. Naturally ESKHI is subject to a background magnetic field, but an analytical dispersion relation and an accurate growth rate of ESKHI under this circumstance are long absent, as former MHD derivations are not applicable in the relativistic regime. We present a generalized dispersion relation of ESKHI in relativistic magnetized shear flows, with few assumptions. ESKHI linear growth rates in certain cases are numerically calculated. We conclude that the presence of an external magnetic field decreases the maximum instability growth rate in most cases, but can slightly increase it when the shear velocity is sufficiently high. Also, the external magnetic field results in a larger cutoff wavenumber of the unstable band and increases the wavenumber of the most unstable mode. PIC simulations are carried out to verify our conclusions, where we also observe the suppressing of kinetic DC magnetic field generation, resulting from electron gyration induced by the external magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Quenching Rates of N$_2$(C$^3\Pi_u$ , $\nu$ = 0-4) States by O$_2$, N$_2$, H$_2$, CO$_2$ and CH$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents the development of a protocol for the measurement of collisional deexcitation rate constants of N$_2$(C$^3\Pi_u$ , $\nu$ = 0-4) States by O$_2$, N$_2$, H$_2$, CO$_2$ and CH$_4$. Excited nitrogen is produced using nanosecond repetitively pulsed  discharges. The applied voltage and the repetition frequencies are adjusted to minimize rotational and gas heating while keeping high electronic and vibrational excitation levels. The populations of the vibrational levels are measured using optical emission spectroscopy of the N$_2$(C $\to$ B,$\Delta_\nu=0$) vibrational bands. Rate coefficients for each vibrational level are then determined from the measured lifetimes. The results are compared to the available literature and new values are provided for the missing vibrational levels.</description>

      <title>The Energy Cascade Rate in Supersonic Magnetohydrodynamic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional direct numerical simulations (DNS) are implemented to investigate the energy cascade rate in compressible isothermal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. Utilizing an exact law derived from the K\'arm\'an-Howarth equation, we examine the contributions of flux and non-flux terms to the cascade rate across a broad range of sonic and Alfv\'enic Mach numbers, from subsonic to supersonic regimes and varying mean magnetic fields. Cascade rates are computed using on-grid 3-D decomposition and two plasma increment approaches: signed and absolute values. Anisotropy induced by strong magnetic fields is analyzed through angular-dependent scaling of the cascade terms. Moreover, the increment calculation method significantly influences the relative contributions of flux and non-flux terms, with absolute methods tending to overestimate the latter. These findings extend current studies of compressible turbulence and offer critical insights into energy transfer mechanisms relevant to many astrophysical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Data efficiency and long-term prediction capabilities for neural operator surrogate models of edge plasma simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modelling of plasma dynamics is fundamental to ensure appropriate diverter and core performance, and is desirable for both interpreting the current generation of experiments and informing the next generation devices like ITER \cite{Loarte2007Chapter4P,Eich2013ScalingOT}. Yet the computational expense of many plasma simulations makes them unsuitable for real-time applications or iterative design workflows. Neural operator surrogate models of JOREK \cite{Hoelzl_2021} and STORM \cite{Walkden2016-ys} are evaluated, investigating their capability to replicate plasma dynamics accurately whilst reducing computational cost. It is found that the accuracy of the surrogate models will degrade for long term predictions, and that physics considerations are important in assessing the performance of the surrogates. Surrogates trained on one dataset can be effectively fine tuned with only a few simulations from a target domain. This is particularly effective where the source domain is a low fidelity physics model and the target domain is a high fidelity model, with an order of magnitude improvement in performance for a small dataset and a short rollout.</description>

      <title>Robust Confinement State Classification with Uncertainty Quantification through Ensembled Data-Driven Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximizing fusion performance in tokamaks relies on high energy confinement, often achieved through distinct operating regimes. The automated labeling of these confinement states is crucial to enable large-scale analyses or for real-time control applications. While this task becomes difficult to automate near state transitions or in marginal scenarios, much success has been achieved with data-driven models. However, these methods generally provide predictions as point estimates, and cannot adequately deal with missing and/or broken input signals. To enable wide-range applicability, we develop methods for confinement state classification with uncertainty quantification and model robustness. We focus on off-line analysis for TCV discharges, distinguishing L-mode, H-mode, and an in-between dithering phase (D). We propose ensembling data-driven methods on two axes: model formulations and feature sets. The former considers a dynamic formulation based on a recurrent Fourier Neural Operator-architecture and a static formulation based on gradient-boosted decision trees. These models are trained using multiple feature groupings categorized by diagnostic system or physical quantity. A dataset of 302 TCV discharges is fully labeled, and will be publicly released. We evaluate our method quantitatively using Cohen's kappa coefficient for predictive performance and the Expected Calibration Error for the uncertainty calibration. Furthermore, we discuss performance using a variety of common and alternative scenarios, the performance of individual components, out-of-distribution performance, cases of broken or missing signals, and evaluate conditionally-averaged behavior around different state transitions. Overall, the proposed method can distinguish L, D and H-mode with high performance, can cope with missing or broken signals, and provides meaningful uncertainty estimates.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal optical vortex (STOV) polariton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17413v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We confirm the existence of the spatiotemporal optical vortex (STOV) polariton and the value of its tOAM, verifying our theory of transverse orbital angular momentum in a simple dispersive medium [S. W. Hancock et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 193901 (2021)]. We also develop a physical picture of the polariton as a structure driven by torques induced by the ponderomotive force of the light in the presence of material dispersion. This is a new type of spatiotemporal torque unanticipated in our recent work [S. W. Hancock et al., Phys. Rev. X 14, 011031 (2024)]. These results are accomplished by high resolution particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of STOV pulse reflection from and transmission through a fully ionized hydrogen plasma slab. The linear theory matches the PIC simulations up to near-critical plasma densities and near-relativistic field strengths. For higher intensities, optical tOAM becomes invested in collective modes of the plasma.</description>

      <title>Physics-consistent machine learning: output projection onto physical manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven machine learning models often require extensive datasets, which can be costly or inaccessible, and their predictions may fail to comply with established physical laws. Current approaches for incorporating physical priors mitigate these issues by penalizing deviations from known physical laws, as in physics-informed neural networks, or by designing architectures that automatically satisfy specific invariants. However, penalization approaches do not guarantee compliance with physical constraints for unseen inputs, and invariant-based methods lack flexibility and generality. We propose a novel physics-consistent machine learning method that directly enforces compliance with physical principles by projecting model outputs onto the manifold defined by these laws. This procedure ensures that predictions inherently adhere to the chosen physical constraints, improving reliability and interpretability. Our method is demonstrated on two systems: a spring-mass system and a low-temperature reactive plasma. Compared to purely data-driven models, our approach significantly reduces errors in physical law compliance, enhances predictive accuracy of physical quantities, and outperforms alternatives when working with simpler models or limited datasets. The proposed projection-based technique is versatile and can function independently or in conjunction with existing physics-informed neural networks, offering a powerful, general, and scalable solution for developing fast and reliable surrogate models of complex physical systems, particularly in resource-constrained scenarios.</description>

      <title>Exact Nonlinear Decomposition of Ideal-MHD Waves Using Eigenenergies III: Gravity, Generalized Inhomogeneous Quasi-linear PDEs, Mode Conversion, and Numerical Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise tracking and measurement of the energy carried by the individual magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modes has important implications and utility in astrophysical and laboratory plasmas. Previously, this was only achievable in limited linear MHD cases in the $\beta \ll 1$ or $\beta \gg 1$ regimes. In a series of papers, of which this is the third, we introduced the Eigenenergy Decomposition Method (EEDM) and derived exact analytical expressions for the modal energy components--called eigenenergies--of nonlinear 3D disturbances governed by the homogeneous ideal-MHD equations. Here, we extend the method to inhomogeneous ideal-MHD by introducing a source term accounting for gravity, and provide detailed guidelines for applying the decomposition scheme to any general inhomogeneous quasi-linear PDEs that possess a globally conserved quantity, beyond the realm of MHD. Furthermore, we show that the eigenenergies can be used to locate and measure nonlinear mode conversions, which is an additional feature of the method. Finally, we provide well-categorized context for the application of the method to simulations and discuss the possible numerical inaccuracies that may inevitably arise due to discretization. This paper provides a more mature description of the method and its interpretation, and is recommended as the starting point for readers unfamiliar with the method.</description>

      <title>Arecibo Multi-frequency IPS Observations: Solar Wind Density Turbulence Scale Sizes and their Anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of interplanetary scintillation (IPS) observations conducted with the Arecibo 305-m radio telescope during the minimum phase at the end of solar cycle 24 and the onset of solar cycle 25. These observations span a broad frequency range of ~300 to 3100 MHz, encompassing the P-, L-, and S-bands, and covered heliocentric distances from ~5 to 200 solar radii. The dynamic spectrum of the scintillations obtained at L-band shows a systematic decrease in the scintillation index from the lowest to the highest frequency, offering valuable insight into the influence of the solar wind density microstructures responsible for scintillation. Analyses of the scintillation index ($m$) for multiple sources at L-band, along with near-simultaneous observations of selected sources covering the P-, L-, and S-bands, clearly demonstrate a wavelength dependence of $m \propto \lambda^\omega$, which inherently leads to a dependence of $m$ on the Fresnel scale, when considering the effective distance to the scattering screen, $z$. The index $\omega$ ranges between $\sim$1 and 1.8. The average $\omega$ value of a source, determined from observations made on different days, exhibits variability across sources. The results on the radial dependence of scintillation agree with earlier IPS measurements. The temporal power spectra obtained over the wide frequency range exhibit a power-level evolution in accordance with the wavelength dependence, and a broadening with increasing observation frequency. Furthermore, the increased temporal-frequency rounding of the `Fresnel knee' in the spectrum with the observing frequency suggests a novel phenomenon: an increase in anisotropy as the scale size of the density-turbulence structure decreases.</description>

Published analyses of the the NIF experiment have used finite-$T$ multi-atom density-functional theory (DFT) with Molecular dynamics (MD), and Path-Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations. These methods are very expensive to implement and often lack physical transparency. Here we (i) relate their results to simpler first-principles average-atom results, (ii) establish the feasibility of rapid data analysis, with good accuracy and gain in physical transparency, and (iii) show that the NIF experiment reveals high-$T$ spin-singlet pairing of hydrogen-like Be ions with near neighbours. Our analysis predicts such stabilization over a wide range of compressed densities for temperatures close to two million Kelvin. Calculations of structure factors $S(k)$ for electrons or ions, the Raleigh weight and other quantities of interest to X-ray Thomson scattering are presented. We find that the NIF data at the scattering wavevector $k_{sc}$ of 7.89 \AA$^{-1}$ are more consistent with a density of $20\pm2$ g/cm$^3$, mean ionization $\bar{Z}=$3.25, at a temperature of $\simeq$ 1,800,000 K than the 34 g/cm$^3, \bar{Z}=3.4$ proposed by the NIF team. The relevance of ion-electron coupled-modes in studying small $k_{sc}$ data is indicated.</description>

      <title>TRANSP integrated modeling code for interpretive and predictive analysis of tokamak plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive review of the TRANSP code, a sophisticated tool for interpretive and predictive analysis of tokamak plasmas, detailing its major capabilities and features. It describes the equations for particle, power, and momentum balance analysis, as well as the poloidal field diffusion equations. The paper outlines the spatial and time grids used in TRANSP and details the equilibrium assumptions and solvers. Various models for heating and current drive \mc{and radiation}, including updates to the NUBEAM model, are discussed. The handling of large-scale events such as sawtooth crashes and pellet injections is examined, along with the predictive capabilities for advancing plasma profiles. The integration of TRANSP with the ITER Integrated Modeling and Analysis Suite (IMAS) is highlighted, demonstrating enhanced data access and analysis capabilities. Additionally, the paper discusses best practices and continuous integration techniques to enhance TRANSP's robustness. The suite of TRANSP tools, designed for efficient data analysis and simulation, further supports the optimization of tokamak operations and coupling with other tokamak codes. Continuous development and support ensure that TRANSP remains a major code for the analysis of experimental data for controlled thermonuclear fusion, maintaining its critical role in supporting the optimization of tokamak operations and advancing fusion research.</description>

      <title>Control of Instability in a Vlasov-Poisson System Through an External Electric Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15008v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plasma instabilities are a major concern in plasma science, for applications ranging from particle accelerators to nuclear fusion reactors. In this work, we consider the possibility of controlling such instabilities by adding an external electric field to the Vlasov--Poisson equations. Our approach to determining the external electric field is based on conducting a linear analysis of the resulting equations. We show that it is possible to select external electric fields that completely suppress the plasma instabilities present in the system when the equilibrium distribution and the perturbation are known. In fact, the proposed strategy returns the plasma to its equilibrium with a rate that is faster than exponential in time. We further perform numerical simulations of the nonlinear two-stream and bump-on-tail instabilities to verify our theory and to compare the different strategies that we propose in this work.</description>

      <title>New axisymmetric equilibria with flow from an expansion about the generalized Solov'ev solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct analytic solutions to the generalized Grad-Shafranov equation, which incorporates both toroidal and poloidal flows. This is achieved by adopting a general linearizing ansatz for the free-function terms of the equation and expanding the generalized Solov'ev solution [Ch. Simintzis, G. N. Throumoulopoulos, G. Pantis and H. Tasso, Phys. Plasmas {\bf 8}, 2641 (2001)]. On the basis of these solutions, we examine how the genaralized Solov'ev configuration is modified as the values of the free parameters associated with the additional pressure, poloidal-current and electric-field terms are changed. Thus, a variety of equilibria of tokamak, spherical tokamak and spheromak pertinence are constructed, including D-shaped configurations with positive and negative triangularity and diverted configurations with either a couple of X-points or a single X-point.</description>

      <title>New Plasma Sheath Potential Solutions in Cylindrical and Spherical Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leading edges of hypersonic vehicles can reach temperatures greater than 2000 {\deg}C, and radii of curvature smaller than 1 cm, at which thermionic emission (also known as electron transpiration) can play a significant role in cooling the leading edge alongside other heat transfer modes such as convection and radiation. Existing theoretical analyses of thermionic cooling with space-charge effects at a leading edge are limited to one-dimensional (1D), analytical and numerical models that do not capture the influences of geometric curvature of the leading edge or temperature gradients along the leading edge. The key to understanding space-charge effects is development of the plasma sheath potential, and to that end we demonstrate a generalized methodology to calculate the sheath potential space in 1D Cartesian, cylindrical, and spherical coordinate systems. We accomplish this by extending Takamura's approach beyond the Cartesian system, and motivate sheath formation conditions for potential sheathes with and without a virtual cathode similar in nature to how Bohm originally presented his criterion of minimum Mach number for a valid 1D Cartesian sheath. By observing for what parameter inputs we satisfy the sheath formation conditions, we illustrate parameter spaces of minimum Mach number, potential derivative at the wall, and net current, for each coordinate system and for two different input work functions; we also show example potential spaces for each coordinate system. With our numerical approach, generalized to multiple coordinate systems, we enable computationally efficient and higher fidelity analysis of thermionic emission with space-charge effects for more realistic system geometries.</description>

      <title>Numerical Model of Thermionic- and Photo- emission Electron Heat Spreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermionic emission has been exploited to give rise to the theory of thermionic cooling also known as electron transpiration cooling, which can potentially serve as a powerful and engineerable cooling mode for hypersonic leading edges that can reach temperatures exceeding 2000 {\deg}C. However, the contribution to this cooling mode by photoexcited electrons remains relatively unexplored. Here, we present a numerical model of thermionic emission and photoemission driven cooling and heat spreading, examining the trajectories of electrons emitted based on a random energy model within a prescribed potential space. By simulating surfaces with two different temperature gradients, and imposing potential spaces derived for Cartesian, cylindrical, and spherical coordinate systems, we demonstrate that heat spreading can be significant for temperature gradients on a length scale comparable to the electron spreading distance. Additionally, by testing two different leading edge radii, we find that heat spreading affects a larger percentage of surface area for a smaller leading edge radius.</description>

      <title>Efficient micromirror confinement of sub-TeV cosmic rays in galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic rays (CRs) play a pivotal role in shaping the thermal and dynamical properties of astrophysical environments, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters. Recent observations suggest a stronger confinement of CRs in certain astrophysical systems than predicted by current CR-transport theories. Here, we show that the incorporation of microscale physics into CR-transport models can account for this enhanced CR confinement. We develop a theoretical description of the effect of magnetic microscale fluctuations originating from the mirror instability on macroscopic CR diffusion. We confirm our theory with large-dynamical-range simulations of CR transport in the intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters and kinetic simulations of CR transport in micromirror fields. We conclude that sub-TeV CR confinement in the ICM is far more effective than previously anticipated on the basis of Galactic-transport extrapolations. The transformative impact of micromirrors on CR diffusion provides insights into how microphysics can reciprocally affect macroscopic dynamics and observable structures across a range of astrophysical scales.</description>

      <title>What defines stationarity in space plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13168v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting from the concept of entropy defect in thermodynamics, we construct the entropy formulation of space plasmas, and then use it to develop a measure of their stationarity. In particular, we show that statistics of this entropy results in two findings that improve our understanding of stationary and nonstationary systems: (i) variations of the Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) entropy do not exceed twice the value of the thermodynamic kappa, the parameter that provides a measure of the entropy defect in both stationary and nonstationary states, while becomes the shape parameter that labels the kappa distributions in stationary states; and (ii) the ratio of the deviation of the BG entropy with kappa scales with the kappa deviation via a power-law, while the respective exponent provides a stationarity deviation index (SDI), which measures the natural tendency of the system to depart from stationarity. We confirm the validity of these findings in three different heliospheric plasma datasets observed from three missions: (1) A solar energetic particle event, recorded by the Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun instrument onboard Parker Solar Probe; (2) Near Earth solar wind protons recorded by the Solar Wind Experiment instrument onboard WIND; and (3) Plasma protons in the heliosheath, source of energetic neutral atoms recorded by IBEX. The full strength and capability of the entropic deviation ratio and SDI can now be used by the space physics community for analyzing and characterizing the stationarity of space plasmas, as well as other researchers for analyzing any other correlated systems.</description>
