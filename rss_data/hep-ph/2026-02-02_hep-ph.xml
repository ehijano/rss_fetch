      <title>Azimuthal angular entanglement between decaying particles in ultra-peripheral ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-peripheral collisions (UPCs) involving relativistic heavy ions are a unique laboratory to study quantum correlations. The intense electromagnetic fields generate high rates of photonuclear interactions, including events involving multiple photon exchange. Multiple photon exchange can result in the production of multiple vector mesons and/or nuclear excitations. These interactions share a common impact parameter, so the photons have the same linear polarization. The shared polarization entangles the particles, leading to unique quantum correlations. The decays of these vector excitations are sensitive to this polarization, allowing for the study of these correlations.
  This letter will compare classical and quantum calculations of the correlations between these azimuthal directions. The two approaches predict vert different angular correlations. The differences are akin to those seen with polarized photons in tests of Bells inequality. Uniquely, UPC photoproduction can produce final states containing three or more particles, all entangled with the same polarization. These more complex states exhibit additional unique phenomenology, allowing new tests of multi-particle entanglement.</description>

      <title>Axions on a Hyperbolic Ride: Geometric Suppression of CMB Isocurvature and a Blue-Tilted Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CMB limits on cold-dark-matter isocurvature are often interpreted as excluding the simultaneous realization of high-scale inflation and large QCD axion decay constants in pre-inflationary Peccei--Quinn (PQ) scenarios. We show that this conclusion can be evaded by exploiting \emph{field-space geometry}. For a minimal complex PQ scalar with a $U(1)$-symmetric potential and nonlinear sigma-model kinetic term $d\sigma^{2}=dR^{2}+f^{2}(R)\,d\theta^{2}$, a curved target-space metric endows the axion fluctuation with a time-dependent geometric mass during inflation, suppressing isocurvature without explicit PQ breaking and without extreme radial displacements. Specializing to a hyperbolic metric $f(R)=L\sinh(R/L)$ with curvature scale $L$, we find that for $R\gtrsim L$ the canonically normalized angular mode can be generically $\mathcal{O}(H_{\rm inf})$-heavy during radial slow-roll, dynamically damping CMB-scale fluctuations while producing a characteristic blue-tilted isocurvature spectrum. As a result, inflationary Hubble scales as large as $H_{\rm inf}\sim 10^{13}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ can be compatible with $f_a\sim 10^{14}$--$10^{16}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, reopening parameter space usually regarded as excluded. We present numerical benchmarks and a semi-analytic template that relates the scale-dependence of isocurvature to the geometric lever arm $R/L$, providing a direct phenomenological probe on PQ field-space geometry.</description>

      <title>Parton spin correlations and $\mathcal{CP}$ properties in Higgs boson decay at future lepton colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a phenomenological study of partonic spin correlations and $\mathcal{CP}$ properties in $H\to gg$ decay channel at future lepton colliders. We investigate two classes of observables: Lund observable defined based on subjets and four-point energy-energy correlator (E4C) between particles inside two jets. Our results show that the E4C with energy weighted to the power of \(n=4\) achieves the strongest sensitivity to the spin correlations of gluons from Higgs boson decay. Under the assumption of ideal identification of different gluon splitting modes, we estimate that future lepton colliders operating at \(\sqrt{s}=240~\mathrm{GeV}\) with an integrated luminosities of \(5.6~\mathrm{ab}^{-1}\) can successfully probe gluon spin correlations, while \(20~\mathrm{ab}^{-1}\) of data can probe the $\mathcal{CP}$-mixing angle in the \(Hgg\) coupling to \(\lesssim 0.03\pi\) using E4C. We outline strategies for extending this framework to realistic detector-level analyses, which can provide a new pathway for the precision test of Standard Model and searches for new physics.</description>

      <title>IceCube DeepCore's sensitivity to Non-Standard neutrino Interactions in the Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino oscillations continue to provide one of the most promising avenues for uncovering physics beyond the Standard Model. In particular, beyond-standard-model neutrino matter interactions may perturb neutrino oscillations in matter, leading to an observable signal in long baseline oscillation experiments. Moreover, such interactions can be a possible explanation of the rising tension between T2K and NOvA's $\delta_{\text{CP}}$ measurements. We examine IceCube DeepCore's sensitivity to these Non-Standard Interactions (NSI) by employing a model-independent NSI parameterization, and examine IceCube DeepCore's ability to comment on NSI being the cause of the T2K-NOvA $\delta_{\text{CP}}$ tension.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Stochastic Gravitational Waves signals from Wess-Zumino chiral superfield</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the possibility that supersymmetric structures may leave observable imprints in the stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background generated during the reheating era. To this end, we construct a phenomenological interaction vertex describing the coupling between a single inflaton and the D-term sectors of a pair of chiral and anti-chiral superfields. In contrast to the conventional Yukawa coupling between the inflaton and structureless matter fields, we find that the supersymmetry-preserving chiral multiplet structure leads to a substantial enhancement, by at least one order of magnitude, in the amplitude of the resulting GWs spectrum. Our results therefore suggest that the interplay between reheating-era stochastic GWs and supersymmetric phenomenology merits further exploration and development.</description>

      <title>Spectral function for pions in magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the spectral functions of neutral ($\pi_0$) and charged ($\pi_{\pm}$) pions under a uniform magnetic field using the SU(2) Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model with the Ritus method. The analysis highlights the complex interplay of magnetic field effects, thermal influences, and chiral symmetry on meson properties in extreme QCD environments. For $\pi_0$, whose properties are governed by the behavior of its constituent quarks, magnetic field-induced Landau levels lead to a multi-peak structure in its spectral function, reflecting stable and resonance solutions that evolve with temperature, showing shifts and critical enhancements near chiral restoration. For $\pi_{\pm}$, cross terms that come from the asymmetry between the constituent quarks introduce Landau cuts alongside Unitary cuts, indicating damping effects, with decay widths narrowing at higher temperatures, suggesting increased stability.</description>

      <title>Relativistic effects in heavy mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the application of a relativistic potential model to the description of the spectrum and radiative transitions in mesons containing at least one heavy quark (b or c). Although the model has a small number of parameters, it is possible to achieve qualitative agreement with all available experimental data, including those that could not be explained by all previous methods. This demonstrates the importance of taking relativistic effects into account. A remarkable property of the relativistic potential model is that the predictions for meson masses and partial widths of radiative transitions remain finite in the limit of zero light quark mass.</description>

      <title>Singly Cabibbo-suppressed hadronic weak decays of the $\Omega^-$ hyperon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the two-body hadronic weak decays of the $\Omega^-$ hyperon with strangeness $S=-3$, including three singly Cabibbo-suppressed decay modes: $\Xi^0 \pi^-$, $\Xi^-\pi^0$ and $\Lambda K^-$. The decay amplitudes at the quark level, arising from $s\to ud \bar{u}$ transitions (direct pion emission and color-suppressed processes) and $su\to ud$ transitions (pole terms), are calculated in the framework of the non-relativistic constituent quark model.The theoretical results show that the $\Xi^0 \pi^-$ channel is dominated by the color-allowed direct pion emission process, while the $\Lambda K^-$ channel is well described by one type of pole contribution mediated through intermediate $\Xi$ resonances ($1^2S_{1/2^+}$ and $1^2P_{1/2^-}$ states). However, the contribution from tree-level mechanisms alone to the branching ratio of $\Omega^- \to \Xi^- \pi^0$ is small due to its color-suppressed nature. The discrepancy is resolved by including final state interactions through rescattering processes via intermediate states $\Xi^0\pi^-$ and $\Lambda K^-$. This work demonstrates that a unified description of $\Omega^-$ hadronic weak decays necessitates the interplay of quark-level weak vertices, baryon pole structures, and long-distance final state rescattering dynamics. With these mechanisms, the obtained branching ratios are in agreement with the high-precision experimental data from the BESIII. Furthermore, these above decays are found to be dominated by the parity-conserving $P$-wave transitions, thus the asymmetry parameters are almost zero.</description>

      <title>Femtoscopic correlation functions for general partial waves: Application to the $\Lambda(1520)$ resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The femtoscopic correlation function has been established in recent years as a high-precision tool for investigating hadron-hadron interactions and exotic states, providing stringent constraints on the dynamics of low-energy strong interactions. However, current research has been predominantly focused on the $s$-wave interaction between hadrons, while studies of higher partial waves remain scarce. We present a general analytical expression for the femtoscopic correlation function in an arbitrary partial wave using the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. This formalism is applied to constrain the $d$-wave $K^-p$ scattering through a combined study of the $K^-p$ correlation function and the $D_{03}$ scattering amplitude of $\bar K N \to \bar K N$ and $\bar K N \to \pi\Sigma$ processes, from which the properties of $\Lambda(1520)$ are extracted and found to be in good agreement with the experimental results. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of determining dynamics between hadrons through femtoscopic correlation functions and scattering amplitudes with higher partial waves.</description>

      <title>Radiative Dirac Neutrino Masses from Modular $S_3$ Symmetry in an Axion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified axion model framework that simultaneously addresses the origin of neutrino masses, leptonic flavor structure, the strong CP problem, and dark matter. The model is based on a global $U(1)_{\rm PQ}$ symmetry combined with a modular $S_3$ symmetry and is realized within a novel class of KSVZ-type axion model. Exotic colored fermions and scalars mediate radiative neutrino mass generation at the one loop-level. The PQ charge assignment forbids tree-level neutrino masses and leaves a residual $Z_3$ symmetry that ensures the Dirac nature of neutrinos. In the minimal realization, the neutrino mass matrix is of rank two, predicting one massless neutrino. Consequently, the sum of neutrino masses is constrained for both the normal and inverted hierarchies. We analyze the implications for charged lepton flavor violation and the lepton $g-2$. The axion emerging from this framework dynamically resolves the strong CP problem and accounts for the observed dark matter abundance. Notably, the predicted axion-photon coupling is within reach of upcoming experiments and consistent with existing astrophysical and cosmological bounds.</description>

      <title>Prompt production of $J/\psi$ in the soft gluon resummation approach using the ICEM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the article, we study prompt $J/\psi$ production at small transverse momentum within the Transverse Momentum Dependent (TMD) factorization. The Soft Gluon Resummation (SGR) approach is used for modelling of TMD PDFs. The hadronization process of heavy charm quarks is described with the Improved Color Evaporation model (ICEM). In order to obtain spectra of $J/\psi$ at the arbitrary transverse momenta, fixed-order calculations within the collinear parton model (CPM) are also applied and further matched with the TMD calculations using the Inverse-Error Weighting (InEW) scheme. We present results of calculations for a wide range of collision energy with the fitting of the relevant nonperturbative parameter of the ICEM. Predictions for the SPD NICA experiment are also provided alongside comparison with the result of calculation using nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) framework.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a model with dipole Pomeron bassed on Regge theory framework for vetor meson photoproduction by arbitarily polaried photons. The accurate helicity amplitude is constructed with free trajectory parameters. This model consistently describes the total and momentum-transfer differential cross sections and he spin-density matrix elements in photoproduction of $\rho^{0}$, by fitting it to the data of $3$ categories simultaneously to determine its $20$ parameters. The agreements with experimental data of our model improve those of the previous models remarkably and predictions for circular SDMEs are made. The model provides key description of the process for our innovative polarimetry of cosmic photons and essential insight to explore the non-perturbative regime and the spin dynamics of strong interaction.</description>

      <title>Heavy quark polarization anisotropy as a novel probe of fireball geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to probe the initial fireball geometry in relativistic heavy-ion collisions using spin polarization. Specifically, we introduce polarization harmonics of open heavy hadrons as a novel observable sensitive to geometric anisotropies. Heavy quarks are produced in early hard scatterings and can acquire spin polarization from the strong, transient electromagnetic fields present at early times. As they propagate through the anisotropic quark-gluon plasma, medium-induced interactions lead to path-length dependent depolarization, imprinting an azimuthally anisotropic polarization pattern. Within the framework of rotational Brownian motion, we show that the resulting polarization harmonics are directly related to the initial spatial eccentricities, thereby establishing heavy-flavor polarization anisotropies as a sensitive and complementary probe of the early-time collision geometry. We present quantitative estimates of the second polarization harmonic associated with the recently observed $D^{*+}$ spin alignment reported by the ALICE Collaboration.</description>

      <title>Evidence for quark-diquark structure of baryons from fluctuations of conserved charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study fluctuations and correlations of conserved charges in QCD using a string-based description of the hadronic mass spectrum. Mesons and baryons are modeled as open relativistic strings with quark-antiquark and quark-diquark endpoints, respectively, leading to an exponential Hagedorn growth of states with a limiting temperature fixed by the string tension. We find that continuous Hagedorn spectra constrained by experimentally established hadrons underestimate net-baryon number fluctuations obtained in lattice QCD calculations. By extracting the Hagedorn string spectrum directly from lattice QCD through a fit to the second-order net-baryon number susceptibility, we obtain a consistent description of a broad set of fluctuations of conserved charges from LQCD with the Hagedorn temperature $T_H \simeq 323~$MeV, without introducing additional free parameters. Our results provide thermodynamic evidence in support of a string quark-diquark picture of baryons in the confined phase of QCD.</description>

      <title>Local finiteness for real-virtual corrections to electroweak production in partonic collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a local subtraction scheme that enables the combined integration of loop momenta and the final-state parton phase space in real-virtual NNLO QCD corrections to cross sections for hadroproduction of electroweak and other colorless states. All initial- and final-state infrared singularities are subtracted at the integrand level in momentum space, yielding a locally finite integral ready for numerical integration in four dimensions. The subtraction terms are all based on the well-understood process of single-Higgs production. The core of our subtraction scheme relies on achieving local factorization in all infrared limits of real and virtual momenta. This necessitates systematic modifications of the original Feynman integrand for loop amplitudes, enabling gauge symmetry cancellations before performing integrations. Our approach provides an essential step toward NNLO cross-section calculations for hadron collider processes, where both loop and phase-space integrations are carried out numerically.</description>

      <title>Analysis of regulator and cutoff artifacts in the phase diagram of the quark-meson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study regulator and cutoff artifacts in the quark-meson model at finite temperature and quark chemical potential within the functional renormalization-group approach using the local potential approximation. To this end, we discuss the concept of renormalization-group consistency in effective models, which necessitates a nontrivial parameter-fixing procedure to enable a meaningful comparison of results obtained with different regulators and cutoffs. We employ a standard range of cutoff values used in phenomenological studies and regulators that differ significantly in their analytic properties as well as in their classification according to the principle of strongest singularity. We find that regulator and cutoff dependences are small at low temperatures and quark chemical potentials. At high temperatures and low quark chemical potentials, significant cutoff artifacts arise, whereas the properties of the regulator affect the dynamics in the regime governed by a chiral phase transition of first order at low temperatures and high quark chemical potentials.</description>

      <title>Establishing Earth's Matter Effect in Atmospheric Neutrino Oscillations at IceCube DeepCore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of the non-zero value of $\theta_{13}$ has opened an exciting opportunity to probe the Earth's matter effects in three-flavor oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos. These matter effects depend on both neutrino energy and the electron density distributions encountered during their propagation through Earth. In this contribution, we present preliminary sensitivities from the DeepCore detector, a densely instrumented sub-array of the IceCube neutrino observatory at the South Pole, demonstrating its ability to observe these matter effects in atmospheric neutrino oscillations. Using simulated data equivalent to 9.3 years of observations at IceCube DeepCore, we show the sensitivity of the DeepCore to reject the vacuum oscillation hypothesis and align with the Preliminary Reference Earth Model. Additionally, we present the expected improvement in sensitivity for rejecting the vacuum oscillations using the upcoming IceCube Upgrade, a low-energy extension of the IceCube detector.</description>

      <title>Exploring Layered Structure Inside Earth Using Atmospheric Neutrino Oscillation at IceCube DeepCore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IceCube detector, using its densely instrumented center, called DeepCore, can detect multi-GeV atmospheric neutrinos. The oscillation pattern of neutrinos is altered due to interactions with ambient electrons as they pass through Earth. The changes in these patterns are influenced by the amount of matter and its specific arrangement. As neutrinos propagate, they retain information about the densities they encounter. Our study demonstrates that IceCube DeepCore can utilize the Earth's matter effects to distinguish between a homogeneous matter density profile and a layered structure density profile of Earth. In this contribution, we present that IceCube DeepCore data equivalent to 9.3 years of observation can reject the homogeneous matter density profile with a confidence level of 1.4$\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Complete Operator Basis for the modular invariant SMEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implement modular flavor symmetries within the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) framework, using the flavor group $A_4^{(q)} \times A_4^{(e)}$ with distinct moduli $\tau_q$ and $\tau_e$, and assigning different modular weights to right-handed quarks using simplest weight assignment. By treating the moduli as non-dynamical spurions, adopting the MFV-like assumption, and neglecting effects associated with $\mathrm{Im}\,\tau$, we systematically construct a finite set of independent modular-invariant higher-dimensional operators via the Hilbert-series techniques. In the holomorphic $A_4$ scenario, where all modular forms derive from the weight-2 triplet $Y^{(2)}_{\mathbf{3}}$, we present two equivalent Hilbert-series bases. This establishes that higher-dimensional operators can be formally organized as $[Y_{\mathbf{r}}^{(k_Y)},{Y_{\mathbf{r}'}^{(k_Y')}}^{*},\mathcal{O}]_{\mathbf{1}}$ singlets. We subsequently enumerate all independent operators up to dimension 7 under this assumption and provide explicit constructions for all dimension-5 operators as well as baryon- and lepton-number conserving dimension-6 operators. Relaxing holomorphicity to the non-holomorphic case of polyharmonic Maas forms, considering that non-holomorphic modular forms are not closed under multiplication, adopting the holomorphic organizing idea would generically lead to an infinite proliferation of modular-invariant structures. To retain a finite and complete operator basis, we therefore impose the same minimal formal organizing principle, which reproduces the benchmark Weinberg operator and the corresponding dimension-$6$ operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.23079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earth's mass and internal structure have been primarily studied through gravitational and seismic methods. Neutrinos, however, offer an independent way to explore Earth's interior via matter effects in neutrino oscillations that depend on the electron distribution inside Earth, and hence its matter density. Our study uses atmospheric neutrinos at DeepCore, a densely instrumented sub-detector of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, to estimate Earth's mass and layer densities. We also assess how the upcoming IceCube Upgrade, with denser instrumentation, could improve these measurements.</description>

      <title>Exploring Long-Range Interactions in the Atmospheric Neutrino Oscillations at IceCube DeepCore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IceCube neutrino observatory consists of an array of Digital Optical Modules (DOMs) instrumenting one cubic-kilometer of deep glacial ice at the South Pole. DeepCore, a densely-spaced sub-array of DOMs at the bottom central region of IceCube, enables the detection of atmospheric neutrinos with an energy threshold in the GeV range. The high statistics data of DeepCore provides a unique opportunity to perform neutrino oscillation studies as well as explore various sub-leading Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics signatures. We consider a well-motivated minimal extension of the Standard Model by an additional anomaly-free, gauged lepton-number symmetry, such as $L_e - L_\mu$ or $L_e - L_\tau$. These symmetries give rise to flavor-dependent long-range interaction mediated through a very light neutral gauge boson. In this contribution, we present the sensitivity of the IceCube DeepCore detector to search for this flavor-dependent long-range interaction potential with a runtime of 9.3 years.</description>

      <title>The LBT $Y_{\rm p}$ Project V: Cosmological Implications of a New Determination of Primordial $^4$He</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primordial abundance of $^4$He plays a central role in big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) and in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The LBT $Y_{\rm p}$ Project's new measurement of the primordial $^4$He mass fraction $Y_{\rm p} =0.2458 \pm 0.0013$ is the most precise determination to date. In this paper, we combine our new $Y_{\rm p}$ value with the latest primordial deuterium measurement, and assess the consequences for cosmology. For Standard BBN, where the number of light neutrino species is fixed at $N_\nu=3$, the single free parameter is the cosmic baryon density; the CMB measures this independently, with results consistent with each other. Combining $Y_{\rm p}$ , D/H, BBN, and the CMB, gives the cosmic baryon-to-photon ratio $\eta = (6.120 \pm 0.038) \times 10^{-10}$, corresponding to a baryon density parameter $\Omega_{\rm B} h^2 = 0.02236 \pm 0.00014$. We then allow $N_\nu$ to vary and thus measure relativistic species present during nucleosynthesis. We find $\eta = (6.101 \pm 0.044) \times 10^{-10}$ or $\Omega_{\rm B} h^2= 0.02229 \pm 0. 00016$, and $N_\nu = 2.925 \pm 0.082$, and for $N_\nu \ge 3$, $\Delta N_\nu= N_\nu-3 \le 0.125$ (95\% CL) during BBN and the CMB. Our results demonstrate consistency with the Standard Model of particle physics, and with the standard cosmology that links BBN at $\sim 1 \ \rm sec$ and the CMB at $\sim 400,000$ yr.</description>

      <title>High energy neutrinos from pulsar-powered optical transients: LFBOTs as potential origin of the KM3NeT event KM3-230213A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the KM3NeT Collaboration reported the detection of an ultra-high energy ($\sim 220$ PeV) neutrino event, KM3-230213A. In this work, we perform a detailed investigation into whether this event could originate from the diffuse neutrino flux produced by a class of pulsar-powered optical transients. In particular, we consider populations of ordinary supernovae (SNe), super-luminous supernovae (SLSNe), and luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs) with a newly formed magnetar as the central engine. We discuss both the thermal electromagnetic and non-thermal neutrino emission from such sources. We scan the parameter space of the dipolar magnetic field strength and the initial spin period to determine characteristic optical emission properties and lightcurve timescales of these transients. Additionally, our scan identifies which classes of these transients can reproduce the required diffuse flux level and neutrino energies. Combining our results, we conclude that a diffuse neutrino flux from a population of LFBOTs can explain the KM3NeT event. Therefore, pulsar-powered optical transients may serve as promising sources for the current and upcoming high-energy and ultra-high energy neutrino telescopes.</description>

      <title>Excited-state uncertainties in lattice-QCD calculations of multi-hadron systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excited-state effects lead to hard-to-quantify systematic uncertainties in lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) spectroscopy calculations when computationally accessible imaginary times are smaller than inverse excitation gaps, as often arises for multi-hadron systems with signal-to-noise problems. Lanczos residual bounds address this by providing two-sided constraints on energies that do not require assumptions beyond Hermiticity, but often give very conservative systematic uncertainty estimates. Here, a more-constraining set of gap bounds is introduced for hadron spectroscopy. These bounds provide tighter constraints whose validity requires an explicit assumption about an energy gap. Exactly solvable lattice field theory correlators are used to test the utility of residual and gap bounds at finite and infinite statistics. Two-sided bounds and other analysis methods are then applied to a high-statistics LQCD calculation of nucleon-nucleon scattering at $m_\pi \sim 800$ MeV. Generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) and Lanczos energy estimators are compatible when applied to the same correlator data, but analyses including different interpolating operators show statistically significant inconsistencies. However, two-sided bounds from all operators are consistent. Under the assumption that the number of energy levels below $N\Delta$ and $\Delta\Delta$ thresholds is the same as for non-interacting nucleons, gap bounds are sufficient to constrain nucleon-nucleon scattering amplitudes at phenomenologically relevant precision. Lanczos methods further reveal that energy-eigenstate estimates from previously studied asymmetric correlators have not converged over accessible imaginary times. Nevertheless, data-driven examples demonstrate why assumptions are required to draw conclusions about the natures of two-nucleon ground states at these masses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice QCD has historically produced energy results interpretable as either estimates relying on implicit assumptions about asymptotic behavior or one-sided upper bounds. New Lanczos methods providing two-sided bounds with less-restrictive assumptions are introduced and quantified in a high-statistics calculation with unphysical quark masses. Two-sided bounds without spectral assumptions provide sub-percent constraints on the nucleon mass. Other bounds, which assume all states in a given energy window are resolved, provide meaningful two-sided constraints on nucleon-nucleon scattering phase shifts.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in Elastic and Inelastic Two-particle Scatterings at High Energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement produced in transverse momentum by two-particle scattering at high energy. Employing the S-matrix framework for the derivation of reduced density matrices, we formulate the entanglement entropy for an inelastic scattering as well as an elastic one. We display the formulas of the entanglement entropy in terms of two-body cross sections. We also derive the entanglement density as a function of the transverse momentum. As an application, we then focus on both forward elastic ($pn \to pn$) and inelastic ($pn \to np$) channels scattering allowing for a fruitful comparison of the two reactions with the same proton-neutron content. We evaluate the elastic and inelastic entanglement entropy by using known parameterizations of experimental data for neutron-proton reactions. Comparing those entanglement entropies, we observe that the inelastic scattering produces more overall entanglement than the elastic one in the $pn$ sector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the chaos in the dynamics of a probe massless particle confined by the harmonic potential near the horizon of the dyonic $\rm{AdS_4}$-Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. The total energy of the particle, chemical potential and magnetic field in this system serving as independently adjustable parameters tune nonlinearity and phase-space structure. By analyzing the trajectories on the Poincar\'e section and evaluating the Lyapunov exponents, we obtain the dynamical phase diagrams of the chaos and find their counteracting regulatory role: at low energy, chaos is enhanced and the Lyapunov exponent $\lambda_L$ violates its upper bound (i.e. surface gravity) in the extremal black hole limit(combined paramete $\Gamma=3$); at high energy, the same extremal limit suppresses chaos, with $\lambda_L$ dropping to zero and a regular dynamical corridor emerging along $\Gamma=3$ in the dynamical phase diagrams. These results establish a direct mapping between black hole thermodynamics and microscopic chaos, offering new insights into the AdS/QCD correspondence and nonlinear dynamics in strongly curved spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Exact black holes and black branes with bumpy horizons supported by superfluid pions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present exact solutions of the Einstein-$SU(2)$ non-linear sigma model in $3+1$ spacetime dimensions, describing bumpy black holes and black branes. Using an Ansatz for superfluid pion multi-vortices, the matter sector reduces to a first-order BPS system, while the Einstein equations reduce to a Liouville equation with a smooth source governing the horizon deformation. These solutions describe horizons of different constant curvatures, with nontrivial bumpy geometries protected by an integer topological invariant, namely the vorticity, which also controls the number of bumps and the black hole thermodynamics. Remarkably, such horizons arise in a minimal and physically motivated matter model, without invoking exotic fields or modified gravity. The physical implications of these results in holography and astrophysics are briefly described.</description>

      <title>A novel Hamiltonian formulation of $1+1$ dimensional $\phi^4$ theory in Daubechies wavelet basis: momentum space analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ the wavelet formalism of quantum field theory to study field theories in the nonperturbative Hamiltonian framework. Specifically, we make use of Daubechies wavelets in momentum space. These basis elements are characterised by a resolution and a translation index that provides for a natural nonperturbative infrared and ultraviolet truncation of the quantum field theory. As an application, we consider the $\phi^4$ theory and demonstrate the emergence of the well-known nonperturbative strong-coupling phase transition in the $m^2&gt;0$ sector.</description>

      <title>Recent results on heavy resonances at CMS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.22995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics provides a successful description of elementary particles and their interactions. However, it does not explain phenomena such as the hierarchy problem or the nature of dark matter. Many Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) theories provide answers to these open questions by adding new heavy resonances, which can be probed directly at colliders. This note summarizes recent resonance searches by the CMS Collaboration, focusing on final states containing top quarks and Higgs bosons.</description>

      <title>One loop photon-graviton mixing in an electromagnetic field: Part 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photon-graviton conversion in an electromagnetic field is a well-known prediction of Einstein-Maxwell theory. First discussed at tree-level by Gertsenshtein in 1962, more recently it has been shown to lead to magnetic dichroism starting from one-loop. While previously only two diagrams were assumed to contribute to this one-loop photon-graviton amplitude in a constant electromagnetic field, here we point out the existence of a third one involving a tadpole subdiagram. As shown by H. Gies and one of the authors in 2016 for the pure QED case, such diagrams cannot be omitted in general even though the tadpole formally vanishes. After a short review of the calculation of one-loop photon-graviton amplitudes in the worldline formalism, we use this formalism for a unified calculation of all three diagrams. Although phenomenologically this amplitude is mainly of interest for the case of the spinor loop in a magnetic field, here we will also include the scalar loop and the electric field component, since the computational effort is essentially the same. We show that the tadpole diagram, although contributing to the amplitude, does not contribute to the magnetic dichroism. The gravitational Ward identity provides a useful check.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Similar to other heavy flavor mesons, the weak decays of $D^*_{(s)}$ mesons can provide a platform to verify the standard model, explore new physics, and understand the mechanisms of weak interactions. At present, the theoretical and experimental studies on $D^*_{(s)}$ mesons are relatively limited. In addition to the dominant electromagnetic decays, the $D^*_{(s)}$ weak decays should be feasible to explore the $D^*_{(s)}$ mesons. In this study, we used the covariant light-front quark model to study the form factors of the transitions $D^*_{(s)}\to \pi, K, \eta_{q,s}$, then calculated the branching ratios of the semi-leptonic decays $D^*_{(s)}\to P\ell^{+}\nu_{\ell}$ and the non-leptonic decays $D^*_{(s)}\to PP, PV$ with $P=\pi, K, \eta^{(\prime)}, V=\rho, K^*, \phi$ and $\ell=e, \mu$. The channels $D_{s}^{*+}\to\eta \ell^{+}\nu_{\ell}$ and $D^{*+}_{s}\to \eta\rho^{+}$ possess the largest branching ratios, which can reach an order of $10^{-6}$ among these decays, and are most likely to be accessible in experiments at future high-luminosity colliders. Furthermore, we predict and discuss the longitudinal polarization fraction $f_{L}$ and the forward-backward asymmetry $A_{FB}$ for the considered semi-leptonic $D^*_{(s)}$ decays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Q-ball dark matter is one of the candidates for the macroscopic dark matter: Q-ball is a non-topological solitonic configuration, whose stability can be ensured by global charge and energy conservation. One of the crucial factors for discovering signatures from the Q-ball dark matter, is the interactions of the Q-ball dark matter with ordinary matter. In particular, the scattering of ordinary matter off the Q-ball dark matter is important for the direct detection searches, such as paleo-detectors. It was conjectured that quarks incident on the Q-ball were reflected as anti-quarks with a probability of order unity, but it costs the energy of the squark in the Q-ball, which cannot be paid in the scattering of ordinary matter off the Q-ball dark matter. In addition, once a proton is reflected as an anti-proton, the Q-ball obtains the electromagnetic charge. In this study, we revisit the scattering process of quarks with the Q-ball with taking into account the energy cost of the scattering and the electromagnetic charge-up of the Q-ball.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the gluon Wigner distributions at non-zero skewness using light-front wave functions (LFWFs) in the dressed quark model, where the target state is a quark dressed with a gluon in the leading-order Fock space expansion. Our analysis focuses on the configurations in which the gluon, the target, or both are transversely polarized. We derive analytical expressions for the Wigner distributions in the boost-invariant longitudinal space ($\sigma$) for transversely polarized configurations and observe a diffraction-like oscillatory pattern in $\sigma$-space, analogous to that reported earlier for unpolarized and longitudinally polarized gluons.</description>

      <title>Global Bayesian Analysis of $\mathrm{J}/\psi$ Photoproduction on Proton and Lead Targets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a global Bayesian analysis of diffractive $\mathrm{J}/\psi$ production in $\gamma+p$ and $\gamma+\mathrm{Pb}$ collisions using a color glass condensate (CGC) based calculation framework. As past calculations have shown that CGC-based models typically overpredict the $\mathrm{J}/\psi$ production in $\gamma+\mathrm{Pb}$ collisions at high center of mass energy, we address the question of whether it is possible to describe coherent and incoherent diffractive $\mathrm{J}/\psi$ data from $\gamma+p$ collisions at HERA and the LHC, and from $\gamma+\mathrm{Pb}$ collisions at the LHC simultaneously. Our results indicate that a simultaneous description of $\gamma+p$ and $\gamma+\mathrm{Pb}$ data is challenging, with results improving when an overall $K$-factor -- scaling $\gamma+p$ and $\gamma+\mathrm{Pb}$ cross sections to absorb model uncertainties -- is introduced.</description>

      <title>Updated Constraints from Electric Dipole Moments in the MSSM with R-Parity Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the electric dipole moments (EDMs) of quarks and leptons in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) with trilinear $R$-parity violation (RPV). In this framework, EDMs are induced at the two-loop level via RPV interactions. We perform a comprehensive recalculation of several classes of Barr-Zee type diagrams in a general $R_\xi$ gauge. While we find general agreement with previous analytic results in the literature, our work provides a valuable independent cross-check of the complicated calculations. We also point out some subtleties in the intermediate steps and in the choice of the flavor basis for the numerical evaluation of the expressions. By confronting the theoretical predictions with the latest experimental limits on EDMs, we derive updated constraints on combinations of RPV couplings. We highlight an approximate, testable correlation between the proton and neutron EDM that emerges within the considered class of RPV models, offering a distinctive signature for future EDM experiments.</description>

      <title>Prediction for Maximum Supercooling in SU(N) Confinement Transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermal confinement phase transition (PT) in $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory is first-order for $N\geq 3$, with bounce action scaling as $N^2$. Remarkably, lattice data for the action include a small coefficient whose presence likely strongly alters the PT dynamics. We give evidence, utilizing insights from softly-broken SUSY YM models, that the small coefficient originates from a deconfined phase instability just below the critical temperature. We predict the maximum achievable supercooling in $SU(N)$ theories to be a few percent, which can be tested on the lattice. We briefly discuss the potentially significant suppression of the associated cosmological gravitational wave signals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ultrarelativistic collisions of heavy ions provide rich spectrum of possibilities to discuss the response of the nucleus to photons. Newly published neutron and proton multiplicities measured in the ALICE experiment in ultraperipheral collisions allow investigating the influence of the electromagnetic fields on colliding nuclei for the $^{208}$Pb+$^{208}$Pb at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=5.02~TeV. The theoretical predictions are done within hybrid model including equivalent photon approximations (EPA), GiBUU modeling of pre-equilibrium processes and generation of the exited nuclear remnants, which decay is modeled by statistical approach: GEM2 or GEMINI++. The cross-sections of the mass-charge distributions of nuclear remnants as well as the neutron, proton and other charged particle multiplicities are estimated. We concentrate on production of protons and isotopes coming from the electromagnetic dissociation. Special attention is devoted to emission of a single proton. The cross section for $1p$ emission is very close to maximal available one based on reactions of photon with individual nucleons. Our pre-equilibrium processes explain simultaneously the tail of neutron energy distributions in the nuclear rest frame observed in $\gamma + A$ collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method to probe sterile neutrinos using polarization observables in the purely leptonic decays $\ell^{\prime-} \to \ell^{-} \bar{\nu}_{\ell} \nu_{\ell^{\prime}}$. By analyzing angular distributions and asymmetries derived from polarized decay rates, we identify distinctive signatures of sterile neutrino mixing. In particular, we demonstrate that sterile neutrinos can induce singularities in certain asymmetry parameters as functions of the invariant mass squared of the neutrino pair. These singularities occur for sterile neutrino masses $m_{4\nu}$ satisfying $m_{4\nu}^2 &lt; m_{\ell^{\prime}}^2 / 2$, providing a clear target for experimental investigation. Our results motivate the incorporation of polarized beam sources at future colliders to enhance sensitivity to sterile neutrinos and other new physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03369v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Renormalization-group equations (RGE) is one of the key tools in studying high-energy behavior of the Standard Model (SM). We begin by reviewing one-loop RGE for the dimensionless couplings of the SM and proceed to the state-of-the-art results. Our study focuses on the RGE solutions at different loop orders. We compare not only the standard (``diagonal'') loop counting when one considers gauge, Yukawa, and scalar self-coupling beta functions at the same order but also ``non-diagonal'' ones, inspired by the so-called Weyl consistency conditions. We discuss the initial conditions for RGE (``matching'') for different loop configurations and study the uncertainties of running couplings both related to the limited precision of the experimental input (``parametric'') and the missing high-order corrections (``theoretical''). As an application of our analysis we also estimate the electroweak vacuum decay probability and study how the uncertainties in the running parameters affect the latter. We argue that ``non-diagonal'' beta functions, if coupled with a more consistent ``non-diagonal'' matching, lead to larger theoretical uncertainty than ``diagonal'' ones.</description>

      <title>On pseudo-gauge ambiguity in the distributions of energy density, pressure, and shear force inside the nucleon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10223v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the spatial distributions of pressure, energy density, and shear forces inside the nucleon within the two-flavor Skyrme model including vector mesons. This framework has the advantage that nucleon configurations can be stabilized without the Skyrme term. In contrast to the model without vector mesons, however, we realize that the energy-momentum tensor (EMT) becomes pseudo-gauge dependent. We explicitly demonstrate that all these distributions differ between the canonical and Belinfante forms of the EMTs. We identify the pseudo-gauge ambiguity as originating from nonvanishing surface terms associated with spin currents generated by the vector-meson field strength tensors. Furthermore, we show that the pressure and shear-force distributions in the canonical EMT develop singularities at the nucleon center, whereas the corresponding Belinfante distributions remain finite. Finally, we discuss the implications of pseudo-gauge dependence for extracting the confining force and for constructing the equation of state inside the nucleon.</description>

Focusing on candidates with $p$-wave annihilation channels, we show that the hadronic injection of pions and kaons beyond freeze-out, and their subsequent interaction with protons and neutrons prior to the deuterium bottleneck, provides a sensitivity to annihilation that surpasses that of the CMB and indirect detection in the galaxy.</description>

      <title>Mass spectra and Mott transitions of neutral mesons at finite temperature and magnetic field in frame of three-flavor Polyakov-extended Nambu-Jona-Lasino model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mass spectra and Mott transitions of neutral mesons $K_0,{\bar K}_0,\pi_0,\eta,\eta'$ at finite temperature and magnetic field are investigated in a three-flavor PNJL model. We focus on the effect of gluons, which is simulated by the Polyakov potential, and the inverse magnetic catalysis (IMC) effect, which is mimicked by using a magnetic field dependent parameter. Mass spectra show similar structure when introducing the gluon and IMC effect. The mass of $K_0\ ({\bar K}_0)$ meson $m_{K_0}=m_{{\bar K}_0}$ is controlled by chiral symmetry breaking and restoration. It increases with temperature in the low temperature region, and shows a mass jump at the Mott transition. Further increasing temperature, $m_{K_0}$ firstly decreases and then increases with temperature. $\pi_0$ meson is not only the pseudo-Goldstone boson of chiral symmetry breaking, but also influenced by the flavor mixing of $\pi_0-\eta-\eta'$. The behavior of $m_{\pi_0}$ is different from $m_{K_0}$ only at high temperature region, which decreases with temperature. $\eta,\eta'$ mesons are affected by both the $U_A(1)$ anomaly and the flavor mixing of $\pi_0-\eta-\eta'$. The mass of $\eta$ meson $m_{\eta}$ decreases with temperature in low temperature region and then shows a jump at its Mott transition. After that $m_{\eta}$ firstly decreases and later increases with temperature. $\eta'$ meson is a resonant state, and its mass $m_{\eta'}$ continuously decreases and then increases with temperature. The mass jumps of $K_0,{\bar K}_0,\pi_0,\eta$ mesons are caused by the dimension reduction of the constituent quarks under external magnetic field. In PNJL model, the Mott transition temperature of $K_0,{\bar K}_0,\pi_0$ mesons ($\eta$ meson) decreases (increases) with magnetic field. The IMC effect leads to no qualitative change to the meson Mott transition temperature but shifts them to the lower values.</description>

      <title>Hidden-charm and -bottom tetraquark states with $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$ via QCD sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03800v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the $1^{-+}$ hidden-charm and hidden-bottom tetraquark states within the framework of QCD sum rules. The mass spectra are computed by including condensates up to dimension eight in the operator product expansion. Our results indicate the possible existence of four $1^{-+}$ hidden-charm tetraquark states, with predicted masses of $(4.83 \pm 0.15)$ GeV, $(4.88 \pm 0.18)$ GeV, $(4.72 \pm 0.16)$ GeV, and $(4.79 \pm 0.12)$ GeV, while their hidden-bottom counterparts are estimated to have masses of $(11.08 \pm 0.16)$ GeV, $(11.16 \pm 0.14)$ GeV, $(10.99 \pm 0.16)$ GeV, and $(11.03 \pm 0.15)$ GeV, respectively. We also analyze the possible decay modes of these tetraquark states, which may be accessible in future experiments at BESIII, Belle~II, LHCb, and future STCF. These findings provide valuable guidance for the experimental search for exotic $1^{-+}$ tetraquark states in both the charm and bottom sectors.</description>

      <title>Searching for axion dark matter with magnetic resonance force microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a magnetic resonance force microscopy (MRFM) search for axion dark matter around 1 GHz. The experiment leverages the axion's derivative coupling to electrons, which induces an effective A.C. magnetic field on a sample of electron spins polarized by a D.C. magnetic field and a micromagnet. A second pump field at a nearby frequency enhances the signal, with the detuning matched to the resonant frequency of a magnet-loaded mechanical oscillator. The resulting spin-dependent force is detected with hih sensitivity via optical interferometry. Accounting for the relevant noise sources, we show that current technology can be used to put constraints competitive with those from laboratory experiments with just a minute of integration time. Furthermore, varying the pump field frequency and D.C. magnetic field allows one to scan the axion mass. Finally, we explore this setup's capability to put constraints on other dark matter - Standard Model couplings.</description>

      <title>Towards First Detection of the Solar MSW Transition With JUNO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matter-induced neutrino flavor mixing (the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein, or MSW, effect) is a central prediction of the neutrino mixing framework, but it has not been conclusively observed. Direct observation of the energy-dependent MSW transition in the solar electron-neutrino survival probability would solve this, but backgrounds have been prohibitive. We show that our new technique for suppressing muon-induced spallation backgrounds will allow JUNO to measure the MSW transition at $&gt;$4$\sigma$ significance in 10 years. This would strongly support upcoming multi-\$1B next-generation long-baseline experiments and their goals in cementing the neutrino mixing framework.</description>

      <title>Revisiting $\mu$-$e$ conversion in $R$-parity violating SUSY</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\mu$-$e$ conversion process is one of the most powerful ways to test lepton-flavor-violating (LFV) interactions involving charged leptons. The standard model with massive neutrinos predicts an extremely low rate for $\mu$-$e$ conversion, making this process an excellent probe for testing LFV arising from new physics. Among many theoretical models that can induce LFV, the Supersymmetric model with R-parity violating interactions is one of the most studied for $\mu$-$e$ conversion. In this work, we revisit trilinear R-parity violating interactions for $\mu$-$e$ conversion, considering renormalization group (RG) running effects from high to low energy scales. The $\mu$-$e$ conversion, $\mu \to e \gamma$, and $\mu \to eee$ experimental data are compared to give upper limits on the relevant 15 combinations of the trilinear $\lambda^{\prime}$ couplings and 6 combinations of the $\lambda$ couplings, certain of which are underexplored in previous studies. We find that RG running effects influence the limits by no more than 30\% in most cases, but can improve constraints by $\sim$80\% in certain combinations, which cannot be neglected. In the near future, COMET and Mu2e are expected to begin data-taking and aim to provide the most stringent constraints on $\mu$-$e$ conversion. These next-generation $\mu$-$e$ experiments have the ability to give much more comprehensive examinations on most trilinear coupling combinations than the $\mu\to e\gamma$ and $\mu\to 3e$ decay experiments. The $\mu$-$e$ experiments will not only deepen our understanding of LFV but also provide a crucial way to examine the underlying new physics contributions.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of radiation from global strings and the relic axion density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss key aspects of the nature of radiation from global strings and its impact on the relic axion density. Using a simple model we demonstrate the dependence on the spectrum of radiation emitted by strings. We then study the radiation emitted by perturbed straight strings paying particular attention to the difference between the overall phase of the field and the small perturbations about the string solution which are the axions. We find that a significant correction is required to be sure that one is analyzing the axions and not the self-field of the string. Typically this requires one to excise a sizeable region around the string - something which is not usually done in the case of numerical field theory simulations of string networks. We have measured the spectrum of radiation from these strings and find that it is compatible with an exponential, as predicted by the Nambu-like Kalb-Ramond action, and in particular is not a ``hard'' spectrum often found in string network simulations. We conclude by attempting to assess the uncertainties on relic density and find that this leads to a range of possible axion masses when compared to the measured density from the Cosmic Microwave Background, albeit that they are typically higher than what is predicted by the Initial Misalignment Mechanism. If the decay is via a ``soft spectrum'' from loops produced close to the backreaction scale we find that $m_{\rm a}\approx 160\,\mu{\rm eV}$ and a detection frequency $f\approx 38\,{\rm GHz}$. If axions are emitted directly by the string network, and we use emission spectra reported in field theory simulations, then $m_{\rm a}\approx 4\,\mu{\rm eV}$ and $f\approx 1\,{\rm GHz}$, however this increases to $m_a \approx 125\,\mu{\rm eV}$ and $f\approx 30\,{\rm GHz}$ using our spectra for the case of an oscillating string. In all scenarios there are significant remaining uncertainties that we delineate.</description>

      <title>A Method to Constrain Preferential Emission and Spectator Dynamics in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06977v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Longitudinal particle production in heavy-ion collisions is influenced both by preferential emission from participating nucleons and by the breakup of spectator matter, yet quantifying these effects experimentally remains challenging. We introduce a Pearson correlation between spectator and charged-particle forward-backward asymmetries as an experimental probe of these phenomena. Using Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV simulated with A Multi-Phase Transport (AMPT) model, we validate that this correlator provides a robust, pseudorapidity-differential measure of the influence of preferential emission on the longitudinal structure of particle production. We further demonstrate that the correlation strength is sensitive to fluctuations in spectator number, which in experiments arise from evaporation and fragmentation of the spectator remnants. The proposed observable therefore offers a data-driven handle for constraining models of preferential emission and spectator breakup, thereby improving our understanding of the mechanisms that shape the final-state longitudinal distributions in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>CaloHadronic: a diffusion model for the generation of hadronic showers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating showers of particles in highly-granular calorimeters is a key frontier in the application of machine learning to particle physics. Achieving high accuracy and speed with generative machine learning models can enable them to augment traditional simulations and alleviate a major computing constraint. Recent developments have shown how diffusion based generative shower simulation approaches that do not rely on a fixed structure, but instead generate geometry-independent point clouds, are very efficient. We present a transformer-based extension to previous architectures which were developed for simulating electromagnetic showers in the highly granular electromagnetic calorimeter of the International Large Detector, ILD. The attention mechanism now allows us to generate complex hadronic showers with more pronounced substructure across both the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters. This is the first time that machine learning methods are used to holistically generate showers across the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeter in highly granular imaging calorimeter systems.</description>

      <title>The Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure for Mixed Dark Matter Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08792v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of the perturbative nonlinear dynamics of cosmological fluctuations in dark sectors comprising a fraction of non-cold dark matter, for example ultra-light axions or light thermal relics. These mixed dark matter scenarios exhibit suppressed growth of perturbations below a characteristic, cosmologically relevant, scale associated with the microscopic nature of the non-cold species. As a consequence, the scale-free nonlinear solutions developed for pure cold dark matter and for massive neutrinos do not, in general, apply. We thus extend the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure to model the coupled fluctuations of the cold and non-cold dark matter components, describing the latter as a perfect fluid with finite sound speed at linear level. We provide new analytical solutions wherever possible and devise an accurate and computationally tractable prescription for the evaluation of the one-loop galaxy power spectrum, which can be applied to probe mixed dark matter scenarios with current and upcoming galaxy survey data. As a first application of this framework, we derive updated constraints on the energy density in ultra-light axions using a combination of Planck and BOSS data. Our refined theoretical modeling leads to somewhat weaker bounds compared to previous analyses.</description>

      <title>SL(2N,C) Yang-Mills Theories: Direct Internal Forces and Emerging Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19210v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a four-dimensional gauge-gravity unification based on the \(SL(2N,\mathbb C)\) gauge theory taken in a universal Yang--Mills type setting. The accompanying tetrads are promoted to dynamical fields whose contracted invertibility condition is interpreted as a nonlinear sigma-model type length constraint. This triggers tetrad condensation and spontaneously breaks $\mathrm{SL}(2N, \mathbb{C})\to \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})\times\mathrm{SU}(N)$, lifting all noncompact directions. A special ghost-free curvature-squared Lagrangian provides a consistent quadratic sector, while an Einstein--Cartan linear curvature term is induced radiatively from fermion loops. Below the breaking scale, only a neutral tetrad associated with graviton and $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ vector fields remain massless, whereas axial-vector and tensor fields of the entire gauge multiplet acquire heavy masses. The matter sector clearly points to a deeper elementarity of \(SL(2N,\mathbb C)\) spinors, which can be identified with preon constituents whose bound states form the observed quarks and leptons. Anomaly matching between preons and composites singles out $N=8$. The chain $\mathrm{SL}(16,\mathbb{C})\to \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})\times\mathrm{SU}(8)$ then naturally yields three composite quark--lepton families, while filtering out extraneous heavy states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new mechanism for inflationary model building in the framework of metric-affine gravity. Such a mechanism involves an inflaton non-minimally coupled with the Holst invariant. If the non-minimal coupling function has a zero point and it is very steep at that same point, then the canonically normalized inflaton potential always features an exponential plateau, regardless of the shape of the original inflaton potential. The inflationary predictions in such a region are equivalent to the ones of Starobinsky inflation.</description>

      <title>Scattering Amplitudes and Conservative Binary Dynamics at $O(G^5)$ without Self-Force Truncation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the complete potential-graviton contributions to the conservative radial action and scattering angle for two non-spinning bodies in general relativity, accurate through fifth order in Newton's constant and including second-order self-force (2SF) effects. The calculation is carried out in the scattering-amplitude framework, combining the double copy, effective field theory, and multi-loop integration techniques based on integration by parts and differential equations. To address a major computational bottleneck, we develop improved integration-by-parts algorithms that render calculations at this order tractable. The post-Minkowskian amplitude is presented as a series expansion, following the strategy used earlier in maximal supergravity. For the first self-force sector, which involves only polylogarithmic functions, we also provide a closed-form analytic expression. For the second self-force sector, as in earlier supergravity work, we find nontrivial cancellations among contributions related to integrals supported on Calabi-Yau geometry.</description>
