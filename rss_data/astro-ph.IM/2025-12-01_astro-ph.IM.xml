      <title>The LMT 2 Millimeter Receiver System (B4R). I. Overview and Results of Science Demonstration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the results of the on-sky test and science demonstration conducted with the 2 mm receiver system, B4R, on the 50 m Large Millimeter Telescope (LMT), located at an altitude of 4600 m in Mexico. The B4R receiver was developed based on the dual-polarization sideband-separating mixer technology of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, and is equipped with a fast Fourier transform digital spectrometer, XFFTS. The primary science objective is the spectroscopic redshift identification of high-redshift dusty star-forming galaxies, complementing the existing 3 mm Redshift Search Receiver by enabling the detection of multiple carbon monoxide lines. Additionally, the B4R receiver broadens the range of science cases possible with the LMT, including astrochemistry, as the 2 mm band encompasses unique molecular lines such as deuterated molecules and shock tracers. During on-site commissioning in 2018 and 2019, we successfully demonstrated on-the-fly mapping and position-switching observations toward the Orion Molecular Cloud 1 and bright high-redshift dusty star-forming galaxies, respectively. We confirmed that the installed B4R system largely met its basic performance specifications. Furthermore, we measured the LMT's aperture efficiencies across the entire B4R frequency range (130-160 GHz), finding them to be roughly consistent with expectations based on a surface accuracy of 100 $\mu$m and the receiver optics design. These results with the B4R will enable the most sensitive single-dish spectroscopic observations at 2 mm using the LMT.</description>

      <title>A Catalogue of Mid-infrared Variable Sources from unTimely</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The WISE and NEOWISE missions have provided the only mid-infrared all-sky time-domain data, opening a unique observational window for variability studies. Yet, a comprehensive and systematic catalog of mid-infrared variable sources has remained unavailable. In this work, we construct the first large-scale mid-infrared variability catalog based on the unTimely coadded photometry, covering tens of millions of sources. By employing a Bayesian Gaussian mixture model with a Dirichlet process, we identified 8,256,042 variable sources in the W1 band and 7,147,661 in the W2 band, significantly expanding the landscape of known mid-infrared variables. In addition to robust variability metrics, our analysis highlights rare and extreme outliers through dedicated outlier-detection algorithms, enabling the discovery of unusual classes of objects such as eruptive young stellar objects, highly variable active galactic nuclei, and other rare transients. This unprecedented dataset provides a new foundation for time-domain astronomy in the mid-infrared, offering complementary insights to optical and near-infrared surveys, and opening the door to systematic investigations of stellar evolution, accretion processes, and dust-enshrouded astrophysical environments on a Galactic and extragalactic scale.</description>

      <title>A Novel Comb Generator for Frequency Phase Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the design and testing of a millimeter-wave frequency comb generator developed for the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) mission, a space Very-Long-Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) mission concept. The heart of BHEX is a dual-band receiver, centered at 90 and 270 GHz. This novel comb generator is based on a microwave phase modulator producing phase-coherent comb signals with multi-octave bandwidth, which will be used to track instrumental delays when injected into the receiver system. The comb generator was tested with astronomical receivers, which confirms its expected operation.</description>

      <title>Recovering Intrinsic Pulsar Profiles and Scattering Parameters with a CLEAN-Based Algorithm for High-Precision Timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In high precision pulsar timing, the accurate recovery of intrinsic pulsar profiles and their associated scattering parameters is of paramount importance. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study focused on the retrieval of intrinsic pulsar profiles through the utilization of a CLEAN-based algorithm as described in Bhat et al. (2003). The primary objective of this study is to elucidate the capabilities of our pipeline in the context of recovering the intrinsic profiles and associated parameters, such as dispersion measure, frequency scaling index, scattering time, pulse broadening function, and time of arrival residuals. We use simulated profiles to rigorously test and validate the efficiency of our recovery pipeline. These simulated profiles encompass single and multi-component Gaussians, designed to emulate the diverse nature of pulsar profiles. By comparing the recovered profiles and parameters to their injected values, as derived from simulations, we provide a robust evaluation of the pipeline's performance along with its drawbacks and limitations.</description>

      <title>The NANOGrav 12.5-year Data Set: Chromatic Noise Characterization &amp; Mitigation with Time-Domain Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) have recently entered the detection era, quickly moving beyond the goal of simply improving sensitivity at the lowest frequencies for the sake of observing the stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB), and focusing on its accurate spectral characterization. While all PTA collaborations around the world use Fourier-domain Gaussian processes to model the GWB and intrinsic long time-correlated (red) noise, techniques to model the time-correlated radio frequency-dependent (chromatic) processes have varied from collaboration to collaboration. Here we test a new class of models for PTA data, Gaussian processes based on time-domain kernels that model the statistics of the chromatic processes starting from the covariance matrix. As we will show, these models can be effectively equivalent to Fourier-domain models in mitigating chromatic noise. This work presents a method for Bayesian model selection across the various choices of kernel as well as deterministic chromatic models for non-stationary chromatic events and the solar wind. As PTAs turn towards high frequency (&gt;1/yr) sensitivity, the size of the basis used to model these processes will need to increase, and these time-domain models present some computational efficiencies compared to Fourier-domain models.</description>

      <title>Identifying Transient Hosts in LSST's Deep Drilling Fields with Galaxy Catalogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will enable astronomers to discover rare and distant astrophysical transients. Host-galaxy association is crucial for selecting the most scientifically interesting transients for follow-up. LSST Deep Drilling Field observations will detect distant transients occurring in galaxies below the detection limits of most all-sky catalogues. Here we investigate the use of pre-existing smaller-scale, field-specific catalogues for host identification in the Deep Drilling Fields (DDFs) and a ranking of their usefulness. We have compiled a database of 70 deep catalogues that overlap with the Rubin DDFs and constructed thin catalogues to be homogenised and combined for transient-host matching. A systematic ranking of their utility is discussed and applied based on the inclusion of information such as spectroscopic redshifts and morphological information. Utilising this data against a Dark Energy Survey (DES) sample of supernovae with pre-identified hosts in the XMM-LSS and ECDFS fields, we evaluate different methods for transient-host association in terms of both accuracy and processing speed. We also apply light data-cleaning techniques to identify and remove contaminants within our associations, such as diffraction spikes and blended galaxies where the correct host cannot be determined with confidence. We use a lightweight machine learning approach in the form of extreme gradient boosting to generate confidence scores in our contaminant selections and associated metrics. Finally, we discuss the computational expense of implementation within the LSST transient alert brokers, which will require efficient, fast-paced processing to handle the large stream of survey data.</description>

      <title>Structure-Preserving Unpaired Image Translation to Photometrically Calibrate JunoCam with Hubble Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Insights into Jupiter's atmospheric dynamics are vital for understanding planetary meteorology and exoplanetary gas giant atmospheres. To study these dynamics, we require high-resolution, photometrically calibrated observations. Over the last 9 years, the Juno spacecraft's optical camera, JunoCam, has generated a unique dataset with high spatial resolution, wide coverage during perijove passes, and a long baseline. However, JunoCam lacks absolute photometric calibration, hindering quantitative analysis of the Jovian atmosphere. Using observations from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) as a proxy for a calibrated sensor, we present a novel method for performing unpaired image-to-image translation (I2I) between JunoCam and HST, focusing on addressing the resolution discrepancy between the two sensors. Our structure-preserving I2I method, SP-I2I, incorporates explicit frequency-space constraints designed to preserve high-frequency features ensuring the retention of fine, small-scale spatial structures - essential for studying Jupiter's atmosphere. We demonstrate that state-of-the-art unpaired image-to-image translation methods are inadequate to address this problem, and, importantly, we show the broader impact of our proposed solution on relevant remote sensing data for the pansharpening task.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data from observations of pulsars made by Murriyang, the CSIRO Parkes 64-metre radio-telescope over the last three decades are more accessible than ever before, largely due to their storage in expansive long-term archives. Containing nearly 2 million files from more than 400 Parkes pulsar projects, CSIRO's Data Access Portal is leading the global effort in making pulsar data accessible. In this article, we present the current status of the archive, and provide information about the acquisition, analysis, reduction, visualisation, preservation and dissemination of these data sets. We highlight the importance of such an archive, and present a selection of new results emanating from archival data.</description>

      <title>The observation of Ground Level Enhancement GLE 77 by the neutron detectors of the Experimental Complex NEVOD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Ground Level Enhancement event was observed by neutron detectors designed for the registration of extensive air showers at the Experimental Complex NEVOD. The potential for that was unlocked by a recent modernization of the experimental setup that included implementation of additional channels for measuring neutron flux variation. At 10:15 UT on November 11, 2025, a sudden and significant increase in the neutron flux was detected by two installations: PRISMA-36 and URAN arrays. For the first time, a GLE has been recorded using a set of neutron detectors oriented at the extensive air shower studies. We present the measured EC NEVOD data and the results of the preliminary analysis of the observed GLE.</description>

      <title>SlotFlow: Amortized Trans-Dimensional Inference with Slot-Based Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inferring the number of distinct components contributing to an observation, while simultaneously estimating their parameters, remains a long-standing challenge across signal processing, astrophysics, and neuroscience. Classical trans-dimensional Bayesian methods such as Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) provide asymptotically exact inference but can be computationally expensive. Instead, modern deep learning provides a faster alternative to inference but typically assume fixed component counts, sidestepping the core challenge of trans-dimensionality. To address this, we introduce SlotFlow, a deep learning architecture for trans-dimensional amortized inference. The architecture processes time-series observations, which we represent jointly in the frequency and time domains through parallel encoders. A classifier produces a distribution over component counts K, and its MAP estimate specifies the number of slots instantiated. Each slot is parameterized by a shared conditional normalizing flow trained via permutation-invariant Hungarian matching. On sinusoidal decomposition with up to 10 overlapping components and Gaussian noise, SlotFlow achieves 99.85% cardinality accuracy and well-calibrated parameter posteriors, with systematic biases well below one posterior standard deviation. Direct comparison with RJMCMC shows close agreement in amplitude and phase, with Wasserstein distances $W_2 &lt; 0.01$ and $&lt; 0.03$, indicating that shared global context captures inter-component structure despite a factorized posterior. Frequency posteriors remain centered but exhibit 2-3x broader intervals, consistent with an encoder bottleneck in retaining long-baseline phase coherence. The method delivers a $\sim 10^6\times$ speedup over RJMCMC, suggesting applicability to time-critical workflows in gravitational-wave astronomy, neural spike sorting, and object-centric vision.</description>

      <title>Tools and Advancements towards Data Standardization of the MAGIC Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray astronomy is able to acquire large data volumes that astronomers use to draw scientific conclusions from. Ensuring the possibility of accessing and utilizing this data also after the lifetime of currently running experiments requires the use of a standardized data format. Following the data standardization format proposed by the gamma-ray astronomy community, we present 104 h of the first production of 166 h of data from the MAGIC Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes in standardized data format. Six datasets were processed from which three are presented, all of which have been analyzed and validated through comparison using the open-source software Gammapy and the MAGIC analysis software MARS.
  Furthermore, looking towards a large-scale production of standardized data and a legacy of the data taken by the MAGIC experiment, we have developed and implemented the automated database-driven MAGIC data reduction tool autoMAGIC which offers a reliable and reproducible way to produce high-level datasets. By utilizing the automatization of parameter configuration choices, the software allows for a reduction of human error as well as an acceleration in the production of standardized data. Here, we also show comparable results for data processed with manual and automatic methods.</description>

      <title>The HITRAN2024 methane update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectroscopic parameters of methane from many different studies were gathered to improve the HITRAN database towards its 2024 version. After a validation process using high-resolution FTS and CRDS spectra, about 60,000 lines of the four most abundant isotopologues were replaced from the dyad to the triacontad regions. These changes amount to 56,000 transition wavenumbers, 16,000 line intensities, 30,000 pressure-broadening half-widths, and 3500 assignments. 40,000 new lines were added, extending the database from 12,000 cm$^{-1}$ up to 14,000 cm$^{-1}$, and covering some gaps. A greater focus was brought on the pentad, octad, and tetradecad regions, targeted by several remote instruments. In these regions, comparisons of spectral fits from multiple line lists were performed, taking only the parameters that provide best fit for each line. In the $\nu _3$ band, in addition to replacing the previous values, gathered speed-independent pressure broadenings of $^{12}$CH$_4$ were used to fit Pade-approximant functions. These functions then replaced any outdated experimental data in $\nu _3$, missing data in the new lines, as well as the values that were determined to be outside their physical boundaries. The CH$_3$D broadenings were replaced in the same manner, for missing and low or high values, using a semi-empirical formula instead.</description>

Abstract: We present GANDALF, a JAX-based spectral solver for Kinetic Reduced MHD (KRMHD) turbulence designed to lower infrastructure barriers to plasma turbulence research. Existing production codes require specialized HPC infrastructure and compilation expertise, limiting participation to well-resourced institutions. GANDALF addresses this barrier by leveraging JAX's hardware abstraction to run transparently on laptops, desktop GPUs, and Apple Silicon without modification, enabling single-command installation via pip. We employ Fourier spectral methods for spatial discretization and Hermite spectral basis for velocity space, combined with an exponential integrating factor method that exactly propagates linear Alfv\'en waves, eliminating associated numerical stiffness. Verification demonstrates research-grade accuracy: linear Alfv\'en waves achieve machine precision (~10^{-15} relative error), the Orszag-Tang vortex conserves energy to 10^{-6} over two Alfv\'en times, and driven turbulence reproduces the expected k_perp^{-5/3} cascade spectrum. GANDALF enables rapid prototyping, parameter surveys, and educational applications on commodity hardware. The code complements rather than replaces established solvers like AstroGK and Viriato, prioritizing accessibility for researchers without HPC resources. By removing infrastructure barriers while maintaining spectral accuracy, GANDALF broadens participation in fundamental plasma turbulence research, particularly benefiting students, small research groups, and institutions in developing regions.</description>

      <title>Modeling Galaxy Formation in Cosmological Simulations with CRK-HACC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-consistently modeling baryonic effects in survey-scale cosmological simulations has become increasingly important as the diversity, precision, and statistical reach of modern observations continue to improve. The advent of exascale computing now enables a new generation of simulations that couple these physical processes across full-sky volumes with excellent statistical sampling of large-scale structure tracers such as galaxies, groups, and clusters. To support these efforts, we extend the CRK-HACC framework, a GPU-accelerated cosmological hydrodynamics code, with a suite of astrophysical subgrid models that simulate radiative cooling, star formation, stellar evolution, and AGN feedback within a numerically robust formulation optimized for scalability on modern exascale architectures. The models were selected and calibrated to reproduce observed galaxy stellar mass functions over the redshift range $0 &lt; z &lt; 2$ and cluster populations probed by cosmological surveys, capturing the large-scale baryonic evolution relevant for multi-wavelength, cross-correlated analyses. We describe the implementation and calibration of these models and demonstrate their consistency with observed galaxy population statistics and modern hydrodynamic simulations, establishing the baseline for exascale efforts that extend this framework to survey-scale volumes.</description>

      <title>Data span and frequency coverage requirements for robust detection and inference in PTAs: A case study with EPTA DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21933</link>

Abstract: Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) are approaching the sensitivity required for a $5\sigma$ detection of the nanohertz stochastic gravitational-wave background (GWB). This makes it crucial to deeply understand the behaviour of our analysis pipelines. A counterintuitive feature of the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) second data release is that restricting the dataset to the last 10.3 years (DR2new) increases the inferred GWB significance from $\leq2\sigma$ for the full 25-year dataset (DR2full) to $\geq3.5\sigma$. We investigate whether this behaviour indicates an anomaly or is a possible outcome of the pipeline. Using realistic, DR2-like simulations with varying timespans, we find that the first 10 years contribute little to the GWB evidence due to their limited frequency coverage. This produces substantial overlap between the HD S/N distributions of DR2full and DR2new. Random noise fluctuations therefore yield a higher GWB evidence in DR2new than in DR2full in $15\%$ of cases. Furthermore, $5\%$ of simulations match the HD S/N of the real data, indicating that the observed behaviour is consistent with being a $\sim2\sigma$ outcome due to noise fluctuations. Regardless of significance, DR2new simulations introduce biases in the GWB parameter estimation due to spectral leakage effects that are ignored in standard analyses and which flatten the inferred spectrum. Including leakage removes these biases, demonstrating the reliability of DR2new when the signal is properly modelled. Furthermore, we demonstrate that combining EPTA DR2full with long-baseline data from NANOGrav and PPTA, as well as low-frequency data from LOFAR and NenuFAR, significantly enhances GWB evidence and parameter accuracy. Finally, we examine the impact of the observation timespan and find that short-baseline datasets introduce strong amplitude biases and are ineffective at constraining the GWB.</description>

      <title>Searches for Post-Merger Gravitational Waves with CoCoA: Sensitivity Projections Across Large Template Banks for Current and Next-Generation Detectors</title>

Abstract: The multi-messenger detection of the binary neutron star (NS) merger GW170817 has revolutionized the field of gravitational wave (GW) astronomy. However, several important questions remain to be answered. One of these is the nature of the compact remnant leftover by GW170817 (short- or long-lived NS versus black hole). A key goal going forward is to understand the diversity of NS-NS merger remnants, and how such diversity maps onto their viability as gamma-ray burst (GRB) central engines. Here, we present a study aimed at assessing the sensitivity of triggered searches for intermediate-duration, post-merger GWs powered by long-lived GRB remnants using networks of current and future ground-based GW detectors and the Cross-Correlation Algorithm (CoCoA). We develop a Python-based framework to efficiently estimate CoCoA distance horizons for a broad range of post merger secular bar-mode waveforms and for different GW detector networks. This framework can be used to identify the most promising regions of parameter space in which to concentrate search efforts, helping design future search strategies to optimally balance search sensitivity and related parameter space gridding schema against computational cost.</description>

      <title>Probing CMB Polarization Gaussianity with the Statistics of Unpolarized Points: Non-Gaussianity of Planck Data and Prospects for Future B-Mode Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Gaussianity test of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization by analyzing the statistics of unpolarized points in the sky, classified into three distinct types: saddles, comets, and beaks. This classification of singular points where both Stokes parameters $Q$ and $U$ vanish stems from the fact that linear polarization is described by a second-rank tensor. By varying the number of spherical harmonics included in the polarization maps, one can probe the statistics of these singularities across a range of angular scales. Applying this method to Planck data we find clear evidence of non-Gaussianity in both $E$ and $B$ modes of polarization. This approach may be especially useful for processing data from current and future experiments such as the Simons Observatory (SO). In particular, it can help to assess the Gaussianity of a potentially detected B mode signal, thereby determining whether it arises from primordial tensor perturbations -- as predicted by inflation -- or from alternative sources such as polarized foregrounds (e.g., thermal dust), E-to-B mode leakage, systematics, photon noise or gravitational lensing. We have made publicly available software that finds
  unpolarized points of all three types on any polarization map in
  Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelation (HEALPix) format with full or incomplete sky coverage
  to enable testing of the observed signal for Gaussianity.</description>

      <title>Galaxy rotation curve based on RGB stars from the Gaia DR3 catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a detailed circular velocity curve of the Milky Way out to 20 kpc based on the radial component of the Jeans equation in cylindrical coordinates, assuming an axisymmetric gravitational potential, and show its dependence on azimuth. We use only Gaia DR3 data and aim to minimize the use of model data and various assumptions.
  To build the rotation curves, we used a sample of 4,547,980 RGB stars with measured spatial velocities, covering the Galactic plane in the range of Galactocentric cylindrical coordinates $150^\circ &lt; \theta &lt; 210^\circ$ and 0 &lt; R &lt; 20 kpc. We exclude systematics in the data that may arise from neglecting higher-order moments of the velocity distribution and their dispersions, as well as due to random measurement errors in Gaia.
  At the distance of the Sun, the circular velocity $V_{\rm c}(R_0)$ turned out to be ($229.63\pm0.30$) km s$^{-1}$, which is in good agreement with many previous estimates. The average slope of the circular velocity is $(-2.29\pm0.05)$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ obtained in the range of $R$ from 6 to 20 kpc and $\theta$ from 150 to 210 degrees. The determined circular velocity curve has some peculiarities in behavior near $R\sim$13 and 18 kpc, but in general it does not contradict the results of other authors up to distances where our statistics are reliable.</description>

      <title>Data-driven informative priors for Bayesian inference with quasi-periodic data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian computational strategies for inference can be inefficient in approximating the posterior distribution in models that exhibit some form of periodicity. This is because the probability mass of the marginal posterior distribution of the parameter representing the period is usually highly concentrated in a very small region of the parameter space. Therefore, it is necessary to provide as much information as possible to the inference method through the parameter prior distribution. We intend to show that it is possible to construct a prior distribution from the data by fitting a Gaussian process (GP) with a periodic kernel. More specifically, we want to show that it is possible to approximate the marginal posterior distribution of the hyperparameter corresponding to the period in the kernel. Subsequently, this distribution can be used as a prior distribution for the inference method. We use an adaptive importance sampling method to approximate the posterior distribution of the hyperparameters of the GP. Then, we use the marginal posterior distribution of the hyperparameter related to the periodicity in order to construct a prior distribution for the period of the parametric model. This workflow is empirical Bayes, implemented as a modular (cut) transfer of a GP posterior for the period to the parametric model. We applied the proposed methodology to both synthetic and real data. We approximated the posterior distribution of the period of the GP kernel and then passed it forward as a posterior-as-prior with no feedback. Finally, we analyzed its impact on the marginal posterior distribution.</description>

      <title>Differentiable N-body code for Galactic Dynamics -- Odisseo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce \textsc{Odisseo} (Optimized Differentiable Integrator for Stellar Systems Evolution of Orbits), a differentiable N-body code designed to constrain the gravitational potential of the Milky Way (MW) through dynamical modeling of accreted structures such as stellar streams. \textsc{Odisseo} is implemented in JAX, enabling just-in-time compilation, automatic differentiation, and hardware acceleration on GPUs and TPUs. The code features efficient, fully vectorized force calculations and exhibits near-linear scaling when distributing a single simulation across multiple GPUs, making it suitable for large scale optimization tasks. As a demonstration, we present a case study using a mock GD-1 stellar stream simulation, where we optimize four physical parameters via gradient descent: the accretion time and progenitor mass, as well as the masses of the host Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) halo and Miyamoto-Nagai (MN) disk. \textsc{Odisseo} accurately recovers stream morphology and underlying parameters in a differentiable and scalable framework, providing a powerful tool for dynamical studies of the Milky Way and its accreted substructures.</description>

Abstract: The Solar Close Observations and Proximity Experiments (SCOPE) mission will send a spacecraft into the solar atmosphere at a low altitude of just 5 R_sun from the solar center. It aims to elucidate the mechanisms behind solar eruptions and coronal heating, and to directly measure the coronal magnetic field. The mission will perform in situ measurements of the current sheet between coronal mass ejections and their associated solar flares, and energetic particles produced by either reconnection or fast-mode shocks driven by coronal mass ejections. This will help to resolve the nature of reconnections in current sheets, and energetic particle acceleration regions. To investigate coronal heating, the mission will observe nano-flares on scales smaller than 70 km in the solar corona and regions smaller than 40 km in the photosphere, where magnetohydrodynamic waves originate. To study solar wind acceleration mechanisms, the mission will also track the process of ion charge-state freezing in the solar wind. A key achievement will be the observation of the coronal magnetic field at unprecedented proximity to the solar photosphere. The polar regions will also be observed at close range, and the inner edge of the solar system dust disk may be identified for the first time. This work presents the detailed background, science, and mission concept of SCOPE and discusses how we aim to address the questions mentioned above.</description>

      <title>Spiral excitation in protoplanetary disks through gap-edge illumination: Distinctive kinematic signatures in CO isotopologues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution, near-infrared observations have revealed prominent, two-armed spirals in a multitude of systems, such as MWC~758, SAO~206462, and V1247~Ori. Alongside the classical theory of disk-companion interaction, shadow-based driving has come into vogue as a potential explanation for such large-scale substructures. How might these two mechanisms be distinguished from one another in observations? To investigate this question, we ran a pair of hydrodynamical simulations with \texttt{PLUTO}. One, with full radiation hydrodynamics and gas-grain collision, was designed to develop shadow-driven spirals at the outer gap edge of a sub-thermal, Saturn-mass planet. The other, with parametrized $\beta$-cooling, was set up to capture the more standard view of spiral wave excitation by a super-thermal, multi-Jupiter-mass, exterior planetary companion. Post-processing of these simulations with the Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MCRT) code \texttt{RADMC3D} revealed that strong vertical velocities in the shadow-driven case create a prominent two-armed feature in the moment-1 CO maps, particularly when the disk is viewed face-on in optically thicker isotopologues; such a feature is not seen in the standard planet-driven case. Conversely, the presence or absence of such signatures in two-armed spiral systems would distinguish those potentially driven by exterior, multi-Jupiter-mass companions, and thus help identify promising targets for future direct-imaging campaigns.</description>

      <title>The Hubble Ultracool Multiplicity (HUM) Survey. I. Characterizing Sensitivity to Companions at Sub-Diffraction Limit Separations with HST WFC3/IR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize the sensitivity of a double point-spread function (PSF) fitting algorithm -- employing empirical, position-dependent PSF models -- for detecting companions using the infrared channel of the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3/IR) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The observed separation distribution of known brown dwarf (BD) binaries is potentially biased towards separations larger than the angular resolution limits of current techniques. Previous imaging analyses suffer from incompleteness at separations $&lt;2\lambda/D$; our aim is to probe within this limit to identify previously missed companions. We evaluate the performance of our technique on artificial data across 8 WFC3/IR filters and a broad range of signal-to-noise ratios (S/N), determining our ability to accurately recover injected companions and identifying the region of parameter space where false positive fits are likely. Here, we demonstrate the capability of this technique to recover companions at sub-pixel separations on the WFC3/IR detector -- below the diffraction limit in multiple filters. For F160W at a typical S/N of 75, we resolve companions separated by 0.8 pixels (104 mas, $0.759\lambda/D$) at 1.5 magnitudes contrast with $&gt;90\%$ confidence. We achieve the closest angular resolution for any detection method with WFC3/IR imaging to date. Compared to previous BD multiplicity surveys with WFC3/IR, we achieve a 2.5$\times$ improvement in separation sensitivity at contrasts of 0-3 magnitudes in F127M. We have demonstrated that applying our improved technique to archival HST images of field BDs will thus probe down to separations of 1 au, in one of the largest high angular resolution surveys of such objects to date.</description>

      <title>Constraining dark matter halo profiles with symbolic regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter haloes are typically characterised by radial density profiles with fixed forms motivated by simulations (e.g. NFW). However, simulation predictions depend on uncertain dark matter physics and baryonic modelling. Here, we present a method to constrain halo density profiles directly from observations using Exhaustive Symbolic Regression (ESR), a technique that searches the space of analytic expressions for the function that best balances accuracy and simplicity for a given dataset. We test the approach on mock weak lensing excess surface density (ESD) data of synthetic clusters with NFW profiles. Motivated by real data, we assign each ESD data point a constant fractional uncertainty and vary this uncertainty and the number of clusters to probe how data precision and sample size affect model selection. For fractional errors around 5%, ESR recovers the NFW profile even from samples as small as 20 clusters. At higher uncertainties representative of current surveys, simpler functions are favoured over NFW, though it remains competitive. This preference arises because weak lensing errors are smallest in the outskirts, causing the fits to be dominated by the outer profile. ESR therefore provides a robust, simulation-independent framework both for testing mass models and determining which features of a halo's density profile are genuinely constrained by the data.</description>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study addressing pile-up effects in single photoelectron counting with R-11265 Hamamatsu multi-anode photomultiplier tubes (MAPMTs) equipped with the SPACIROC-3 ASIC. Extended dead time in the electronics causes saturation and quenching of the counting rate, an effect we counter by inverting the pile-up plot once the double pulse resolution is determined. Our work combines extensive numerical simulations with experimental validations to quantify the statistical uncertainties associated with the corrected event rates. We apply this methodology to the Mini-EUSO experiment onboard the International Space Station where machine learning techniques are employed to extract pixel-by-pixel double pulse resolutions from long-term photon count histograms. This integrated approach enables the accurate recovery of true photon fluxes essential for studying ELVES, meteors and other transient phenomena detected by Mini-EUSO.</description>

      <title>Deep Investigation of Neutral Gas Origins (DINGO): Options for the Processing and Storage of Radio Astronomy Data for robust Deep Spectral Line Imaging in the SKA-Era using uv-Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02285v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The next generation of radio astronomy telescopes are challenging existing data analysis paradigms, as they have an order of magnitude more antennas and larger bandwidth. Foremost amongst these are deep spectral line surveys, because these have the largest number of epochs and spectral channels per dataset. For example, the Deep Investigation of Neutral Gas Origins (DINGO) project on the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) aims to observe over 3,000 hours spread over hundreds of observing sessions, covering two pointings and two frequency settings. The two primary problems encountered when processing this data are the need for storage and that processing is primarily I/O limited. To address these issues, we have implemented an deep imaging pipeline based on the storage of an intermediate data product in the software ASKAPSoft, that of the uv-gridded data, and have demonstrated lossy and lossless compression of this data on ASKAP, using MGARD and ADIOS2 libraries. We find data compression ratios from a factor of 7 (lossless) up to 20 (using lossy compression with an absolute error bound of $10^{-4}$), and processing is faster by a factor of 7 for lossless compression. We discuss the effectiveness of lossy MGARD compression and its adherence to the designated error bounds, the trade-off between these error bounds and the corresponding compression ratios, as well as the potential consequences of these I/O and storage improvements on the science quality of the data products.</description>

      <title>HOLISMOKES XVIII: Detecting strongly lensed SNe Ia from time series of multi-band LSST-like imaging data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong gravitationally lensed supernovae (LSNe), though rare, are exceptionally valuable probes for cosmology and astrophysics. Upcoming time-domain surveys like the Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) offer a major opportunity to discover them in large numbers. Early identification is crucial for timely follow-up observations. We develop a deep learning pipeline to detect LSNe using multi-band, multi-epoch image cutouts. Our model is based on a 2D convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM2D) architecture, designed to capture both spatial and temporal correlations in time-series imaging data. Predictions are made after each observation in the time series, with accuracy improving as more data arrive. We train the model on realistic simulations derived from Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) data, which closely matches LSST in depth and filters. This work focuses exclusively on Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). LSNe Ia are injected onto HSC luminous red galaxies (LRGs) at various phases of evolution to create positive examples. Negative examples include variable sources from HSC Transient Survey (including unclassified transients), and simulated unlensed SNe Ia in LRG and spiral galaxies. Our multi-band model shows rapid classification improvements during the initial few observations and quickly reaches high detection efficiency: at a fixed false-positive rate (FPR) of $0.01\%$, the true-positive rate (TPR) reaches $\gtrsim 60\%$ by the 7th observation and exceeds $\gtrsim 70\%$ by the 9th. Among the negative examples, SNe in LRGs remain the primary source of FPR, as they can resemble their lensed counterparts under certain conditions. The model detects quads more effectively than doubles and performs better on systems with larger image separations. Although trained and tested on HSC-like data, our approach applies to any cadenced imaging survey, particularly LSST.</description>

      <title>VIPCALs: A fully automated calibration pipeline for very long baseline interferometry data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) is a powerful technique that can achieve sub-milliarcsecond resolution. However, it requires complex and often manual post-correlation calibration to correct for instrumental, geometric, and propagation-related errors. Unlike connected-element interferometers, VLBI arrays typically provide raw visibilities rather than science-ready data, and existing pipelines are largely semi-automated and reliant on user supervision. We present VIPCALs, a fully automated, end-to-end calibration pipeline for continuum VLBI data that operates without human intervention or prior knowledge of the dataset. Designed for scalability to thousands of sources and heterogeneous archival observations, VIPCALs addresses the needs of initiatives such as the Search for Milli-Lenses (SMILE) project. Implemented in Python using ParselTongue, VIPCALs reproduces the standard AIPS calibration workflow in a fully unsupervised mode. Besides the usual calibration tasks, the pipeline also performs automatic reference antenna selection, calibrator identification, and generates diagnostic outputs for inspection. We validated it on a representative sample of Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) data corresponding to 1000 sources from the SMILE project. VIPCALs successfully calibrated observations of 955 of the test sources across multiple frequency bands. Over 91% of the calibrated datasets achieved successful fringe fitting on target in at least half of the solutions attempted. The median ratio of calibrated visibilities to initial total visibilities was 0.87. The average processing time was below 10 minutes per dataset, demonstrating both efficiency and scalability. VIPCALs enables robust, reproducible, and fully automated calibration of VLBI continuum data, significantly lowering the entry barrier for VLBI science and making large-scale projects like SMILE feasible.</description>

      <title>A Less Terrifying Universe? Mundanity as an Explanation for the Fermi Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Applying a principle of "radical mundanity", this paper examines explanations for the lack of strong evidence for the presence of technology-using extraterrestrial civilizations (ETCs) in the Galaxy - the Fermi paradox. With this principle, the prospect that the Galaxy contains a modest number of civilizations is preferred, where none have achieved technology levels sufficient to accomplish large-scale astro-engineering or lack the desire to do so. This consideration also leads to the expectation that no ETC will colonize a large fraction of the Galaxy, even using robotic probes, and that there are no long-duration high-power beacons. However, there is a reasonable chance that we may make contact on a short, by historical standards, timescale. This event would be momentous, but could still leave us slightly disappointed. Such a Universe would be less terrifying than either of the two possibilities in the quote generally attributed to Arthur C. Clarke on whether we are alone or not. Also, if there is a modest number of ETCs in the Galaxy, that would suggest that there is a large number of planets with some form of life.</description>

      <title>Measurements of the Birks' coefficient of GAGG:Ce using hard X-rays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inorganic scintillators continue to be widely used within astrophysical X-ray and gamma-ray detectors. This is in part thanks to the development of new scintillators, such as GAGG:Ce, as well as the availability of new scintillator readout sensors such as Silicon Photomultipliers and Silicon Drift Detectors. In order to use such scintillator materials for spectrometry or polarimetry, a detailed understanding of their response is important. One parameter that can affect the scintillator performance, particularly at lower photon energies, is their Birks' coefficient, which correlates the relative light yield to the ionization energy density. While for many high-Z inorganic scintillators this effect can be ignored, for GAGG:Ce this appears to not be the case. Here we provide a measurement of the Birks' coefficient for GAGG:Ce using data from a detector irradiated in the 20-80~keV energy range at the LARIX-A X-ray beam in Ferrara, Italy. While the effects due to Birks' law are visible below 30 keV, they also significantly influence the performance of GAGG:Ce performance near one of the K-edges, affecting both the measured gain and the energy resolution. Here, we use beam test data to derive the Birks' coefficient from GAGG:Ce. The results indicate that for usage in hard X-ray and soft gamma-ray missions, this coefficient has a significant effect on the measurements.</description>

Abstract: The PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) mission concept is a proposed mission to NASA's Astrophysics Probe Explorer (APEX) call. The concept features a cryogenically cooled 1.8 m diameter telescope, and is designed to carry two science instruments covering the 24 to 264 $\mu$m wavelength range: an imaging polarimeter (PRIMAger) and a spectrometer (FIRESS). The majority of PRIMA's time (75%) will be open to observations proposed by the community (General Observer science / GO), and all of data will be publicly available for archival research (Guest Investigator science / GI). Following up on the successful community engagement created by the first volume of the GO PRIMA Science Book (arXiv:2310.20572), Volume 2 gathers 120 new and updated contributed science cases which could be performed within the context of the PRIMA GO/GI program. This volume reflects the strong development of the community interest, awareness and involvement in PRIMA, and further develops how PRIMA's unprecedented capabilities can be leveraged for an impactful and innovative GO/GI program covering most areas of astrophysics and over 90% of the scientific questions and discovery areas in the Astro2020 decadal survey.</description>

      <title>Deep Investigation of Neutral Gas Origins (DINGO): Options for robust Deep Spectral Line Imaging in the SKA-Era</title>

Abstract: The data storage requirements for deep spectral line observations with next-generation radio interferometers like the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) are extremely challenging. The default strategy is to reduce data after each daily observation and stack the resulting images. Although this approach is computationally efficient, it risks propagating systematic errors and significantly degrades the final data quality. However, storage and computation requirements for a traditional way to image the entire deep dataset together are prohibitively expensive. We present an alternative \textit{uv}-grid stacking method and compare its scientific outcomes with both the traditional approach, which processes all data jointly and serves as the best-possible result, and the default image-stacking method. Our technique involves halting the standard imaging pipeline after the daily residual visibility grids are formed. These grids are then stacked and jointly deconvolved to combine many epochs of data. Using the traditional approach as a benchmark, we show that image-stacking recovers only 92\% of the true {\HI} flux. In contrast, our \textit{uv}-grid stacking method recovers 99\%, which is in excellent agreement with the traditional method within the noise limits. Furthermore, image-stacking introduces significant non-physical artefacts, such as negative bowls around strong sources, indicating poor deconvolution and a loss of physical information. Based on these findings, we intend to apply the \textit{uv}-grid stacking to the Deep Investigation of Neutral Gas Origins (DINGO) survey on ASKAP and strongly recommend this or a similar approach for future radio astronomy facilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01413v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen rapid progress in calculations of gravitational waveforms from asymmetric compact binaries containing spinning secondaries. Here we outline a complete waveform-generation scheme, through first post-adiabatic order (1PA) in gravitational self-force theory, for generic secondary spin and generic (eccentric, precessing) orbital configurations around a generic Kerr primary. We emphasize the utility of a Fermi-Walker frame in parametrizing the secondary spin, and we analyse precession and nutation effects in the spin-orbit dynamics. We also explain convenient gauge choices within the waveform-generation scheme, and the gauge invariance of the resulting waveform. Finally, we highlight that, thanks to recent results due to Grant and Witzany et al., all relevant spin effects at 1PA order can now be computed without evaluating local self-forces or torques.</description>
