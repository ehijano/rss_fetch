      <title>Enumeration of groups in some special varieties of $A$-groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find an upper bound for the number of groups of order $n$ up to isomorphism in the variety $G = A_pA_qA_r$, where $p$, $q$ and $r$ are distinct primes. We also find a bound on the orders and on the number of conjugacy classes of subgroups that are maximal amongst the subgroups of the general linear group that are also in the variety $A_qA_r$.</description>

      <title>Simplicial maps between spheres and Davis' manifolds with positive simplicial volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the simplicial volume of manifolds obtained from Davis' reflection group trick, the goal being characterizing those having positive simplicial volume. In particular, we focus on checking whether manifolds in this class with nonzero Euler characteristic have positive simplicial volume (Gromov asked whether this holds in general for aspherical manifolds). This leads to a combinatorial problem about triangulations of spheres: we define a partial order on the set of triangulations -- the relation being the existence of a nonzero-degree simplicial map between two triangulations -- and the problem is to find the minimal elements of a specific subposet. We solve explicitly the case of triangulations of the two-dimensional sphere, and then perform an extensive analysis, with the help of computer searches, of the three-dimensional case. Moreover, we present a connection of this problem with the theory of graph minors.</description>

      <title>Simply transitive geodesics and omnipotence of lattices in PSL$(2,\mathbb{C})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the isometry group of a finite-volume hyperbolic 3-manifold acts simply transitively on many of its closed geodesics. Combining this observation with the Virtual Special Theorems of the first author and Wise, we show that every non-arithmetic lattice in PSL$(2,\mathbb{C})$ is the full group of orientation-preserving isometries for some other lattice and that the orientation-preserving isometry group of a finite-volume hyperbolic 3-manifold acts non-trivially on the homology of some finite-sheeted cover.</description>

      <title>Morita equivalence classes of $2$-blocks with abelian defect groups of rank $4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05734v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify all $2$-blocks with abelian defect groups of rank $4$ up to Morita equivalence. The classification holds for blocks over a suitable discrete valuation ring as well as for those over an algebraically closed field. An application is that Brou\'{e}'s abelian defect group conjecture holds for all blocks under consideration here.</description>

      <title>Blocks whose defect groups are Suzuki $2$-groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify up to Morita equivalence all blocks whose defect groups are Suzuki $2$-groups. The classification holds for blocks over a suitable discrete valuation ring as well as for those over an algebraically closed field, and in fact holds up to basic Morita equivalence. As a consequence Donovan's conjecture holds for Suzuki $2$-groups. A corollary of the proof is that Suzuki Sylow $2$-subgroups of finite groups with no nontrivial odd order normal subgroup are trivial intersection.</description>

      <title>Submonoid Membership in n-dimensional lamplighter groups and S-unit equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that Submonoid Membership is decidable in n-dimensional lamplighter groups $(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}) \wr \mathbb{Z}^n$ for any prime $p$ and integer $n$. More generally, we show decidability of Submonoid Membership in semidirect products of the form $\mathcal{Y} \rtimes \mathbb{Z}^n$, where $\mathcal{Y}$ is any finitely presented module over the Laurent polynomial ring $\mathbb{F}_p[X_1^{\pm}, \ldots, X_n^{\pm}]$. Combined with a result of Shafrir (2024), this gives the first example of a group $G$ and a finite index subgroup $\widetilde{G} \leq G$, such that Submonoid Membership is decidable in $\widetilde{G}$ but undecidable in $G$.
  To obtain our decidability result, we reduce Submonoid Membership in $\mathcal{Y} \rtimes \mathbb{Z}^n$ to solving S-unit equations over $\mathbb{F}_p[X_1^{\pm}, \ldots, X_n^{\pm}]$-modules. We show that the solution set of such equations is effectively $p$-automatic, extending a result of Adamczewski and Bell (2012). As an intermediate result, we also obtain that the solution set of the Knapsack Problem in $\mathcal{Y} \rtimes \mathbb{Z}^n$ is effectively $p$-automatic.</description>

      <title>Soficity of free extensions of effective subshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02620v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group and $H\leqslant G$ a subgroup. The free extension of an $H$-subshift $X$ to $G$ is the $G$-subshift $\widetilde{X}$ whose configurations are those for which the restriction to every coset of $H$ is a configuration from $X$. We study the case of $G = H \times K$ for infinite and finitely generated groups $H$ and $K$: on the one hand we show that if $K$ is nonamenable and $H$ has decidable word problem, then the free extension to $G$ of any $H$-subshift which is effectively closed is a sofic $G$-subshift. On the other hand we prove that if both $H$ and $K$ are amenable, there are always $H$-subshifts which are effectively closed by patterns whose free extension to $G$ is non-sofic. We also present a few applications in the form of a new simulation theorem and a new class of groups which admit strongly aperiodic SFTs.</description>

      <title>Effective dynamical systems beyond dimension zero and factors of SFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using tools from computable analysis we develop a notion of effectiveness for general dynamical systems as those group actions on arbitrary spaces that contain a computable representative in their topological conjugacy class. Most natural systems one can think of are effective in this sense, including some group rotations, affine actions on the torus and finitely presented algebraic actions. We show that for finitely generated and recursively presented groups, every effective dynamical system is the topological factor of a computable action on an effectively closed subset of the Cantor space. We then apply this result to extend the simulation results available in the literature beyond zero-dimensional spaces. In particular, we show that for a large class of groups, many of these natural actions are topological factors of subshifts of finite type.</description>
