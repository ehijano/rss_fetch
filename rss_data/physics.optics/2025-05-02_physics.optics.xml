      <title>Monolithically Integrated C-Band Quantum Emitters on Foundry Silicon Photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state spin-based quantum systems have emerged as popular platforms for quantum networking applications due to their optical interfaces, their long-lived quantum memories, and their natural compatibility with semiconductor manufacturing. Photonic crystal cavities are often used to enhance radiative emission; however, fabrication of the necessary subwavelength cavities is typically limited to small batch electron beam lithography. In this work, we demonstrate high quality factor, small mode volume nanobeam cavities fabricated on a scalable silicon photonic foundry platform. The foundry fabricated cavities are then interfaced with single erbium ions through backend deposition of TiO2 thin films lightly doped with erbium. Single ion lifetime measurements indicate Purcell enhancement up to about 500, thereby demonstrating a route toward manufacturable deterministic single photon sources in the telecom C-band.</description>

      <title>Super Bound States in the Continuum: Analytic Framework, Parametric Dependence, and Fast Direct Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In periodic structures such as photonic crystal (PhC) slabs, a bound state in the continuum (BIC) is always surrounded by resonant states with their $Q$-factor following $Q\sim 1/|{\bm \beta}-{\bm \beta}_*|^{2p}$, where ${\bm \beta}$ and ${\bm \beta}_*$ are the Bloch wavevectors of the resonant state and the BIC, respectively. Typically $p=1$, but special BICs, known as the super-BICs, have $p\geq 2$. Super-BICs can significantly enhance the $Q$-factor of nearby resonant states and reduce scattering losses due to fabrication imperfections, making them highly advantageous in practical applications. However, super-BICs, requiring the tuning of structural parameters for their realization, are generally not robust. In this work, we develop a theory to classify super-BICs, determine the minimal number $n$ of tunable structural parameters needed, and show that super-BICs form a manifold of dimension $(m-n)$ in an $m$-dimensional parameter space. We also propose a direct method for computing super-BICs in structures with different symmetry. Numerical examples demonstrate that our method is far more efficient than existing methods when $n &gt; 1$. In addition, we study the effect of structural perturbations, focusing on the transition from super-BICs to generic BICs. Finally, we analyze a class of degenerate BICs that can be regarded as Dirac points, and show that they are the intersections of super-BICs in a relevant parameter space. Our work advances the theoretical understanding on super-BICs, and has both direct and potential applications in optical design and light-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Experimental Investigation of Twist Conservation in Nonlinear Optical Three-Wave Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct an experimental investigation into the conservation of the twist phase in Twisted Gaussian Schell Model (TGSM) beams during both up- and down-conversion three-wave mixing nonlinear processes. Independently generated TGSM beams, prepared with varying twist parameters, are used to pump and seed the nonlinear interactions. The resulting beams are then analyzed to determine their twist properties. Our findings demonstrate that the twists of the up- and down-converted beams depend on those of the pump and seed beams. Additionally, the results indicate that the twist phase is conserved throughout the process, in qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions. This study is motivated by the increasing potential applications of TGSM beams in various fields.</description>

      <title>Control of Photon Dynamics in Non-Euclidean Polygonal Microcavities by Joint Geometric Curvatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Euclidean geometry has recently emerged as a powerful tool, offering new insights and applications in optical microcavities supporting Whispering Gallery Modes (WGMs). In this study, we extend the concept of polygonal microcavities to non-Euclidean spaces by developing a unified model that incorporates a joint geometric parameter of curvatures. This system uncovers a range of unexplored phenomena, mechanisms, and concepts that are unique to curved spaces. Notably, we observe dissipative states characterized by hyperbolic fixed points (HFPs) that appear exclusively in non-Euclidean scenarios, leading to the formation of phase diagrams within the parametric space of curvatures. Our results reveal phase transitions across geometric boundaries, marked by abrupt changes in the cavity quality factor. These transitions are strongly influenced by the wavelike nature of photon trajectories, offering intriguing insights into quantum chaos within curved spaces. Additionally, we discover that cavities with geodesic side lines exhibit a remarkable symmetry-driven avoidance of such phase transitions, highlighting the profound connection between physical dynamics and spatial geometry. Our findings establish a promising platform for optical simulations of non-Euclidean quantum chaos and open up potential applications in on-chip photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Temporal coupled mode theory for high-$Q$ resonances in dielectric metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a coupled mode theory for resonant response from quasi-guided modes in periodic dielectric metasurfaces. First, we derived a generic set of constraints imposed onto the parameters of the temporal coupled mode theory by energy conservation and time-reversal symmetry in an invariant form that allows for asymmetry between the coupling and decoupling coefficients. The proposed approach is applied to the problem of Fano resonances induced by isolated quasi-guided modes in the regime of specular reflection. Our central result is a generic formula for the line-shape of the Fano resonance in transmittance for the lossless metasurfaces in the framework of 2D electrodynamics. We consider all possible symmetries of the metasurface elementary cell and uncover the effects that the symmetry incurs on the profile of the Fano resonance induced by an isolated high-$Q$ mode. It is shown that the proposed approach correctly describes the presence of robust reflection and transmission zeros in the spectra as well as the spectral signatures of bound states in the continuum. The approach is applied to uniderictionally guided resonant modes in metasurfaces with an asymmetric elementary cell. It is found that the existence of such modes and the transmittance in their spectral vicinity are consistent with the theoretical predictions. Furthermore, the theory predicts that a uniderictionally guided resonant mode is dual to a counter-propagating mode of a peculiar type which is coupled with the outgoing wave on both sides of the metasurface but, nonetheless, exhibits only a single-sided coupling with incident waves.</description>

      <title>Multi-dimensional optical imaging on a chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light inherently consists of multiple dimensions beyond intensity, including spectrum, polarization, etc. The coupling among these high-dimensional optical features provides a compressive characterization of intrinsic material properties. Because multiple optical dimensions are intrinsically coupled rather than independent, analyzing their inter-relationships and achieving their simultaneous acquisition is essential. Despite the existing optical techniques to obtain different-dimensional data with cumbersome systems, joint acquisition of multi-dimensional optical information on a chip is still a serious challenge, limited by intensity-only photoelectric detection, single-dimensional optical elements, and finite bandwidth. In this work, we report a multi-dimensional on-chip optical imaging (MOCI) architecture, which is functionally composed of three layers, including a multi-dimensional encoding layer to simultaneously encode different dimensions of incident light, an image acquisition layer to collect coupled intensity data, and a computational reconstruction layer to recover multi-dimensional images from a single frame of coupled measurement. Following the MOCI architecture, we for the first time fabricated a real-time (74 FPS) on-chip polarization-hyperspectral imaging (PHI) sensor, with 2048$\times$2448 pixels at 61 spectral channels covering the VIS-NIR range and 4 polarization states. We applied the PHI sensor for simultaneously resolving hyperspectral and polarization information of complex scenes, and for the first time demonstrated new applications including hyperspectral 3D modeling with normal and height maps, and hyperspectral sensing against strong reflection and glare...</description>

      <title>A General Model for Linearly Polarized Optical Vector Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an approach for deriving a broad class of propagation models for inhomogeneously, linearly polarized ``vector'' beams. Our formulation leverages a complex scalar potential along with an appropriately constructed Lagrangian energy density. Importantly, we show that polarization inhomogeneities can be included by simple addition of a spatially dependent polarization angle to the complex potential phase. Thus, phase and polarization are seen to be equivalent from an energy perspective. As part of our development, we also show how the complex scalar potential arises naturally when considering polarization angle as a field symmetry during construction of the Lagrangian. We further show that the definition of linear momentum density in terms of the complex potential holds a distinct advantage over the conventional definition for inhomogeneously polarized beams.</description>

      <title>Closed-form expressions for the centroid-tilt error due to scintillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In adaptive optics, the tracker and wavefront sensor commonly measure irradiance centroids (in their respective focal planes) to estimate the turbulence-degraded wavefront in the pupil plane. Several factors affect the accuracy of these centroid measurements, including noise, speckle, and scintillation. The centroid-tilt or ``C-tilt'' errors due to these factors have been studied by numerous researchers; however, to our knowledge, closed-form expressions for the C-tilt error due to scintillation have not been found.
  In this paper, we derive such expressions, assuming spherical-wave illumination of the pupil, a path-invariant index of refraction structure constant $C_n^2$, and Kolmogorov turbulence. We compare the analytically predicted C-tilt values to those obtained by wave-optics simulations. The agreement, at large, is quite good over a wide range of conditions. As a result, researchers and engineers will find this analysis useful when quantifying the performance of centroid-based trackers and wavefront sensors, both of which are critical adaptive-optics components.</description>

      <title>Wavefront errors in two-wavelength adaptive optics systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-wavelength adaptive optics (AO) systems sense turbulence-induced wavefront distortions using an artificial beacon or natural guidestar at one wavelength, while correcting and possibly transmitting at another. Although most existing AO systems employ this methodology, the literature on atmospheric turbulence correction and AO system design generally focuses on performance at a single wavelength, neglecting the two-wavelength nature of the problem. In this paper, we undertake a rigorous study of the relevant wavefront errors necessary to quantify two-wavelength AO system performance.
  Since most AO systems employ separate tilt and higher-order correcting subsystems, our analysis mirrors this division, and we begin with higher-order wavefront errors. Utilizing Mellin transform techniques, we derive closed-form relations for the piston-removed and piston- and tilt-removed variances. The former is a measure of the total, residual wavefront error that a two-wavelength AO systems experiences; while the latter, quantifies the residual wavefront error due to higher-order aberrations.
  We then proceed to tilt or tracking errors and derive the two-wavelength Zernike- and gradient-tilt variances. Zernike tilt is the actual amount of tilt in the turbulent atmosphere; yet, most AO tracking subsystems measure gradient tilt. Consequently, we also derive the two-wavelength gradient-tilt, Zernike-tilt variance -- also known as centroid anisoplanatism -- to quantify this error.
  Lastly, we validate our analysis by performing two-wavelength wave-optics simulations and comparing the results to theory. We observe excellent agreement among the simulated results and our theoretical predictions.
  The analysis and findings presented in this paper will be useful in the characterization of existing, and the design of new, two-wavelength AO systems.</description>

      <title>Why the hyperbolic polaritons are hyperbolic?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polaritons travelling along a hyperbolic medium's surface have recently sparked significant interest in nanophotonics for the unprecedented manipulation ability on light at the nanoscale in a planar way, promising potential nano-optical applications, especially in two-dimensional circuitry. Despite of being named hyperbolic polaritons, the hyperbolic nature has not been thoroughly revealed since an analytical description of the Iso-frequency contour is still elusive. In this work, we proposed an analytical form for describing the iso-frequency contour of the hyperbolic polaritons, showcasing their strictly hyperbolic nature. Such an analytical form is obtained based on the focusing behavior of the hyperbolic polaritons and verified by both the published data from commonly used hyperbolic media systems of the hyperbolic polaritons and our own experimental characterizations on a hyperbolic metamaterial film. By presenting a concise and intuitive physical image, this work may provide a groundbreaking methodology in developing novel hyperbolic polaritons based optical devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic-crystal resonators (PhCRs) have been widely used in nonlinear integrated photonics for frequency engineering applications. A microwave-assisted frequency converter based on PhCRs highlights its precise control of frequency (enabled by creation of a pair of supermodes by a corrugated PhCR) and bidirectional frequency conversion. In this paper, we demonstrate a high-quality PhCR on a hybrid silicon nitride-on-lithium niobate-on-insulator (SiN-on-LNOI) platform for the first time for voltage-driven flexible frequency conversion using the electro-optic effect (0.85 pm/V). The fabricated PhCR has a large supermode splitting bandwidth = 14.6 GHz and an intrinsic quality factor (Q) = 147,000. Using different periodic corrugation amplitudes in the fabricated PhCRs enables the precise control of mode splitting with a ratio of 93.5 MHz/nm between the mode splitting bandwidth and the corrugation amplitude.</description>

      <title>Physical Limits and Optimal Synthesis of Beyond Diagonal Anomalous Scatterers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing metasurfaces for anomalous scattering is fundamental to designing reflector arrays, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, and metasurface antennas. However, the basic cost of steering scattering into non-specular directions is not fully understood. This paper derives tight physical bounds on anomalous scattering using antenna array systems equipped with non-local matching networks. The matching networks are explicitly synthesized based on the solutions of the optimization problems that define these bounds. Furthermore, we analyze fundamental limits for metasurface antennas implemented with metallic and dielectric materials exhibiting minimal loss within a finite design region. The results reveal a typical 6dB reduction in bistatic radar cross section (RCS) in anomalous directions compared to the forward direction. Numerical examples complement the theory and illustrate the inherent cost of achieving anomalous scattering relative to forward or specular scattering for canonical configurations.</description>

      <title>Symmetry induced pairing in dark excitonic condensate at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bose Einstein condensate of optically inactive (dark) intervalley excitons must be inherently multi-component because of the point group and the time-reversal symmetries of a crystal. Accordingly, a number of the condensate components N$_v$ is determined by the symmetry. Since the valleys hosting such excitons are separated by large quasi-momenta, the minimal inter-component Josephson-type coupling can only be established between pairs of excitons from the time-reversed valleys. As a result, a paired condensate can emerge at finite temperature, that is, the phase where individual valleys are not characterized by the condensate order, while the order exists for the pairs from the time-reversed valleys. This prediction follows from the elementary mean field analysis regardless of the dimensionality. However, as Monte Carlo simulations show, no such a phase exists in 3D crystals. Instead, the N$_v$-component condensation proceeds as the Ist order transition from the normal state. The paired phase does exist in 2D for N$_v\geq 6$. It forms by Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition from the high temperature (normal) phase. Upon further lowering temperature, a second transition transforms the paired phase into the N$_v$-component condensate.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust and Generalizable Gerchberg Saxton based Physics Inspired Neural Networks for Computer Generated Holography: A Sensitivity Analysis Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) enables applications in holographic augmented reality (AR), 3D displays, systems neuroscience, and optical trapping. The fundamental challenge in CGH is solving the inverse problem of phase retrieval from intensity measurements. Physics-inspired neural networks (PINNs), especially Gerchberg-Saxton-based PINNs (GS-PINNs), have advanced phase retrieval capabilities. However, their performance strongly depends on forward models (FMs) and their hyperparameters (FMHs), limiting generalization, complicating benchmarking, and hindering hardware optimization. We present a systematic sensitivity analysis framework based on Saltelli's extension of Sobol's method to quantify FMH impacts on GS-PINN performance. Our analysis demonstrates that SLM pixel-resolution is the primary factor affecting neural network sensitivity, followed by pixel-pitch, propagation distance, and wavelength. Free space propagation forward models demonstrate superior neural network performance compared to Fourier holography, providing enhanced parameterization and generalization. We introduce a composite evaluation metric combining performance consistency, generalization capability, and hyperparameter perturbation resilience, establishing a unified benchmarking standard across CGH configurations. Our research connects physics-inspired deep learning theory with practical CGH implementations through concrete guidelines for forward model selection, neural network architecture, and performance evaluation. Our contributions advance the development of robust, interpretable, and generalizable neural networks for diverse holographic applications, supporting evidence-based decisions in CGH research and implementation.</description>

      <title>Infrared photothermal heterodyne imaging in thermally thick medium for thermo-optic property characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring temperature fields in semi-transparent media requires the knowledge of material thermo-optic properties. While the current techniques are well established for isothermal thin films, they remain unexplored for thick media where temperature gradients need to be considered. This study proposes to generalize the current methods of infrared heterodyne photothermal imaging to thick media by combining transmittance measurements and thermo-optic modeling to measure simultaneously the thermoabsorbance and thermoreflectance coefficients in semi-transparent media. In this work, we demonstrate the validity of our methodology followed by the measurements of the thermo-optic properties of several materials: soft polymers (polydimethylsiloxane) and borofloat glasses.</description>

      <title>Stable self-charged perovskite quantum rods for liquid laser with near-zero threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) are promising optical gain materials that require further threshold reduction to realize their full potential. While QD charging theoretically reduces the threshold to zero, its effectiveness has been limited by strong Auger recombination and unstable charging. Here we theoretically reveal the optimal combination of charging number and Auger recombination to minimize the lasing threshold. Experimentally, we develop stable self-charged perovskite quantum rods (QRs) as an alternative to QDs via state engineering and Mn-doping strategy. An unprecedented two-order-of-magnitude reduction in nonradiative Auger recombination enables QRs to support a sufficient charging number of up to 6. The QR liquid lasing is then achieved with a near-zero threshold of 0.098 using quasi-continuous pumping of nanosecond pulses, which is the lowest threshold among all reported QD lasers. These achievements demonstrate the potential of the specially engineered QRs as an excellent gain media and pave the way for their prospective applications.</description>

      <title>Scalable Quantum Computing with Optical Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers have great potential to solve problems which are intractable on classical computers. However, quantum processors have not yet reached the required scale to run applications which outperform traditional computers. Leading hardware platforms, such as superconducting qubit based processors, will soon become bottlenecked by the physical constraints of their low temperature environments, and the expansion of quantum computers will necessitate quantum links between multiple processor modules. Optical frequencies offer the most promising path for these links due to their resilience to noise even at ambient temperature and the maturity of classical optical networks. However, required microwave-to-optics transducers cannot operate deterministically yet, which has widely been seen as a key challenge for their integration into fault-tolerant quantum computers. In this work, we examine implementations of optical links between cryogenic units that surpass the performance of individual cryogenic modules even with the performance of existing or near-term microwave-to-optics transducers. We show methods for these transducers to provide on-demand entanglement between separated quantum processors with high fidelity and lay out key steps for adoption of the technology including scaling transducer numbers and integration with other hardware. Finally, we discuss a number of architectures comprised of these links which can drive the expansion of quantum data centers to utility scale.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Mode-Locked Single-Cavity Dual-Comb Laser Utilizing Time-Stretch Dispersive Fourier Transform Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03550v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As dual combs play a significant role in numerous high-precision measurements, their efficient generation has been widely researched. Although the single-cavity dual-comb generation can avoid the complex active stabilization methods, achieving and maintaining stable dual-comb mode locking within a single cavity remains a critical challenge. To break through this constraint, a two-part evaluation criterion containing a fitness function and a CNN-Transformer network is employed to achieve mode locking and classify the dual-comb mode-locked state. Simulated time-stretch dispersive Fourier transform (DFT) spectra are used as datasets, which simplifies the optimization process and does not rely on specific experimental data. A developed evolutionary algorithm (EA) for paddle-based motorized polarization controllers (MPCs) is proposed, enabling the intelligent attainment of dual-comb mode-locked states. A real-time library stores fitness and MPC angles, facilitating mode-locked state achievement within 2 seconds. Finally, long term running of dual-comb mode locking is ensured by a random collision algorithm utilizing an evaluation criterion of weak soliton peaks.</description>

      <title>Effects of phase-gradient on the nonadiabatic dynamics and photon-phonon conversion in one-dimensional array of optomechanical cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18447v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Manipulation of photonic and phononic coupling in the coupled cavities plays a crucial role in the development of nonreciprocal devices and photon-phonon conversion. Here, we theoretically investigate how the phase gradient of a driving laser affects the coupling between photonic and phononic modes. This, in turn, affects and offers the controllability of the nonadiabatic dynamics of the population of hybrid eigenmodes following a sudden change in the optomechanical coupling. We show that the controllable nonadiabatic dynamics can be attributed to the phase-induced alteration of the bandgaps in the hybrid eigenmodes. We further demonstrate that the phase-assisted control of the relative weight of photonic and phononic modes in the hybrid eigenmodes also contributes to the nonadiabatic dynamics. Finally, we investigate the effects of phase on the coherent conversion of photon-phonon in a finite-size array.</description>

      <title>Hopf Exceptional Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points at which eigenvalues and eigenvectors of non-Hermitian matrices coalesce are ubiquitous in the description of a wide range of platforms from photonic or mechanical metamaterials to open quantum systems. Here, we introduce a class of Hopf exceptional points (HEPs) that are protected by the Hopf invariants (including the higher-dimensional generalizations) and which exhibit phenomenology sharply distinct from conventional exceptional points. Saliently, owing to their $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant related to the Witten anomaly, three-fold HEPs and symmetry-protected five-fold HEPs act as their own ``antiparticles". Furthermore, based on higher homotopy groups of spheres, we predict the existence of multifold HEPs and symmetry-protected HEPs with non-Hermitian topology captured by a range of finite groups (such as $\mathbb{Z}_3$, $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$, or $\mathbb{Z}_{24}$) beyond the periodic table of Bernard-LeClair symmetry classes.</description>
