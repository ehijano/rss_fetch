      <title>On the quantum Guerra-Morato Action Functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a smooth potential $W:\mathrm{T}^{n} \to \mathbb{R}$ on the torus, the Quantum Guerra-Morato action functional is given by \smallskip
  $ \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, I(\psi) = \int\,(\, \, \,\frac{D v\, D v^*}{2}(x) - W(x) \,) \,\,a(x)^2 dx,$ \smallskip
  \noindent where $\psi $ is described by $\psi = a\, e^{i\,\frac{ u }{h}} $, $ u =\, \frac{v + v^*}{2},$ $a=e^{\,\frac{v^*\,-\,v}{2\, \hbar} }$, $v,v ^*$ are real functions, $\int a^2 (x) d x =1$, and $D$ is derivative on $x \in \mathrm{T}^{n}$. It is natural to consider the constraint $ \mathrm{d}\mathrm{i}\mathrm{v}(a^{2}Du)=0$, which means flux zero. The $a$ and $u$ obtained from a critical solution (under variations $\tau$) for such action functional, fulfilling such constraints, satisfy the Hamilton-Jacobi equation with a quantum potential. Denote $'=\frac{d}{d\tau}$. We show that the expression for the second variation of a critical solution is given by
  \smallskip $\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\int a^{2}\,D[ v' ]\, D [(v ^*)']\, dx.$
  \smallskip
  Introducing the constraint $\int a^2 \,D u \,dx =V$, we also consider later an associated dual eigenvalue problem. From this follows a transport and a kind of eikonal equation.</description>

      <title>Special Features of the Upper Half-Plane in Semiclassical Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study conditions that the semiquantised Riemannian metric $g_Q$ and Levi-Civita connection $\nabla_Q$ have the same form as classical one in semiclassical theory. Concrete examples of semiclassical theory have been computed by Majid et al. for upper half-planes, hemispheres and complex projective spaces. However, only in the example of the upper half-planes the semiquantised metric and connection have the same form as classical one. In this study, we first investigate the conditions that the Riemannian metric has the same form as classical one when its components are replaced by general functions. Next, based on these conditions we compute the generalised Ricci form and investigate the conditions that a quantised connection is a quantum Levi-Civita connection. Finally, we semiquantise the upper half-plane with Poincar\'e metric generalised by a parameter $t$. This paper is based on my Master thesis.</description>

      <title>Ergodic properties of one-dimensional incommensurate bilayer materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review ergodic properties of one-dimensional incommensurate bilayer materials, especially the convergence of the density of states in the large-volume limit, from the perspective of the theory of ergodic Schr\"odinger operators. More precisely, we first provide a short introduction to ergodic Schr\"odinger operators as a unifying concept in spectral theory at a level accessible for nonspecialists. We then present two natural tight-binding models of incommensurate bilayer materials in one dimension and prove convergence of their density of states measures in the large volume limit using ideas from the theory of ergodic Schr\"odinger operators.</description>

      <title>On the rational invariants of quantum systems of $n$-qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an $n$-qubit system, a rational function on the space of mixed states which is invariant with respect to the action of the group of local symmetries may be viewed as a detailed measure of entanglement. We show that the field of all such invariant rational functions is purely transcendental over the complex numbers and has transcendence degree $4^n - 2n-1$. An explicit transcendence basis is also exhibited.</description>

      <title>The energy spectrum of a quantum vortex loop moving in a long pipe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study we consider the closed vortex filament that moves in a pipe of length $L &gt;&gt; R_1$, where $R_1$ means inner radius of the pipe. The vortex filament is described in the Local Induction Approximation. We quantize this dynamical system and calculate the spectrum both circulation and energy. In the study, we focus on the case $L \to \infty$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of the finite-temperature sine kernel determinant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we study the asymptotics of the Fredholm determinant $D(x,s)$ of the finite-temperature deformation of the sine kernel, which represents the probability that there is no particles on the interval $(-x/\pi,x/\pi)$ in the bulk scaling limit of the finite-temperature fermion system. The variable $s$ in $D(x,s)$ is related to the temperature. The determinant also corresponds to the finite-temperature correlation function of one dimensional Bose gas. We derive the asymptotics of $D(x,s)$ in several different regimes in the $(x,s)$-plane. A third-order phase transition is observed in the asymptotic expansions as both $x$ and $s$ tend to positive infinity at certain related speed. The phase transition is then shown to be described by the integral involving the Hastings-McLeod solution of the second Painlev\'e equation.</description>

      <title>Martingales associated with strongly quasi-invariant states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the martingales in relevance with $G$-strongly quasi-invariant states on a $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal A$, where $G$ is a separable locally compact group of $*$-automorphisms of $\mathcal A$. In the von Neumann algebra $\mathfrak A$ of the GNS representation, we define a unitary representation of the group and define a group $\hat G$ of $*$-automorphisms of $\mathfrak A$, which is homomorphic to $G$. For the case of compact $G$, under some mild condition, we find a $\hat G$-invariant state on $\mathfrak A$ and define a conditional expectation with range the $\hat G$-fixed subalgebra. Moving to the separable locally compact group $G=\cup_NG_N$, which is the union of increasing compact groups, we construct a sequence of conditional expectations and thereby construct (decreasing) martingales, which have limits by the martingale convergence theorem. We provide with an example for the group of finite permutations on the set of nonnegative integers acting on a $C^*$-algebra of infinite tensor product.</description>

      <title>Two $\beta$-ensemble realization of $\beta$-deformed WLZZ models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a two $\beta$-ensemble realization of the series of $\beta$-deformed WLZZ matrix models. We demonstrate that such a realization involves $\beta$-deformed Harish-Chandra-Itzykson-Zuber integrals, one of them providing a coupling to the external field. We also construct Ward identities in the corresponding two $\beta$-ensemble model, which requires a set of identities for partition function of the one $\beta$-ensemble in the external field, and a set of identities for the $\beta$-deformed Itzykson-Zuber integral. These both sets of identities are formulated in terms of the Dunkl operators.</description>

      <title>Real-time observables in de Sitter thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study real-time finite-temperature correlators for free scalars of any mass in a $dS_{d+1}$ static patch in any dimension. We show that whenever the inverse temperature is a rational multiple of the inverse de Sitter temperature, certain Matsubara poles of the symmetric Wightman function disappear. At the de Sitter temperature, we explicitly show how the Lorentzian thermal correlators can all be obtained by analytic continuations from the round $S^{d+1}$. We establish the precise relation between the Harish-Chandra character for $SO(1,d+1)$ and the integrated spectral function, providing a novel dynamical perspective on the former and enabling generalizations. Furthermore, we study scalars with exceptional non-positive masses. We provide a physical picture for the distinctive structures of their characters. For the massless case, we perform a consistent static patch quantization, and find the unique $S^{d+1}$ correlator that analytically continues to the correlators in the quantum theory.</description>

      <title>On the mutual exclusiveness of time and position in quantum physics and the corresponding uncertainty relation for free falling particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The uncertainty principle is one of the characteristic properties of quantum theory, where it signals the incompatibility of two types of measurements. In this paper, we argue that measurements of time-of-arrival $T_x$ at position $x$ and position $X_t$ at time $t$ are mutually exclusive for a quantum system, each providing complementary information about the state of that system. For a quantum particle of mass $m$ falling in a uniform gravitational field $g$, we show that the corresponding uncertainty relation can be expressed as $\Delta T_x \Delta X_t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2mg}$. This uncertainty relationship can be taken as evidence of the presence of a form of epistemic incompatibility in the sense that preparing the initial state of the system so as to decrease the measured position uncertainty will lead to an increase in the measured time-of-arrival uncertainty. These findings can be empirically tested in the context of ongoing or forthcoming experiments on measurements of time-of-arrival for free-falling quantum particles.</description>

      <title>A Parisi Formula for Quantum Spin Glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish three equivalent versions of a Parisi formula for the free energy of mean-field spin glasses in a transversal magnetic field. These results are derived from available results for classical vector spin glasses by an approximation method using the functional integral representation of the partition function. In this approach, the order parameter is a non-decreasing function with values in the non-negative, real hermitian Hilbert-Schmidt operators. For the quantum Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, we also show that under the assumption of self-averaging of the self-overlap, the optimising Parisi order parameter is found within a two-dimensional subspace spanned by the self-overlap and the fully stationary overlap.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic versus instantaneous transitions from a harmonic oscillator to an inverted oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have obtained explicit analytical formulas for the mean energy and its variance (characterizing the energy fluctuations) of a quantum harmonic oscillator with time-dependent frequency in the adiabatic regimes after the frequency passes through zero. The behavior of energy turns out to be quite different in two cases: when the frequency remains real and when it becomes imaginary. In the first case, the mean energy always increases when the frequency returns to its initial value, and the increment coefficient is determined by the exponent in the power law of the frequency crossing zero. On the other hand, if the frequency becomes imaginary, the mean energy becomes equal to zero exactly, for all initial Fock states and for any value of the power law exponent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Krylov complexity is considered to provide a measure of the growth of operators evolving under Hamiltonian dynamics. The main strategy is the analysis of the structure of Krylov subspace $\mathcal{K}_M(\mathcal{H},\eta)$ spanned by the multiple applications of the Liouville operator $\mathcal{L}$ defined by the commutator in terms of a Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}$, $\mathcal{L}:=[\mathcal{H},\cdot]$ acting on an operator $\eta$, $\mathcal{K}_M(\mathcal{H},\eta)=\text{span}\{\eta,\mathcal{L}\eta,\ldots,\mathcal{L}^{M-1}\eta\}$. For a given inner product $(\cdot,\cdot)$ of the operators, the orthonormal basis $\{\mathcal{O}_n\}$ is constructed from $\mathcal{O}_0=\eta/\sqrt{(\eta,\eta)}$ by Lanczos algorithm. The moments $\mu_m=(\mathcal{O}_0,\mathcal{L}^m\mathcal{O}_0)$ are closely related to the important data $\{b_n\}$ called Lanczos coefficients. I present the exact and explicit expressions of the moments $\{\mu_m\}$ for 16 quantum mechanical systems which are {\em exactly solvable both in the Schr\"odinger and Heisenberg pictures}. The operator $\eta$ is the sinusoidal coordinate which is the variable of the eigenpolynomials $\{P_n(\eta)\}$ of the exactly solvable Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}$.</description>

      <title>Quantum double structure in cold atom superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of topological quantum computation is underpinned by two important classes of models. One is based on non-abelian Chern-Simons theory, which yields the so-called $\rm{SU}(2)_k$ anyon models that often appear in the context of electrically charged quantum fluids. The physics of the other is captured by symmetry broken Yang-Mills theory in the absence of a Chern-Simons term, and results in the so-called quantum double models. Extensive resources have been invested into the search for $\rm{SU}(2)_k$ anyon quasi-particles; in particular the so-called Ising anyons ($k=2$) of which Majorana zero modes are believed to be an incarnation. In contrast to the $\rm{SU}(2)_k$ models, quantum doubles have attracted little attention in experiments despite their pivotal role in the theory of error correction. Beyond topological error correcting codes, the appearance of quantum doubles has been limited to contexts primarily within mathematical physics, and as such, they are of seemingly little relevance for the study of experimentally tangible systems. However, recent works suggest that quantum double anyons may be found in spinor Bose-Einstein condensates. In light of this, the core purpose of this article is to provide a self-contained exposition of the quantum double structure, framed in the context of spinor condensates, by constructing explicitly the quantum doubles for various ground state symmetry groups and discuss their experimental realisability. We also derive analytically an equation for the quantum double Clebsch-Gordan coefficients from which the relevant braid matrices can be worked out. Finally, the existence of a particle-vortex duality is exposed and illuminated upon in this context.</description>

      <title>On Asymptotically Almost Periodic Solutions of the parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel system on real hyperbolic Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we investigate the existence, uniqueness and exponential decay of asymptotically almost periodic solutions of the parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel system on a real hyperbolic manifold. We prove the existence and uniqueness of such solutions in the linear equation case by using the dispersive and smoothing estimates of the heat semigroup. Then we pass to the well-posedness of semi-linear equation case by using the results of linear equation and fixed point arguments. The exponential decay is proven by using Gronwall's inequality.</description>

      <title>Differential geometry and general relativity with algebraifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is often noted that many of the basic concepts of differential geometry, such as the definition of connection, are purely algebraic in nature. Here, we review and extend existing work on fully algebraic formulations of differential geometry which eliminate the need for an underlying manifold. While the literature contains various independent approaches to this, we focus on one particular approach that we argue to be the most natural one based on the definition of \emph{algebraifold}, by which we mean a commutative algebra $\mathcal{A}$ for which the module of derivations of $\mathcal{A}$ is finitely generated projective. Over $\mathbb{R}$ as the base ring, this class of algebras includes the algebra $C^\infty(M)$ of smooth functions on a manifold $M$, and similarly for analytic functions. An importantly different example is the Colombeau algebra of generalized functions on $M$, which makes distributional differential geometry an instance of our formalism. Another instance is a fibred version of smooth differential geometry, since any smooth submersion $M \to N$ makes $C^\infty(M)$ into an algebraifold with $C^\infty(N)$ as the base ring.Over any field $k$ of characteristic zero, examples include the algebra of regular functions on a smooth affine variety as well as any function field.
  Our development of differential geometry in terms of algebraifolds comprises tensors, connections, curvature, geodesics and we briefly consider general relativity.</description>

      <title>Rapid state-recrossing kinetics in non-Markovian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mean first-passage time (MFPT) is one standard measure for the reaction time in thermally activated barrier-crossing processes. While the relationship between MFPTs and phenomenological rate coefficients is known for systems that satisfy Markovian dynamics, it is not clear how to interpret MFPTs for experimental and simulation time-series data generated by non-Markovian systems. Here, we simulate a one-dimensional generalized Langevin equation (GLE) in a bistable potential and compare two related numerical methods for evaluating MFPTs: one that only incorporates information about first arrivals between subsequent states and is equivalent to calculating the waiting time, or dwell time, and one that incorporates information about all first-passages associated with a given barrier-crossing event and is therefore typically employed to enhance numerical sampling. In the Markovian limit, the two methods are equivalent. However, for significant memory times, the two methods suggest dramatically different reaction kinetics. By focusing on first-passage distributions, we systematically reveal the influence of memory-induced rapid state-recrossing on the MFPTs, which we compare to various other numerical or theoretical descriptions of reaction times. Overall, we demonstrate that it is necessary to consider full first-passage distributions, rather than just the mean barrier-crossing kinetics when analyzing non-Markovian time series data.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Resolved Measures in Quantum Field Theory: a Short Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this short review we present the key definitions, ideas and techniques involved in the study of symmetry resolved entanglement measures, with a focus on the symmetry resolved entanglement entropy. In order to be able to define such entanglement measures, it is essential that the theory under study possess an internal symmetry. Then, symmetry resolved entanglement measures quantify the contribution to a particular entanglement measure that can be associated to a chosen symmetry sector. Our review focuses on conformal (gapless/massless/critical) and integrable (gapped/massive) quantum field theories, where the leading computational technique employs symmetry fields known as (composite) branch point twist fields.</description>

      <title>A viscoelastic model for skin via homogenization theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We carry out the homogenization of a fluid-structure interaction problem consisting in the periodic inclusions of a viscous fluid in an elastic body. We get a macrostructure model where the body behaves as a viscoelastic material with a long-range memory term. Our aim is not only to get this limit problem but also to study its main properties. Using the micro-structure variables it is simple to check that it satisfies an energy conservation law assuring in particular the existence and uniqueness of solution. The difficulty is to characterize these properties using only the macroscopic system. We prove that the nonlocal term is given through a convolution kernel which exponentially decreases to zero and satisfies some positive conditions which we write in terms of the Laplace transform. These conditions can be used to directly prove the existence and uniqueness of solution. The results apply to modeling the mechanical behavior of skin as an indicator of what kind of models we should use. In a naive interpretation the fluid inclusions represent the cells and the elastic medium the extracellular matrix.</description>

      <title>A quasilinear Keller-Segel model with saturated discontinuous advection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the singular limit of a chemotaxis model of bacterial collective motion recently introduced in arXiv:2009.11048 [math.AP]. The equation models aggregation-diffusion phenomena with advection that is discontinuous and depends sharply on the gradient of the density itself. The quasi-linearity of the problem poses major challenges in the construction of the solution and complications arise in the proof of regularity. Our method overcomes these obstacle by relying solely on entropy inequalities and the theory of monotone operators. We provide existence, uniqueness and smoothing estimates in any dimensional space.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we develop the theory of reduction of quantum principal bundles over projective bases. We show how the sheaf theoretic approach can be effectively applied to certain relevant examples as the Klein model for the projective spaces; in particular we study in the algebraic setting the reduction of the principal bundle $\mathrm{GL}(n) \to \mathrm{GL}(n)/P= \mathbf{P}^{n-1}(\mathbb{C})$ to the Levi subgroup $G_0$ inside the maximal parabolic subgroup $P$ of $\mathrm{GL}(n)$. We characterize reductions in the sheaf theoretic setting.</description>

      <title>Exact Multi-Point Correlations in the Stochastic Heat Equation for Strictly Sublinear Coordinates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Stochastic Heat Equation (SHE) in $(1+1)$ dimensions with delta Dirac initial data and spacetime white noise. We prove exact large-time asymptotics for multi-point correlations of the SHE for strictly sublinear space coordinates. The sublinear condition is optimal, in the sense that different asymptotics are known to occur when the space coordinates grow linearly [Lin 2023, Theorem 1.1]. Lastly, a notable feature of our result is that it confirms the connection between multi-point correlations in the SHE and the ground state of the Hamiltonian of the delta-Bose gas.</description>

Abstract: We explore the phase-space of homogeneous and anisotropic spacetimes within symmetric teleparallel $f(Q)$-gravity. Specifically, we consider the Kantowski-Sachs and locally rotational Bianchi III geometries to describe the physical space. By analyzing the phase-space, we reconstruct the cosmological history dictated by $f(Q)$-gravity and comment about the theory's viability. Our findings suggest that the free parameters of the connection must be constrained to eliminate nonlinear terms in the field equations. Consequently, new stationary points emerge, rendering the theory cosmologically viable. We identify the existence of anisotropic accelerated universes, which may correspond to the pre-inflationary epoch.</description>

      <title>Decorrelation of a leader by the increasing number of followers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the connected two-time correlator of the maximum $M_N(t)$ of $N$ independent Gaussian stochastic processes (GSP) characterised by a common correlation coefficient $\rho$ that depends on the two times $t_1$ and $t_2$. We show analytically that this correlator, for fixed times $t_1$ and $t_2$, decays for large $N$ as a power law $N^{-\gamma}$ (with logarithmic corrections) with a decorrelation exponent $\gamma = (1-\rho)/(1+ \rho)$ that depends only on $\rho$, but otherwise is universal for any GSP. We study several examples of physical processes including the fractional Brownian motion (fBm) with Hurst exponent $H$ and the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process. For the fBm, $\rho$ is only a function of $\tau = \sqrt{t_1/t_2}$ and we find an interesting ``freezing'' transition at a critical value $\tau= \tau_c=(3-\sqrt{5})/2$. For $\tau &lt; \tau_c$, there is an optimal $H^*(\tau) &gt; 0$ that maximises the exponent $\gamma$ and this maximal value freezes to $\gamma= 1/3$ for $\tau &gt;\tau_c$. For the OU process, we show that $\gamma = {\rm tanh}(\mu \,|t_1-t_2|/2)$ where $\mu$ is the stiffness of the harmonic trap. Numerical simulations confirm our analytical predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.03997v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the features of Baxter's Q-operators for many closed spin chain models is that all transfer matrices arise as products of two Q-operators with shifts in the spectral parameter. In the representation-theoretical approach to Q-operators, underlying this is a factorization formula for L-operators (solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation associated to particular infinite-dimensional representations). To have such a formalism to open spin chains, one needs a factorization identity for solutions of the reflection equation (boundary Yang-Baxter equation) associated to these representations. In the case of quantum affine $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ and diagonal K-matrices, we derive such an identity using the recently formulated theory of universal K-matrices for quantum affine algebras.</description>

      <title>Null Hamiltonian Yang-Mills theory: Soft symmetries and memory as superselection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03531v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Soft symmetries for Yang-Mills theory are shown to correspond to the residual Hamiltonian action of the gauge group on the Ashtekar-Streubel phase space, which is the result of a partial symplectic reduction. The associated momentum map is the electromagnetic memory in the abelian theory, or a nonlinear, gauge-equivariant, generalization thereof in the nonabelian case.
  This result follows from an application of Hamiltonian reduction by stages, enabled by the existence of a natural normal subgroup of the gauge group on a null codimension-1 submanifold with boundaries. The first stage is coisotropic reduction of the Gauss constraint, and it yields a symplectic extension of the Ashtekar-Streubel phase space (up to a covering). Hamiltonian reduction of the residual gauge action leads to the fully-reduced phase space of the theory. This is a Poisson manifold, whose symplectic leaves, called superselection sectors, are labelled by the (gauge classes of the generalized) electric flux across the boundary.
  In this framework, the Ashtekar-Streubel phase space arises as an intermediate reduction stage that enforces the superselection of the electric flux at only one of the two boundary components. These results provide a natural, purely Hamiltonian, explanation of the existence of soft symmetries as a byproduct of partial symplectic reduction, as well as a motivation for the expected decomposition of the quantum Hilbert space of states into irreducible representations labelled by the Casimirs of the Poisson structure on the reduced phase space.</description>

Abstract: We present a much shorter and streamlined proof of an improved version of the results previously given in [A. Posilicano: On the Self-Adjointness of $H+A^{*}+A$, Math. Phys. Anal. Geom. (2020)] concerning the self-adjoint realizations of formal QFT-like Hamiltonians of the kind $H+A^{*}+A$, where $H$ and $A$ play the role of the free field Hamiltonian and of the annihilation operator respectively. We give explicit representations of the resolvent and of the self-adjointness domain; the consequent Krein-type resolvent formula leads to a characterization of these self-adjoint realizations as limit (with respect to convergence in norm resolvent sense) of cutoff Hamiltonians of the kind $H+A^{*}_{n}+A_{n}-E_{n}$, the bounded operator $E_{n}$ playing the role of a renormalizing counter term.</description>

Abstract: We provide spinor-based proof of the positivity of the Wang-Yau \cite{yau} quasi-local mass. More precisely we prove under an appropriate spin assumption that the gravitational mass bounded by a spacelike topological $2-$sphere is non-negative in a generic spacetime verifying dominant energy condition and vanishes only if the surface is embedded in the Minkowski space. This proof is purely quasi-local in nature and in particular does not rely on Bartanik's gluing and asymptotic extension construction \cite{bartnik1993quasi} and subsequent application of the Schoen-Yau \cite{schoen1979proof,schoen1981proof} positive mass theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2004.06198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work studies exact solvability of a class of fractional reaction-diffusion equation with the Riemann-Liouville fractional derivatives on the half-line in terms of the similarity solutions. We derived the conditions for the equation to possess scaling symmetry even with the fractional derivatives. Relations among the scaling exponents are determined, and the appropriate similarity variable introduced. With the similarity variable we reduced the stochastic partial differential equation to a fractional ordinary differential equation. Exactly solvable systems are then identified by matching the resulted ordinary differential equation with the known exactly solvable fractional ones. Several examples involving the three-parameter Mittag-Leffler function (Kilbas-Saigo function) are presented. The models discussed here turn out to correspond to superdiffusive systems.</description>

Abstract: Let $(G_n)_{n \geq 1} = ((V_n,E_n))_{n \geq 1}$ be a sequence of finite, connected, vertex-transitive graphs with volume tending to infinity. We say that a sequence of parameters $(p_n)_{n \geq 1}$ in $[0,1]$ is supercritical with respect to Bernoulli bond percolation $\mathbb P_p^G$ if there exists $\varepsilon &gt;0$ and $N&lt;\infty$ such that \[
  \mathbb P_{(1-\varepsilon)p_n}^{G_n} \left( \text{the largest cluster contains at least $\varepsilon |V_n|$ vertices}\right) \geq \varepsilon \] for every $n\geq N$ with $p_n &lt;1$. We prove that if $(G_n)_{n \geq 1}$ is sparse, meaning that the degrees are sublinear in the number of vertices, then the supercritical giant cluster is unique with high probability in the sense that if $(p_n)_{n \geq 1}$ is supercritical then \[
  \lim_{n\to\infty}\mathbb P_{p_n}^{G_n} \left( \text{the second largest cluster contains at least $c|V_n|$ vertices} \right) = 0 \] for every $c&gt;0$. This result is new even under the stronger hypothesis that $(G_n)_{n \geq 1}$ has uniformly bounded vertex degrees, in which case it verifies a conjecture of Benjamini (2001). Previous work of many authors had established the same theorem for complete graphs, tori, hypercubes, and bounded degree expander graphs, each using methods that are highly specific to the examples they treated. We also give a complete solution to the problem of supercritical uniqueness for dense vertex-transitive graphs, establishing a simple necessary and sufficient isoperimetric condition for uniqueness to hold.</description>

      <title>Explicit formula of deformation quantization with separation of variables for complex two-dimensional locally symmetric K\"{a}hler manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.15266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a complex two-dimensional noncommutative locally symmetric K\"{a}hler manifold via a deformation quantization with separation of variables. We present an explicit formula of its star product by solving the system of recurrence relations given by Hara-Sako. In the two-dimensional case, this system of recurrence relations gives two types of equations corresponding to the two coordinates. From the two types of recurrence relations, symmetrized and antisymmetrized recurrence relations are obtained. The symmetrized one gives the solution of the recurrence relation. From the antisymmetrized one, the identities satisfied by the solution are obtained. The star products for $\mathbb{C}^{2}$ and $\mathbb{C}P^{2}$ are constructed by the method obtained in this study, and we verify that these star products satisfy the identities.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal polynomial duality of a two-species asymmetric exclusion process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.11114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine type D ASEP, a two--species interacting particle system which generalizes the usual asymmetric simple exclusion process. For certain cases of type D ASEP, the process does not give priority for one species over another, even though there is nontrivial interaction between the two species. For those specific cases, we prove that the type D ASEP is self--dual with respect to an independent product of $q$--Krawtchouk polynomials. The type D ASEP was originally constructed in arXiv:2011.13473, using the type D quantum groups $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{so}_6)$ and $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{so}_8)$. That paper claimed that certain states needed to be "discarded'' in order to ensure non--negativity. Here, we also provide a more efficient argument for the same claim.</description>

      <title>Hessian spectrum at the global minimum and topology trivialization of locally isotropic Gaussian random fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.15254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the energy landscape near the ground state of a model of a single particle in a random potential with trivial topology. More precisely, we find the large dimensional limit of the Hessian spectrum at the global minimum of the Hamiltonian $X_N(x) +\frac\mu2 \|x\|^2, x\in\rz^N,$ when $\mu$ is above the phase transition threshold so that the system has only one critical point. Here $X_N$ is a locally isotropic Gaussian random field. The same idea is also applied to study the more general model of elastic manifold. In the replica symmetric regime, our results confirm the predictions of Fyodorov and Le Doussal made in 2018 and 2020 using the replica method.</description>

Abstract: We present a construction of the fractional $\Phi^4$ Euclidean quantum field theory on $\mathbb{R}^3$ in the full subcritical regime via parabolic stochastic quantisation. Our approach is based on the use of a truncated flow equation for the effective description of the model at sufficiently small scales and on coercive estimates for the non-linear stochastic partial differential equation describing the interacting field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the i.i.d. Bernoulli field $\mu_p$ with occupation density $p \in (0,1)$ on a possibly non-regular countably infinite tree with bounded degrees. For large $p$, we show that the quasilocal Gibbs property, i.e. compatibility with a suitable quasilocal specification, is lost under the deterministic transformation which removes all isolated ones and replaces them by zeros, while a quasilocal specification does exist at small $p$. Our results provide an example for an independent field in a spatially non-homogeneous setup which loses the quasilocal Gibbs property under a local deterministic transformation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Modular $\widehat Z{}^G$-Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum modular properties of $\widehat Z{}^G$-invariants of closed three-manifolds. Higher depth quantum modular forms are expected to play a central role for general three-manifolds and gauge groups $G$. In particular, we conjecture that for plumbed three-manifolds whose plumbing graphs have $n$ junction nodes with definite signature and for rank $r$ gauge group $G$, that $\widehat Z{}^G$ is related to a quantum modular form of depth $nr$. We prove this for $G={\rm SU}(3)$ and for an infinite class of three-manifolds (weakly negative Seifert with three exceptional fibers). We also investigate the relation between the quantum modularity of $\widehat Z{}^G$-invariants of the same three-manifold with different gauge group $G$. We conjecture a recursive relation among the iterated Eichler integrals relevant for $\widehat Z{}^G$ with $G={\rm SU}(2)$ and ${\rm SU}(3)$, for negative Seifert manifolds with three exceptional fibers. This is reminiscent of the recursive structure among mock modular forms playing the role of Vafa-Witten invariants for ${\rm SU}(N)$. We prove the conjecture when the three-manifold is moreover an integral homological sphere.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical Theory and the Koopman-van Hove Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01865v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The phase space Koopman-van Hove (KvH) equation can be derived from the asymptotic semiclassical analysis of partial differential equations. Semiclassical theory yields the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the complex phase factor and the transport equation for the amplitude. These two equations can be combined to form a nonlinear semiclassical version of the KvH equation in configuration space. There is a natural injection of configuration space solutions into phase space and a natural projection of phase space solutions onto configuration space. Hence, every solution of the configuration space KvH equation satisfies both the semiclassical phase space KvH equation and the Hamilton-Jacobi constraint. For configuration space solutions, this constraint resolves the paradox that there are two different conserved densities in phase space. For integrable systems, the KvH spectrum is the Cartesian product of a classical and a semiclassical spectrum. If the classical spectrum is eliminated, then, with the correct choice of Jeffreys-Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (JWKB) matching conditions, the semiclassical spectrum satisfies the Einstein-Brillouin-Keller quantization conditions which include the correction due to the Maslov index. However, semiclassical analysis uses different choices for boundary conditions, continuity requirements, and the domain of definition. For example, use of the complex JWKB method allows for the treatment of tunneling through the complexification of phase space. Finally, although KvH wavefunctions include the possibility of interference effects, interference is not observable when all observables are approximated as local operators on phase space. Observing interference effects requires consideration of nonlocal operations, e.g. through higher orders in the asymptotic theory.</description>

      <title>Painlev\'e-III Monodromy Maps Under the $D_6\to D_8$ Confluence and Applications to the Large-Parameter Asymptotics of Rational Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The third Painlev\'e equation in its generic form, often referred to as Painlev\'e-III($D_6$), is given by $$ \frac{{\rm d}^2u}{{\rm d}x^2} =\frac{1}{u}\left(\frac{{\rm d}u}{{\rm d}x}\right)^2-\frac{1}{x}\frac{{\rm d}u}{{\rm d}x}+\frac{\alpha u^2+\beta}{x}+4u^3-\frac{4}{u}, \qquad \alpha,\beta \in \mathbb C.$$ Starting from a generic initial solution $u_0(x)$ corresponding to parameters $\alpha$, $\beta$, denoted as the triple $(u_0(x),\alpha,\beta)$, we apply an explicit B\"acklund transformation to generate a family of solutions $(u_n(x),\alpha+4n,\beta+4n)$ indexed by $n \in \mathbb N$. We study the large $n$ behavior of the solutions $(u_n(x),\alpha+4n,\beta+4n)$ under the scaling $x=z/n$ in two different ways: (a) analyzing the convergence properties of series solutions to the equation, and (b) using a Riemann-Hilbert representation of the solution $u_n(z/n)$. Our main result is a proof that the limit of solutions $u_n(z/n)$ exists and is given by a solution of the degenerate Painlev\'e-III equation, known as Painlev\'e-III($D_8$), $$ \frac{{\rm d}^2U}{{\rm d}z^2} =\frac{1}{U}\left(\frac{{\rm d}U}{{\rm d}z}\right)^2-\frac{1}{z}\frac{{\rm d}U}{{\rm d}z}+\frac{4U^2+4}{z}.$$ A notable application of our result is to rational solutions of Painlev\'e-III($D_6$), which are constructed using the seed solution $(1,4m,-4m)$ where $m \in \mathbb C \setminus \big(\mathbb Z +\frac{1}{2}\big)$ and can be written as a particular ratio of Umemura polynomials. We identify the limiting solution in terms of both its initial condition at $z=0$ when it is well defined, and by its monodromy data in the general case. Furthermore, as a consequence of our analysis, we deduce the asymptotic behavior of generic solutions of Painlev\'e-III, both $D_6$ and $D_8$ at $z=0$. We also deduce the large $n$ behavior of the Umemura polynomials in a neighborhood of $z=0$.</description>

By making use of a recent argument due to Affonso, Bissacot and Maia from 2022 which establishes that a phase transition occurs for the long range, random-field Ising model, from a suggestion of the authors we demonstrate that a phase transition also occurs for the long range Ising model, from a set of appropriately defined contours for the long range system, and a Peierls' argument.</description>

      <title>Free fermions beyond Jordan and Wigner</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19897v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Jordan-Wigner transformation is frequently utilised to rewrite quantum spin chains in terms of fermionic operators. When the resulting Hamiltonian is bilinear in these fermions, i.e. the fermions are free, the exact spectrum follows from the eigenvalues of a matrix whose size grows only linearly with the volume of the system. However, several Hamiltonians that do not admit a Jordan-Wigner transformation to fermion bilinears still have the same type of free-fermion spectra. The spectra of such ``free fermions in disguise" models can be found exactly by an intricate but explicit construction of the raising and lowering operators. We generalise the methods further to find a family of such spin chains. We compute the exact spectrum, and generalise an elegant graph-theory construction. We also explain how this family admits an N=2 lattice supersymmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct highest weight vectors of ${\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_2}}_{,k+1} \oplus \mathsf{Vir}$ in tensor products of highest weight modules of ${\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_2}}_{,k}$ and ${\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_2}}_{,1}$, and thus for generic weights we find the decomposition of the tensor product into irreducibles of ${\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_2}}_{,k+1} \oplus \mathsf{Vir}$. The construction uses Wakimoto representations of ${\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_2}}_{,k}$, but the obtained vectors can be mapped back to Verma modules. Singularities of this mapping are cancelled by a renormalization. A detailed study of ``degenerations'' of Wakimoto modules allowed to find the renormalization factor explicitly. The obtained result is a significant step forward in a proof of equivalence of certain two-dimesnional CFT models.</description>

Abstract: The paper deals with affine 2-dimensional Toda field theories related to simple Lie algebras of the classical series ${\bf D}_r$. We demonstrate that the complexification procedure followed by a restriction to a specified real Hamiltonian form commutes with the external automorphisms of $\mathfrak{g}$. This is illustrated on the examples ${\bf D}_{r+1}^{(1)} \to {\bf B}_r^{(1)}$ and ${\bf D}_4^{(1)} \to {\bf G}_2^{(1)}$ using external automorphisms of the corresponding extended Dynkin diagrams.</description>
