      <title>Stochastic trade-offs and the emergence of diversification in E. coli evolution experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laboratory experiments with bacterial colonies, under well-controlled conditions often lead to evolutionary diversification, where at least two ecotypes emerge from an initially monomorphic population. Empirical evidence suggests that such "evolutionary branching" occurs stochastically, even under fixed and stable conditions. This stochastic nature is characterized by: (i) occurrence in a significant fraction, but not all, of experimental settings, (ii) emergence at widely varying times, and (iii) variable relative abundances of the resulting subpopulations across experiments. Theoretical approaches to understanding evolutionary branching under these conditions have been previously developed within the (deterministic) framework of "adaptive dynamics." Here, we advance the understanding of the stochastic nature of evolutionary outcomes by introducing the concept of "stochastic trade-offs" as opposed to "hard" ones. The key idea is that the stochasticity of mutations occurs in a high-dimensional trait space and this translates into variability that is constrained to a flexible tradeoff curve. By incorporating this additional source of stochasticity, we are able to account for the observed empirical variability and make predictions regarding the likelihood of evolutionary branching under different conditions. This approach effectively bridges the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental observations, providing insights into when and how evolutionary branching is more likely to occur in laboratory experiments.</description>

      <title>Refining the drift barrier hypothesis: a role of recessive gene count and an inhomogeneous Muller`s ratchet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09094v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The drift-barrier hypothesis states that random genetic drift constrains the refinement of a phenotype under natural selection. The influence of effective population size and the genome-wide deleterious mutation rate were studied theoretically, and an inverse relationship between mutation rate and genome size has been observed for many species. However, the effect of the recessive gene count, an important feature of the genomic architecture, is unknown. In a Wright-Fisher model, we studied the mutation burden for a growing number of N completely recessive and lethal disease genes. Diploid individuals are represented with a binary $2 \times N$ matrix denoting wild-type and mutated alleles. Analytic results for specific cases were complemented by simulations across a broad parameter regime for gene count, mutation and recombination rates. Simulations revealed transitions to higher mutation burden and prevalence within a few generations that were linked to the extinction of the wild-type haplotype (least-loaded class). This metastability, that is, phases of quasi-equilibrium with intermittent transitions, persists over $100\,000$ generations. The drift-barrier hypothesis is confirmed by a high mutation burden resulting in population collapse. Simulations showed the emergence of mutually exclusive haplotypes for a mutation rate above 0.02 lethal equivalents per generation for a genomic architecture and population size representing complex multicellular organisms such as humans. In such systems, recombination proves pivotal, preventing population collapse and maintaining a mutation burden below 10. This study advances our understanding of gene pool stability, and particularly the role of the number of recessive disorders. Insights into Muller`s ratchet dynamics are provided, and the essential role of recombination in curbing mutation burden and stabilizing the gene pool is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Identifying vegetation patterns for a qualitative assessment of land degradation using a cellular automata model and satellite imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We aim to identify the spatial distribution of vegetation and its growth dynamics with the purpose of obtaining a qualitative assessment of vegetation health and land degradation. To do so, we compare a statistical model of vegetation growth and real-world Earth observation data. Specifically, we analyze a stochastic cellular automata model and data obtained from satellite images, namely using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Leaf Area Index (LAI). In the experimental data, we look for areas where vegetation is broken into small patches and qualitatively compare it to the percolating, fragmented, and degraded states that appear in the cellular automata model. We model the periodic effect of seasons, finding numerical evidence of a periodic fragmentation and recovery phenomenology if the model parameters are sufficiently close to the model's percolation transition. We qualitatively recognize these effects in real-world vegetation images and consider them a signal of increased environmental stress and vulnerability. Finally, we show an estimation of the environmental stress in land images by considering both the vegetation density and its clusterization.</description>
