      <title>Dynamic SBI: Round-free Sequential Simulation-Based Inference with Adaptive Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is emerging as a new statistical paradigm for addressing complex scientific inference problems. By leveraging the representational power of deep neural networks, SBI can extract the most informative simulation features for the parameters of interest. Sequential SBI methods extend this approach by iteratively steering the simulation process towards the most relevant regions of parameter space. This is typically implemented through an algorithmic structure, in which simulation and network training alternate over multiple rounds. This strategy is particularly well suited for high-precision inference in high-dimensional settings, which are commonplace in physics applications with growing data volumes and increasing model fidelity. Here, we introduce dynamic SBI, which implements the core ideas of sequential methods in a round-free, asynchronous, and highly parallelisable manner. At its core is an adaptive dataset that is iteratively transformed during inference to resemble the target observation. Simulation and training proceed in parallel: trained networks are used both to filter out simulations incompatible with the data and to propose new, more promising ones. Compared to round-based sequential methods, this asynchronous structure can significantly reduce simulation costs and training overhead. We demonstrate that dynamic SBI achieves significant improvements in simulation and training efficiency while maintaining inference performance. We further validate our framework on two challenging astrophysical inference tasks: characterising the stochastic gravitational wave background and analysing strong gravitational lensing systems. Overall, this work presents a flexible and efficient new paradigm for sequential SBI.</description>

      <title>Extracting latent representations from X-ray spectra. Classification, regression, and accretion signatures of Chandra sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of X-ray spectra is crucial to understanding the physical nature of astrophysical sources. Machine learning methods can extract compact and informative representations of data from large datasets. The Chandra Source Catalog (CSC) provides a rich archive of X-ray spectral data, which remains largely underexplored in this context. This work aims to develop a compact and physically meaningful representation of Chandra X-ray spectra using deep learning. To verify that the learned representation captures relevant information, we evaluate it through classification, regression, and interpretability analyses. We use a transformer-based autoencoder to compress X-ray spectra. The input spectra, drawn from the CSC, include only high-significance detections. Astrophysical source types and physical summary statistics are compiled from external catalogs. We evaluate the learned representation in terms of spectral reconstruction accuracy, clustering performance on 8 known astrophysical source classes, and correlation with physical quantities such as hardness ratios and hydrogen column density ($N_H$). The autoencoder accurately reconstructs spectra with 8 latent variables. Clustering in the latent space yields a balanced classification accuracy of $\sim$40% across the 8 source classes, increasing to $\sim$69% when restricted to AGNs and stellar-mass compact objects exclusively. Moreover, latent features correlate with non-linear combinations of spectral fluxes, suggesting that the compressed representation encodes physically relevant information. The proposed autoencoder-based pipeline is a powerful tool for the representation and interpretation of X-ray spectra, providing a compact latent space that supports both classification and the estimation of physical properties. This work demonstrates the potential of deep learning for spectral studies and uncovering new patterns in X-ray data.</description>

      <title>Polarisation Performance of Offset Phase Antennas: A Study for FARSIDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several radio telescopes have been planned or proposed to be deployed on the Lunar farside in the coming years. These will observe the unexplored ultra-long wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum from the lunar farside's unique radio-quiet and ionosphere-free environment. One such lunar radio array is the NASA-funded concept - the Farside Array for Radio Science Investigations of the Dark Ages and Exoplanets (FARSIDE). FARSIDE will operate over 100~kHz to 40~MHz with 128 spatially non-co-located orthogonal pairs of antenna nodes distributed over a 12 X 12 km area in a four-arm spiral configuration. Being on the lunar farside, this radio interferometer will be deployed by tele-operated rovers. The rover deployment mode could lead to a phase offset between each of the two orthogonally polarised antenna elements in the array, which are typically co-located. In this paper, we quantify the effects of such antenna phase offsets on the polarisation response and imaging performance of the lunar radio array. Modelling and analysing the FARSIDE dipole beams with and without offset, we find the latter leads to additional leakages into Stokes U and V corresponding to Muller matrix terms of M2(0,1,2,3) and M3(0,1,2,3). Using a custom simulation pipeline to incorporate all four Stokes beams of spatially co-located and non-co-located dipoles, we produce visibilities and simulated images for the GLEAM (GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA) sky model through the FARSIDE array. We find that for a pure Stokes I input sky, the output image maximum Stokes V/I flux ratio for the offset case has increased to 2.5% versus 0.05% for the co-located case. The additional Stokes V needs to be corrected since the detection of Electron Cyclotron Maser (ECM) emissions from exoplanets requires high-fidelity Stokes V measurements.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Simulation-Based Inference of Supernova Power Sources and their Physical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time domain surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory are projected to annually discover millions of astronomical transients. This and complementary programs demand fast, automated methods to constrain the physical properties of the most interesting objects for spectroscopic follow up. Traditional approaches to likelihood-based inference are computationally expensive and ignore the multi-component energy sources powering astrophysical phenomena. In this work, we present a hierarchical simulation-based inference model for multi-band light curves that 1) identifies the energy sources powering an event of interest, 2) infers the physical properties of each subclass, and 3) separates physical anomalies in the learned embedding space. Our architecture consists of a transformer-based light curve summarizer coupled to a flow-matching regression module and a categorical classifier for the physical components. We train and test our model on $\sim$150k synthetic light curves generated with $\texttt{MOSFiT}$. Our network achieves a 90% classification accuracy at identifying energy sources, yields well-calibrated posteriors for all active components, and detects rare anomalies such as tidal disruption events (TDEs) through the learned latent space. This work demonstrates a scalable joint framework for population studies of known transients and the discovery of novel populations in the era of Rubin.</description>

      <title>Design and Performance of the SPT-SLIM Receiver Cryostat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The South Pole Telescope Shirokoff Line Intensity Mapper (SPT-SLIM) is a millimeter-wavelength line-intensity mapping experiment, which was deployed on the South Pole Telescope (SPT) during the 2024-2025 Austral summer season. This pathfinder experiment serves to demonstrate the on-sky operation of multi-pixel on-chip spectrometer technology. We report on the cryogenic performance of the SPT-SLIM receiver for the first year of commissioning observations. The SPT-SLIM receiver utilizes an Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigerator (ADR) for cooling the focal plane of superconducting filterbank spectrometers to a temperature of 150 mK. We demonstrate stable thermal performance of the focal plane module during observations consistent with thermal modeling, enabling a cryogenic operating efficiency above 80%. We also report on the receiver control system design utilizing the Observatory Control System (OCS) platform for automated cryogenic operation on the SPT.</description>

      <title>An On-Sky Atmospheric Calibration of SPT-SLIM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the methodology and results of the on-sky responsivity calibration of the South Pole Telescope Shirokoff Line Intensity Mapper (SPT-SLIM). SPT-SLIM is a pathfinder line intensity mapping experiment utilizing the on-chip spectrometer technology, and was first deployed during the 2024-2025 Austral Summer season on the South Pole Telescope. During the two-week on-sky operation of SPT-SLIM, we performed periodic measurements of the detector response as a function of the telescope elevation angle. Combining these data with atmospheric opacity measurements from an on-site atmospheric tipping radiometer, simulated South Pole atmospheric spectra, and measured detector spectral responses, we construct estimates for the responsivity of SPT-SLIM detectors to sky loading. We then use this model to calibrate observations of the moon taken by SPT-SLIM, cross-checking the result against the known brightness temperature of the Moon as a function of its phase.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Photometry with a scientific CMOS Camera: I Lab Testing of the Marana camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific CMOS cameras are becoming increasingly prevalent in modern observational astronomy. We assess the ability of CMOS image sensors technology to perform high-precision photometry with a detailed laboratory characterization of the Marana 4.2BV-11 CMOS camera. We characterise the camera in the Fastest Frame Rate (FFR) and High Dynamic Range (HDR) modes. Our evaluation includes read noise, dark current, photo response and dark signal non-uniformities, quantum efficiency and window transmittance. The read noise is found to be 1.577\,e$^-$ for the FFR mode. For the HDR mode the read noise floor is measured to be 1.571\,e$^-$ for signal levels below approximately 1800\,e$^-$. The bias level shows dark signal non-uniformities with values of 0.318\,e$^-$ and 0.232\,e$^-$ for FFR and HDR mode, respectively. Pixel well capacity reached 2366 e$^-$pix$^{-1}$ for the FFR mode and 69026 e$^-$pix$^{-1}$ with a dynamic range of 93\,dB for the HDR mode. The camera demonstrates good linearity, yielding linearity errors of 0.099\,\% for FFR mode and 0.122\,\% for HDR mode. The uniformity across the image arrays show a photo response non-uniformity of 0.294\,\% for the FFR mode and 0.131\,\% for the HDR mode. The dark current displays a noticeable glow pattern, resulting in mean dark current levels of $1.674\pm0.011$\, \eps\, for the FFR mode and $1.617\pm0.008$\,\eps\, for the HDR mode at a constant temperature of -25\,$^\circ$C. We measured the quantum efficiency across the visible spectrum, with a peak of of &gt;95\,\% at 560\,nm. Our tests indicate that the Marana CMOS camera is potentially capable of performing precise photometry.</description>

      <title>SETI Post-Detection Protocols: Progress Towards a New Version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The International Academy of Astronautics (IAA) SETI Committee has long provided guiding principles for responding to a potential detection of a SETI signal. The foundational Declaration of Principles Concerning Activities Following the Detection of Extraterrestrial Intelligence, first formulated in 1989, has been widely recognised by the international scientific community. A supplemental set of draft protocols addressing the possibility of a reply to an extraterrestrial signal was prepared in 1995 by the IAA SETI Permanent Committee, with both documents presented in a position paper to the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space in 2000. In keeping with the evolving landscape of SETI research, the IAA Declaration of Principles was streamlined and updated in 2010. Recognising the need for continued adaptation, the IAA SETI Committee established a Task Group in 2022 to re-examine the protocols in light of recent advances in search methodologies, the expansion of international participation in SETI, and the increasing complexity of the global information environment. The Group recognises the living document nature of the protocols, which will require ongoing refinement to remain relevant and effective in a rapidly changing world. A draft revised Declaration of Principles was presented at the IAC 2024 in Milan, and initial feedback was received from the community, particularly members of the IAA SETI Committee. Since then, we have continued to seek broader community input in a structured process, refining the proposed updates based on further discussions and consultations. A Revised Declaration of Principles, is presented here.</description>

      <title>Antarctic Infrared Binocular Telescope. I. System Overview, Laboratory Testing, and On-Sky Performance Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared time-domain surveys remain significantly underdeveloped compared with their optical counterparts. We have developed the Antarctic Infrared Binocular Telescope (AIRBT) to study the dynamic infrared sky at Dome A, Antarctica, taking advantage of the superb infrared observational conditions at this site. AIRBT consists of two identical 15 cm f/3 optical tube assemblies and two cost-effective indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) cameras equipped with J and H filters, respectively. The cameras have 640 x 512 pixels with a size of 15 micrometers, providing a scale of 6.9 arcseconds per pixel and a field of view of 1.22 x 0.97 square degrees. We characterize the performance of the InGaAs cameras, including bias, readout noise, dark current, nonlinearity, and photon transfer curve. Our analysis highlights the distinct behaviors of InGaAs cameras compared with charge-coupled devices (CCDs). The bias and readout noise show temperature dependence, and the noise measured from the photon transfer curves has additional components that increase with exposure time. On-sky tests were conducted in October 2022 including system calibration, limiting depth, and photometric precision. For a single 3-second exposure, we achieved 5-sigma limiting magnitudes of 11.2 mag (Vega system) in J band and 9.7 mag in H band. The best photometric precision reached 20 millimagnitudes at the bright end, which could be further improved to sub-percent levels through image stacking. AIRBT was installed at Dome A in January 2023, and scientific observations began as soon as darkness set in.</description>

      <title>Modelling the nebular emission of galaxies across cosmic time with COLT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extragalactic nebular emission has long been a workhorse probe of the processes driving galaxy evolution, but the richness of JWST spectroscopy has shifted the bottleneck from data acquisition to physical interpretation and modelling. In this context, we present a major update to the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code COLT to facilitate self-consistent modelling of nebular line and continuum emission from simulated galaxies. We introduce a new thermal equilibrium solver that iteratively couples to the existing ionization solver and radiation field to compute effective gas temperatures by accurately balancing photoionization heating, radiative and dielectronic recombination, collisional ionization, charge exchange, metal and primordial line cooling, free-free emission, and Compton scattering. To prevent over-cooling where non-equilibrium hydrodynamics dominate, we introduce a Courant-limited cooling prescription tied to each cell's sound-crossing time, preserving temperatures in the diffuse halo while allowing physically motivated cooling in the interstellar medium (ISM). Applied to an isolated local galaxy simulation, the equilibrium solver reshapes the ISM phase space by reducing spuriously excessive lukewarm ($T=10^3-10^4$K) gas and better resolving warm ionized and cold neutral phases, while leaving the CGM largely intact. We further implement a level population solver based on modern atomic data, enabling accurate cooling and emissivities for a large library of UV to infrared metal lines, together with newly implemented primordial nebular continuum emission from free-free, free-bound, and two-photon processes. Finally, by applying COLT to the high-redshift THESAN-ZOOM simulations, we reproduce observed emission-line ratios, establishing COLT as a robust framework for forward modelling nebular emission across cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Resonant Loop Interferometers for High-Frequency Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves at kilohertz and higher frequencies offer a unique probe of the early Universe at temperatures well beyond the reach of the cosmic microwave background, corresponding to energy scales $\gtrsim 10^9$ GeV. Existing detector concepts fall many orders of magnitude short of the big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) bound on the stochastic background in this regime. We propose a new interferometric architecture based on closed optical loops, in which the gravitational-wave-induced phase shift accumulates coherently over many traversals. This produces sharp, narrowband resonances whose predictable comb structure provides a distinct experimental signature. For square or triangular loops with parameters compatible with the Einstein Telescope infrastructure, and finesse values of order 500, we project sensitivity that approaches and even surpasses the BBN bound up to tens of kilohertz after one year of integration. Such loop interferometers thus open a realistic and distinctive path toward exploring high-frequency stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds.</description>

      <title>MHDuet : a high-order General Relativistic Radiation MHD code for CPU and GPU architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present MHDuet, an open source evolution code for general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics with neutrino transport. The code solves the full set of Einstein equations coupled to a relativistic, magnetized fluid with an M1 neutrino radiation scheme using advanced techniques, including adaptive mesh and large eddy simulation techniques, to achieve high accuracy. The Simflowny platform generates the code from a high-level specification of the computational system, producing code that runs with either the SAMRAI or AMReX infrastructure. The choice of AMReX enables compilation and execution on GPUs, running an order of magnitude faster than on CPUs at the node level. We validate the code against benchmark tests, reproducing previous results obtained with the SAMRAI infrastructure, and demonstrate its capabilities with simulations of neutron stars employing realistic tabulated equations of state. Resolution studies clearly demonstrate convergence faster than second order in the grid spacing. Scaling tests reveal excellent strong and weak scaling performance when running on GPUs. The goal of the code is to provide a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of compact objects within multi-messenger astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Constraining Power of Wavelet vs. Power Spectrum Statistics for CMB Lensing and Weak Lensing with Learned Binning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present forecasts for constraints on the matter density ($\Omega_m$) and the amplitude of matter density fluctuations at 8h$^{-1}$Mpc ($\sigma_8$) from CMB lensing convergence maps and galaxy weak lensing convergence maps. For CMB lensing convergence auto statistics, we compare the angular power spectra ($C_\ell$'s) to the wavelet scattering transform (WST) coefficients. For CMB lensing convergence $\times$ galaxy weak lensing convergence statistics, we compare the cross angular power spectra to wavelet phase harmonics (WPH). This work also serves as the first application of WST and WPH to these probes. For CMB lensing convergence, we find that WST and $C_\ell$'s yield similar constraints in forecasts for the $\textit{Simons}$ Observatory and the South Pole Telescope. However, WST gives a tighter constraint on $\sigma_8$ by a factor of $1.7$ for $\textit{Planck}$ data. When CMB lensing convergence is crossed with galaxy weak lensing convergence projected from $\textit{Euclid}$ Data Release 2 (DR2), we find that WPH outperforms cross-$C_\ell$'s by factors between $2.4$ and $3.8$ for individual parameter constraints. To compare these different summary statistics we develop a novel learned binning approach. This method compresses summary statistics while maintaining interpretability. We find this leads to improved constraints compared to more naive binning schemes for $C_\ell$'s, WST, and most significantly WPH. By learning the binning and measuring constraints on distinct data sets, our method is robust to overfitting by construction.</description>

      <title>Predictions of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope Galactic Exoplanet Survey. IV. Lens Mass and Distance Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As part of the Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey (GBTDS), the Nancy Grace Roman Galactic Exoplanet Survey (RGES) will use microlensing to discover cold outer planets and free-floating planets unbound to stars. NASA has established several science requirements for the GBTDS to ensure RGES success. A key advantage of RGES is Roman's high angular resolution, which will allow detection of flux from many host stars. One requirement specifies that Roman must measure the masses and distances of 40% of detected planet hosts with 20% precision or better. To test this, we simulated microlensing events toward the GBTDS fields and used Fisher matrix analysis to estimate light curve parameter uncertainties. Combining these with Roman imaging observables (lens flux, relative lens-source proper motion), we estimated the achievable precision of lens mass and distance measurements. Using pyLIMASS, a publicly available code for estimating lens properties, we applied this analysis to 3,000 simulated events. Assuming the Cassan et al. (2012) exoplanet mass function, we find that &gt;40% of host stars meet the required 20% precision threshold, confirming that the GBTDS can satisfy the mission requirement. We validated our approach by comparing our inferred lens masses and distances to empirical measurements from detailed image-constrained light curve modeling of historical microlensing events with Hubble and Keck follow-up imaging. Our results agree within roughly 1 sigma, demonstrating that both approaches yield consistent and reliable mass and distance estimates, and confirming the robustness of our simulations for Roman-era microlensing science.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating Exoplanet Transit Photometry from Space with a 15-mm Aperture Optical Navigation Camera on Hayabusa2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of exoplanet transits by small satellites have gained increasing attention for reducing detection biases. However, no unambiguous detection of an exoplanet has yet been demonstrated using optics with apertures smaller than 60 mm. Here, we investigated the detectability of exoplanet transits using the telescopic Optical Navigation Camera (ONC-T) onboard the Hayabusa2 spacecraft, which has an effective aperture of only 15 mm. We conducted transit observations of the hot Jupiters WASP-189 b and MASCARA-1 b, collecting data for ten and four events, respectively. The transit signal was detected with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 13 for WASP-189 b and 8 for MASCARA-1 b for each event. Stacking all events improved the SNR to 40 and 16, respectively. The transit mid-times of each event were measured with a precision of 6 minutes and were consistent with Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) data to within 2 minutes. The planet-to-star radius ratio was determined with an absolute precision of 0.004 (6% relative) and agreed with TESS results to within 0.002 (3% relative). The recent ONC-T and TESS data enabled an update to the planetary ephemerides. We report a 4 sigma discrepancy between the updated orbital period of MASCARA-1 b and previously reported values. ONC-T sets a new record for the smallest-aperture instrument to detect an exoplanet transit from space, advancing the frontier of exoplanet science with miniature instrumentation. Our results suggest that optics as small as ONC-T may be capable of detecting transiting long-period Jupiters: a population that remains underrepresented in current surveys.</description>

      <title>Glitch noise classification in KAGRA O3GK observing data using unsupervised machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave interferometers are disrupted by various types of nonstationary noise, referred to as glitch noise, that affect data analysis and interferometer sensitivity. The accurate identification and classification of glitch noise are essential for improving the reliability of gravitational wave observations. In this study, we demonstrated the effectiveness of unsupervised machine learning for classifying images with nonstationary noise in the KAGRA O3GK data. Using a variational autoencoder (VAE) combined with spectral clustering, we identified eight distinct glitch noise categories. The latent variables obtained from VAE were dimensionally compressed, visualized in three-dimensional space, and classified using spectral clustering to better understand the glitch noise characteristics of KAGRA during the O3GK period. Our results highlight the potential of unsupervised learning for efficient glitch noise classification, which may in turn potentially facilitate interferometer upgrades and the development of future third-generation gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>The multimessenger view of Pulsar Timing Array black holes with the Horizon-AGN simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the Horizon-AGN cosmological simulation to study the properties of supermassive black hole binaries (MBHBs) contributing most to the gravitational wave background (GWB) signal expected in the pulsar timing array (PTA) band. We develop a pipeline to generate realistic populations of MBHBs, allowing us to estimate both the characteristic strain and GWB time series observable by PTA experiments. We identify potential continuous wave (CW) candidates standing above the background noise, using toy PTA sensitivities representing the current EPTA and future SKA. We estimate the probability of detecting at least one CW with signal-to-noise ratio $&gt;3$ to be $4\%$ ($20\%$) for EPTA (SKA)-like sensitivities, assuming a 10-year baseline. We find the GWB to be dominated by hundreds to thousands of binaries at redshifts in the range $0.05-1$, with chirp masses of $10^{8.5}-10^{9.5}\, M_\odot$, hosted mainly in quiescent massive galaxies residing in halos of mass $\sim 10^{13}\, M_\odot$. CW candidates have larger masses, lower redshifts and are found in even more massive halos, typical of galaxy groups and clusters. The majority of these systems would appear as AGN rather than quasars, because of their low Eddington ratios. Nevertheless, CW candidates with $f_{\rm Edd}&gt;10^{-3}$ can still outshine their hosts, particularly in radio and X-ray bands, suggesting them as the most promising route for identification. Our findings imply that optical and near-infrared searches based on light curve variability are challenging and biased toward more luminous systems. Finally, we highlight important caveats in the common method used to compare PTA observations with theoretical models. We find that GWB spectral inferences used by PTAs could be biased toward shallower slopes and higher amplitudes at $f=1/\rm yr$, thereby reducing the apparent tension between astrophysical expectations and PTA observations.</description>

      <title>Detection of spin-modulated circular polarisation and radial velocity variations in the long period Intermediate Polar 1RXS J080114.6-462324</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive photometric, spectroscopic, and polarimetric study of the intermediate polar (IP) 1RXS J080114.6-462324, using observations from the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO) 1.0-m and 1.9-m telescopes and the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT), complemented by archival TESS photometry. Photometric and photo-polarimetric data reveal a coherent modulation at the white dwarf (WD) spin period. TESS confirms periodicities of 1307.517 s (spin) and 11.803 h (orbital). Photopolarimetric and circular spectropolarimetric measurements show circular polarisation reaching ~+5%, modulated with the WD spin period, consistent with cyclotron emission from an accreting magnetic pole. Time-resolved optical spectra display prominent Balmer (H$\gamma$, H$\beta$, and H$\alpha$) and He\textsc{ii} $\lambda$4686 emission features and additional He\textsc{i} emissions, all exhibiting minimal radial-velocity variations. We detect red-shifted absorption dips adjacent to the He\textsc{ii} and H$\beta$ lines, modulated at the WD spin period; periodogram analysis of the emission lines also yields spin modulation. These observations indicate that the system is a disc-fed, low-inclination IP. The combination of circular polarisation and spin-modulated absorption by infalling accretion curtain material supports this classification. Its comparatively long orbital period among IPs and the detection of polarised emission render 1RXS J080114.6-462324 an appealing candidate for evolutionary studies, potentially offering insight into how magnetic accretion systems evolve toward synchronism at longer orbital periods.</description>

      <title>Learned harmonic mean estimation of the Bayesian evidence with normalizing flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05969v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the learned harmonic mean estimator with normalizing flows - a robust, scalable and flexible estimator of the Bayesian evidence for model comparison. Since the estimator is agnostic to sampling strategy and simply requires posterior samples, it can be applied to compute the evidence using any Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling technique, including saved down MCMC chains, or any variational inference approach. The learned harmonic mean estimator was recently introduced, where machine learning techniques were developed to learn a suitable internal importance sampling target distribution to solve the issue of exploding variance of the original harmonic mean estimator. In this article we present the use of normalizing flows as the internal machine learning technique within the learned harmonic mean estimator. Normalizing flows can be elegantly coupled with the learned harmonic mean to provide an approach that is more robust, flexible and scalable than the machine learning models considered previously. We perform a series of numerical experiments, applying our method to benchmark problems and to a cosmological example in up to 21 dimensions. We find the learned harmonic mean estimator is in agreement with ground truth values and nested sampling estimates. The open-source harmonic Python package implementing the learned harmonic mean, now with normalizing flows included, is publicly available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an approach combining diffusion models and inverse problems for the reconstruction of circumstellar disk images. Our method builds upon the Rhapsodie framework for polarimetric imaging, substituting its classical prior with a diffusion model trained on synthetic data. Our formulation explicitly incorporates stellar leakage while efficiently handling missing data and high level noise inherent to high-contrast polarimetric imaging. Experiments show significant improvement over conventional methods within our framework of assumptions, opening new perspectives for studying circumstellar environments.</description>

      <title>A Neural Symbolic Model for Space Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we unveil a new AI model, termed PhyE2E, to discover physical formulas through symbolic regression. PhyE2E simplifies symbolic regression by decomposing it into sub-problems using the second-order derivatives of an oracle neural network, and employs a transformer model to translate data into symbolic formulas in an end-to-end manner. The resulting formulas are refined through Monte-Carlo Tree Search and Genetic Programming. We leverage a large language model to synthesize extensive symbolic expressions resembling real physics, and train the model to recover these formulas directly from data. A comprehensive evaluation reveals that PhyE2E outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, delivering superior symbolic accuracy, precision in data fitting, and consistency in physical units. We deployed PhyE2E to five applications in space physics, including the prediction of sunspot numbers, solar rotational angular velocity, emission line contribution functions, near-Earth plasma pressure, and lunar-tide plasma signals. The physical formulas generated by AI demonstrate a high degree of accuracy in fitting the experimental data from satellites and astronomical telescopes. We have successfully upgraded the formula proposed by NASA in 1993 regarding solar activity, and for the first time, provided the explanations for the long cycle of solar activity in an explicit form. We also found that the decay of near-Earth plasma pressure is proportional to r^2 to Earth, where subsequent mathematical derivations are consistent with satellite data from another independent study. Moreover, we found physical formulas that can describe the relationships between emission lines in the extreme ultraviolet spectrum of the Sun, temperatures, electron densities, and magnetic fields. The formula obtained is consistent with the properties that physicists had previously hypothesized it should possess.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing Tools for Fast Detection of Gravitational Waves in the Context of LISA Space Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12929v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The field of gravitational wave (GW) detection is progressing rapidly, with several next-generation observatories on the horizon, including LISA. GW data is challenging to analyze due to highly variable signals shaped by source properties and the presence of complex noise. These factors emphasize the need for robust, advanced analysis tools. In this context, we have initiated the development of a low-latency GW detection pipeline based on quantum neural networks (QNNs). Previously, we demonstrated that QNNs can recognize GWs simulated using post-Newtonian approximations in the Newtonian limit. We then extended this work using data from the LISA Consortium, training QNNs to distinguish between noisy GW signals and pure noise. Currently, we are evaluating performance on the Sangria LISA Data Challenge dataset and comparing it against classical methods. Our results show that QNNs can reliably distinguish GW signals embedded in noise, achieving classification accuracies above 98\%. Notably, our QNN identified 5 out of 6 mergers in the Sangria blind dataset. The remaining merger, characterized by the lowest amplitude, highlights an area for future improvement in model sensitivity. This can potentially be addressed using additional mock training datasets, which we are preparing, and by testing different QNN architectures and ansatzes.</description>
