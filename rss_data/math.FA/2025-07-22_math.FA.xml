      <title>Supercyclic weighted composition operators on the space of smooth functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A weighted composition operator on the space of scalar-valued smooth functions on an open set of d-dimensional Euclidean space is supercyclic if and only if it is weakly mixing, and it is strongly supercyclic if and only if it is mixing. Every mixing such operator is chaotic. In the one-dimensional case, it is supercyclic if and only if it is mixing and if and only if it is chaotic.</description>

      <title>Composition and Volterra type operators on large Bergman spaces with rapidly decreasing weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize boundedness, compactness and Schatten class properties of generalized Volterra-type integral operators acting between large Bergman spaces $A_\omega^p$ and $A_\omega^q$ for $0 &lt;p, q\leq \infty$. To prove our characterizations, which involve Berezin-type integral transforms, we use the Littlewood-Paley formula of Constantin and Pel\'aez and corresponding embedding theorems. Our results generalize the work on integration operators of Pau and Pel\'{a}ez in J. Funct. Anal. 259 (2010), 2727--2756.</description>

      <title>Vector valued weighted analogue of converse of Wiener-L\'evy theorem and applications to modulation spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We shall prove a strong converse of the Wiener-L\'evy theorem in weighted setting for Banach algebra valued functions. In fact, it is shown that if $\omega$ is a weight on a discrete abelian group $G$, $\mathcal X$ is a unital commutative Banach algebra and if $F$ is a $\mathcal X-$valued function defined on $\mathbb C$ such that $T_F(f)=F\circ f \in A^q(\Gamma,\mathcal X)$ for all $f\in A^1_\omega(\Gamma,\mathcal X)$, then $F$ must be real analytic. Its multivariate analogue and analogue for locally compact abelian $G$ are also established. Lastly, similar results are obtained for modulation and amalgam spaces as an application.</description>

      <title>Almost uniform vs. pointwise convergence from a linear point of view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A review of the state of the art of the comparison between any two different modes of convergence of sequences of measurable functions is carried out with focus on the algebraic structure of the families under analysis. As a complement of the amount of results obtained by several authors, it is proved, among other assertions and under natural assumptions, the existence of large vector subspaces as well as of large algebras contained in the family of the sequences of measurable functions converging to zero pointwise almost everywhere but not almost uniformly, and in the family of the sequences of measurable functions converging to zero almost uniformly but not uniformly almost everywhere.</description>

      <title>Gelfand-Phillips-type properties in Banach lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $p$-limited and almost $p$-limited sets in Banach lattices and their connections with relatively $p$-compact and relatively compact sets. We investigate the weak and the strong
  Gelfand-Phillips property of order $p$, as well as the $p$-GP property introduced by Delgado and Pi\~neiro, providing conditions under which these properties may coincide. Additionally, we prove that a Banach lattice $E$ is a KB-space if and only if every almost $p$-limited set in $E$ is
  relatively weakly compact if and only if every the adjoint of a weakly compact taking values on $E$ is disjoint $p$-summing.</description>

      <title>Continual Lie algebras determined by chain complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.07431v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continual Lie algebras are infinite-dimensional generalizations of Lie algebras with discrete root system by considering continual root systems. In this paper we establish a general relation between chain complexes and continual Lie algebras. The natural orthogonality condition with respect to a product among elements of a chain complex $\mathcal C$ spaces brings about to $\mathcal C$ the structure of a graded algebra with differential relations. We prove the main result of this paper: a chain complex endowed with an appropriate Leibniz-property product of elements of its spaces
  brings about the structure of a continual Lie algebra with the root space determined by parameters for the complex. That provides a new source of examples of continual Lie algebras. Finally, as an example, we consider the case of \v{C}ech-de Rham complex associated to a foliation of a smooth manifold. In a particular case of this chain complex, we derive explicitly the commutation relations for the corresponding continual Lie algebra.</description>

      <title>How averaged is the projection?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Projection operators are important in Analysis, Optimization and Algorithm. It is well known that these operators are firmly nonexpansive. In this paper, we provide an exact result that sharpens this well-known result. We develop the theory of averaged operators and provide a lower bound. We give a result on the avergedness of operator compositions. We also provide some nonlinear examples to illustrate our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Banach spaces $C(K)$ of real-valued continuous functions from the finite product of compact lines. It turns out that the topological character of these compact lines can be used to distinguish whether two spaces of continuous functions on products are isomorphic or embeddable to each other. In particular, for compact lines $K_1, \dots, K_n, L_1, \dots, L_k$ of uncountable character and $k \neq n$, we claim that Banach spaces $C(\prod_{i=1}^n K_i)$ and $C(\prod_{j=1}^k L_j)$ are not isomorphic.</description>

      <title>Analytic diffeomorphisms of the circle and topological Riemann-Roch theorem for circle fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10517v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the group $\mathcal G$ which is the semidirect product of the group of analytic functions with values in ${\mathbb C}^*$ on the circle and the group of analytic diffeomorphisms of the circle that preserve the orientation. Then we construct the central extensions of the group $\mathcal G$ by the group ${\mathbb C}^*$. The first central extension, so-called the determinant central extension, is constructed by means of determinants of linear operators acting in infinite-dimensional locally convex topological $\mathbb C$-vector spaces. Other central extensions are constructed by $\cup$-products of group $1$-cocycles with the application to them the map related with algebraic $K$-theory. We prove in the second cohomology group, i.e. modulo of a group $2$-coboundary, the equality of the $12$th power of the $2$-cocycle constructed by the first central extension and the product of integer powers of the $2$-cocycles constructed above by means of $\cup$-products (in multiplicative notation). As an application of this result we obtain the new topological Riemann-Roch theorem for a complex line bundle $L$ on a smooth manifold $M$, where $\pi :M \to B$ is a fibration in oriented circles. More precisely, we prove that in the group $H^3(B, {\mathbb Z})$ the element $12 \, [ {\mathcal Det} (L)]$ is equal to the element $6 \, \pi_* ( c_1(L) \cup c_1(L))$, where $[{\mathcal Det} (L)]$ is the class of the determinant gerbe on $B$ constructed by $L$ and the determinant central extension.</description>
