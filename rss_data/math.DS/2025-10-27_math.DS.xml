      <title>Weak Gibbs Measures for Local Homeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a broad class of local homeomorphisms and continuous potentials, proving the existence and uniqueness of weak Gibbs measures. From the Gibbs property, we show the uniqueness of equilibrium states and derive a large deviations principle. Furthermore, we extend these results to a class of attractors that are semiconjugate to local homeomorphisms from our original setting. Our approach is based on non-uniform conformal-like property and applies to a wide range of topological dynamical systems, including non-uniformly expanding maps, zooming local homeomorphisms, attractors arising from solenoid-like constructions and certain families of partially hyperbolic horseshoes.</description>

      <title>On Non-KAM Invariant Circles for Area-Preserving Twist Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we investigate the dynamics of invariant circles in area-preserving twist maps. The invariant circles under consideration lie beyond the applicability of classical KAM theory, as the perturbations involved exceed the scope of standard KAM methods. By integrating both constructive and non-constructive techniques, we establish several results on the existence and breakdown of such non-KAM invariant circles. These findings provide new evidence in support of affirmative answers to two open questions posed by Mather in 1998.</description>

      <title>Spatially inhomogeneous two-cycles in an integrodifference equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we prove the existence of a 2-cycle in an integrodifference equation with a Laplace kernel and logistic growth function, connecting two non-trivial fixed points of the second iterate of the logistic map in the non-chaotic regime. This model was first studied by Kot (1992), and the 2-cycle we establish corresponds to one numerically observed by Bourgeois, Leblanc, and Lutscher (2018) for the Ricker growth function. We provide strong evidence that the 2-cycle for the Ricker growth function can be rigorously proven using a similar approach. Finally, we present numerical results indicating that both 2-cycles exhibit spectral stability.</description>

      <title>Multi-stable oscillations in cortical networks with two classes of inhibition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the classic view of cortical rhythms, the interaction between excitatory pyramidal neurons (E) and inhibitory parvalbumin neurons (I) has been shown to be sufficient to generate gamma and beta band rhythms. However, it is now clear that there are multiple inhibitory interneuron subtypes and that they play important roles in the generation of these rhythms. In this paper we develop a spiking network that consists of populations of E, I and an additional interneuron type, the somatostatin (S) internerons that receive excitation from the E cells and inhibit both the E cells and the I cells. These S cells are modulated by a third inhibitory subtype, VIP neurons that receive inputs from other cortical areas. We reduce the spiking network to a system of nine differential equations that characterize the mean voltage, firing rate, and synaptic conductance for each population and using this we find many instances of multiple rhythms within the network. Using tools from nonlinear dynamics, we explore the roles of each of the two classes of inhibition as well as the role of the VIP modulation on the properties of these rhythms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with semigroups of holomorphic self-maps of the upper half-plane that exhibit an extremal (i.e. the slowest possible) rate of convergence to their Denjoy--Wolff point. The main novelty lies in the parabolic case of zero hyperbolic step. We provide several characterizations for such semigroups in terms of the Herglotz representation of their infinitesimal generators, the conformality at the Denjoy--Wolff point of a modification of their associated Koenigs function, and more.</description>

      <title>Renormalized oscillation theory for singular linear Hamiltonian pencils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For many applications, critical information about system dynamics is encoded in associated eigenvalue problems that can be posed as linear Hamiltonian systems with suitable boundary conditions. Motivated by examples from hydrodynamics, quantum mechanics, and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), we develop a general framework for analyzing a broad class of linear Hamiltonian systems with at least one singular boundary condition and possible nonlinear dependence on the spectral parameter. We show that renormalized oscillation results can be obtained in a natural way through consideration of the Maslov index associated with appropriately chosen paths of Lagrangian subspaces of $\mathbb{C}^{2n}$. This extends previous work by the authors for regular linear Hamiltonian systems that depend nonlinearly on the spectral parameter and singular linear Hamiltonian systems that depend linearly on the spectral parameter. We conclude the study by using our framework to study the spectrum in the setting of each of our motivating examples.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Framework for Identifying Weakly Chaotic, Strongly Chaotic, Resonant and Non-resonant Orbits in the Generalized Kicked Rotator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21318v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying the types of orbits is an important topic in the study of chaotic dynamical systems. Beyond the well-known distinctly chaotic and regular motions, we focus on dynamics occurring in regions where regular and chaotic motions coexist and intertwine, which potentially indicating weakly chaotic orbits. This intermediate regime lies between strongly chaotic dynamics, characterized by exponential sensitivity and completely non-chaotic, purely regular behavior. In this paper, we introduce a deep learning framework to identify the types of orbits in the generalized kicked rotator system, which is challenging to study due to its complex and mixed chaotic behaviors. Our deep learning framework can be divided into two steps. First, we propose a novel algorithm that integrates the weighted Birkhoff average, the Lyapunov exponent, and the correlation dimension to identify weakly chaotic orbits. The algorithm categorizes orbits into four types: weakly chaotic, strongly chaotic, and regular orbits (which are further subdivided into resonant and non-resonant orbits), thereby creating a valuable dataset required for deep learning models. Second, we demonstrate that a well-trained 2D-CNN achieves high performance in accurately classifying orbits, largely because it effectively leverages the 2D structural information of the phase space relation. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to identify weakly chaotic orbits using deep learning methods. The method can be easily extend to other models.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the asymptotic behavior of some SIR models incorporating demography, bounded random transmission coefficient and a time-dependent vaccination strategy targeting the susceptible population. In this setting, we establish the existence and uniqueness of non-negative global solution of the models and derive conditions under which either the disease is eradicated or becomes endemic. In addition, the theoretical results are further illustrated by several numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Classification of Conditional Measures Along Certain Invariant One-Dimensional Foliations</title>

      <description>arXiv:1812.00057v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f:M\to M$ be a homeomorphism over a compact Riemannian manifold, ergodic with respect to a measure $\mu$ defined on the completion of the Borel $\sigma$-algebra and $\mathcal F$ a $f$-invariant one dimensional continuous foliation of $M$ by $C^1$-leaves. Then, if $f$ preserves a continuous $\mathcal{F}$-arc length system, then we only have three possibilities for the conditional measures of $\mu$ along $\mathcal F$, namely: - they are atomic for almost every leaf, or - for almost every leaf they are equivalent to the measure $\lambda_x$ induced by the invariant arc-length system over $\mathcal F$, or - for almost every leaf their support is a nowhere dense, perfect subset of the leaf. Furthermore, we show that restricted to ergodic partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism with one-dimensional topological neutral center direction, we are able to eliminate the third case obtaining a dichotomy.</description>

Abstract: The distributional analysis of Euclidean algorithms was carried out by Baladi and Vall\'{e}e. They showed the asymptotic normality of the number of division steps and associated costs in the Euclidean algorithm as a random variable on the set of rational numbers with bounded denominator based on the transfer operator methods. We extend their result to the Euclidean algorithm over appropriate imaginary quadratic fields by studying dynamics of the nearest integer complex continued fraction map, which is piecewise analytic and expanding but not a full branch map. By observing a finite Markov partition with a regular CW-structure, which enables us to associate the transfer operator acting on a direct sum of spaces of $C^1$-functions, we obtain the limit Gaussian distribution as well as residual equidistribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random metastability occurs when an externally forced or noisy system possesses more than one state of apparent equilibrium. This work investigates a class of random dynamical systems, arising from perturbing a one-dimensional piecewise smooth expanding map of the interval with two invariant subintervals, each supporting a unique ergodic absolutely continuous invariant measure. Upon perturbation, this invariance is destroyed, allowing trajectories to randomly switch between subintervals. We show that the invariant density of the randomly perturbed system may be approximated by an explicit convex combination of the two initially invariant densities, obtained by averaging. Further, we also identify the limit of the second Oseledets space, or coherent structure, as the perturbation shrinks to zero. Our results are applied to random paired tent maps over ergodic, measure-preserving, and invertible driving systems. Finally, we provide generalisations to systems admitting more than two initially invariant sets.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the statistics of collisions among locally confined gas particles poses a major challenge. In this work we investigate $\mathbb Z^d$-map lattices coupled by collision with simplified local dynamics that offer significant insights for the above challenging problem. We obtain a first order approximation for the first collision rate at a site $\textbf{p}^*\in \mathbb Z^d$ and we prove a distributional convergence for the first collision time to an exponential, with sharp error term. Moreover, we prove that the number of collisions at site $\textbf{p}^*$ converge in distribution to a compound Poisson distributed random variable. Key to our analysis in this infinite dimensional setting is the use of transfer operators associated with the decoupled map lattice at site $\textbf{p}^*$.</description>

Abstract: We prove a necessary and sufficient condition for a cycle on a \emph{triod} $\tau$ to be \emph{mixing}. We show that for continuous maps on a \emph{triod} $\tau$, the rule governing the coexistence of periods of \emph{slow}, \emph{fast}, and \emph{ternary} \emph{mixing} cycles induces three different linear orderings of the natural numbers, and that these orderings persist even when the underlying map is slightly perturbed.</description>

      <title>VENI, VINDy, VICI: a generative reduced-order modeling framework with uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The simulation of many complex phenomena in engineering and science requires solving expensive, high-dimensional systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). To circumvent this, reduced-order models (ROMs) have been developed to speed up computations. However, when governing equations are unknown or partially known, typically ROMs lack interpretability and reliability of the predicted solutions.
  In this work we present a data-driven, non-intrusive framework for building ROMs where the latent variables and dynamics are identified in an interpretable manner and uncertainty is quantified. Starting from a limited amount of high-dimensional, noisy data the proposed framework constructs an efficient ROM by leveraging variational autoencoders for dimensionality reduction along with a newly introduced, variational version of sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), which we refer to as Variational Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (VINDy).
  In detail, the method consists of Variational Encoding of Noisy Inputs (VENI) to identify the distribution of reduced coordinates. Simultaneously, we learn the distribution of the coefficients of a pre-determined set of candidate functions by VINDy. Once trained offline, the identified model can be queried for new parameter instances and new initial conditions to compute the corresponding full-time solutions. The probabilistic setup enables uncertainty quantification as the online testing consists of Variational Inference naturally providing Certainty Intervals (VICI). In this work we showcase the effectiveness of the newly proposed VINDy method in identifying interpretable and accurate dynamical system for the Roessler system with different noise intensities and sources. Then the performance of the overall method - named VENI, VINDy, VICI - is tested on PDE benchmarks including structural mechanics and fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Bounded-confidence opinion models with random-time interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In models of opinion dynamics, agents interact with each other and can change their opinions as a result of those interactions. One type of opinion model is a bounded-confidence model (BCM), in which opinions take continuous values and interacting agents compromise their opinions with each other if their opinions are sufficiently similar. In studies of BCMs, researchers typically assume that interactions between agents occur at deterministic times. This assumption neglects an inherent element of randomness in social interactions, and it is desirable to account for it. In this paper, we study BCMs on networks and allow agents to interact at random times. To incorporate random-time interactions, we use renewal processes to determine social-interaction event times, which can follow arbitrary interevent-time distributions (ITDs). We establish connections between these random-time-interaction BCMs and deterministic-time-interaction BCMs. We analyze the quantitative impact of ITDs on the transient dynamics of BCMs and derive approximate master equations for the time-dependent expectations of the BCM dynamics. We find that BCMs with Markovian ITDs have consistent statistical properties (in particular, they have the same expected time-dependent opinions) when the ITDs have the same mean but that the statistical properties of BCMs with non-Markovian ITDs depend on the type of ITD even when the ITDs have the same mean. Additionally, we numerically examine the transient and steady-state dynamics of our models with various ITDs on different networks and compare their expected order-parameter values and expected convergence times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a way of constructing non-autonomous Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms with roots of all orders by adapting the Anosov-Katok construction. This answers a question by Kathryn Mann and Egor Shelukin. Additionally, we construct an action of the rationals by diffeomorphism on any manifold that is not $C^0$-continuous with respect to the Euclidean topology on $\mathbb Q$.</description>

      <title>Control analysis and synthesis for general control-affine systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study controllability and constructive synthesis for control-affine systems. We introduce trajectory-dependent Gramian maps that extend the linear time-varying Gramian and yield explicit fixed-point synthesis maps. On feasible coercivity classes (uniform eigenvalue lower bounds), the Gramian map is Lipschitz, synthesis iterates exhibit factorial decay, and the Caccioppoli fixed-point theorem gives a unique fixed point that steers the system and satisfies an energy identity. When, in addition, an annihilation (range-alignment) condition holds, this fixed point coincides with the unique global minimum-energy control on the feasible set; if the coercivity bound holds uniformly for all bounded controls, the same conclusion holds on the full bounded-control space. We provide structural conditions on the input matrix that ensure the nonemptiness of the admissible class (and, in fully actuated regimes, equality with the full space) and sufficient conditions for underactuated systems via bounded-amplitude reference controls. Case studies on Hopfield network dynamics illustrate refined estimates that enlarge reachable targets. A trajectory-freezing and compactness step extends the synthesis to general nonlinear control-affine systems. The results yield verifiable controllability criteria with explicit, numerically implementable controllers.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations and Intermittency in Coupled Dissipative Kicked Rotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of complex dynamics in a system of coupled dissipative kicked rotors and show that critical transitions can be understood via bifurcations of simple states. We study multistability and bifurcations in the single rotor model, demonstrating how these give rise to a variety of coexisting spatial patterns in a coupled system. A combined order parameter is introduced to characterize different spatial patterns and to reveal the coexistence of chaotic and regular attractors. Finally, we illustrate an intermittent phenomenon near the onset of chaos.</description>

      <title>True Zero-Shot Inference of Dynamical Systems Preserving Long-Term Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex, temporally evolving phenomena, from climate to brain activity, are governed by dynamical systems (DS). DS reconstruction (DSR) seeks to infer generative surrogate models of these from observed data, reproducing their long-term behavior. Existing DSR approaches require purpose-training for any new system observed, lacking the zero-shot and in-context inference capabilities known from LLMs. Here we introduce DynaMix, a novel multivariate ALRNN-based mixture-of-experts architecture pre-trained for DSR, the first DSR model able to generalize zero-shot to out-of-domain DS. Just from a provided context signal, without any re-training, DynaMix faithfully forecasts the long-term evolution of novel DS where existing time series (TS) foundation models, like Chronos, fail -- at a fraction of the number of parameters (0.1%) and orders of magnitude faster inference times. DynaMix outperforms TS foundation models in terms of long-term statistics, and often also short-term forecasts, even on real-world time series, like traffic or weather data, typically used for training and evaluating TS models, but not at all part of DynaMix' training corpus. We illustrate some of the failure modes of TS models for DSR problems, and conclude that models built on DS principles may bear a huge potential also for advancing the TS prediction field.</description>

      <title>Efficient Parametric SVD of Koopman Operator for Stochastic Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a principled framework for analyzing nonlinear dynamical systems through linear operator theory. Recent advances in dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) have shown that trajectory data can be used to identify dominant modes of a system in a data-driven manner. Building on this idea, deep learning methods such as VAMPnet and DPNet have been proposed to learn the leading singular subspaces of the Koopman operator. However, these methods require backpropagation through potentially numerically unstable operations on empirical second moment matrices, such as singular value decomposition and matrix inversion, during objective computation, which can introduce biased gradient estimates and hinder scalability to large systems. In this work, we propose a scalable and conceptually simple method for learning the top-$k$ singular functions of the Koopman operator for stochastic dynamical systems based on the idea of low-rank approximation. Our approach eliminates the need for unstable linear-algebraic operations and integrates easily into modern deep learning pipelines. Empirical results demonstrate that the learned singular subspaces are both reliable and effective for downstream tasks such as eigen-analysis and multi-step prediction.</description>

      <title>Predictability Enables Parallelization of Nonlinear State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of parallel computing hardware has made it increasingly important to understand which nonlinear state space models can be efficiently parallelized. Recent advances like DEER (arXiv:2309.12252) or DeepPCR (arXiv:2309.16318) have shown that evaluating a state space model can be recast as solving a parallelizable optimization problem, and sometimes this approach can yield dramatic speed-ups in evaluation time. However, the factors that govern the difficulty of these optimization problems remain unclear, limiting the larger adoption of the technique. In this work, we establish a precise relationship between the dynamics of a nonlinear system and the conditioning of its corresponding optimization formulation. We show that the predictability of a system, defined as the degree to which small perturbations in state influence future behavior, impacts the number of optimization steps required for evaluation. In predictable systems, the state trajectory can be computed in $O((\log T)^2)$ time, where $T$ is the sequence length, a major improvement over the conventional sequential approach. In contrast, chaotic or unpredictable systems exhibit poor conditioning, with the consequence that parallel evaluation converges too slowly to be useful. Importantly, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that for predictable systems, the optimization problem is always well-conditioned, whereas for unpredictable systems, the conditioning degrades exponentially as a function of the sequence length. We validate our claims through extensive experiments, providing practical guidance on when nonlinear dynamical systems can be efficiently parallelized, and highlighting predictability as a key design principle for parallelizable models.</description>
