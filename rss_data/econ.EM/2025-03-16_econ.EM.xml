      <title>A New Design-Based Variance Estimator for Finely Stratified Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of design-based inference for the average treatment effect in finely stratified experiments. Here, by "design-based'' we mean that the only source of uncertainty stems from the randomness in treatment assignment; by "finely stratified'' we mean units are first stratified into groups of size k according to baseline covariates and then, within each group, a fixed number l &lt; k are assigned uniformly at random to treatment and the remainder to control. In this setting, we first show under mild conditions that inference using the difference-in-means estimator requires an estimator of its variance that is at least asymptotically upward-biased. We then present a novel estimator of the variance and show that it is upward-biased; furthermore, the magnitude of the bias depends in a natural way on the quality of the stratification. Importantly, this estimator remains well-defined even in the setting in which l = 1 or k - l = 1. We then compare our estimator with some well-known estimators that have been proposed previously for this case. We first show that, while these estimators are also upward-biased, the magnitude of their bias does not change in the natural way with the quality of stratification. To further discriminate among these estimators, we introduce a framework motivated by a thought experiment in which the finite population can be modeled as having been drawn once in an i.i.d. fashion from a well-behaved probability distribution. In this framework, we argue that our estimator dominates the others in terms of limiting bias, and that these improvements are strict except under exceptionally strong restrictions on the treatment effects. Finally, we illustrate our theoretical results through a simulation study, which reveals that our estimator can lead to substantially more precise inferences, especially when the quality of stratification is high.</description>

      <title>Constructing an Instrument as a Function of Covariates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Researchers often use instrumental variables (IV) models to investigate the causal relationship between an endogenous variable and an outcome while controlling for covariates. When an exogenous variable is unavailable to serve as the instrument for an endogenous treatment, a recurring empirical practice is to construct one from a nonlinear transformation of the covariates. We investigate how reliable these estimates are under mild forms of misspecification. Our main result shows that for instruments constructed from covariates, the IV estimand can be arbitrarily biased under mild forms of misspecification, even when imposing constant linear treatment effects. We perform a semi-synthetic exercise by calibrating data to alternative models proposed in the literature and estimating the average treatment effect. Our results show that IV specifications that use instruments constructed from covariates are non-robust to nonlinearity in the true structural function.</description>

      <title>On the numerical approximation of minimax regret rules via fictitious play</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding numerical approximations to minimax regret treatment rules is of key interest. To do so when potential outcomes are in {0,1} we discretize the action space of nature and apply a variant of Robinson's (1951) algorithm for iterative solutions for finite two-person zero sum games. Our approach avoids the need to evaluate regret of each treatment rule in each iteration. When potential outcomes are in [0,1] we apply the so-called coarsening approach. We consider a policymaker choosing between two treatments after observing data with unequal sample sizes per treatment and the case of testing several innovations against the status quo.</description>

      <title>Difference-in-Differences Meets Synthetic Control: Doubly Robust Identification and Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Difference-in-Differences (DiD) and Synthetic Control (SC) are widely used methods for causal inference in panel data, each with its own strengths and limitations. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology that integrates the advantages of both DiD and SC approaches. Our integrated approach provides a doubly robust identification strategy for causal effects in panel data with a group structure, identifying the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) under either the parallel trends assumption or the group-level SC assumption. Building on this identification result, we develop a unified semiparametric framework for estimating the ATT. Notably, while the identification-robust moment function satisfies Neyman orthogonality under the parallel trends assumption, it does not under the SC assumption, leading to different asymptotic variances under these two identification strategies. To address this challenge, we propose a multiplier bootstrap method that consistently approximates the asymptotic distribution, regardless of which identification assumption holds. Furthermore, we extend our methodology to accommodate repeated cross-sectional data and staggered treatment designs. As an empirical application, we apply our method to evaluate the impact of the 2003 minimum wage increase in Alaska on family income.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Forecast Error Variance Decompositions with Hermite Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel approach to Forecast Error Variance Decompositions (FEVD) in nonlinear Structural Vector Autoregressive models with Gaussian innovations is proposed, called the Hermite FEVD (HFEVD). This method employs a Hermite polynomial expansion to approximate the future trajectory of a nonlinear process. The orthogonality of Hermite polynomials under the Gaussian density facilitates the construction of the decomposition, providing a separation of shock effects by time horizon, by components of the structural innovation and by degree of nonlinearity. A link between the HFEVD and nonlinear Impulse Response Functions is established and distinguishes between marginal and interaction contributions of shocks. Simulation results from standard nonlinear models are provided as illustrations and an application to fiscal policy shocks is examined.</description>
