      <title>New Algorithm for Structured OFDM Channel Estimation using Subgroup Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a group-theoretic framework for structured channel estimation in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). By modeling subcarriers as the cyclic group \(\mathbb{Z}_N\), we show that nulling a subgroup \(H \subseteq \mathbb{Z}_N\) constrains the channel impulse response to its annihilator \(H^\perp\) in the dual domain. A low-complexity estimator is proposed that detects such structure by evaluating energy concentration across candidate annihilators. Simulations demonstrate consistent gains in mean squared error, bit error rate, and throughput compared with least-squares and linear minimum mean square error baselines, achieving competitive performance with substantially lower complexity and preserved interpretability.</description>

      <title>A New Particle Filter for Target Tracking in MIMO OFDM Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle filtering for target tracking using multi-input multi-output (MIMO) pulse-Doppler radars faces three long-standing obstacles: a) the absence of reliable likelihood models for raw radar data; b) the computational and statistical complications that arise when nuisance parameters (e.g., complex path gains) are augmented into state vectors; and c) the prohibitive computational burden of extracting noisy measurements of range, Doppler, and angles from snapshots. Motivated by an optimization-centric interpretation of Bayes' rule, this article addresses these challenges by proposing a new particle filtering framework that evaluates each hypothesized state using a tailored cost function, rather than relying on an explicit likelihood relation. The framework yields substantial reductions in both running time and tracking error compared to existing schemes. In addition, we examine the implementation of the proposed particle filter in MIMO orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, aiming to equip modern communication infrastructure with integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) capabilities. Experiments suggest that MIMO-OFDM with pulse-Doppler processing holds considerable promise for ISAC, particularly when wide bandwidth, extended on-target time, and large antenna aperture are utilized.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Residue Floating Numerical Architecture for High Precision Arithmetic on FPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Floating point arithmetic remains expensive on FPGA platforms due to wide datapaths and normalization logic, motivating alternative representations that preserve dynamic range at lower cost. This work introduces the Hybrid Residue Floating Numerical Architecture (HRFNA), a unified arithmetic system that combines carry free residue channels with a lightweight floating point scaling factor. We develop the full mathematical framework, derive bounded error normalization rules, and present FPGA optimized microarchitectures for modular multiplication, exponent management, and hybrid reconstruction. HRFNA is implemented on a Xilinx ZCU104, with Vitis simulation, RTL synthesis, and on chip ILA traces confirming cycle accurate correctness. The architecture achieves over 2.1 times throughput improvement and 38-52 percent LUT reduction compared to IEEE 754 single precision baselines while maintaining numerical stability across long iterative sequences. These results demonstrate that HRFNA offers an efficient and scalable alternative to floating point computation on modern FPGA devices.</description>

      <title>Secure Wireless Communication Using Distributed Coherent Transmission and Spatial Signal Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new approach to secure wireless communications using coherent distributed transmission of signals that are spatially decomposed between a two-element distributed antenna array. High-accuracy distributed coordination of microwave wireless systems supports the ability to transmit different parts of a signal from separate transmitters such that they combine coherently at a designated destination. In this paper we explore this concept using a two-element coherent distributed phased array where each of the two transmitters sends a separate component of a communication signal where each symbol is decomposed into a sum of two pseudo-random signal vectors, the coherent summation of which yields the intended symbol. By directing the transmission to an intended receiver using distributed beamforming, the summation of the two vector components is largely confined to a spatial region at the destination receiver. We implement the technique in a 50 wavelength array operating at 3 GHz. We evaluate the symbol error ratio. (SER) in two-dimensional space through simulation and measurement, showing the approach yields a spatially confined secure region where the information is recoverable(i.e., the received signal has low SER), and outside of which the information is unrecoverable (high SER). The proposed system is also compared against a traditional beamforming system where each node sends the same data. We validate experimentally that our approach achieves a low SER of 0.0082 at broadside and a SER above 0.25 at all other locations compared to a traditional beamforming approach that achieves a SER of 0 at all locations measured.</description>

      <title>Joint Channel Estimation and Localization in Pinching-Antenna OFDM Systems: The Blessing of Multipath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pinching-antenna systems (PASS) have recently attracted considerable attention owing to their capability of flexibly reconfiguring large-scale wireless channels. Motivated by this potential, we investigate the issue of joint localization and channel estimation for the uplink PASS in the presence of multipath dispersion. To this end, a comprehensive multi-user orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) uplink PASS model is first established, where the use of a cyclic prefix (CP) enables the multipath-induced time-domain dispersion to be transformed into a set of superimposed sinusoids in the frequency domain. Building upon this model, we propose a hybrid inference framework capable of accurately estimating both channel parameters and user locations. Specifically, expectation propagation is first employed to mitigate multi-user interference, while the path delays are then extracted from noisy channel state information using an orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) based approach, or a hybrid belief propagation-variational inference (BP-VI) algorithm. Then the estimated delays are subsequently refined through the embedded geometric information via an iterative localization procedure, wherein the estimated channel matrices are recursively fed back to EP. Furthermore, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived to characterize the fundamental estimation limits. Finally, simulation results validate that our proposed framework closely approaches the CRLB, with performance comparable to cooperative multi-base station localization, with significantly fewer RF chains and reduced hardware complexity.</description>

      <title>Analytical and DNN-Aided Performance Evaluation of IRS-Assisted THz Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted terahertz (THz) communication system, where the IRS facilitates connectivity between the source and destination nodes in the absence of a direct transmission path. The source-IRS and IRS-destination links are subject to various challenges, including atmospheric attenuation, asymmetric $\alpha$-$\mu$ distributed small-scale fading, and beam misalignment-induced pointing errors. The IRS link is characterized using the Laguerre series expansion (LSE) approximation, while both the source-IRS and IRS-destination channels are modeled as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) $\alpha$-$\mu$ fading channels. Furthermore, closed-form analytical expressions are derived for the outage probability (OP), average channel capacity (ACC), and average symbol error rate (ASER) for rectangular QAM (RQAM) and hexagonal QAM (HQAM) schemes over the end-to-end (e2e) link. The impact of random co-phasing and phase quantization errors are also examined. In addition to the theoretical analysis, deep neural network-based frameworks are developed to predict key performance metrics, facilitating fast and accurate system evaluation without computationally intensive analytical computations. Moreover, the asymptotic analysis in the high-signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime yields closed-form expressions for coding gain and diversity order, providing further insights into performance trends. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations validate the theoretical formulations and present a comprehensive assessment of system behavior under practical conditions.</description>

      <title>CKM-Enabled Joint Spatial-Doppler Domain Clutter Suppression for Low-Altitude UAV ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of low-altitude economy has placed higher demands on the sensing of small-sized unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) targets. However, the complex and dynamic low-altitude environment, like the urban and mountainous areas, makes clutter a significant factor affecting the sensing performance. Traditional clutter suppression methods based on Doppler difference or signal strength are inadequate for scenarios with dynamic clutter and slow-moving targets like low-altitude UAVs. In this paper, motivated by the concept of channel knowledge map (CKM), we propose a novel clutter suppression technique for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, by leveraging a new type of CKM named clutter angle map (CLAM). CLAM is a site-specific database, containing location-specific primary clutter angles for the coverage area of the ISAC base station (BS). With CLAM, the sensing signal components corresponding to the clutter environment can be effectively removed before target detection and parameter estimation, which greatly enhances the sensing performance. Besides, to take into account the scenarios when the targets and clutters are in close directions so that pure CLAM-based spatial domain clutter suppression is no longer effective, we further propose a two-step CLAM-enabled joint spatial-Doppler domain clutter suppression algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed technique effectively suppresses clutter and enhances target sensing performance, achieving accurate parameter estimation for sensing slow-moving low-altitude UAV targets.</description>

      <title>Temporal Windows of Integration for Multisensory Wireless Systems as Enablers of Physical AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the AI that interacts with the physical world in real time. Similar to multisensory perception, Physical AI makes decisions based on multimodal updates from sensors and devices. Physical AI thus operates with a finite spatial footprint of its sensory tributaries. The multimodal updates traverse heterogeneous and unreliable paths, involving wireless links. Throughput or latency guarantees do not ensure correct decision-making, as misaligned, misordered, or stale inputs still yield wrong inferences. Preserving decision-time coherence hinges on three timing primitives at the network-application interface: (i) simultaneity, a short coincidence window that groups measurements as co-temporal, (ii) causality, path-wise delivery that never lets a consequence precede its precursor, and (iii) usefulness, a validity horizon that drops information too stale to influence the current action. In this work, we focus on usefulness and adopt temporal window of integration (TWI)-Causality: the TWI enforces decision-time usefulness by assuming path-wise causal consistency and cross-path simultaneity are handled upstream. We model end-to-end path delay as the sum of sensing/propagation, computation, and access/transmission latencies, and formulate network design as minimizing the validity horizon under a delivery reliability constraint. In effect, this calibrates delay-reliability budgets for a timing-aware system operating over sensors within a finite spatial footprint. The joint choice of horizon and per-path reliability is cast as a convex optimization problem, solved to global optimality to obtain the minimal horizon and per-path allocation of reliability. This is compared favourably to a benchmark based on uniform-after-threshold allocation. Overall, this study contributes to timing-aware Physical AI in next-generation networks.</description>

      <title>Flexible Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Aided Covert Communications in UAV Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become a key role in wireless communication networks due to their flexibility and dynamic adaptability. However, the openness of UAV-based communications leads to security and privacy concerns in wireless transmissions. This paper investigates a framework of UAV covert communications which introduces flexible reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (F-RIS) in UAV networks. Unlike traditional RIS, F-RIS provides advanced deployment flexibility by conforming to curved surfaces and dynamically reconfiguring its electromagnetic properties to enhance the covert communication performance. We establish an electromagnetic model for F-RIS and further develop a fitted model that describes the relationship between F-RIS reflection amplitude, reflection phase, and incident angle. To maximize the covert transmission rate among UAVs while meeting the covert constraint and public transmission constraint, we introduce a strategy of jointly optimizing UAV trajectories, F-RIS reflection vectors, F-RIS incident angles, and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) power allocation. Considering this is a complicated non-convex optimization problem, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm-based optimization solution. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed framework and optimization method significantly outperform traditional benchmarks, and highlight the advantages of F-RIS in enhancing covert communication performance within UAV networks.</description>

      <title>On the Ambiguity Function of OFDM-based ISAC Signals Under Non-Ideal Power Amplifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) has garnered significant attention as a promising technology for next-generation wireless and vehicular communications. Among candidate waveforms, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) has been extensively investigated over the past decade for its robustness against frequency-selective fading and its favorable ranging performance. However, the waveform's sensing and communication (S&amp;C) performance depends strongly on the modulation scheme; while variable-amplitude constellations such as quadrature amplitude (QAM) are more efficient for communication, constant-modulus modulations such as phase shift keying (PSK) are more suitable for sensing. Yet, it remains unclear whether these findings persist under power amplifier (PA) nonlinearity. Because OFDM signals exhibit a high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), they require highly linear PAs to avoid distortion, which conflicts with radar requirements, where high transmit power is always beneficial for sensing. In this work, we analyze the effect of PA-induced distortions on the sensing task for PSK and QAM constellations. By introducing the Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SDR), we examine the extent of the distortion limitation on the ranging task. We complement simulation results with a theoretical characterization of the ambiguity function (AF), thereby explicitly demonstrating how distortion artifacts manifest in the zero-Doppler sidelobes (i.e, ranging sidelobes) and the zero-delay sidelobes. Simulations show that PA distortions impose a palpable performance ceiling for both constellations, reshape the AF, and reduce detection probability, diminishing the theoretical advantage of unimodular signaling and further compromising the OFDM sensing performance with non-uniform envelope signals.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Federated Learning with Relay-Assisted Aggregation in IIoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an energy-efficient transmission framework for federated learning (FL) in industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments with strict latency and energy constraints. Machinery subnetworks (SNs) collaboratively train a global model by uploading local updates to an edge server (ES), either directly or via neighboring SNs acting as decode-and-forward relays. To enhance communication efficiency, relays perform partial aggregation before forwarding the models to the ES, significantly reducing overhead and training latency. We analyze the convergence behavior of this relay-assisted FL scheme. To address the inherent energy efficiency (EE) challenges, we decompose the original non-convex optimization problem into sub-problems addressing computation and communication energy separately. An SN grouping algorithm categorizes devices into single-hop and two-hop transmitters based on latency minimization, followed by a relay selection mechanism. To improve FL reliability, we further maximize the number of SNs that meet the roundwise delay constraint, promoting broader participation and improved convergence stability under practical IIoT data distributions. Transmit power levels are then optimized to maximize EE, and a sequential parametric convex approximation (SPCA) method is proposed for joint configuration of system parameters. We further extend the EE formulation to the imperfect channel state information (ICSI). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly enhances convergence speed, reduces outage probability from 10-2 in single-hop to 10-6 and achieves substantial energy savings, with the SPCA approach reducing energy consumption by at least 2x compared to unaggregated cooperation and up to 6x over single-hop transmission.</description>

      <title>A Speculative GLRT-Backed Approach for Adversarial Resilience on Deep Learning-Based Array Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical array processing methods such as the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) provide statistically grounded solutions for signal detection and direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation, but their high computational cost limits their use in low-latency settings. Deep learning (DL) has recently emerged as an efficient alternative, offering fast inference for array processing tasks. However, DL models lack statistical guarantees and, moreover, are highly susceptible to adversarial perturbations, raising fundamental concerns about their reliability in adversarial wireless environments. To address these challenges, we propose an adversarially resilient speculative array processing framework that consists of a low-latency DL classifier backed by a theoretically-grounded GLRT validator, where DL is used for fast speculative inference and later confirmed with the GLRT. We show that second order statistics of the received array, which the GLRT operates on, are spatially invariant to L-p bounded adversarial perturbations, providing adversarial robustness and theoretically-grounded validation of DL predictions. Empirical evaluations under multiple L-p bounds, perturbation designs, and perturbation magnitudes corroborate our theoretical findings, demonstrating the superior performance of our proposed framework in comparison to multiple state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Exposing Vulnerabilities in Counterfeit Prevention Systems Utilizing Physically Unclonable Surface Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Counterfeit products pose significant risks to public health and safety through infiltrating untrusted supply chains. Among numerous anti-counterfeiting techniques, leveraging inherent, unclonable microscopic irregularities of paper surfaces is an accurate and cost-effective solution. Prior work of this approach has focused on enabling ubiquitous acquisition of these physically unclonable features (PUFs). However, we will show that existing authentication methods relying on paper surface PUFs may be vulnerable to adversaries, resulting in a gap between technological feasibility and secure real-world deployment. This gap is investigated through formalizing an operational framework for paper-PUF-based authentication. Informed by this framework, we reveal system-level vulnerabilities across both physical and digital domains, designing physical denial-of-service and digital forgery attacks to disrupt proper authentication. The effectiveness of the designed attacks underscores the strong need for security countermeasures for reliable and resilient authentication based on paper PUFs. The proposed framework further facilitates a comprehensive, stage-by-stage security analysis, guiding the design of future counterfeit prevention systems. This analysis delves into potential attack strategies, offering a foundational understanding of how various system components, such as physical features and verification processes, might be exploited by adversaries.</description>

      <title>Human perception of audio deepfakes: the role of language and speaking style</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio deepfakes have reached a level of realism that makes it increasingly difficult to distinguish between human and artificial voices, which poses risks such as identity theft or spread of disinformation. Despite these concerns, research on humans' ability to identify deepfakes is limited, with most studies focusing on English and very few exploring the reasons behind listeners' perceptual decisions. This study addresses this gap through a perceptual experiment in which 54 listeners (28 native Spanish speakers and 26 native Japanese speakers) classified voices as natural or synthetic, and justified their choices. The experiment included 80 stimuli (50% artificial), organized according to three variables: language (Spanish/Japanese), speech style (audiobooks/interviews), and familiarity with the voice (familiar/unfamiliar). The goal was to examine how these variables influence detection and to analyze qualitatively the reasoning behind listeners' perceptual decisions. Results indicate an average accuracy of 59.11%, with higher performance on authentic samples. Judgments of vocal naturalness rely on a combination of linguistic and non-linguistic cues. Comparing Japanese and Spanish listeners, our qualitative analysis further reveals both shared cues and notable cross-linguistic differences in how listeners conceptualize the "humanness" of speech. Overall, participants relied primarily on suprasegmental and higher-level or extralinguistic characteristics - such as intonation, rhythm, fluency, pauses, speed, breathing, and laughter - over segmental features. These findings underscore the complexity of human perceptual strategies in distinguishing natural from artificial speech and align partly with prior research emphasizing the importance of prosody and phenomena typical of spontaneous speech, such as disfluencies.</description>

      <title>Power Control of Multi-Layer Repeater Networks (POLARNet)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter we introduce POLARNet -- power control of multi-layer repeater networks -- for local optimization of SNR given different repeater power constraints. We assume relays or repeaters in groups or layers spatially separated. Under ideal circumstances SISO narrow-band communication and TDD, the system may be viewed as a dual to a deep neural network, where activations, corresponding to repeater amplifications, are optimized and weight matrices, corresponding to channel matrices, are static. Repeater amplifications are locally optimized layer-by-layer in a forward-backward manner over compact sets. The method is applicable for a wide range of constraints on within-layer power/energy utilization, is furthermore gradient-free, step-size-free, and has proven monotonicity in the objective. Numerical simulations show significant improvement compared to upper bounds on the expected SNR. In addition, power distribution over multiple repeaters is shown to be superior to optimal selection of single repeaters in the layers.</description>

      <title>NeuroSketch: An Effective Framework for Neural Decoding via Systematic Architectural Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural decoding, a critical component of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), has recently attracted increasing research interest. Previous research has focused on leveraging signal processing and deep learning methods to enhance neural decoding performance. However, the in-depth exploration of model architectures remains underexplored, despite its proven effectiveness in other tasks such as energy forecasting and image classification. In this study, we propose NeuroSketch, an effective framework for neural decoding via systematic architecture optimization. Starting with the basic architecture study, we find that CNN-2D outperforms other architectures in neural decoding tasks and explore its effectiveness from temporal and spatial perspectives. Building on this, we optimize the architecture from macro- to micro-level, achieving improvements in performance at each step. The exploration process and model validations take over 5,000 experiments spanning three distinct modalities (visual, auditory, and speech), three types of brain signals (EEG, SEEG, and ECoG), and eight diverse decoding tasks. Experimental results indicate that NeuroSketch achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across all evaluated datasets, positioning it as a powerful tool for neural decoding. Our code and scripts are available at https://github.com/Galaxy-Dawn/NeuroSketch.</description>

      <title>TinyD\'ej\`aVu: Smaller Memory Footprint &amp; Faster Inference on Sensor Data Streams with Always-On Microcontrollers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Always-on sensors are increasingly expected to embark a variety of tiny neural networks and to continuously perform inference on time-series of the data they sense. In order to fit lifetime and energy consumption requirements when operating on battery, such hardware uses microcontrollers (MCUs) with tiny memory budget e.g., 128kB of RAM. In this context, optimizing data flows across neural network layers becomes crucial. In this paper, we introduce TinyD\'ej\`aVu, a new framework and novel algorithms we designed to drastically reduce the RAM footprint required by inference using various tiny ML models for sensor data time-series on typical microcontroller hardware. We publish the implementation of TinyD\'ej\`aVu as open source, and we perform reproducible benchmarks on hardware. We show that TinyD\'ej\`aVu can save more than 60% of RAM usage and eliminate up to 90% of redundant compute on overlapping sliding window inputs.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Driven Adaptive Power Allocation for Optical Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSELs) have gained popularity in Optical Wireless Communication (OWC) due to their high modulation bandwidth, narrow spectral width, and directional beam, offering improved spectral efficiency and reduced multipath dispersion compared to Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs). In this work, we explore the deployment of VCSELs as Access Points (APs) in an indoor environment under mobility and time varying user distributions. To enhance performance, a Merged Access Point (MAP) topology is introduced to extend the serving area of each cell, whilst Zero Forcing (ZF) precoding is employed for inter user interference management. A sum rate maximisation problem is then formulated to maintain high quality network operation in the dynamic environment. Although deterministic methods can solve the formulated problem, they become impractical in real time due to computational complexity, particularly under high user mobility and rapidly changing channel conditions. To address this, we propose a hybrid Machine Learning (ML) based solution combining a low complexity distance based user association algorithm with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for adaptive power allocation. Simulation results show that the proposed hybrid association CNN framework achieves near optimal performance while substantially reducing computation complexity relative to optimisation based schemes. Furthermore, it operates in real time, with measured median and P95 inference latencies in the millisecond range, and maintains a small empirical worst-case gap to the Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) optimum, demonstrating both practicality and robustness under mobility.</description>

      <title>Low Complexity Weight Flexible Decoding Schemes of Linear Block Code for 6G xURLLC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low complexity error correction code is a key enabler for next generation ultra-reliable low-latency communications (xURLLC) in six generation (6G). Against this background, this paper proposes a decoding scheme for linear block code by leveraging certain interesting properties of dual codewords. It is found that dual codewords with flexible weights can provide useful decoding information for the locations and magnitudes of error bits, which yielding higher reliability performance. In addition, two decoding schemes are proposed, in which one directly utilizes intrinsic information for iterative decoding, and the other combines prior channel information with intrinsic information for decoding. Both schemes are implemented using vector multiplication and real-number comparisons, making them easy to implement in hardware. Simulation results demonstrate the validness of our study.</description>

      <title>Point Neuron Learning: A New Physics-Informed Neural Network Architecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning and neural networks have advanced numerous research domains, but challenges such as large training data requirements and inconsistent model performance hinder their application in certain scientific problems. To overcome these challenges, researchers have investigated integrating physics principles into machine learning models, mainly through: (i) physics-guided loss functions, generally termed as physics-informed neural networks, and (ii) physics-guided architectural design. While both approaches have demonstrated success across multiple scientific disciplines, they have limitations including being trapped to a local minimum, poor interpretability, and restricted generalizability. This paper proposes a new physics-informed neural network (PINN) architecture that combines the strengths of both approaches by embedding the fundamental solution of the wave equation into the network architecture, enabling the learned model to strictly satisfy the wave equation. The proposed point neuron learning method can model an arbitrary sound field based on microphone observations without any dataset. Compared to other PINN methods, our approach directly processes complex numbers and offers better interpretability and generalizability. We evaluate the versatility of the proposed architecture by a sound field reconstruction problem in a reverberant environment. Results indicate that the point neuron method outperforms two competing methods and can efficiently handle noisy environments with sparse microphone observations.</description>

      <title>Efficient Transformed Gaussian Process State-Space Models for Non-Stationary High-Dimensional Dynamical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18309v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian process state-space models (GPSSMs) offer a principled framework for learning and inference in nonlinear dynamical systems with uncertainty quantification. However, existing GPSSMs are limited by the use of multiple independent stationary Gaussian processes (GPs), leading to prohibitive computational and parametric complexity in high-dimensional settings and restricted modeling capacity for non-stationary dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient transformed Gaussian process state-space model (ETGPSSM) for scalable and flexible modeling of high-dimensional, non-stationary dynamical systems. Specifically, our ETGPSSM integrates a single shared GP with input-dependent normalizing flows, yielding an expressive non-stationary implicit process prior that can capture complex transition dynamics while significantly reducing model complexity. For the inference of the implicit process, we develop a variational inference algorithm that jointly approximates the posterior over the underlying GP and the neural network parameters defining the normalizing flows. To avoid explicit variational parameterization of the latent states, we further incorporate the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) into the variational framework, enabling accurate and efficient state estimation. Extensive empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our ETGPSSM in system dynamics learning, high-dimensional state estimation, and time-series forecasting, outperforming existing GPSSMs and neural network-based SSMs in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy.</description>

Abstract: Cryptocurrency blockchain networks safeguard digital assets using cryptographic keys, with wallets playing a critical role in generating, storing, and managing these keys. Wallets, typically categorized as hot and cold, offer varying degrees of security and convenience. However, they are generally software-based applications running on microcontrollers. Consequently, they are vulnerable to malware and side-channel attacks, allowing perpetrators to extract private keys by targeting critical algorithms, such as ECC, which processes private keys to generate public keys and authorize transactions. To address these issues, this work presents EthVault, the first hardware architecture for an Ethereum hierarchically deterministic cold wallet, featuring hardware implementations of key algorithms for secure key generation. Also, an ECC architecture resilient to side-channel and timing attacks is proposed. Moreover, an architecture of the child key derivation function, a fundamental component of cryptocurrency wallets, is proposed. The design minimizes resource usage, meeting market demand for small, portable cryptocurrency wallets. FPGA implementation results validate the feasibility of the proposed approach. The ECC architecture exhibits uniform execution behavior across varying inputs, while the complete design utilizes only 27%, 7%, and 6% of LUTs, registers, and RAM blocks, respectively, on a Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ FPGA</description>
