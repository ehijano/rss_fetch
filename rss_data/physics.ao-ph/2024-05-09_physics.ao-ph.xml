      <title>Relationship of temperature changes in the mesopause region with the climate changes at the surface from observations in 1960-2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The results of an analysis of temperature variations in the mesopause region based on long-term measurements of hydroxyl airglow at the Zvenigorod Scientific Station of the A.M. Obukhov Institute of Atmospheric Physics RAS (ZSS IAP RAS) in 1960-2024 in comparison with variations of surface temperature characterizing global-scale climate changes are presented. Along with temperature variations in the mesopause region, two versions of temperature variations in the mesopause region, normalized to the same level of solar activity, were analyzed. Quantitative estimates of a strong decrease in temperature in the mesopause region over the past decades in winter against the background of a global increase in surface temperature have been obtained. It was noted that significant coherence of long-term variations for temperature in the mesopause region with the surface temperature in the Northern Hemisphere with the use of cross-wavelet analysis, what was not previously evident in data for a shorter time interval. The possibility of such coherence was predicted in (Mokhov et al., 2017) under the continuation of global warming based on the results of model simulations for the 20-21 centuries, taking into account anthropogenic forcing. It was not previously manifested from observational data for a shorter time interval. Along with long-term trends, features of a sharp decrease in temperature in the mesopause region in the 1970s with its synchronicity with the known shift in surface climate regimes associated with El Ni\~no events were analyzed. The results of cross-wavelet analysis using data obtained at the ZSS IAP RAS for the time interval 1960-2024 indicate a more significant connection between temperature variations in the mesopause region and El Nino indices in recent decades.</description>

      <title>Improved calculation of the second-order ocean Doppler spectrum for sea state inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a simple method, based on an original change of variables, for the fast and accurate calculation of the second-order ocean Doppler spectrum that describes the sea echo of High-Frequency radars. A byproduct of the technique is the derivation of an improved weighting function which can be used for the inversion of the main sea state parameters. For this we revisit Barrick's method for the estimation of the significant wave height and the mean period from the ocean Doppler spectrum. On the basis of numerical simulations we show that a better estimation of these parameters can be reached but necessitates a preliminary bias correction that depends only on the radar frequency. A second consequence of our formulation is the derivation of a simple yet analytical nonlinear approximation of the second-order ocean Doppler spectrum when the Doppler frequency is larger than the Bragg frequency. This opens new perspective for the inversion of directional wave spectra from High-Frequency radar measurements.</description>

      <title>On-ground calibration of the X-ray, gamma-ray, and relativistic electron detector onboard TARANIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed the X-ray, Gamma-ray and Relativistic Electron detector (XGRE) onboard the TARANIS satellite, to investigate high-energy phenomena associated with lightning discharges such as terrestrial gamma-ray flashes and terrestrial electron beams. XGRE consisted of three sensors. Each sensor has one layer of LaBr$_{3}$ crystals for X-ray/gamma-ray detections, and two layers of plastic scintillators for electron and charged-particle discrimination. Since 2018, the flight model of XGRE was developed, and validation and calibration tests, such as a thermal cycle test and a calibration test with the sensors onboard the satellite were performed before the launch of TARANIS on 17 November 2020. The energy range of the LaBr$_{3}$ crystals sensitive to X-rays and gamma rays was determined to be 0.04-11.6 MeV, 0.08-11.0 MeV, and 0.08-11.3 MeV for XGRE1, 2, and 3, respectively. The energy resolution at 0.662 MeV (full width at half maximum) was to be 20.5%, 25.9%, and 28.6%, respectively. Results from the calibration test were then used to validate a simulation model of XGRE and TARANIS. By performing Monte Carlo simulations with the verified model, we calculated effective areas of XGRE to X-rays, gamma rays, electrons, and detector responses to incident photons and electrons coming from various elevation and azimuth angles.</description>

      <title>Statistical Response of ENSO Complexity to Initial Condition and Model Parameter Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studying the response of a climate system to perturbations has practical significance. Standard methods in computing the trajectory-wise deviation caused by perturbations may suffer from the chaotic nature that makes the model error dominate the true response after a short lead time. Statistical response, which computes the return described by the statistics, provides a systematic way of reaching robust outcomes with an appropriate quantification of the uncertainty and extreme events. In this paper, information theory is applied to compute the statistical response and find the most sensitive perturbation direction of different El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events to initial value and model parameter perturbations. Depending on the initial phase and the time horizon, different state variables contribute to the most sensitive perturbation direction. While initial perturbations in sea surface temperature (SST) and thermocline depth usually lead to the most significant response of SST at short- and long-range, respectively, initial adjustment of the zonal advection can be crucial to trigger strong statistical responses at medium-range around 5 to 7 months, especially at the transient phases between El Ni\~no and La Ni\~na. It is also shown that the response in the variance triggered by external random forcing perturbations, such as the wind bursts, often dominates the mean response, making the resulting most sensitive direction very different from the trajectory-wise methods. Finally, despite the strong non-Gaussian climatology distributions, using Gaussian approximations in the information theory is efficient and accurate for computing the statistical response, allowing the method to be applied to sophisticated operational systems.</description>

      <title>Unraveling how winds and surface heat fluxes control the Atlantic Ocean's meridional heat transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The North Atlantic Ocean circulation, fueled by winds and surface buoyancy fluxes, carries 1.25$\,$PettaWatts of heat poleward in the subtropics, and plays an important role in regulating global weather and climate patterns. Using a series of simulations with perturbed surface forcing, we study how winds and surface heat flux gradients affect the Atlantic meridional heat transport. We decompose the Atlantic meridional heat transport into contributions from circulation cells at warm and cold temperatures (resembling a subtropical gyre and the dense overturning circulation respectively), and a mixed circulation that contains water masses traversing both these cells. Variations in wind stress initially alter the amount of heat carried by the warm and mixed cells, but on long time scales ($&gt;$10 years), changes in the temperature distribution restore the heat transport to equilibrium. Changes in surface buoyancy forcing control the cold cell's circulation, and its associated meridional heat transport, through high-latitude processes.</description>
