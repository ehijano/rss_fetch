      <title>Linking number of grid models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the linking numbers of random links within the grid model. The linking number is treated as a random variable on the isotopy classes of 2-component links, with the paper exploring its asymptotic growth as the diagram size increases. The main result is that the $u$th moment of the linking number for a random link is a polynomial in the grid size with degree $d\leq u$, and all odd moments vanishing. The limits of the moments of the normalized linking number are computed, and it is shown that the distribution of the normalized linking number converges weakly as the grid size tends to infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study cosmetic surgeries on a knot in a homology sphere. Several constraints on knots and surgery slopes to admit such surgeries are given. Our main ingredient is the rational surgery formula of the Casson--Walker invariant for 2-component links in the 3-sphere.</description>

Abstract: Let $N_g$ be a closed non-orientable surface of genus $g\geq 3$. Let $\operatorname{Homeo}_0(N_g,\mu)$ be the identity component of the group of measure-preserving homeomorphisms of $N_g$.

      <title>Simplicial volume via foliated simplices and duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be an aspherical oriented closed connected manifold with universal cover $\widetilde{M}\to M$ and let $\Gamma=\pi_1(M)\curvearrowright (X,\mu)$ be a measure preserving action on a standard Borel probability space. We consider singular foliated simplices on the measured foliation $\Gamma\backslash(\widetilde{M}\times X)$ defined by Sauer and we compare the \emph{real singular foliated homology} with classic singular homology. We introduce a notion of \emph{foliated fundamental class} and we prove that its norm coincides with the simplicial volume of $M$. Then we consider the dual cochain complex and define the \emph{singular foliated bounded cohomology}, proving that it is isometrically isomorphic to the measurable bounded cohomology of the action $\Gamma\curvearrowright X$. As a consequence of the duality principle we deduce a vanishing criteria for the simplicial volume in terms of the vanishing of the bounded cohomology of p.m.p actions and of their transverse groupoids.</description>

      <title>Period matrices and homological quasi-trees on discrete Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study discrete period matrices associated with graphs cellularly embedded on closed surfaces, resembling classical period matrices of Riemann surfaces. Defined via integrals of discrete harmonic 1-forms, these period matrices are known to encode discrete conformal structure in the sense of circle patterns. We obtain a combinatorial interpretation of the discrete period matrix, where its minors correspond to weighted sums over certain spanning subgraphs, which we call homological quasi-trees. Furthermore, we relate the period matrix to the determinant of the Laplacian for a flat complex line bundle. We derive a combinatorial analogue of the Weil-Petersson potential on Teichm\"uller space, expressed as a weighted sum over homological quasi-trees. Finally, we prove that the collection of homological quasi-trees form a delta-matroid. The discrete period matrix plays a role similar to that of the response matrix in circular planar networks, thereby addressing a question posed by Richard Kenyon.</description>

      <title>Finiteness properties of stabilisers of oligomorphic actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An action of a group on a set is oligomorphic if it has finitely many orbits of $n$-element subsets for all $n$. We prove that for a large class of groups (including all groups of finite virtual cohomological dimension and all countable linear groups), for any oligomorphic action of such a group on an infinite set there exists a finite subset whose stabiliser is not of type $\mathrm{FP}_\infty$. This leads to obstructions on finiteness properties for permutational wreath products and twisted Brin-Thompson groups. We also prove a version for actions on flag complexes, and discuss connections to the Boone-Higman conjecture. In the appendix, we improve on the criterion of Bartholdi-Cornulier-Kochloukova for finiteness properties of wreath products, and the criterion of Kropholler-Martino for finiteness properties of graph-wreath products.</description>

      <title>The tight length spectrum of large-genus random hyperbolic surfaces with many cusps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the work of Mirzakhani \&amp; Petri \cite{Mirzakhani_petri_2019} on random hyperbolic surfaces of large genus, length statistics of closed geodesics have been studied extensively. We focus on the case of random hyperbolic surfaces with cusps, the number $n_g$ of which grows with the genus $g$. We prove that if $n_g$ grows fast enough and we restrict attention to special geodesics that are \emph{tight}, we recover upon proper normalization the same Poisson point process in the large-$g$ limit for the length statistics. The proof relies on a recursion formula for tight Weil-Petersson volumes obtained in \cite{budd2023topological} and on a generalization of Mirzakhani's integration formula to the tight setting.</description>

      <title>Towards Geometry Problem Solving in the Large Model Era: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometry problem solving (GPS) represents a critical frontier in artificial intelligence, with profound applications in education, computer-aided design, and computational graphics. Despite its significance, automating GPS remains challenging due to the dual demands of spatial understanding and rigorous logical reasoning. Recent advances in large models have enabled notable breakthroughs, particularly for SAT-level problems, yet the field remains fragmented across methodologies, benchmarks, and evaluation frameworks. This survey systematically synthesizes GPS advancements through three core dimensions: (1) benchmark construction, (2) textual and diagrammatic parsing, and (3) reasoning paradigms. We further propose a unified analytical paradigm, assess current limitations, and identify emerging opportunities to guide future research toward human-level geometric reasoning, including automated benchmark generation and interpretable neuro-symbolic integration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.14765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce holed cone structures on 3-manifolds to generalize cone structures. In the same way as a cone structure, a holed cone structure induces the holonomy representation. We consider the deformation space consisting of the holed cone structures on a 3-manifold whose holonomy representations are irreducible. This deformation space for positive cone angles is a covering space on a reasonable subspace of the character variety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A natural family of potentially 2-torsion elements in the integer homology cobordism group consists of splices of knots with their mirrors. We show that such 3-manifolds have locally trivial involutive Floer homology. We show some related families of splices also have locally trivial involutive Floer homology. Our arguments show that many gauge theoretic invariants also vanish on these 3-manifolds.</description>

      <title>Patterns of Geodesics, Shearing, and Anosov Representations of the Modular Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18457v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X=SL_3(\R)/SO(3)$. Let $\cal DFR$ be the space of discrete faithful representations of the modular group into ${\rm Isom\/}(X)$ which map the order $2$ generator to an isometry with a unique fixed point. I prove many things about the component $\cal B$ of $\cal DFR$ known as the Barbot component: It is homeomorphic to $\R^2 \times [0,\infty)$. The boundary parametrizes the Pappus representations from [{\bf S0\/}]. The interior parametrizes the complete extension of the family of Anosov representations from [{\bf BLV\/}]. The members of $\cal B$ are isometry groups of embedded patterns of geodesics in $X$ which have asymptotic properties like the edges of the Farey triangulation or shears thereof. The Anosov representations are obtained from the Pappus representations by either of two shearing operations in $X$. The shearing structure is encoded by two proper foliations of $\cal B$ into rays.</description>

      <title>A Pansiot-type subword complexity theorem for automorphisms of free groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.00676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by Pansiot's work on substitutions, we prove a similar theorem for automorphisms of a free group F of finite rank: if a right-infinite word X represents an attracting fixed point of an automorphism of F, the subword complexity of X is equivalent to n, n log log n, n log n, or n^2. The proof uses combinatorial arguments analogue to Pansiot's as well as train tracks. We also define the recurrence complexity of X, and we apply it to laminations. In particular, we show that attracting laminations have complexity equivalent to n, n log log n, n log n, or n^2 (to n if the automorphism is fully irreducible).</description>

      <title>Classification of aut-fixed subgroups in free-abelian times surface groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13540v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the direct product $G=\pi_1(\Sigma)\times \Z^k$ for $\Sigma$ a compact orientable surface with negative Euler characteristic, and give a complete classification of its fixed subgroups of automorphisms. As a corollary, we show that $G$ contains, up to isomorphism, infinitely many fixed subgroups of automorphisms if and only if $k\geq 2$, which is a contrast to that of hyperbolic groups. As an application on Nielsen fixed point theory, we provide a family of aspherical manifolds without Jiang's Bound Index Property. Moreover, we also give some results on the fixed subgroups of the direct product $H\times \Z^k$ for $H$ a non-elementary torsion-free hyperbolic group.</description>

      <title>Exotic proper actions on homogeneous spaces via convex cocompact representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a series of homogeneous spaces G/H of reductive type which admit proper actions of discrete subgroups of G isomorphic to cocompact lattices of O(n,1) (n=2,3,4) but do not admit proper actions of non-compact semisimple subgroups of G. The existence of such homogeneous spaces was previously not known even for n=2. Our construction of proper actions of discrete subgroups is based on Gu\'eritaud-Kassel's work on convex cocompact subgroups of O(n,1) and Danciger-Gu\'eritaud-Kassel's work on right-angled Coxeter groups. On the other hand, the non-existence of proper actions of non-compact semisimple subgroups is proved by the theory of nilpotent orbits and elementary combinatorics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19799v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interior polynomial was originally defined for hypergraphs and later shown to coincide with the Ehrhart polynomial of the root polytope of an associated bipartite graph. In previous work, we derived an alternating cycle recursion formula for the interior polynomial. Here, we introduce a new, more transparent recursion formula based on the structure of non-expanding sets. This formula offers a clearer combinatorial interpretation of the interior polynomial and its connection to polyhedral geometry.</description>
