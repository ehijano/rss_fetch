      <title>Revising the quantum work fluctuation framework to encompass energy conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Work is a process-based quantity, and its measurement typically requires interaction with a measuring device multiple times. While classical systems allow for non-invasive and accurate measurements, quantum systems present unique challenges due to the influence of the measuring device on the final value of work. As recent studies have shown, among these challenges is the impossibility of formulating a universal definition of work that respects energy conservation for coherent quantum systems and is compatible with the Jarzynski equality - a fluctuation relation linking the equilibrium free energy difference to the non-equilibrium work. Here we overcome this challenge by introducing a genuinely quantum, positive correction to the Jarzynski equality stemming from imposing energy conservation. When sufficiently large, this correction forces quantum work to violate the second law more often. Moreover, we construct modified two-point measurement (TPM) schemes for work that ensure energy conservation for coherent quantum states and align with our quantum-corrected fluctuation relation. We further underscore the practicality and effectiveness of these schemes by providing detailed circuit implementations for them.</description>

      <title>Contraction of Private Quantum Channels and Private Quantum Hypothesis Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum generalized divergence by definition satisfies the data-processing inequality; as such, the relative decrease in such a divergence under the action of a quantum channel is at most one. This relative decrease is formally known as the contraction coefficient of the channel and the divergence. Interestingly, there exist combinations of channels and divergences for which the contraction coefficient is strictly less than one. Furthermore, understanding the contraction coefficient is fundamental for the study of statistical tasks under privacy constraints. To this end, here we establish upper bounds on contraction coefficients for the hockey-stick divergence under privacy constraints, where privacy is quantified with respect to the quantum local differential privacy (QLDP) framework, and we fully characterize the contraction coefficient for the trace distance under privacy constraints. With the machinery developed, we also determine an upper bound on the contraction of both the Bures distance and quantum relative entropy relative to the normalized trace distance, under QLDP constraints. Next, we apply our findings to establish bounds on the sample complexity of quantum hypothesis testing under privacy constraints. Furthermore, we study various scenarios in which the sample complexity bounds are tight, while providing order-optimal quantum channels that achieve those bounds. Lastly, we show how private quantum channels provide fairness and Holevo information stability in quantum learning settings.</description>

      <title>Localized statistics decoding: A parallel decoding algorithm for quantum low-density parity-check codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum low-density parity-check codes are a promising candidate for fault-tolerant quantum computing with considerably reduced overhead compared to the surface code. However, the lack of a practical decoding algorithm remains a barrier to their implementation. In this work, we introduce localized statistics decoding, a reliability-guided inversion decoder that is highly parallelizable and applicable to arbitrary quantum low-density parity-check codes. Our approach employs a parallel matrix factorization strategy, which we call on-the-fly elimination, to identify, validate, and solve local decoding regions on the decoding graph. Through numerical simulations, we show that localized statistics decoding matches the performance of state-of-the-art decoders while reducing the runtime complexity for operation in the sub-threshold regime. Importantly, our decoder is more amenable to implementation on specialized hardware, positioning it as a promising candidate for decoding real-time syndromes from experiments.</description>

      <title>Sample Complexity of Locally Differentially Private Quantum Hypothesis Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state discrimination is an important problem in many information processing tasks. In this work we are concerned with finding its best possible sample complexity when the states are preprocessed by a quantum channel that is required to be locally differentially private. To that end we provide achievability and converse bounds for different settings. This includes symmetric state discrimination in various regimes and the asymmetric case. On the way, we also prove new sample complexity bounds for the general unconstrained setting. An important tool in this endeavor are new entropy inequalities that we believe to be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Quantum Sensing with Nanoelectronics: Fisher Information for an Adiabatic Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum systems used for metrology can offer enhanced precision over their classical counterparts. The design of quantum sensors can be optimized by maximizing the quantum Fisher information (QFI), which characterizes the precision of parameter estimation for an ideal measurement. Here we consider the response of a quantum system as a means to estimate the strength of an external perturbation that has been switched on slowly. General expressions for the QFI are derived, which also hold for interacting many-body systems in the thermodynamic limit at finite temperatures, and can be related to linear-response transport coefficients. For quantum dot nanoelectronics devices, we show that electron interactions can lead to exponential scaling of the QFI with system size, highlighting that quantum resources can be utilized in the full Fock space. The precision estimation of voltages and fields can also be achieved by practical global measurements, such as the electric current, making quantum circuits good candidates for metrological applications.</description>

      <title>Noise reduction via optimal control in a light-matter quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum noise reduction below the shot noise limit is a signature of light-matter quantum interaction. A limited amount of squeezing can be obtained along the transient evolution of a two-level system resonantly interacting with a harmonic mode. We propose the use of optimal quantum control over the two-level system to enhance the transient noise reduction in the harmonic mode in a system described by the Jaynes-Cummings model. Specifically, we propose the use of a sequence of Gaussian pulses in a given time window. We find that the correct choice of pulse times can reduce the noise in the quadrature field mode well below the shot noise, reaching reductions of over 80$\%$. As the Jaynes-Cummings model describes a pivotal light-matter quantum system, our approach for noise reduction provides an experimentally feasible protocol to produce a non-trivial amount of squeezing with current technology.</description>

      <title>Analytic solution to the nonlinear generation of squeezed states in a thermal bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model squeezed state generation in a lossy optical cavity in the presence of a thermal bath using the Lindblad master equation. We show that the exact solution is a squeezed thermal state, where thermal photons arise both from loss and from the thermal bath. We derive an exact, closed-form solution for the evolution of the quadrature uncertainty arising from pulsed degenerate spontaneous parametric down conversion in the cavity. We apply this solution under different pump conditions and show in detail how the thermal environment reduces quadrature squeezing as well as the second order coherence function.</description>

      <title>Quantum Resources Required for Binding Affinity Calculations of Amyloid beta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amyloid beta, an intrinsically disordered protein, plays a seemingly important but not well-understood role in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease. A key feature of amyloid beta, which could lead to potential therapeutic intervention pathways, is its binding affinity to certain metal centers, like iron and copper. Numerically calculating such binding affinities is a computationally challenging task, involving strongly correlated metal centers. A key bottleneck in understanding the binding affinity is obtaining estimates of the ground state energy. Quantum computers have the potential to accelerate such calculations but it is important to understand the quantum resources required. In this work, we detail a computational workflow for binding affinity calculations for amyloid beta utilizing quantum algorithms, providing estimated quantum resources required, at both the logical and hardware level.</description>

      <title>Computational Fluid Dynamics on Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: QubitSolve is working on a quantum solution for computational fluid dynamics (CFD). We have created a variational quantum CFD (VQCFD) algorithm and a 2D Software Prototype based on it. By testing the Software Prototype on a quantum simulator, we demonstrate that the partial differential equations that underlie CFD can be solved using quantum computers. We aim to determine whether a quantum advantage can be achieved with VQCFD. To do this, we compare the performance of VQCFD with classical CFD using performance models. The quantum performance model uses data from VQCFD circuits run on quantum computers. We define a key performance parameter Q_{5E7}, the ratio of quantum to classical simulation time for a size relevant to industrial simulations. Given the current state of the Software Prototype and the limited computing resources available, we can only estimate an upper bound for Q_{5E7}. While the estimated Q_{5E7} shows that the algorithm's implementation must improve significantly, we have identified several innovative techniques that could reduce it sufficiently to achieve a quantum advantage. In the next phase of development, we will develop a 3D minimum-viable product and implement those techniques.</description>

      <title>Quantum computing for corrosion-resistant materials and anti-corrosive coatings design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent estimates indicate that the U.S. Department of Defense spends over \$20 billion USD annually on corrosion-related maintenance. This expenditure is accompanied by a substantial loss in asset readiness, ranging from 10% to 30%. Moreover, the global costs associated with corrosion damage have been estimated at an astonishing \$2.5 trillion USD per year, or approximately 3.4% of global GDP in 2016. This project aims to describe how quantum computers might be leveraged to fundamentally change the way material-environment interactions are modeled for material discovery, selection, and design. This project also seeks to understand the plausibility and utility of replacing portions of classical computing workflows with algorithms optimized for quantum computing hardware. The utility of quantum computers is explored through the lens of two industrially relevant problems: (1) characterizing magnesium alloy corrosion properties in aqueous environments and (2) identifying stable niobium-rich alloys with corrosion resistance at temperatures above 1500K. This paper presents an end-to-end analysis of the complexity of both classical and quantum algorithms used in application workflows. Resource estimates are produced using a custom software package, pyLIQTR, based on the qubitized Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm. Estimates for the two aforementioned applications show that industrially-relevant computational models that have the potential to deliver commercial utility require quantum computers with thousands to hundreds of thousands of logical qubits and the ability to execute $10^{13}$ to $10^{19}$ T-gates. These estimates represent an upper bound and motivate continued research into improved quantum algorithms and resource reduction techniques.</description>

      <title>Resource overheads and attainable rates for trapped-ion lattice surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present estimates for the number of ions needed to implement fault-tolerant lattice surgery between spatially separated trapped-ion surface codes. Additionally, we determine attainable lattice surgery rates given a number of dedicated "communication ions" per logical qubit. Because our analysis depends heavily on the rate that syndrome extraction cycles take place, we survey the state-of the art and propose three possible cycle times between $10$ and $1000 \mu s$ that we could reasonably see realised provided certain technological milestones are met. Consequently, our numerical results indicate that hundreds of resource ions will be needed for lattice surgery in the slowest case, while close to a hundred thousand will be needed in the fastest case. The main factor contributing to these prohibitive estimates is the limited rate that ions can be coupled across traps. Our results therefore indicate an urgent need for improved optical coupling in order for trapped-ion quantum computers to scale.</description>

      <title>Constant search time algorithm via topological quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that quantum algorithms such as Grover's can provide a quadradic speed-up for unstructured search problems. By adding topological structure to a search problem, we show that it is possible to achieve a constant search-time quantum algorithm with a constant improvement of the search probability over classical search. Specifically, we study the spatial search algorithm implemented by a two-dimensional split-step quantum random walks that realize topologically nontrivial phases and show the asymptotic search behavior is constant with growing system size. Using analytical and numerical calculations, we determine the efficient search regions in the parameter space of the quantum walker. These regions correspond to pairs of trapped states formed near a lattice defect. By studying the spectral properties of the discrete time-evolution-operators, we show that these trapped states have large overlap with the initial state. This correspondence, which is analogous to localization by constructive interference of bound states, makes it possible to reach the best possible search-time asymptotic and produce a disorder-protected fast search in quantum random walks.</description>

      <title>Protecting three-dimensional entanglement from correlated amplitude damping channel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a crucial resource in quantum information processing, and protecting it against noise poses a significant challenge. This paper introduces two strategies for preserving qutrit-qutrit entanglement in the presence of correlated amplitude damping (CAD) noise: weak measurement (WM) and environment-assisted measurement (EAM), both combined with quantum measurement reversal (QMR). Two prototypical classes of three-dimensional entangled states are examined. The findings demonstrate that while the WM+QMR method can partially retain entanglement, the EAM+QMR approach is more effective at protecting entanglement as well as enhancing success probabilities, particularly for specific qutrit-qutrit entangled states. Additionally, we thoroughly discuss the impact of correlation effects on entanglement protection and the enhancement of success probability. Our results provide valuable insights into defending high-dimensional entanglement from CAD noise, thus offering practical solutions for the advancement of quantum information technologies.</description>

      <title>A Study on Quantum Car-Parrinello Molecular Dynamics with Classical Shadows for Resource Efficient Molecular Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) is a powerful tool to simulate physical movements of molecules for investigating properties of materials. While AIMD is successful in some applications, circumventing its high computational costs is imperative to perform large-scale and long-time simulations. In recent days, near-term quantum computers have attracted much attentions as a possible solution to alleviate the challenge. Specifically, Kuroiwa et al. proposed a new AIMD method called quantum Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics (QCPMD), which exploits the Car-Parrinello method and Langevin formulation to realize cost-efficient simulations at the equilibrium state, using near-term quantum devices. In this work, we build on the proposed QCPMD method and introduce the classical shadow technique to further improve resource efficiency of the simulations. More precisely, classical shadows are used to estimate the forces of all nuclei simultaneously, implying this approach is more effective as the number of molecules increases. We numerically study the performance of our scheme on the $\text{H}_2$ molecule and show that QCPMD with classical shadows can simulate the equilibrium state. Our results will give some insights into efficient AIMD simulations on currently-available quantum computers.</description>

      <title>ML-Powered FPGA-based Real-Time Quantum State Discrimination Enabling Mid-circuit Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Similar to reading the transistor state in classical computers, identifying the quantum bit (qubit) state is a fundamental operation to translate quantum information. However, identifying quantum state has been the slowest and most error-prone operation on superconducting quantum processors. Most existing state discrimination algorithms have only been implemented and optimized "after the fact" - using offline data transferred from control circuits to host computers. Real-time state discrimination is not possible because a superconducting quantum state only survives for a few hundred us, which is much shorter than the communication delay between the readout circuit and the host computer (i.e., tens of ms). Mid-circuit measurement (MCM), where measurements are conducted on qubits at intermediate stages within a quantum circuit rather than solely at the end, represents an advanced technique for qubit reuse. For MCM necessitating single-shot readout, it is imperative to employ an in-situ technique for state discrimination with low latency and high accuracy. This paper introduces QubiCML, a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) based system for real-time state discrimination enabling MCM - the ability to measure the state at the control circuit before/without transferring data to a host computer. A multi-layer neural network has been designed and deployed on an FPGA to ensure accurate in-situ state discrimination. For the first time, ML-powered quantum state discrimination has been implemented on a radio frequency system-on-chip FPGA platform. The deployed lightweight network on the FPGA only takes 54 ns to complete each inference. We evaluated QubiCML's performance on superconducting quantum processors and obtained an average accuracy of 98.5% with only 500 ns readout. QubiCML has the potential to be the standard real-time state discrimination method for the quantum community.</description>

      <title>Insensitivity of the two-photon Jaynes-Cummings model to thermal noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the thermal effects of the multi-photon Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM) with a method of thermo field dynamics (TFD). Letting the initial state of the whole system for the multi-photon JCM be a product of the ground state of an atom and a coherent state of a cavity field at finite temperature, we compute its time evolution. We evaluate a period of the collapse and revival of the Rabi oscillations and the relative entropy of coherence of the atom up to the second-order perturbation of the low-temperature expansion. We show that an intuitive estimation of the period matches with the result of the perturbation theory of TFD well. In particular, we witness that the period of the two-photon JCM hardly depends on the amplitude of the coherent state of the cavity field or the temperature. Numerical calculations suggest that the relative entropy of coherence of the two-photon JCM does not decay even for nonzero temperature cases as time proceeds. By contrast, the relative entropy of coherence for single-, three-, and four-photon JCMs decay as time proceeds for zero- and finite-temperature cases.</description>

      <title>On-off switchable nonreciprocal negative refraction in non-Hermitian photon-magnon hybrid systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon-magnon coupling, where electromagnetic waves interact with spin waves, and negative refraction, which bends the direction of electromagnetic waves unnaturally, constitute critical foundations and advancements in the realms of optics, spintronics, and quantum information technology. Here, we explore a magnetic-field-controlled, on-off switchable, nonreciprocal negative refraction within a non-Hermitian photon-magnon hybrid system. By integrating an yttrium iron garnet film with an inverted split-ring resonator, we discover pronounced negative refraction driven by the system's non-Hermitian properties. This phenomenon exhibits unique nonreciprocal behavior dependent on the signal's propagation direction. Our analytical model sheds light on the crucial interplay between coherent and dissipative coupling, significantly altering permittivity and permeability's imaginary components, crucial for negative refraction's emergence. This work pioneers new avenues for employing negative refraction in photon-magnon hybrid systems, signaling substantial advancements in quantum hybrid systems.</description>

      <title>Leapfrogging Sycamore: Harnessing 1432 GPUs for 7$\times$ Faster Quantum Random Circuit Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random quantum circuit sampling serves as a benchmark to demonstrate quantum computational advantage. Recent progress in classical algorithms, especially those based on tensor network methods, has significantly reduced the classical simulation time and challenged the claim of the first-generation quantum advantage experiments. However, in terms of generating uncorrelated samples, time-to-solution, and energy consumption, previous classical simulation experiments still underperform the \textit{Sycamore} processor. Here we report an energy-efficient classical simulation algorithm, using 1432 GPUs to simulate quantum random circuit sampling which generates uncorrelated samples with higher linear cross entropy score and is 7 times faster than \textit{Sycamore} 53 qubits experiment. We propose a post-processing algorithm to reduce the overall complexity, and integrated state-of-the-art high-performance general-purpose GPU to achieve two orders of lower energy consumption compared to previous works. Our work provides the first unambiguous experimental evidence to refute \textit{Sycamore}'s claim of quantum advantage, and redefines the boundary of quantum computational advantage using random circuit sampling.</description>

      <title>Resilience of the surface code to error bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction works effectively only if the error rate of gate operations is sufficiently low. However, some rare physical mechanisms can cause a temporary increase in the error rate that affects many qubits; examples include ionizing radiation in superconducting hardware and large deviations in the global control of atomic systems. We refer to such rare transient spikes in the gate error rate as error bursts. In this work, we investigate the resilience of the surface code to generic error bursts. We assume that, after appropriate mitigation strategies, the spike in the error rate lasts for only a single syndrome extraction cycle; we also assume that the enhanced error rate is uniform across the code block. Under these assumptions, and for a circuit-level depolarizing noise model, we perform Monte Carlo simulations to determine the regime in burst error rate and background error rate for which the memory time becomes arbitrarily long as the code block size grows. Our results indicate that suitable hardware mitigation methods combined with standard decoding methods may suffice to protect against transient error bursts in the surface code.</description>

      <title>Spin Hamiltonian with large fourth order terms: Triple well potentials and Bloch sphere visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of a general spin Hamiltonian with terms up to fourth order. With the coherent states the semiclassical potential is obtained and with catastrophe theory its parameter space is constructed. When the fourth order parameters are large enough the parameter space has regions where the semiclassical potential has three wells. By applying an oscillating magnetic field a trajectory in parameter space crosses the Maxwell set multiple times resulting in many ground state quantum phase transitions. Using the coherent states we are able to visualize the localization of the ground state on the Bloch sphere as the magnetic field is varied.</description>

      <title>Quantum teleportation between a continuous-variable optical qumode and a discrete-variable solid-state qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum teleportation is a fundamental ingredient for quantum information science and technology. In particular, the ability to perform quantum teleportation between quantum systems of different natures and encoding types is crucial for building complex systems, such as distributed quantum internet. Here we propose a scheme to teleport a continuous variable optical qubit, encoded in an optical qumode by means of a superposed coherent state, onto a discrete variable solid-state qubit, associated with a single nitrogen-vacancy center spin in diamond, via a hybrid entanglement. By using a newly developed method for Bell-state measurement, which relies only on light homodyne detection and spin polarization measurement, near-deterministic and -perfect quantum teleportation can be achieved for large coherent-state amplitude input. Taking noise effects into account, we find that the average teleportation fidelity can still exceed the classical limit, enabling substantial teleportation distances under realistic experimental conditions.</description>

      <title>Witnessing mass-energy equivalence with trapped atom interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art atom interferometers can keep atoms in a superposition of heights in Earth's gravitational field for times reaching minute-scale, allowing for precise measurements of the gravitational potential. Yet, the phase shifts measured in such experiments can always be explained with a non-relativistic theory of gravity. There is therefore growing interest in finding feasible ways to use such new experimental capabilities to go beyond the non-relativistic regime. Here we propose modifying the existing experimental setups to probe both the quantum and the general relativistic effects on the atom's dynamics. Our proposal consists of adding two additional laser pulses in a trapped atom interferometer that would set up a quantum clock trapped at a superposition of heights reading a quantum superposition of relativistic proper times. We derive the phases acquired by different trajectories in the interferometer and demonstrate that the effect of superposition of proper times would manifest itself in two ways in the interference pattern: as visibility modulations, and as a shift of the resonant frequency of the atom. We argue that the latter might be observable with current technology.</description>

      <title>Scalable approach to monitored quantum dynamics and entanglement phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions in monitored quantum circuits have stimulated activity in a diverse research community. However, the study of measurement-induced dynamics, due to the requirement of exponentially complex postselection, has been experimentally limited to small or specially designed systems that can be efficiently simulated classically. We present a solution to this outstanding problem by introducing a scalable protocol in $U(1)$ symmetric circuits that facilitates the observation of entanglement phase transitions \emph{directly} from experimental data, without detailed assumptions of the underlying model or benchmarking with simulated data. Thus, the method is applicable to circuits which do not admit efficient classical simulation and allows a reconstruction of the full entanglement entropy curve with minimal theoretical input. Our approach relies on adaptive circuits and a steering protocol to approximate pure-state trajectories with mixed ensembles, from which one can efficiently filter out the subsystem $U(1)$ charge fluctuations of the target trajectory to obtain its entanglement entropy. The steering protocol replaces the exponential costs of postselection and state tomography with a scalable overhead which, for fixed accuracy $\epsilon$ and circuit size $L$, scales as $\mathcal{N}_s\sim L^{5/2}/\epsilon$.</description>

      <title>Semi-definite optimization of the measured relative entropies of quantum states and channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measured relative entropies of quantum states and channels find operational significance in quantum information theory as achievable error rates in hypothesis testing tasks. They are of interest in the near term, as they correspond to hybrid quantum-classical strategies with technological requirements far less challenging to implement than required by the most general strategies allowed by quantum mechanics. In this paper, we prove that these measured relative entropies can be calculated efficiently by means of semi-definite programming, by making use of variational formulas for the measured relative entropies of states and semi-definite representations of the weighted geometric mean and the operator connection of the logarithm. Not only do the semi-definite programs output the optimal values of the measured relative entropies of states and channels, but they also provide numerical characterizations of optimal strategies for achieving them, which is of significant practical interest for designing hypothesis testing protocols.</description>

      <title>G_q-concurrence and entanglement constraints in multiqubit systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a category of one-parameter bipartite entanglement quantifiers, termed $G_q$-concurrence ($q&gt;1$), and show rigorously that they satisfy all the axiomatic conditions of an entanglement measure and can be considered as a generalization of concurrence. In addition, we establish an analytic formula relating $G_q$-concurrence to concurrence for $1&lt;q\leq2$ in two-qubit systems. Furthermore, the polygamy relation is presented based on the $G_q$-concurrence of assistance in multiqubit systems. As far as $G_q$-concurrence ($1&lt;q\leq2$) itself is concerned, however, it does not obey the monogamy relation, but we prove that the square of $G_q$-concurrence does. By means of this monogamy inequality, we construct a set of entanglement indicators that can detect genuinely multiqubit entangled states even when the tangle loses its efficacy.</description>

      <title>$n$ qubits can be entangled in two different ways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [M. Walter et al., Science 340, 1205, 7 June (2013)], via polytopes they gave a sufficient condition for genuinely entangled pure states and discussed SLOCC classification. In this paper, we study entanglement classification of pure states of $n$ qubits via the basis state matrix (BSM) whose rows are the basis states. We propose a canonical form of BSM obtained by exchanging columns (i.e. permutation of qubits) and rows of BSM and then a necessary and sufficient condition for a genuinely entangled state of n qubits via a canonical form of BSM. Thus, for any $n$ qubits, the genuinely entangled states can be partitioned into two families. One family includes all states whose BSM cannot be transformed into the canonical form. The states with the BSM are always genuinely entangled no matter what the non-zero coefficients are. GHZ and W states belong to the family. The other includes all states whose BSM can be transformed into the canonical form, but for any canonical form of BSM, some two columns or rows of the corresponding coefficient matrix are not proportional. The cluster state belongs to the family.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Quantum Operating System (QOS), a unified system stack for managing quantum resources while mitigating their inherent limitations, namely their limited and noisy qubits, (temporal and spatial) heterogeneities, and load imbalance. QOS features the $\textit{QOS compiler}$ -- a modular and composable compiler for analyzing and optimizing quantum applications to run on small and noisy quantum devices with high performance and configurable overheads. For scalable execution of the optimized applications, we propose the $\textit{QOS runtime}$ -- an efficient quantum resource management system that multi-programs and schedules the applications across space and time while achieving high system utilization, low waiting times, and high-quality results.
  We evaluate QOS on real quantum devices hosted by IBM, using 7000 real quantum runs of more than 70.000 benchmark instances. We show that the QOS compiler achieves 2.6--456.5$\times$ higher quality results, while the QOS runtime further improves the quality by 1.15--9.6$\times$ and reduces the waiting times by up to 5$\times$ while sacrificing only 1--3\% of results quality (or fidelity).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The programs described in this article and distributed with it aim (1) at integrating the optical Bloch equations governing the time evolution of the density matrix representing the quantum state of an atomic system driven by laser or microwave fields, and (2) at integrating the 1D Maxwell-Bloch equations for one or two laser fields co-propagating in an atomic vapour. The rotating wave approximation is assumed. These programs can also be used for more general quantum dynamical systems governed by the Lindblad master equation. They are written in Fortran 90; however, their use does not require any knowledge of Fortran programming. Methods for solving the optical Bloch equations in the rate equations limit, for calculating the steady-state density matrix and for formulating the optical Bloch equations in the weak probe approximation are also described.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction suppresses noise in quantum systems to allow for high-precision computations. In this work, we introduce Trivariate Bicycle Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (TB-QLDPC) codes, via an extension of the framework developed by Bravyi et al. [Nature, 627, 778-782 (2024)]. Unlike the weight-6 codes proposed in their study, our approach also offers weight-4 and weight-5 codes, which promises to be more amenable to near-term experimental setups. We show that our TB-QLDPC codes up to weight-6 have a bi-planar structure. Further, most of our new codes can also be arranged in a two-dimensional toric layout, and have substantially better encoding rates than comparable surface codes while offering comparable error suppression capabilities. For example, we can encode 4 logical qubits with distance 5 into 30 physical qubits with weight-5 check measurements, while a surface code with comparable parameters requires 100 physical qubits. The high encoding rate and compact layout make our codes highly suitable candidates for near-term hardware implementations, paving the way for a realizable quantum error correction protocol.</description>

      <title>A Method Using Photon Collapse and Entanglement to Transmit Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements cause quantum wave functions to collapse. In tackling this elusive issue, we embark on the exploration of entropy exhibited by single-qubit quantum systems. Our findings surprisingly challenge the conventional law of entropy never diminishing. We then interpret the confusing retrocausality phenomenon in Wheeler's delayed-choice experiments. The entropy reduction and the quantum retrocausality can be combined to investigate how measurements lead to collapse - A close link is shown between quantum wave function collapse and the ubiquity of photons in the environments. Next, by studying the overlooked phenomena of quantum wave function collapse, we find that quantum eigenstate sets may be artificially controlled rather than randomly selected. Our study uncovers an often overlooked aspect of quantum wave function collapse - a potential avenue for deliberate manipulation of quantum eigenstate sets, deviating from the conventional notion of random selection. Leveraging this novel insight, we propose an innovative method for direct information transmission utilizing photon wave function collapse and entanglement. Given the lack of efficient approaches for employing quantum mechanisms in information transfer, our research aims to push the boundaries of quantum mechanics and contribute to advancing this field.</description>

      <title>Quantum voting machine encoded with microwave photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a simple quantum voting machine using microwave photon qubit encoding, based on a setup comprising multiple microwave cavities and a coupled superconducting flux qutrit. This approach primarily relies on a multi-control single-target quantum phase gate. The scheme offers operational simplicity, requiring only a single step, while ensuring verifiability through the measurement of a single qubit phase information to obtain the voting results. And it provides voter anonymity, as the voting outcome is solely tied to the total number of affirmative votes. Our quantum voting machine also has scalability in terms of the number of voters. Additionally, the physical realization of the quantum voting machine is general and not limited to circuit QED. Quantum voting machine can be implemented as long as the multi-control single-phase quantum phase gate is realized in other physical systems. Numerical simulations indicate the feasibility of this quantum voting machine within the current quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Emergent limit cycles, chaos, and bistability in driven-dissipative atomic arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the driven-dissipative dynamics of subwavelength periodic atomic arrays in free space, where atoms interact via light-induced dipole-dipole interactions. We find that depending on the system parameters, the underlying mean-field model allows four different types of dynamics at late times: a single monostable steady state solution, bistability (where two stable steady state solutions exist), limit cycles and chaotic dynamics. We provide conditions on the parameters required to realize the different solutions in the thermodynamic limit. In this limit, only the monostable or bistable regime can be accessed for the parameter values accessible via light-induced dipole-dipole interactions. For finite size periodic arrays, however, we find that the mean-field dynamics of the many-body system also exhibit limit cycles and chaotic behavior. Notably, the emergence of chaotic dynamics does not rely on the randomness of an external control parameter but arises solely due to the interplay of coherent drive and dissipation.</description>

Abstract: The theory of quantum thermodynamics investigates how the concepts of heat, work, and temperature can be carried over to the quantum realm, where fluctuations and randomness are fundamentally unavoidable. These lecture notes provide an introduction to the thermodynamics of small quantum systems. It is illustrated how the laws of thermodynamics emerge from quantum theory and how open quantum systems can be modeled by Markovian master equations. Quantum systems that are designed to perform a certain task, such as cooling or generating entanglement are considered. Finally, the effect of fluctuations on the thermodynamic description is discussed.</description>

      <title>Photon number states via iterated photon addition in a loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the probabilistic generation of time-bin photon number states from a train of single photon pulses. We propose a simple interferometric feedback loop setup having a beam splitter and a possibly non-idel detector. This Hong-Ou-Mandel type scheme implements iterated photon additions. Our detailed study shows that up to 4 photons this simple setup can provide reasonable success probabilities and fidelities.</description>

      <title>JuliVQC: an Efficient Variational Quantum Circuit Simulator for Near-Term Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce JuliVQC: a light-weight, yet extremely efficient variational quantum circuit simulator. JuliVQC is part of an effort for classical simulation of the \textit{Zuchongzhi} quantum processors, where it is extensively used to characterize the circuit noises, as a building block in the Schr$\ddot{\text{o}}$dinger-Feynman algorithm for classical verification and performance benchmarking, and for variational optimization of the Fsim gate parameters. The design principle of JuliVQC is three-fold: (1) Transparent implementation of its core algorithms, realized by using the high-performance script language Julia; (2) Efficiency is the focus, with a cache-friendly implementation of each elementary operations and support for shared-memory parallelization; (3) Native support of automatic differentiation for both the noiseless and noisy quantum circuits. We perform extensive numerical experiments on JuliVQC in different application scenarios, including quantum circuits, variational quantum circuits and their noisy counterparts, which show that its performance is among the top of the popular alternatives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The power of quantum states arises in part from superpositions of product states. Can complex classical systems be designed to exhibit such superpositions of tensor products of basis states, thereby mimicking quantum states? We exhibit a one-to-one map between the product basis of quantum states comprising an arbitrary number of qubits and the eigenstates of a construction comprising classical oscillator networks. Specifically, we prove the existence of this map based on Cartesian products of graphs, where the graphs depict the layout of oscillator networks.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-party secure quantum remote sensing (SQRS) protocols enable quantum-enhanced measurements at remote locations with guaranteed security against eavesdroppers. This idea can be scaled up to networks of nodes where one party can directly measure functions of parameters at the different nodes using entangled states. However, the security on such networks decreases exponentially with the number of nodes. Here we show how this problem can be overcome in a hybrid protocol that utilises both entangled and separable states to achieve quantum-enhanced measurement precision and security on networks of any size.</description>

      <title>Utility of virtual qubits in trapped-ion quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose encoding multiple qubits inside ions in existing trapped-ion quantum computers to access more qubits and to simplify circuits implementing standard algorithms. By using such `virtual' qubits, some inter-ion gates can be replaced by intra-ion gates, reducing the use of vibrational modes of the ion chain, leading to less noise. We discuss specific examples such as the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm and random circuit sampling, using a small number of virtual qubits. Additionally, virtual qubits enable using larger number of data qubits for an error correcting code, and we consider the repetition code as an example. We also lay out practical considerations to be made when choosing states to encode virtual qubits in $^{137}\mathrm{Ba}^+$ ions, and for preparing states and performing measurements.</description>

      <title>A comment on comparing optimization on D-Wave and IBM quantum processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work [Sachdeva et al.] presented an iterative hybrid quantum variational optimization algorithm designed by Q-CTRL and executed on IBM gate-based quantum processing units (QPUs), claiming a significant performance advantage against a D-Wave quantum annealer. Here we point out major methodological problems with this comparison. Using a simple unoptimized workflow for quantum annealing, we show success probabilities multiple orders of magnitude higher than those reported by [Sachdeva et al.]. These results, which can be reproduced using open-source code and free trial access to a D-Wave quantum annealer, contradict Q-CTRL's claims of superior performance. We also provide a direct comparison between quantum annealing and a recent demonstration of digitized quantum annealing on an IBM processor, showing that analog quantum annealing on a D-Wave QPU reaches far lower energies than digitized quantum annealing on an IBM QPU.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Quantum State Discrimination with Indefinite Causal Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard quantum state discrimination problem can be understood as a communication scenario involving a sender and a receiver following these three steps: (i) the sender encodes information in pre-agreed quantum states, (ii) sends them over a noiseless channel, and (iii) the receiver decodes the information by performing appropriate measurements on the received states. In a practical setting, however, the channel is not only noisy but often also unknown, thus altering the states and making optimal decoding generally not possible. In this work, we study this noisy discrimination scenario using a protocol based on indefinite causal order. To this end, we consider the quantum switch and define its higher-order generalisations, which we call superswitches. We find that, for certain channels and ensembles, the guessing probability can be significantly improved compared to both single- and multi-copy state discrimination.</description>

      <title>Quartic quantum speedups for planted inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a quantum algorithm for the Planted Noisy $k$XOR problem (also known as sparse Learning Parity with Noise) that achieves a nearly quartic ($4$th power) speedup over the best known classical algorithm while also only using logarithmically many qubits. Our work generalizes and simplifies prior work of Hastings, by building on his quantum algorithm for the Tensor Principal Component Analysis (PCA) problem. We achieve our quantum speedup using a general framework based on the Kikuchi Method (recovering the quartic speedup for Tensor PCA), and we anticipate it will yield similar speedups for further planted inference problems. These speedups rely on the fact that planted inference problems naturally instantiate the Guided Sparse Hamiltonian problem. Since the Planted Noisy $k$XOR problem has been used as a component of certain cryptographic constructions, our work suggests that some of these are susceptible to super-quadratic quantum attacks.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous symmetry breaking in open quantum systems: strong, weak, and strong-to-weak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depending on the coupling to the environment, symmetries of open quantum systems manifest in two distinct forms, the strong and the weak. We study the spontaneous symmetry breaking among phases with different symmetries. Concrete Liouvillian models with strong and weak symmetry are constructed, and different scenarios of symmetry-breaking transitions are investigated from complementary approaches. It is demonstrated that strong symmetry always spontaneously breaks into the corresponding weak symmetry. For strong $U(1)$ symmetry, we show that strong-to-weak symmetry breaking leads to gapless Goldstone modes dictating diffusion of the symmetry charge in translational invariant systems. We conjecture that this relation among strong-to-weak symmetry breaking, gapless modes, and symmetry-charge diffusion is general for continuous symmetries. It can be interpreted as an "enhanced Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) theorem" for open quantum systems, according to which the gapless spectrum does not require non-integer filling. We also investigate the scenario where the strong symmetry breaks completely. In the symmetry-broken phase, we identify an effective Keldysh action with two Goldstone modes, describing fluctuations of the order parameter and diffusive hydrodynamics of the symmetry charge, respectively. For a particular model studied here, we uncover a transition from a symmetric phase with a "Bose surface" to a symmetry-broken phase with long-range order induced by tuning the filling. It is also shown that the long-range order of $U(1)$ symmetry breaking is possible in spatial dimension $d\geq 3$, in both weak and strong symmetry cases. Our work outline the typical scenarios of spontaneous symmetry breaking in open quantum systems, and highlights their physical consequences.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Contextuality via Rank Separation with Applications to Cloning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum contextuality is a key nonclassical feature essential for understanding advantages in quantum computation and communication. We introduce a new framework to study contextuality based solely on information processing statistics. This simple and intuitive perspective leads to a powerful criterion denoted as rank separation for identifying contextuality in various quantum scenarios. We showcase the power of this technique through several applications, including a new derivation of Hardy's quantum excess-baggage theorem, and a simplified proof of contextuality for minimum error quantum state discrimination. Finally, we show as a prominent example that quantum contextuality provides the resource in optimal phase-covariant and universal cloning schemes, hence establishing it as a fundamental source of nonclassicality in all known optimal quantum cloning scenarios.</description>

      <title>Measurement of dynamic nonlocal deformation using nanodiamond sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlocal deformation sensing achieved by integrating atomic force microscopy indentation with nanodiamond-based orientation tracking features high precision and high spatial resolution, providing a useful technique for studying the mechanical properties of soft biological systems. However, this technique is currently limited to lifeless systems because it cannot differentiate the indentation-induced deformation from that associated with live activities or other external perturbations. Here we develop a dynamic nonlocal deformation sensing method using oscillatory nanoindentation and spectroscopic analysis to overcome this limitation. The method realizes both temporally and spatially resolved mechanical analysis, with tens of microsecond time-lag precision, nanometer vertical deformation precision, and sub-hundred nanometer lateral spatial resolution, leading to the disclosure of surface/interface effects in the mechanical response of viscoelastic materials and live cells. Neglecting surface tension would underestimate the liquid-like characteristics of the materials. This work demonstrates nanodiamond sensors as a useful tool for spatial-temporal mechanical analysis of soft, complex bio-relevant materials.</description>

      <title>Solving the homogeneous Bethe-Salpeter equation with a quantum annealer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The homogeneous Bethe-Salpeter equation (hBSE), describing a bound system in a genuinely relativistic quantum-field theory framework, was solved for the first time by using a D-Wave quantum annealer. After applying standard techniques of discretization, the hBSE, in ladder approximation, can be formally transformed in a generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP), with two square matrices: one symmetric and the other non symmetric. The latter matrix poses the challenge of obtaining a suitable formal approach for investigating the non symmetric GEVP by means of a quantum annealer, i.e to recast it as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem. A broad numerical analysis of the proposed algorithms, applied to matrices of dimension up to 64, was carried out by using both the proprietary simulated-anneaing package and the D-Wave Advantage 4.1 system. The numerical results very nicely compare with those obtained with standard classical algorithms, and also show interesting scalability features.</description>

      <title>Scattering Neutrinos, Spin Models, and Permutations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of Heisenberg all-to-all coupled spin models inspired by neutrino interactions in a supernova with $N$ degrees of freedom. These models are characterized by a coupling matrix that is relatively simple in the sense that there are only a few, relative to $N$, non-trivial eigenvalues, in distinction to the classic Heisenberg spin-glass models, leading to distinct behavior in both the high-temperature and low-temperature regimes. When the momenta of the neutrinos are uniform and random in directions, we can calculate the large-$N$ partition function for the quantum Heisenberg model. In particular, the high-temperature partition function predicts a non-Gaussian density of states, providing interesting counter-examples showing the limits of general theorems on the density of states for quantum spin models. We can repeat the same argument for classical Heisenberg models, also known as rotor models, and we find the high-temperature expansion is completely controlled by the eigenvalues of the coupling matrix, and again predicts non-Gaussian behavior for the density of states as long as the number of eigenvalues does not scale linearly with $N$. Indeed, we derive the amusing fact that these \emph{thermodynamic} partition functions are essentially the generating function for counting permutations in the high-temperature regime. Finally, for the case relevant to neutrinos in a supernova, we identify the low-temperature phase as a unique state with the direction of the momenta of the neutrino dictating its coherent state in flavor-space, a state we dub the "flavor-momentum-locked" state.</description>

Abstract: We consider the strong coupling limit of lattice QCD with massless staggered quarks and study the resource requirements for quantum simulating the theory in its Hamiltonian formulation. The bosonic Hilbert space of the color-singlet degrees of freedom grows quickly with the number of quark flavors, making it a suitable testing ground for resource considerations across different platforms. In particular, in addition to the standard model of computation with qubits, we consider mapping the theory to qudits $(d&gt;2)$ and qumodes, as used on trapped-ion systems and photonic devices, respectively.</description>

      <title>Why Teach Quantum In Your Own Time: The Values of Grassroots Organizations Involved in Quantum Technologies Education and Outreach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the intersection of goals and values within grassroots organizations operating in the realm of quantum technologies (QT) education. It delineates a fundamental distinction between the objective to provide education and the drive to democratize learning through principles of inclusivity, accessibility, and diversity. The analysis reveals how these organizations navigate their nascent stages, grappling with the dual challenge of adhering to their foundational values while aspiring for sustainable growth and development in the highly specialized field of QT. The study uncovers the strategic approaches adopted by these entities, including efforts to create educational ecosystems and foster community engagement. The research underscores the potential vulnerabilities of these grassroots organizations, particularly in relation to the longevity and evolution of their initiatives as members transition into professional roles within the quantum sector. Through this investigation, the paper contributes to a nuanced understanding of how emerging educational organizations in the QT field balance their ideological commitments with practical growth considerations, highlighting the critical factors that influence their trajectory and impact.</description>

      <title>Wafer-Scale Fabrication of InGaP-on-Insulator for Nonlinear and Quantum Photonic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of manufacturable and scalable integrated nonlinear photonic materials is driving key technologies in diverse areas such as high-speed communications, signal processing, sensing, and quantum information. Here, we demonstrate a novel nonlinear platform -- InGaP-on-insulator -- optimized for visible-to-telecommunication wavelength $\chi^{\left(2\right)}$ nonlinear optical processes. In this work, we detail our 100-mm wafer-scale InGaP-on-insulator fabrication process realized via wafer bonding, optical lithography, and dry-etching techniques. The resulting wafers yield 1000s of components in each fabrication cycle, with initial designs that include chip-to-fiber couplers, 12.5-cm-long nested spiral waveguides, and arrays of microring resonators with free-spectral ranges spanning 400-900 GHz. We demonstrate intrinsic resonator quality factors as high as 324,000 (440,000) for single-resonance (split-resonance) modes near 1550 nm corresponding to 1.56 dB cm$^{-1}$ (1.22 dB cm$^{-1}$) propagation loss. We analyze the loss versus waveguide width and resonator radius to establish the operating regime for optimal 775-to-1550 nm phase matching. By combining the high $\chi^{\left(2\right)}$ and $\chi^{\left(3\right)}$ optical nonlinearity of InGaP with wafer-scale fabrication and low propagation loss, these results open promising possibilities for entangled-photon, multi-photon, and squeezed light generation.</description>

Abstract: Undergraduate students of physics in Tibet have great difficulty learning quantum mechanics (QM). We attempt to use PER-based methods to help Tibetan students learn QM. In this preliminary study, we incorporate Mathematica in a QM course at Tibet University and record students' learning experiences. Tibetan students tend to have subjective feelings of learning Mathematica, whereas Han students (majority) are more focused on the operational techniques of Mathematica. The results also suggest that both Tibetan students and Han students show limited improvement in time-independent Schrodinger equations after learning QM with Mathematica. Further effort is needed to improve the academic literacy skills of physics students in Tibet.</description>

      <title>Quantum annealing-based structural optimization with a multiplicative design update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new structural design framework, developed based on iterative optimization via quantum annealing (QA). The novelty lies in its successful design update using an unknown design multiplier obtained by iteratively solving the optimization problems with QA. In addition, to align with density-based approaches in structural optimization, multipliers are multiplicative to represent design material and serve as design variables. In particular, structural analysis is performed on a classical computer using the finite element method, and QA is utilized for topology updating. The primary objective of the framework is to minimize compliance under an inequality volume constraint, while an encoding process for the design variable is adopted, enabling smooth iterative updates to the optimized design. The proposed framework incorporates both penalty methods and slack variables to transform the inequality constraint into an equality constraint and is implemented in a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) model through QA. To demonstrate its performance, design optimization is performed for both truss and continuum structures. Promising results from these applications indicate that the proposed framework is capable of creating an optimal shape and topology similar to those benchmarked by the optimality criteria (OC) method on a classical computer.</description>

      <title>Exact Fisher zeros and thermofield dynamics across a quantum critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By setting the inverse temperature $\beta$ loose to occupy the complex plane, Michael E. Fisher showed that the zeros of the complex partition function $Z$, if approaching the real $\beta$ axis, reveal a thermodynamic phase transition. More recently, Fisher zeros have been used to mark the dynamical phase transition in quench dynamics. The success of Fisher zeros however seems limited, and it is unclear how they can be employed to shed light on quantum phase transitions or the non-unitary dynamics of open quantum systems. Here we answer this question by a comprehensive analysis of the (analytically continued) one-dimensional transverse field Ising model. We exhaust all the Fisher zeros to show that in the thermodynamic limit they congregate into a remarkably simple pattern in the form of continuous open or closed lines. These Fisher lines evolve smoothly as the coupling constant is tuned, and a qualitative change identifies the quantum critical point. By exploiting the connection between $Z$ and the thermofield double states, we obtain analytical expressions for the short- and long-time dynamics of the survival amplitude and the scaling of recurrence time at the quantum critical point. We further point out $Z$ can be realized and probed in monitored quantum circuits. The analytical results are corroborated by numerical tensor renormalization group which elevates the approach outlined here to a powerful tool for interacting quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: We propose a very simple toy model of a $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-supersymmetric quantum system and show, via Klein's construction, how to understand the system as being an $N=2$ supersymmetric system with an extra $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-grading. That is, the commutation/anticommutation rules are defined via the standard boson/fermion rules, but the system still has an underlying $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-grading that needs to be taken into account.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Theory for Optical Cooling of a Trapped Atom with Spin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooling atoms to the ground-state of optical tweezers is becoming increasingly important for high-fidelity imaging, cooling, and molecular assembly. While extensive theoretical work has been conducted on cooling in free space, fewer studies have focused on cooling in bound states. In this work, we present a unified formalism for optical cooling mechanisms in neutral atom tweezers, including resolved and unresolved sideband cooling with different trapping potentials, polarization gradient cooling, gray molasses cooling, $\Lambda$-enhanced gray molasses cooling, and Raman sideband cooling. We perform simulations and demonstrate good agreement with a simplified spin model. We derive and discuss the fundamental limits of each cooling mechanism and propose new strategies for achieving ground-state cooling in optical tweezers. Our findings provide valuable insights into optimizing cooling schemes for neutral atoms in optical tweezers, paving the way for minimizing thermal decoherence in Rydberg and molecular gates and improving efficiencies of molecular assembly.</description>

      <title>Stark Control of Plexcitonic States in Incoherent Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electro-optic control of quantum dots embedded in the plasmonic nanocavities enables active tuning of photonic devices for emerging applications in Quantum optics such as quantum information processing, entanglement and ultrafast optical switching. Here, we demonstrate the coherent control of plexcitonic states in (i) an off-resonant and (ii) a resonant coupled quantum systems through optical Stark effect (OSE). We analyze a hybrid plasmon-emitter system which exhibits tunable Fano resonance, Stark induced transparency (SIT) and vacuum Rabi splitting due to quadratic Stark shift in the degenerate states of quantum emitter (QE). In addition, a resonantly coupled system shows the signature of double Fano resonance due to Stark-induced splitting in a two-level QE. Our study shows that Stark tuning of plexcitons not only mitigates decoherence in the quantum system but it also stimulates on/off switching of spontaneous photon emission in the visible regime. Such tunable systems can be used to operate photonic integrated circuits (PIC) for applications in quantum computing and information processing.</description>

Abstract: Completely positive trace preserving maps are widely used in quantum information theory. These are mostly studied using the master equation perspective. A central part in this theory is to study whether a given system of dynamical maps $\{\Lambda_t: t \ge 0\}$ is Markovian or non-Markovian. We study the problem when the underlying Hilbert space is of infinite dimensional. We construct a sufficient condition for checking P (resp. CP) divisibility of dynamical maps. We construct several examples where the underlying Hilbert space may not be of finite dimensional. We also give a special emphasis on Gaussian dynamical maps and get a version of our result in it.</description>

      <title>Preserving quantum information in $f(Q)$ cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effects of cosmological expansion on quantum bosonic states are investigated, using quantum information theory. In particular, a generic Bogoliubov transformation of bosonic field modes is considered and the state change on a single mode is regarded as the effect of a quantum channel. Properties and capacities of this channel are thus explored in the framework of $f(Q)$ theories. As immediate result, we obtain that the information on a single-mode state appears better preserved, whenever the number of particles produced by the cosmological expansion is small. Hence, similarly to general relativity, we show that analogous particle productions result even if we consider symmetric teleparallel gravity theories. Thus, we investigate a power law $f(Q)$ model, leaving unaltered the effective gravitational coupling, and minimise the corresponding particle production. We thus show how to optimise the preservation of classical and quantum information, stored in a bosonic mode states in the remote past. Finally, we compare our findings with those obtained in general relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the optical polarizability of microwave-shielded ultracold NaCs molecules in an optical dipole trap. While dressing a pair of rotational states with a microwave field, we observe a marked dependence of the optical polarizability on the intensity and detuning of the dressing field. To precisely characterize differential energy shifts between dressed rotational states, we establish dressed-state spectroscopy. For strong dressing fields, we find that a magic rotational transition can be engineered and demonstrate its insensitivity to laser intensity fluctuations. The results of this work have direct relevance for evaporative cooling and the recent demonstration of molecular Bose-Einstein condensates [Bigagli, et al., Nature (2024)] and may open a door to precision microwave spectroscopy in interacting many-body systems of microwave-shielded molecules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a large class of models exhibiting robust ergodicity breaking in quantum dynamics. Our work is inspired by recent discussions of "topologically robust Hilbert space fragmentation," but massively generalizes in two directions: firstly from states describable as "loop-soups" to a broader class of states reminiscent of string-nets and sponges, and secondly from models restricted to square or cubic lattices, to models defined on arbitrary lattices (and even arbitrary graphs without translation invariance). Our constructions leverage a recently proposed group-theory framework [PRX 14, 021034 (2024)], and identify a host of new phenomena arising from the interplay of "group-model dynamics" and lattice structure. We make crisp connections to gauge theories, and our construction generalizes Kitaev's quantum double to infinite groups.</description>

Abstract: Quantum information decoupling is a fundamental quantum information processing task, which also serves as a crucial tool in a diversity of topics in quantum physics. In this paper, we characterize the reliability function of catalytic quantum information decoupling, that is, the best exponential rate under which perfect decoupling is asymptotically approached. We have obtained the exact formula when the decoupling cost is below a critical value. In the situation of high cost, we provide meaningful upper and lower bounds. This result is then applied to quantum state merging, exploiting its inherent connection to decoupling. In addition, as technical tools, we derive the exact exponents for the smoothing of the conditional min-entropy and max-information, and we prove a novel bound for the convex-split lemma. Our results are given in terms of the sandwiched R\'enyi divergence, providing it with a new type of operational meaning in characterizing how fast the performance of quantum information tasks approaches the perfect.</description>

Abstract: Entropic uncertainty relation (EUR) formulates the restriction of the inherent uncertainty of quantum mechanics from the information-theoretic perspective. A tighter lower bound for uncertainty relations can provide information-theoretic security to quantum communication protocols. Recently, a generalized EUR (GEUR) for the measurement of multiple observables in arbitrary many-body systems has been formulated. Here, we experimentally test this GEUR using a four-photon entangled state with a controllable decoherence channel and show that for the tripartite scenario, the GEUR improves the entropic bound from Renes--Boileau's famous results. As an application, we further demonstrate an improvement of the secure key rate in quantum key distribution from the GEUR. Our results extend the test of EURs into multipartite regimes and may find applications in practical quantum cryptography tasks.</description>

      <title>Strong Converse Exponent for Entanglement-Assisted Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.00555v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the exact strong converse exponent for entanglement-assisted classical communication of a quantum channel. Our main contribution is the derivation of an upper bound for the strong converse exponent which is characterized by the sandwiched R\'enyi divergence. It turns out that this upper bound coincides with the lower bound of Gupta and Wilde (Commun. Math. Phys. 334:867-887, 2015). Thus, the strong converse exponent follows from the combination of these two bounds. Our result has two implications. Firstly, it implies that the exponential bound for the strong converse property of quantum-feedback-assisted classical communication, derived by Cooney, Mosonyi and Wilde (Commun. Math. Phys. 344:797-829, 2016), is optimal. This answers their open question in the affirmative. Hence, we have determined the exact strong converse exponent for this problem as well. Secondly, due to an observation of Leung and Matthews, it can be easily extended to deal with the transmission of quantum information under the assistance of entanglement or quantum feedback, yielding similar results. The above findings provide, for the first time, a complete operational interpretation to the channel's sandwiched R\'enyi information of order $\alpha &gt; 1$.</description>

Abstract: The discovery of holographic codes established a surprising connection between quantum error correction and the anti-de Sitter-conformal field theory correspondence. Recent technological progress in artificial quantum systems renders the experimental realization of such holographic codes now within reach. Formulating the hyperbolic pentagon code in terms of a stabilizer graph code, we give gate sequences that are tailored to systems with long-range interactions. We show how to obtain encoding and decoding circuits for the hyperbolic pentagon code, before focusing on a small instance of the holographic code on twelve qubits. Our approach allows to verify holographic properties by partial decoding operations, recovering bulk degrees of freedom from their nearby boundary.</description>

Abstract: Measurement backaction inherently alters observed dynamics in quantum physics. In the realm of quantum synchronization, this backaction induces a phase bias, making the assessment of synchronization critically dependent on the choice of the observables. In this study, we extend the quantum phase reduction approach [PhysRevLett.132.093602] into heterodyne detection, offering a comprehensive theoretical framework for analyzing quantum synchronization dynamics through uniform continuous measurement over all possible quadrature observables. This method averages out the backaction, allowing for unbiased evaluation of synchronization between quantum oscillators while avoiding measurement-induced phase bias. Furthermore, by defining the phase and limit-cycle solution independently of specific observables, our proposed method consistently adapts to the scenario where the observables are freely modified during the time evolution. Through simulations of noise-induced synchronization, our method reveals that the number of phase clusters between oscillators is restricted by their bosonic levels.</description>

Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) is a fundamental concept for characterizing the local geometry of quantum states. After casting the geometry of pure quantum states and extracting the QGT, we generalize the geometry to mixed quantum states via the density matrix and its purification. The gauge-invariant QGT of mixed states is derived, whose real and imaginary parts are the Bures metric and the Uhlmann form, respectively. In contrast to the imaginary part of the pure-state QGT that is proportional to the Berry curvature, the Uhlmann form vanishes identically for ordinary physical processes. Moreover, there exists a Pythagorean-like equation that links different local distances and reflect the underlying fibration. The Bures metric of mixed states is shown to reduce to the corresponding Fubini-Study metric of the ground state as temperature approaches zero, establishing a correspondence despite the different underlying fibrations. We also present two examples with contrasting local geometries and discuss experimental implications.</description>

Abstract: In three dimensions, dipole-dipole interactions which alter atomic level shifts and spontaneous decay rates only persist over distances comparable to the wavelength of the emitted light. In this paper we show that it is possible to significantly extend the range of these interactions with the help of a partially transparent asymmetric mirror interface. Suppose two two-level atoms are placed on opposite sides of the interface, each at the position of the mirror image of the other. In this case, their emitted light interferes almost exactly as it would when the atoms are right next to each other. Hence their dipole-dipole interaction assumes an additional maximum, even when the actual distance of the atoms is several orders of magnitude larger than the transition wavelength. Although the resulting ultralong-range interactions are in general relatively weak, we expect them to find applications in quantum technology, like non-invasive quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Exponential Quantum Error Mitigation of BQP Computations using Verification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a modular error mitigation protocol for running $\mathsf{BQP}$ computations on a quantum computer with time-dependent noise. Utilising existing tools from quantum verification and measurement-based quantum computation, our framework interleaves standard computation rounds alongside test rounds for error-detection and inherits an exponential bound (in the number of circuit runs) on the probability that a returned classical output is correct. We repurpose these ideas in an error mitigation context, introducing a post-selection technique called basketing to address time-dependent noise behaviours and reduce overhead. The result is a first-of-its-kind error mitigation protocol which is exponentially effective and requires minimal noise assumptions, making it straightforwardly implementable on existing, NISQ devices and scalable to future, larger ones. We demonstrate the protocol experimentally using classical noisy simulation, presenting a measurement pattern which directly maps to (and can be tiled on) the heavy-hex layout of current IBM hardware.</description>

      <title>Computing Quantum Mean Values in the Deep Chaotic Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the time evolution of mean values of quantum operators in a regime plagued by two difficulties: The smallness of $\hbar$ and the presence of strong and ubiquitous classical chaos. While numerics become too computationally expensive for purely quantum calculations as $\hbar \to 0$, methods that take advantage of the smallness of $\hbar$ -- that is, semiclassical methods -- suffer from both conceptual and practical difficulties in the deep chaotic regime. We implement an approach which addresses these conceptual problems, leading to a deeper understanding of the origin of the interference contributions to the operator's mean value. We show that in the deep chaotic regime our approach is capable of unprecedented accuracy, while a standard semiclassical method (the Herman-Kluk propagator) produces only numerical noise. Our work paves the way to the development and employment of more efficient and accurate methods for quantum simulations of systems with strongly chaotic classical limits.</description>

      <title>Wigner's Phase Space Current for Variable Beam Splitters -Seeing Beam Splitters in a New Light-</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06706v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beam splitters allow us to superpose two continuous single mode quantum systems. To study the behaviour of their strongly mode mixing dynamics we consider variable beam splitters and their dynamics using Wigner's phase space distribution, W, the evolution of which is governed by the continuity-equation $ \frac{\partial}{\partial \tau} W = - {\nabla } \cdot {J}$. We derive the form of the corresponding Wigner current, J, of each outgoing mode after tracing out the other. The influence of the modes on each other is analyzed and visualized using their respective Wigner distributions and Wigner currents. This allows us to perform geometrical analyses of the mode interactions, casting new light on beam splitter behaviour. Several of the presented results should be immediately testable in experiments.</description>

Abstract: Analog and digital quantum simulators can efficiently simulate quantum many-body systems that appear in natural phenomena. However, experimental limitations of near-term devices still make it challenging to perform the entire process of quantum simulation. The purification-based quantum simulation methods can alleviate the limitations in experiments such as the cooling temperature and noise from the environment, while this method has the drawback that it requires global entangled measurement with a prohibitively large number of measurements that scales exponentially with the system size. In this Letter, we propose that we can overcome these problems by restricting the entangled measurements to the vicinity of the local observables to be measured, when the locality of the system can be exploited. We provide theoretical guarantees that the global purification operation can be replaced with local operations under some conditions, in particular for the task of cooling and error mitigation. We furthermore give a numerical verification that the localized purification is valid even when conditions are not satisfied. Our method bridges the fundamental concept of locality with quantum simulators, and therefore expected to open a path to unexplored quantum many-body phenomena.</description>

      <title>Quench dynamics in lattices above one dimension: the free fermionic case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We begin a systematic investigation of quench dynamics in higher-dimensional lattice systems considering the case of non-interacting fermions with conserved particle number. We prepare the system in a translational-invariant non-equilibrium initial state -- the simplest example being a classical configuration with fermions at fixed positions on the lattice -- and let it to evolve in time. We characterise the system's dynamics by measuring the entanglement between a finite connected region and its complement. We observe the transmutation of entanglement entropy into thermodynamic entropy and investigate how this process depends on the shape and orientation of the region with respect to the underlying lattice. Interestingly, we find that irregular regions display a distinctive multi-slope entanglement growth, while the dependence on the orientation angle is generically fairly weak. This is particularly true for regions with a large (discrete) rotational symmetry group. The main tool of our analysis is the celebrated quasiparticle picture of Calabrese and Cardy, which we generalise to describe the case at hand. Specifically, we show that for generic initial configurations (even when restricting to classical ones) one has to allow for the production of multiplets involving ${n&gt;2}$ quasiparticles and carrying non-diagonal correlations. We obtain quantitatively accurate predictions -- tested against exact numerics -- and propose an efficient Monte Carlo-based scheme to evaluate them for arbitrary connected regions of generic higher dimensional lattices.</description>

      <title>Optimal Zeno Dragging for Quantum Control: A Shortcut to Zeno with Action-based Scheduling Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum Zeno effect asserts that quantum measurements inhibit simultaneous unitary dynamics when the "collapse" events are sufficiently strong and frequent. This applies in the limit of strong continuous measurement or dissipation. It is possible to implement a dissipative control that is known as "Zeno Dragging", by dynamically varying the monitored observable, and hence also the eigenstates which are attractors under Zeno dynamics. This is similar to adiabatic processes, in that the Zeno dragging fidelity is highest when the rate of eigenstate change is slow compared to the measurement rate. We demonstrate here two theoretical methods for using such dynamics to achieve control of quantum systems. The first, which we shall refer to as "shortcut to Zeno" (STZ), is analogous to the shortcuts to adiabaticity (counterdiabatic driving) that are frequently used to accelerate unitary adiabatic evolution. In the second approach we apply the Chantasri Dressel Jordan (2013, CDJ) stochastic action, and demonstrate that the extremal-probability readout paths derived from this are well suited to setting up a Pontryagin-style optimization of the Zeno dragging schedule. A fundamental contribution of the latter approach is to show that an action suitable for measurement-driven control optimization can be derived quite generally from statistical arguments. Implementing these methods on the Zeno dragging of a qubit, we find that both approaches yield the same solution, namely, that the optimal control is a unitary that matches the motion of the Zeno-monitored eigenstate. We then show that such a solution can be more robust than a unitary-only operation, and comment on solvable generalizations of our qubit example embedded in larger systems. These methods open up new pathways toward systematically developing dynamic control of Zeno subspaces to realize dissipatively-stabilized quantum operations.</description>

      <title>Error-corrected Hadamard gate simulated at the circuit level</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We simulate the logical Hadamard gate in the surface code under a circuit-level noise model, compiling it to a physical circuit on square-grid connectivity hardware. Our paper is the first to do this for a logical unitary gate on a quantum error-correction code. We consider two proposals, both via patch-deformation: one that applies a transversal Hadamard gate (i.e. a domain wall through time) to interchange the logical $X$ and $Z$ strings, and another that applies a domain wall through space to achieve this interchange. We explain in detail why they perform the logical Hadamard gate by tracking how the stabilisers and the logical operators are transformed in each quantum error-correction round. We optimise the physical circuits and evaluate their logical failure probabilities, which we find to be comparable to those of a quantum memory experiment for the same number of quantum error-correction rounds. We present syndrome-extraction circuits that maintain the same effective distance under circuit-level noise as under phenomenological noise. We also explain how a $SWAP$-quantum error-correction round (required to return the patch to its initial position) can be compiled to only four two-qubit gate layers. This can be applied to more general scenarios and, as a byproduct, explains from first principles how the "stepping" circuits of the recent Google paper [McEwen, Bacon, and Gidney, Quantum 7, 1172 (2023)] can be constructed.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a scheme to enhance the sensitivity in detecting weak variations in a parameter of an optoelectromechanical system by detecting the system response at radio frequencies. We consider a setup, where either one or two mechanical modes mediate the interaction between an optical cavity and an rf resonator. This system can be operated in a regime of impedance matching where thermal fluctuations are redistributed among the system elements, and, in particular, rf output noise can be reduced to the quantum vacuum noise level. We show that this effect can be used to boost the sensitivity in detecting parameter variations also in regimes of high thermal noise. We characterize the performance of this protocol in detecting variations in the capacitance of the rf resonator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11147v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-fidelity quantum gates are an essential prerequisite for large-scale quantum computation. When manipulating practical quantum systems, environmentally and operationally induced errors are inevitable, and thus, in addition to being fast, it is preferable that operations should be intrinsically robust against different errors. Here, we propose a general protocol for constructing geometric quantum gates with on-demand trajectories by modulating the applied pulse shapes that define the system's evolution trajectory. Our scheme adopts reverse engineering of the target Hamiltonian using smooth pulses, which also eliminates the difficulty of calculating geometric phases for an arbitrary trajectory. Furthermore, because a particular geometric gate can be induced by various different trajectories, we can further optimize the gate performance under different scenarios; the results of numerical simulations indicate that this optimization can greatly enhance the quality of the gate. In addition, we present an implementation of our proposal using superconducting circuits, showcasing substantial enhancements in gate performance compared with conventional schemes. Our protocol thus presents a promising approach for high-fidelity and strong-robust geometric quantum gates for large-scale quantum computation.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Signal Processing (QSP), together with the quantum singular value transformation, is one of the central quantum algorithms due to its efficiency and generality in many fields including quantum simulation, quantum machine learning, and quantum cryptography. The largest bottleneck of QSP and its family is its difficulty in finding the phase angle sequence for signal processing. We find that this is in particular prominent when one employs the generalized formalism of the QSP, or the GQSP, to employ arbitrary single-qubit unitaries for signal processing operator. In this work, we extend the framework of GQSP and propose a robust angle finding algorithm. The proposed angle finding algorithm, based on Prony's method, successfully generates angle sequence of precision $10^{-13}$ up to polynomial degrees of hundreds within a second. By applying our method to Hamiltonian simulation, we find that the number of calls, or queries, to signal operators are essentially halved compared to the ordinary framework of QSP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the performance of a one-dimensional dimerized XY chain as a spin quantum battery. Such integrable model shows a rich quantum phase diagram that emerges through a mapping of the spins onto auxiliary fermionic degrees of freedom. We consider a charging protocol relying on the double quench of an internal parameter, namely the strength of the dimerization, and address the energy stored in the systems. We observe three distinct regimes, depending on the time-scale characterizing the duration of the charging: a short-time regime related to the dynamics of the single dimers, a long-time regime related to the recurrence time of the system at finite size, and a thermodynamic limit time regime. In the latter, the energy stored is almost unaffected by the charging time and the precise values of the charging parameters, provided the quench crosses a quantum phase transition. Such a robust many-body effect, that characterizes also other models like the quantum Ising chain in a transverse field, as we prove analytically, can play a relevant role in the design of stable solid-state quantum batteries.</description>

Abstract: Subtracting accidental coincidences is a common practice quantum optics experiments. For zero mean Gaussian states, such as squeezed vacuum, we show that if one removes accidental coincidences the measurement results are quantitatively the same, both for photon coincidences at very low flux and for intensity covariances. Consequently, pure quantum effects at the photon level, like interference of photon wave functions or photon bunching, are reproduced in the correlation of fluctuations of macroscopic beams issued from spontaneous down conversion. This is true both in experiment if the detection resolution is smaller than the coherence cell (size of the mode), and in stochastic simulations based on sampling the Wigner function. We discuss the limitations of this correspondence, such as Bell inequalities (for which one cannot substract accidental coincidences), highly multimode situations such as quantum imaging, and higher order correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04642v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We measure space- and time-correlated charge jumps on a four-qubit device, operating 107 meters below the Earth's surface in a low-radiation, cryogenic facility designed for the characterization of low-threshold particle detectors. The rock overburden of this facility reduces the cosmic ray muon flux by over 99% compared to laboratories at sea level. Combined with 4$\pi$ coverage of a movable lead shield, this facility enables quantifiable control over the flux of ionizing radiation on the qubit device. Long-time-series charge tomography measurements on these weakly charge-sensitive qubits capture discontinuous jumps in the induced charge on the qubit islands, corresponding to the interaction of ionizing radiation with the qubit substrate. The rate of these charge jumps scales with the flux of ionizing radiation on the qubit package, as characterized by a series of independent measurements on another energy-resolving detector operating simultaneously in the same cryostat with the qubits. Using lead shielding, we achieve a minimum charge jump rate of 0.19$^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$ mHz, almost an order of magnitude lower than that measured in surface tests, but a factor of roughly eight higher than expected based on reduction of ambient gammas alone. We operate four qubits for over 22 consecutive hours with zero correlated charge jumps at length scales above three millimeters.</description>

      <title>A hybrid atom tweezer array of nuclear spin and optical clock qubits</title>

Abstract: While data qubits with a long coherence time are essential for the storage of quantum information, ancilla qubits are pivotal in quantum error correction (QEC) for fault-tolerant quantum computing. The recent development of optical tweezer arrays, such as the preparation of large-scale qubit arrays and high-fidelity gate operations, offers the potential for realizing QEC protocols, and one of the important next challenges is to control and detect ancilla qubits while minimizing atom loss and crosstalk. Here, we present the realization of a hybrid system consisting of a dual-isotope ytterbium (Yb) atom array, in which we can utilize a nuclear spin qubit of fermionic ${}^{171}\mathrm{Yb}$ as a data qubit and an optical clock qubit of bosonic ${}^{174}\mathrm{Yb}$ as an ancilla qubit with a capacity of non-destructive qubit readout. We evaluate the crosstalk between qubits regarding the impact on the coherence of the nuclear spin qubits from the imaging light for ${}^{174}\mathrm{Yb}$. The Ramsey sequence with a 556 nm probe beam shows negligible influence on the coherence up to 100 ms exposure time. In the Hahn-echo sequence with a 399 nm probe and 556 nm cooling beams for ${}^{174}\mathrm{Yb}$, we observe retaining a 98.4(2.1) % coherence under 30 ms exposure. This result highlights the potential of the hybrid-Yb atom array for ancilla-qubit-based QEC protocols.</description>

      <title>Validity condition for high-fidelity Digitized Quantum Annealing</title>

Abstract: Digitizing an adiabatic evolution is a strategy able to combine the good performance of gate-based quantum processors with the advantages of adiabatic algorithms, providing then a hybrid model for efficient quantum information processing. In this work we develop validity conditions for high fidelity digital adiabatic tasks. To this end, we assume a digitizing process based on the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition, which allows us to introduce a $Digitized$ $Adiabatic$ $Theorem$. As consequence of this theorem, we show that the performance of such a hybrid model is limited by the fundamental constraints on the adiabatic theorem validity, even in ideal quantum processors. We argue how our approach predicts the existence of intrinsic non-adiabatic errors reported by R. Barends $et$ $al$., Nature 534, 222 (2016) through an empirical study of digital annealing. In addition, our approach allows us to explain the existence of a scaling of the number of Suzuki-Trotter blocks for the optimal digital circuit with respect to the optimal adiabatic total evolution time, as reported by G. B. Mbeng $et$ $al$, Phys. Rev. B 100, 224201 (2019) through robust numerical analysis of digital annealing. We illustrate our results through two examples of digitized adiabatic algorithms, namely, the two-qubits exact-cover problem and the three-qubits adiabatic factorization of the number 21.</description>

Abstract: We introduce MindSpore Quantum, a pioneering hybrid quantum-classical framework with a primary focus on the design and implementation of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) algorithms. Leveraging the robust support of MindSpore, an advanced open-source deep learning training/inference framework, MindSpore Quantum exhibits exceptional efficiency in the design and training of variational quantum algorithms on both CPU and GPU platforms, delivering remarkable performance. Furthermore, this framework places a strong emphasis on enhancing the operational efficiency of quantum algorithms when executed on real quantum hardware. This encompasses the development of algorithms for quantum circuit compilation and qubit mapping, crucial components for achieving optimal performance on quantum processors. In addition to the core framework, we introduce QuPack, a meticulously crafted quantum computing acceleration engine. QuPack significantly accelerates the simulation speed of MindSpore Quantum, particularly in variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), and tensor network simulations, providing astonishing speed. This combination of cutting-edge technologies empowers researchers and practitioners to explore the frontiers of quantum computing with unprecedented efficiency and performance.</description>

      <title>Low-Crosstalk, Silicon-Fabricated Optical Waveguides for Laser Delivery to Matter Qubits</title>

Abstract: Reliable control of quantum information in matter-based qubits requires precisely applied external fields, and unaccounted for spatial cross-talk of these fields between adjacent qubits leads to loss of fidelity. We report a CMOS foundry-produced, micro-fabricated silicon nitride (Si3N4) optical waveguide for addressing a chain of eight, unequally-spaced trapped barium ions with crosstalk compatible with scalable quantum information processing. The crosstalk mitigation techniques incorporated into the chip design result in a reduction of the measured optical field by at least 50.8(1.3) dB between adjacent waveguide outputs near 650 nm and similar behavior for devices designed for 493 nm and 585 nm. The waveguide outputs near 650 nm, along with a global laser near 493 nm were used to laser-cool a chain of eight barium-138 ions, and a camera imaged the resulting fluorescence at 493 nm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1911.10893v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Every measurement determines a single value as its outcome, and yet quantum mechanics predicts it only probabilistically. The Kochen-Specker theorem and Bell's inequality are often considered to reject a realist view but favor a skeptical view that measuring an observable does not mean ascertaining the value that it has, but producing the outcome, having only a personal meaning. However, precise analysis supporting this view is unknown. Here, we show that a quantum mechanical analysis turns down this view. Supposing that two observers simultaneously measure the same observable, we can well pose the question as to whether they always obtain the same outcome, or whether the probability distributions are the same, but the outcomes are uncorrelated. Contrary to the widespread view in favor of the second, we shall show that quantum mechanics predicts that only the first case occurs. We further show that any measurement establishes a time-like entanglement between the observable to be measured and the meter after the measurement, which causes the space-like entanglement between the meters of different observers. We also show that our conclusion cannot be extended to measurements of so-called `generalized' observables, suggesting a demand for reconsidering the notion of observables in foundations of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Nonlocality of local Andreev conductances as a probe for topological Majorana wires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a protocol based only on local conductance measurements for distinguishing trivial from topological phases in realistic three-terminal superconducting nanowires coupled to normal leads, capable of hosting Majorana zero modes (MZMs). By using Green functions and the scattering matrix approach, we calculate the conductance matrix and the local density of states (LDOS) as functions of the asymmetry in the couplings to the left ($\Gamma_L$) and right ($\Gamma_R$) leads. In the trivial phase, we find that the zero-bias local conductances are distinctively affected by variations in $\Gamma_R$ (for fixed $\Gamma_L$): while $G_{LL}$ is mostly constant, $G_{RR}$ decays exponentially as $\Gamma_R$ is decreased. In the topological phase, surprisingly, $G_{LL}$ and $G_{RR}$ are both suppressed with $G_{LL} \sim G_{RR}$. This \textit{nonlocal} suppression of $G_{LL}$ with $\Gamma_R$ scales with the MZM hybridization energy $\varepsilon_m$ and arises from the emergence of a dip in the LDOS near zero energy at the left end of the wire, which affects the local Andreev reflection. We further exploit this nonlocality of the local Andreev processes and the gate-controlled suppression of the LDOS by proposing a Majorana-based transistor. Our results hold for zero and low electron temperatures $T&lt;20$ mK. For $T = 30, 40$ mK, $G_{LL}$ and $G_{RR}$ become less correlated. As an additional nonlocal fingerprint of the topological phase at higher $T$'s, we predict modulations in our \textit{asymmetric} conductance deviation $\delta G^{asym}_{LL}= G_{LL}^{\Gamma_R = \Gamma_L} - G_{LL}^{\Gamma_R \ll \Gamma_L}$ that remains commensurate with the Majorana oscillations in $\varepsilon_m$ over the range $30&lt;T&lt; 150~\rm{mK}$.</description>

      <title>Geometrically Taming Dynamical Entanglement Growth in Purified Quantum States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07961v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement properties of purified quantum states are of key interest for two reasons. First, in quantum information theory, minimally entangled purified states define the Entanglement of Purification as a fundamental measure for the complexity of the corresponding physical mixed state. Second, dynamical entanglement growth in purified states represents the main bottleneck for calculating dynamical physical properties on classical computers in the framework of tensor network states. Here, we demonstrate how geometric methods including parallel transport may be harnessed to reduce such dynamical entanglement growth, and to obtain a general prescription for maintaining (locally) optimal entanglement entropy when time-evolving a purified state. Adapting and extending by higher order skew corrections the notion of Uhlmann geometric phases, we reveal the relation between dynamical entanglement growth and the geometry of the Hilbert-Schmidt bundle as the mathematical foundation of purified states. With benchmarks on a non-integrable spin chain model, we compare the computational performance of matrix product state algorithms based on our present geometric disentangling method to previous approaches for taming entanglement growth in purified states. Our findings provide numerical evidence that geometric disentanglers are a powerful approach, superior in various aspects to known methods for disentangling purified states in a range of physically relevant computational scenarios. To exclude the effect of algorithmic imperfections, we also provide a numerically exact analysis for systems of moderate size.</description>

      <title>Generalized Black Hole Entropy is von Neumann Entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15897v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was recently shown that the von Neumann algebras of observables dressed to the mass of a Schwarzschild-AdS black hole or an observer in de Sitter are Type II, and thus admit well-defined traces. The von Neumann entropies of "semi-classical" states were found to be generalized entropies. However, these arguments relied on the existence of an equilibrium (KMS) state and thus do not apply to, e.g., black holes formed from gravitational collapse, Kerr black holes, or black holes in asymptotically de Sitter space. In this paper, we present a general framework for obtaining the algebra of dressed observables for linear fields on any spacetime with a Killing horizon. We prove, assuming the existence of a stationary (but not necessarily KMS) state and suitable decay of solutions, a structure theorem that the algebra of dressed observables always contains a Type II factor "localized" on the horizon. These assumptions have been rigorously proven in most cases of interest. Applied to the algebra in the exterior of an asymptotically flat Kerr black hole, where the fields are dressed to the black hole mass and angular momentum, we find a product of a Type II$_{\infty}$ algebra on the horizon and a Type I$_{\infty}$ algebra at past null infinity. In Schwarzschild-de Sitter, despite the fact that we introduce an observer, the quantum field observables are dressed to the perturbed areas of the black hole and cosmological horizons and is the product of Type II$_{\infty}$ algebras on each horizon. In all cases, the von Neumann entropy for semiclassical states is given by the generalized entropy. Our results suggest that in all cases where there exists another "boundary structure" (e.g., an asymptotic boundary or another Killing horizon) the algebra of observables is Type II$_{\infty}$ and in the absence of such structures (e.g., de Sitter) the algebra is Type II$_{1}$.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of spin-momentum entanglement from superradiant phase transitions</title>

Abstract: Exploring operational regimes of many-body cavity QED with multi-level atoms remains an exciting research frontier for their enhanced storage capabilities of intra-level quantum correlations. In this work, we consider an experimentally feasible many-body cavity QED model describing a four-level system, where each of those levels is formed from a combination of different spin and momentum states of ultra-cold atoms in a cavity. The resulting model comprises a pair of Dicke Hamiltonians constructed from pseudo-spin operators, effectively capturing two intertwined superradiant phase transitions. The phase diagram reveals regions featuring weak and strong entangled states of spin and momentum atomic degrees of freedom. These states exhibit different dynamical responses, ranging from slow to fast relaxation, with the added option of persistent entanglement temporal oscillations. We discuss the role of cavity losses in steering the system's dynamics into such entangled states and propose a readout scheme that leverages different light polarizations within the cavity. Our work paves the way to connect the rich variety of non-equilibrium phase transitions that occur in many-body cavity QED to the buildup of quantum correlations in systems with multi-level atom descriptions.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Dynamics in Monitored Systems and the Role of Quantum Jumps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13419v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monitored quantum many-body systems display a rich pattern of entanglement dynamics, which is unique to this non-unitary setting. This work studies the effect of quantum jumps on the entanglement dynamics beyond the no-click limit corresponding to a deterministic non-Hermitian evolution. We consider two examples, a monitored SSH model and a quantum Ising chain, for which we show the jumps have remarkably different effects on the entanglement despite having the same statistics as encoded in their waiting-time distribution. To understand this difference, we introduce a new metric, the statistics of entanglement gain and loss due to jumps and non-Hermitian evolution. This insight allows us to build a simple stochastic model of a random walk with partial resetting, which reproduces the entanglement dynamics, and to dissect the mutual role of jumps and non-Hermitian evolution on the entanglement scaling. We demonstrate that significant deviations from the no-click limit arise whenever quantum jumps strongly renormalize the non-Hermitian dynamics, as in the case of the SSH model at weak monitoring or in the Ising chain at large transverse field. On the other hand, we show that the weak monitoring phase of the Ising chain leads to a robust sub-volume logarithmic phase due to weakly renormalized non-Hermitian dynamics.</description>

      <title>Level spacing distribution of localized phases induced by quasiperiodic potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10067v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Level statistics is a crucial tool in the exploration of localization physics. The level spacing distribution of the disordered localized phase follows Poisson statistics, and many studies naturally apply it to the quasiperiodic localized phase. Here we analytically obtain the level spacing distribution of the quasiperiodic localized phase, and find that it deviates from Poisson statistics. Moreover, based on this level statistics, we derive the ratio of adjacent gaps and find that for a single sample, it is a $\delta$ function, which is in excellent agreement with numerical studies. Additionally, unlike disordered systems, in quasiperiodic systems, there are variations in the level spacing distribution across different regions of the spectrum, and increasing the size and increasing the sample are non-equivalent. Our findings carry significant implications for the reevaluation of level statistics in quasiperiodic systems and a profound understanding of the distinct effects of quasiperiodic potentials and disorder induced localization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open quantum systems display unusual phenomena not seen in closed systems, such as new topological phases and unconventional phase transitions. An interesting example was studied for a quantum spin liquid in the Kitaev model [K. Yang, S. C. Morampudi, and E. J. Bergholtz, Phys. Rev. Lett. ${\bf 126}$, 077201 (2021)]; an effective non-Hermitian Kitaev model, which incorporates dissipation effects, was shown to give rise to a gapless spin liquid state with exceptional points in the Majorana dispersions. Given that an external magnetic field induces a gapped Majorana topological state in the Hermitian case, the exceptional points may bring about intriguing quantum phenomena under a magnetic field. Here we investigate the non-Hermitian Kitaev model perturbed by the magnetic field. We show that the exceptional points remain gapless up to a finite critical magnetic field, in stark contrast to the Hermitian case where an infinitesimal field opens a gap. The gapless state is stable over a wide range of the magnetic field for some particular parameter sets, and in special cases, undergoes topological transitions to another gapless state with different winding number around the exceptional points without opening a gap. In addition, in the system with edges, we find that the non-Hermitian skin effect is induced by the magnetic field, even for the parameters where the skin effect is absent at zero field. The chirality of edge states is switched through the exceptional points, similarly to the surface Fermi arcs connected by the Weyl points in three-dimensional Weyl semimetals. Our results provide a new possible route to stabilize topological gapless quantum spin liquids under the magnetic field in the presence of dissipation.</description>

Abstract: We give an explicit operator representation (via a sequential circuit and projection to symmetry subspaces) of Kramers-Wannier duality transformation in higher-dimensional subsystem symmetric models generalizing the construction in the 1D transverse-field Ising model. Using the Kramers-Wannier duality operator, we also construct the Kennedy-Tasaki transformation that maps subsystem symmetry-protected topological phases to spontaneous subsystem symmetry breaking phases, where the symmetry group for the former is either $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ or $\mathbb{Z}_2$. This generalizes the recently proposed picture of one-dimensional Kennedy-Tasaki transformation as a composition of manipulations involving gauging and stacking symmetry-protected topological phases to higher dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Subwavelength arrays of quantum emitters have emerged as an interesting platform displaying prominent collective effects that can be harnessed for applications. Here we study such arrays under strong coherent driving, realizing an open quantum many-body problem in a strongly non-linear regime. We show that the spectrum of scattered light, characterized by the famous Mollow triplet for a single atom, develops a characteristic lineshape with flat sidebands determined by dipolar interactions. Remarkably, this is independent of the specific geometry, but is sensitive to the ordered arrangement of the atoms. This lineshape therefore characterizes atomic arrays and distinguishes them from disordered ensembles and non-interacting emitters. Our predictions are based on a novel dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) approach to the problem, paving the way for further studies of these systems.</description>

      <title>Vertex corrections to conductivity in the Holstein model: A numerical-analytical study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The optical-conductivity profile carries information on electronic dynamics in interacting quantum many-body systems. Its computation is a formidable task that is usually approached by invoking the single-particle (bubble) approximation and neglecting the vertex corrections, the importance of which remains elusive even in model Hamiltonian calculations. Here, we combine analytical arguments with our recent breakthroughs in numerically exact and approximate calculations of finite-temperature real-time correlation functions to thoroughly assess the importance of vertex corrections in the one-dimensional Holstein polaron model. We find, both analytically and numerically, vanishing vertex corrections to optical conductivity in the limits of zero electron--phonon interaction, zero electronic bandwidth, and infinite temperature. Furthermore, our numerical results show that vertex corrections to the electron mobility also vanish in many parameter regimes between these limits. In some of these cases, the vertex corrections still introduce important qualitative changes to the optical-conductivity profile in comparison to the bubble approximation even though the self-energy remains approximately local. We trace these changes back to the bubble approximation not fully capturing a time-limited slow-down of the electron on intermediate time scales between ballistic and diffusive transport. We find that the vertex corrections are overall most pronounced for intermediate electron--phonon interaction and may increase or decrease the bubble-approximation mobility depending on the values of model parameters.</description>

      <title>Entanglement suppression and low-energy scattering of heavy mesons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05958v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently entanglement suppression was proposed to be one possible origin of emergent symmetries. Here we test this conjecture in the context of heavy meson scatterings. The low-energy interactions of $D^{(*)}\bar D^{(*)}$ and $D^{(*)} D^{(*)}$ are closely related to the hadronic molecular candidates $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)^+$, respectively, and can be described by a nonrelativistic effective Lagrangian manifesting heavy-quark spin symmetry, which includes only constant contact potentials at leading order. We explore entanglement suppression in a tensor-product framework to treat both the isospin and spin degrees of freedom. Using the $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ as inputs, we find that entanglement suppression indeed leads to an emergent symmetry, namely, a light-quark spin symmetry, and as such the $D^{(*)}\bar D^{(*)}$ or $D^{(*)} D^{(*)}$ interaction strengths for a given total isospin do not depend on the total angular momentum of light (anti)quarks. The $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ are predicted to have five and one isoscalar partner, respectively, while the corresponding partner numbers derived solely from heavy-quark spin symmetry are three and one, respectively. The predictions need to be confronted with experimental data and lattice quantum chromodynamics results to further test the entanglement suppression conjecture.</description>

Abstract: The periodic flashing potential has proven to be a powerful tool for investigating directed atomic currents. By applying the flashing ring-shaped potential to spin-orbit (SO) coupled, noninteracting Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) systems, through photon-assisted tunneling (resonance) techniques, we demonstrate the generation of tunable alternating (AC) spin and atomic mass currents that can be precisely controlled in terms of direction and strength. The underlying mechanism behind this phenomenon is that the flashing potential supplies enough photons to induce Rabi oscillations and provides momentum transfer for spin and atomic transport. As the single-particle ground state of the unperturbed SO-coupled BEC depends on the Raman coupling strength, we demonstrate how to generate and control AC spin currents in the cases where the initial state resides in a single-well or double-well phase. In particular, we realize and explain the mechanism of generating a net AC spin current without mass current through single-photon resonance processes. It is shown that these interesting resonance phenomena can be analytically described only by the simple three-level model, which creates the possibility of transparent controls of spin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Annealing-based approach to solving partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations using an annealing-based approach is based on solving generalized eigenvalue problems. When a partial differential equation is discretized, it leads to a system of linear equations (SLE). Solving an SLE can be expressed as a general eigenvalue problem, which can be converted into an optimization problem with the objective function being a generalized Rayleigh quotient. The proposed algorithm allows the computation of eigenvectors at arbitrary precision without increasing the number of variables using an Ising machine. Simple examples solved using this method and theoretical analysis provide a guideline for appropriate parameter settings.</description>
