      <title>Interference-Induced Suppression of Doublon Transport and Prethermalization in the Extended Bose-Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coherent mobility of doublons, arising from second-order virtual dissociation-recombination processes, fundamentally limits their use as information carriers in the strongly interacting Bose-Hubbard model. We propose a disorder-free suppression mechanism by introducing an optimized nearest-neighbor pair-hopping term that destructively interferes with the dominant virtual hopping channel. Using the third-order Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we derive an analytical optimal condition that accounts for lattice geometry corrections. Exact numerical simulations demonstrate that this optimized scheme achieves near-complete dynamical arrest and entanglement preservation in one-dimensional chains, while in two-dimensional square lattices, it significantly suppresses ballistic spreading yet permits a slow residual expansion. Furthermore, in the many-body regime, finite-size scaling analysis identifies the observed long-lived density-wave order as a prethermal plateau emerging from the dramatic separation of microscopic and thermalization timescales.</description>

      <title>Mechanism for the anomalous minimization of superfluid critical velocity: Superfluid stability along a step potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To explain the experiment on the anomalous dependence of the superfluid critical velocity on a moving obstacle potential in a atomic Bose-Einstein condensate [\href{https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevA.91.053615}{Phys.~Rev.~A \textbf{91}, 053615 (2015)}], we introduce a considerably simplified model of superflow along a step potential. The energy spectrum and wave functions of the lowest-energy excitations in this system are well described by the semi-classical analysis based on the Bogoliubov theory. We found that the critical velocity is minimized and becomes zero when the potential height equals the hydrostatic chemical potential, which corresponds to the critical point of the local condensation phase transition inside the step potential. In a finite-size system, the critical velocity $v_\mathrm{c}$ obeys a power-law scaling with the system size $L_x$ as $v_\mathrm{c}\propto L_x^{-0.963}$. This criticality provides an explanation of the power-law scaling of the minimum critical velocity observed in the experiment.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Dynamical Quantum Phase Transitions via Double-Mode Squeezing Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a protocol to tailor dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) by double-mode squeezing onto the initial state in the XY chain. The effect of squeezing depends critically on the system's symmetry and parameters. When the squeezing operator breaks particle-hole symmetry (PHS), DQPTs become highly tunable, allowing one to either induce transitions within a single phase or suppress them. Remarkably, when PHS is preserved and the squeezing strength reaches $r=\pi/4$, a universal class of DQPTs emerges, independent of the quench path. This universality is characterized by two key features: (i) the collapse of all Fisher zeros onto the real-time axis, and (ii) the saturation of intermode entanglement to its maximum in each $(k,-k)$ modes. Moreover, the critical momenta governing the DQPTs coincide exactly with the modes attaining the maximal entanglement. At this universal point, the dynamical phase vanishes, leading to a purely geometric evolution marked by $\pi$-jumps in the Pancharatnam geometric phase. Our work establishes initial-state squeezing as a versatile tool for tailoring far-from-equilibrium criticality and reveals a direct link between entanglement saturation and universal nonanalytic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Gorkov algebraic diagrammatic construction for infinite nuclear matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an approximate many-body truncation for Gorkov self-consistent Green's function (SCGF) theory where pairing correlations are handled at first order, while the bulk of many-body correlations are described using the particle-number conserving Dyson-SCGF scheme up to third order in the algebraic diagrammatic construction, a method so far restricted to closed shell isotopes. The new method is enabled by the introduction of a scheme that allows to approximate the Gorkov propagator in terms of a particle-number-conserving optimized reference state. The approach provides state-of-the-art predictions of the equation of state and spectral properties of infinite nuclear matter at zero temperature and in the presence of pairing. We find satisfactory results using modern saturating Hamiltonians at next-to-next-to-leading order in chiral effective field theory.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms of anomalous three-body loss in a population-imbalanced three-component Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06946v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving precise control of ultracold atomic gases requires a detailed understanding of atom loss mechanisms. Motivated by the anomalous three-body decay in a three-component Fermi gas reported in Ref. [1], this work investigates mechanisms that possibly contribute to the observed loss. The three-body Schr\"odinger equation is solved in the hyperspherical adiabatic representation with pairwise van der Waals interactions, and the $S$-matrix is obtained via the eigenchannel $R$-matrix method to compute recombination rate coefficients $K_3$ and two-body cross sections. At the magnetic field strength where the anomalous decay occurs, $K_3$ is unitary limited, exhibiting the threshold energy scaling $K_3(E)\propto E^{-1}$. Consequently, the thermally averaged $\langle K_3 \rangle$ acquires a temperature dependence. Because the experiment is performed in the degenerate regime, $\langle K_3 \rangle$ also explicitly depends on the per-spin densities through the per-spin Fermi energies $E_{F}^{(i)}\propto n_i^{2/3}$. As the gas is diluted and degeneracy is reduced, $\langle K_3 \rangle$ approaches the non-degenerate value and becomes a function of temperature only. Channel-resolved branching ratios and cross sections are folded into a Monte Carlo cascade simulation of secondary collisions and trap escape. The analysis indicates that typical three-body recombination events remove fewer than three atoms on average, and that the atom losses are primarily due to the ejection of secondary collision products, rather than the initial three-body recombination products. Therefore, a significant fraction of the released binding energy remains in the trapped ensemble as kinetic energy. Retained energy drives evaporative loss, offering a plausible, partial explanation for the anomalous decay.</description>

      <title>Chiral Dynamics Near Intra- and Inter-Band Exceptional Points under Dissipative Spin-Orbital-Angular-Momentum Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the parametric chiral dynamics of atoms under dissipative spin-orbital-angular-momentum coupling (SOAMC). With atoms confined in the ring-shaped potential of the Laguerre-Gaussian Raman beams, the SOAMC not only couples the atomic center-of-mass angular momentum to the hyperfine spins, but also mixes different bands in the radial direction. This gives rise to a series of exceptional points of two types, the intra-band and the inter-band. Leveraging the topology of the spectral Riemann surface close to these exceptional points, we demonstrate the path-dependent chiral transfer of atoms to the higher-lying bands, by evolving the system along closed loops in the parameter space. Specifically, we illustrate two distinct scenarios, characterized by different mechanisms, where the atoms can be transferred to designated SOAMC-dressed bands. Our work demonstrates the rich exceptional structure in atom gases under dissipative SOAMC, and offers a novel route toward populating higher bands.</description>

      <title>Counterflow and coflow instabilities in miscible binary superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore instabilities in binary superfluids with a nonvanishing relative superflow, particularly focusing on counterflow and coflow instabilities. We extend recent results on the thermodynamic origin of finite superflow instabilities in single-component superfluids to binary systems and derive a criterion for the onset of instability through a hydrodynamic analysis, which applies to interacting many-body systems at finite temperature. We find that the onset of these instabilities is signaled by the determinant of the Hessian of the thermal free energy diverging and changing sign. We verify this hydrodynamic prediction in a holographic binary superfluid modeled with gauge/gravity duality, which naturally incorporates strong coupling, finite temperature, and dissipation. We also compare to results obtained using the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensates and find that the same criterion continues to apply at zero temperature, where it reduces to evaluating derivatives of the supercurrents with respect to the superfluid velocities. We observe that the critical velocities of these instabilities follow a general scaling law related to the interaction strength between superfluid components. Finally, the nonlinear stages of the instabilities are studied by full time evolution using gauge/gravity duality, where vortex annihilation leads to a decrease of superfluid velocity back to a value where the binary superfluid phase is stable.</description>

      <title>Agentic Exploration of Physics Models</title>

Abstract: The process of scientific discovery relies on an interplay of observations, analysis, and hypothesis generation. Machine learning is increasingly being adopted to address individual aspects of this process. However, it remains an open challenge to fully automate the heuristic, iterative loop required to discover the laws of an unknown system by exploring it through experiments and analysis, without tailoring the approach to the specifics of a given task. Here, we introduce SciExplorer, an agent that leverages large language model tool-use capabilities to enable exploration of systems without any domain-specific blueprints, and apply it to physical systems that are initially unknown to the agent. We test SciExplorer on a broad set of models spanning mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution, and quantum many-body physics. Despite using a minimal set of tools, primarily based on code execution, we observe impressive performance on tasks such as recovering equations of motion from observed dynamics and inferring Hamiltonians from expectation values. The demonstrated effectiveness of this setup opens the door towards similar scientific exploration in other domains, without the need for finetuning or task-specific instructions.</description>

      <title>More is uncorrelated: Tuning the local correlations of SU($N$) Fermi-Hubbard systems via controlled symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cold-atom experiments based on alkali-like atoms provide us with a tool to experimentally realize Hubbard models with a large number $N$ of components. The value of $N$ can be seen as a new handle to tune the properties of the system, leading to new physics both in the case of fully SU($N$) symmetric systems, or in the presence of controlled symmetry breaking. We focus on the Mott transition at global half filling and we characterize local correlations between particles through the \emph{inter-flavor mutual information}, an experimentally accessible quantity that rigorously measures the distance from the closest gaussian state, unveiling features that cannot be accessed by conventional probes of Mottness. We prove that these correlations are fully independent from local entanglement and quantum discord, and, using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory, we show that the SU(4) system has significantly smaller correlations than the SU(2) counterpart. In the atomic limit we prove that increasing $N$ further decreases the strength of the correlations. This suggests that a controlled reduction of the symmetry, reducing the number of effective components, can be used to enhance the degree of correlation. We confirm this scenario solving the model for $N=4$ and gradually breaking the symmetry via a Raman field, revealing an evolution from the SU(4) to the SU(2) Mott transition as the symmetry-breaking term increases, with a sudden recovery of the large correlations of the SU(2) model at weak Raman coupling in the Mott state. By further exploring the interplay between energy repulsion and the Raman field, we obtain a rich phase diagram with three different phases -- a metal, a band insulator, and a Mott insulator -- all coexisting at a single tricritical point.</description>
