      <title>EnzyCLIP: A Cross-Attention Dual Encoder Framework with Contrastive Learning for Predicting Enzyme Kinetic Constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of enzyme kinetic parameters is crucial for drug discovery, metabolic engineering, and synthetic biology applications. Current computational approaches face limitations in capturing complex enzyme-substrate interactions and often focus on single parameters while neglecting the joint prediction of catalytic turnover numbers (Kcat) and Michaelis-Menten constants (Km). We present EnzyCLIP, a novel dual-encoder framework that leverages contrastive learning and cross-attention mechanisms to predict enzyme kinetic parameters from protein sequences and substrate molecular structures. Our approach integrates ESM-2 protein language model embeddings with ChemBERTa chemical representations through a CLIP-inspired architecture enhanced with bidirectional cross-attention for dynamic enzyme-substrate interaction modeling. EnzyCLIP combines InfoNCE contrastive loss with Huber regression loss to learn aligned multimodal representations while predicting log10-transformed kinetic parameters. The model is trained on the CatPred-DB database containing 23,151 Kcat and 41,174 Km experimentally validated measurements, and achieved competitive performance with R2 scores of 0.593 for Kcat and 0.607 for Km prediction. XGBoost ensemble methods applied to the learned embeddings further improved Km prediction (R2 = 0.61) while maintaining robust Kcat performance.</description>

      <title>DeepFRI Demystified: Interpretability vs. Accuracy in AI Protein Function Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning technologies for protein function prediction are black box models. Despite their potential to identify key drug targets with high accuracy and accelerate therapy development, the adoption of these methods depends on verifying their findings. This study evaluates DeepFRI, a leading Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based tool, using advanced explainability techniques (GradCAM, Excitation Backpropagation, and PGExplainer) and adversarial robustness tests. Our findings reveal that the model's predictions often prioritize conserved motifs over truly deterministic residues, complicating the identification of functional sites. Quantitative analyses show that explainability methods differ significantly in granularity, with GradCAM providing broad relevance and PGExplainer pinpointing specific active sites. These results highlight tradeoffs between accuracy and interpretability, suggesting areas for improvement in DeepFRI's architecture to enhance its trustworthiness in drug discovery and regulatory settings.</description>

      <title>A Review of Wearable Sweat Monitoring Platforms: From Biomarker Detection to Signal Processing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wearable electronics hold great potential in defining new paradigms of modern healthcare, including personalized health management, precision medicine, and athletic performance optimization. This stems from their ability in enabling continuous, real-time health monitoring. To enable molecular-level analysis, biofluids rich in molecular analytes have become one of the most important target samples for wearable sensors. Among them, sweat stands out as an ideal candidate for next-generation wearable health monitoring platforms due to its completely noninvasive nature and ease of acquisition. In recent years, several studies have demonstrated feasible prototype designs for sweat-based wearable sensors. However, one of the major gaps toward large-scale commercialization is the development of clinically validated standards for sweat analysis. One key requirement is to establish the relationship between sweat analytes and those of blood, the latter serving as the gold standard in modern diagnostics. This review provides an overview of sweat biomarkers, with a particular focus on their partitioning mechanisms, which reveal the underlying connections between sweat analytes and their counterparts within systemic metabolic pathways. In addition, this review offers a mechanistic-level examination of biosensors employed in sweat sensing, addressing a gap that has not been adequately covered in prior reviews. Given the critical role of electronic systems in constructing highly integrated wearable sweat-monitoring platforms, this review also analyzes the electronic architectures used for sensor signal processing from an interdisciplinary perspective, with particular emphasis on the analog circuitry that interfaces with electrochemical sensors.</description>

      <title>Realistic Transition Paths for Large Biomolecular Systems: A Langevin Bridge Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a computational framework for generating realistic transition paths between distinct conformations of large bio-molecular systems. The method is built on a stochastic integro-differential formulation derived from the Langevin bridge formalism, which constrains molecular trajectories to reach a prescribed final state within a finite time and yields an efficient low-temperature approximation of the exact bridge equation. To obtain physically meaningful protein transitions, we couple this formulation to a new coarse-grained potential combining a Go-like term that preserves native backbone geometry with a Rouse-type elastic energy term from polymer physics; we refer to the resulting approach as SIDE. We evaluate SIDE on several proteins undergoing large-scale conformational changes and compare its performance with established methods such as MinActionPath and EBDIMS. SIDE generates smooth, low-energy trajectories that maintain molecular geometry and frequently recover experimentally supported intermediate states. Although challenges remain for highly complex motions-largely due to the simplified coarse-grained potential-our results demonstrate that SIDE offers a powerful and computationally efficient strategy for modeling bio-molecular conformational transitions.</description>

      <title>Consistent Synthetic Sequences Unlock Structural Diversity in Fully Atomistic De Novo Protein Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality training datasets are crucial for the development of effective protein design models, but existing synthetic datasets often include unfavorable sequence-structure pairs, impairing generative model performance. We leverage ProteinMPNN, whose sequences are experimentally favorable as well as amenable to folding, together with structure prediction models to align high-quality synthetic structures with recoverable synthetic sequences. In that way, we create a new dataset designed specifically for training expressive, fully atomistic protein generators. By retraining La-Proteina, which models discrete residue type and side chain structure in a continuous latent space, on this dataset, we achieve new state-of-the-art results, with improvements of +54% in structural diversity and +27% in co-designability. To validate the broad utility of our approach, we further introduce Proteina Atomistica, a unified flow-based framework that jointly learns the distribution of protein backbone structure, discrete sequences, and atomistic side chains without latent variables. We again find that training on our new sequence-structure data dramatically boosts benchmark performance, improving \method's structural diversity by +73% and co-designability by +5%. Our work highlights the critical importance of aligned sequence-structure data for training high-performance de novo protein design models. All data will be publicly released.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Programmable Exploration of Synthesizable Chemical Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The constrained nature of synthesizable chemical space poses a significant challenge for sampling molecules that are both synthetically accessible and possess desired properties. In this work, we present PrexSyn, an efficient and programmable model for molecular discovery within synthesizable chemical space. PrexSyn is based on a decoder-only transformer trained on a billion-scale datastream of synthesizable pathways paired with molecular properties, enabled by a real-time, high-throughput C++-based data generation engine. The large-scale training data allows PrexSyn to reconstruct the synthesizable chemical space nearly perfectly at a high inference speed and learn the association between properties and synthesizable molecules. Based on its learned property-pathway mappings, PrexSyn can generate synthesizable molecules that satisfy not only single-property conditions but also composite property queries joined by logical operators, thereby allowing users to ``program'' generation objectives. Moreover, by exploiting this property-based querying capability, PrexSyn can efficiently optimize molecules against black-box oracle functions via iterative query refinement, achieving higher sampling efficiency than even synthesis-agnostic baselines, making PrexSyn a powerful general-purpose molecular optimization tool. Overall, PrexSyn pushes the frontier of synthesizable molecular design by setting a new state of the art in synthesizable chemical space coverage, molecular sampling efficiency, and inference speed.</description>

      <title>Towards Precision Protein-Ligand Affinity Prediction Benchmark: A Complete and Modification-Aware DAVIS Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in AI for science unlocks capabilities for critical drug discovery tasks such as protein-ligand binding affinity prediction. However, current models overfit to existing oversimplified datasets that does not represent naturally occurring and biologically relevant proteins with modifications. In this work, we curate a complete and modification-aware version of the widely used DAVIS dataset by incorporating 4,032 kinase-ligand pairs involving substitutions, insertions, deletions, and phosphorylation events. This enriched dataset enables benchmarking of predictive models under biologically realistic conditions. Based on this new dataset, we propose three benchmark settings-Augmented Dataset Prediction, Wild-Type to Modification Generalization, and Few-Shot Modification Generalization-designed to assess model robustness in the presence of protein modifications. Through extensive evaluation of both docking-free and docking-based methods, we find that docking-based model generalize better in zero-shot settings. In contrast, docking-free models tend to overfit to wild-type proteins and struggle with unseen modifications but show notable improvement when fine-tuned on a small set of modified examples. We anticipate that the curated dataset and benchmarks offer a valuable foundation for developing models that better generalize to protein modifications, ultimately advancing precision medicine in drug discovery.

      <title>Active Force Dynamics in Red Blood Cells Under Non-Invasive Optical Tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Red blood cells (RBCs) sustain mechanical stresses associated with microcirculatory flow through ATP-driven plasma membrane flickering. This is an active phenomenon driven by motor proteins that regulate interactions between the spectrin cytoskeleton and the lipid bilayer; it is manifested in RBC shape fluctuations reflecting the cell's mechanical and metabolic state. Yet, direct quantification of the forces and energetic costs underlying this non-equilibrium behavior remains challenging due to the invasiveness of existing techniques. Here, a minimally invasive method that combines bead-free, low-power optical tweezers with high-speed video microscopy was employed to track local membrane forces and displacements in single RBCs during the same time window. This independent dual-channel measurement enabled the construction of a mechano-dynamic phase space for RBCs under different chemical treatments, that allowed for differentiating between metabolic and structural states based on their fluctuation-force signatures. Quantification of mechanical work during flickering demonstrated that membrane softening enhanced fluctuations while elevating energy dissipation. The proposed optical tweezers methodology provides a robust framework for mapping the active mechanics of living cells, enabling precise probing of cellular physiology and detection of biomechanical dysfunction in diseases.</description>

      <title>Multiscale guidance of protein structure prediction with heterogeneous cryo-EM data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protein structure prediction models are now capable of generating accurate 3D structural hypotheses from sequence alone. However, they routinely fail to capture the conformational diversity of dynamic biomolecular complexes, often requiring heuristic MSA subsampling approaches for generating alternative states. In parallel, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has emerged as a powerful tool for imaging near-native structural heterogeneity, but is challenged by arduous pipelines to transform raw experimental data into atomic models. Here, we bridge the gap between these modalities, combining cryo-EM density maps with the rich sequence and biophysical priors learned by protein structure prediction models. Our method, CryoBoltz, guides the sampling trajectory of a pretrained biomolecular structure prediction model using both global and local structural constraints derived from density maps, driving predictions towards conformational states consistent with the experimental data. We demonstrate that this flexible yet powerful inference-time approach allows us to build atomic models into heterogeneous cryo-EM maps across a variety of dynamic biomolecular systems including transporters and antibodies.
