      <title>A Robust Clustering Framework Combining Minimum Description Length and Genetic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clustering algorithms are fundamental in data analysis, enabling the organization of data into meaningful groups. However, individual clustering methods often face limitations and biases, making it challenging to develop a universal solution for diverse datasets. To address this, we propose a novel clustering framework that combines the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle with a genetic optimization algorithm. This approach begins with an ensemble clustering solution as a baseline, which is refined using MDL-based evaluation functions and optimized with a genetic algorithm. By leveraging the MDL principle, the method adapts to the intrinsic properties of datasets, minimizing dependence on input clusters and ensuring a data-driven process. The proposed method was evaluated on thirteen benchmark datasets using four validation metrics: accuracy, normalized mutual information (NMI), Fisher score, and adjusted Rand index (ARI). Results show that the method consistently outperforms traditional clustering algorithms, achieving higher accuracy, greater stability, and reduced biases. Its adaptability makes it a reliable tool for clustering complex and varied datasets. This study demonstrates the potential of combining MDL and genetic optimization to create a robust and versatile clustering framework, advancing the field of data analysis and offering a scalable solution for diverse applications.</description>

      <title>Trimming Down Large Spiking Vision Transformers via Heterogeneous Quantization Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are amenable to deployment on edge devices and neuromorphic hardware due to their lower dissipation. Recently, SNN-based transformers have garnered significant interest, incorporating attention mechanisms akin to their counterparts in Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) while demonstrating excellent performance. However, deploying large spiking transformer models on resource-constrained edge devices such as mobile phones, still poses significant challenges resulted from the high computational demands of large uncompressed high-precision models. In this work, we introduce a novel heterogeneous quantization method for compressing spiking transformers through layer-wise quantization. Our approach optimizes the quantization of each layer using one of two distinct quantization schemes, i.e., uniform or power-of-two quantification, with mixed bit resolutions. Our heterogeneous quantization demonstrates the feasibility of maintaining high performance for spiking transformers while utilizing an average effective resolution of 3.14-3.67 bits with less than a 1% accuracy drop on DVS Gesture and CIFAR10-DVS datasets. It attains a model compression rate of 8.71x-10.19x for standard floating-point spiking transformers. Moreover, the proposed approach achieves a significant energy reduction of 5.69x, 8.72x, and 10.2x while maintaining high accuracy levels of 85.3%, 97.57%, and 80.4% on N-Caltech101, DVS-Gesture, and CIFAR10-DVS datasets, respectively.</description>

      <title>Towards 3D Acceleration for low-power Mixture-of-Experts and Multi-Head Attention Spiking Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks(SNNs) provide a brain-inspired and event-driven mechanism that is believed to be critical to unlock energy-efficient deep learning. The mixture-of-experts approach mirrors the parallel distributed processing of nervous systems, introducing conditional computation policies and expanding model capacity without scaling up the number of computational operations. Additionally, spiking mixture-of-experts self-attention mechanisms enhance representation capacity, effectively capturing diverse patterns of entities and dependencies between visual or linguistic tokens. However, there is currently a lack of hardware support for highly parallel distributed processing needed by spiking transformers, which embody a brain-inspired computation. This paper introduces the first 3D hardware architecture and design methodology for Mixture-of-Experts and Multi-Head Attention spiking transformers. By leveraging 3D integration with memory-on-logic and logic-on-logic stacking, we explore such brain-inspired accelerators with spatially stackable circuitry, demonstrating significant optimization of energy efficiency and latency compared to conventional 2D CMOS integration.</description>

      <title>Training neural networks without backpropagation using particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks are a group of neurons stacked together in multiple layers to mimic the biological neurons in a human brain. Neural networks have been trained using the backpropagation algorithm based on gradient descent strategy for several decades. Several variants have been developed to improve the backpropagation algorithm. The loss function for the neural network is optimized through backpropagation, but several local minima exist in the manifold of the constructed neural network. We obtain several solutions matching the minima. The gradient descent strategy cannot avoid the problem of local minima and gets stuck in the minima due to the initialization. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) was proposed to select the best local minima among the search space of the loss function. The search space is limited to the instantiated particles in the PSO algorithm, and sometimes it cannot select the best solution. In the proposed approach, we overcome the problem of gradient descent and the limitation of the PSO algorithm by training individual neurons separately, capable of collectively solving the problem as a group of neurons forming a network.</description>

      <title>Neural network interpretability with layer-wise relevance propagation: novel techniques for neuron selection and visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpreting complex neural networks is crucial for understanding their decision-making processes, particularly in applications where transparency and accountability are essential. This proposed method addresses this need by focusing on layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), a technique used in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to attribute neural network outputs to input features through backpropagated relevance scores. Existing LRP methods often struggle with precision in evaluating individual neuron contributions. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel approach that improves the parsing of selected neurons during LRP backward propagation, using the Visual Geometry Group 16 (VGG16) architecture as a case study. Our method creates neural network graphs to highlight critical paths and visualizes these paths with heatmaps, optimizing neuron selection through accuracy metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE). Additionally, we utilize a deconvolutional visualization technique to reconstruct feature maps, offering a comprehensive view of the network's inner workings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enhances interpretability and supports the development of more transparent artificial intelligence (AI) systems for computer vision applications. This advancement has the potential to improve the trustworthiness of AI models in real-world machine vision applications, thereby increasing their reliability and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Spiking Neural Networks for Radio Frequency Interference Detection in Radio Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) promise efficient spatio-temporal data processing owing to their dynamic nature. This paper addresses a significant challenge in radio astronomy, Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) detection, by reformulating it as a time-series segmentation task inherently suited for SNN execution. Automated RFI detection systems capable of real-time operation with minimal energy consumption are increasingly important in modern radio telescopes. We explore several spectrogram-to-spike encoding methods and network parameters, applying first-order leaky integrate-and-fire SNNs to tackle RFI detection. To enhance the contrast between RFI and background information, we introduce a divisive normalisation-inspired pre-processing step, which improves detection performance across multiple encoding strategies. Our approach achieves competitive performance on a synthetic dataset and compelling results on real data from the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) instrument. To our knowledge, this work is the first to train SNNs on real radio astronomy data successfully. These findings highlight the potential of SNNs for performing complex time-series tasks, paving the way for efficient, real-time processing in radio astronomy and other data-intensive fields.</description>

      <title>Learnable Evolutionary Multi-Objective Combinatorial Optimization via Sequence-to-Sequence Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in learnable evolutionary algorithms have demonstrated the importance of leveraging population distribution information and historical evolutionary trajectories. While significant progress has been made in continuous optimization domains, combinatorial optimization problems remain challenging due to their discrete nature and complex solution spaces. To address this gap, we propose SeqMO, a novel learnable multi-objective combinatorial optimization method that integrates sequence-to-sequence models with evolutionary algorithms. Our approach divides approximate Pareto solution sets based on their objective values' distance to the Pareto front, and establishes mapping relationships between solutions by minimizing objective vector angles in the target space. This mapping creates structured training data for pointer networks, which learns to predict promising solution trajectories in the discrete search space. The trained model then guides the evolutionary process by generating new candidate solutions while maintaining population diversity. Experiments on the multi-objective travel salesman problem and the multi-objective quadratic assignment problem verify the effectiveness of the algorithm.

      <title>Flexible and Scalable Deep Dendritic Spiking Neural Networks with Multiple Nonlinear Branching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in spiking neural networks (SNNs) have a predominant focus on network architectures, while relatively little attention has been paid to the underlying neuron model. The point neuron models, a cornerstone of deep SNNs, pose a bottleneck on the network-level expressivity since they depict somatic dynamics only. In contrast, the multi-compartment models in neuroscience offer remarkable expressivity by introducing dendritic morphology and dynamics, but remain underexplored in deep learning due to their unaffordable computational cost and inflexibility. To combine the advantages of both sides for a flexible, efficient yet more powerful model, we propose the dendritic spiking neuron (DendSN) incorporating multiple dendritic branches with nonlinear dynamics. Compared to the point spiking neurons, DendSN exhibits significantly higher expressivity. DendSN's flexibility enables its seamless integration into diverse deep SNN architectures. To accelerate dendritic SNNs (DendSNNs), we parallelize dendritic state updates across time steps, and develop Triton kernels for GPU-level acceleration. As a result, we can construct large-scale DendSNNs with depth comparable to their point SNN counterparts. Next, we comprehensively evaluate DendSNNs' performance on various demanding tasks. By modulating dendritic branch strengths using a context signal, catastrophic forgetting of DendSNNs is substantially mitigated. Moreover, DendSNNs demonstrate enhanced robustness against noise and adversarial attacks compared to point SNNs, and excel in few-shot learning settings. Our work firstly demonstrates the possibility of training bio-plausible dendritic SNNs with depths and scales comparable to traditional point SNNs, and reveals superior expressivity and robustness of reduced dendritic neuron models in deep learning, thereby offering a fresh perspective on advancing neural network design.</description>

      <title>UAV Virtual Antenna Array Deployment for Uplink Interference Mitigation in Data Collection Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have gained considerable attention as a platform for establishing aerial wireless networks and communications. However, the line-of-sight dominance in air-to-ground communications often leads to significant interference with terrestrial networks, reducing communication efficiency among terrestrial terminals. This paper explores a novel uplink interference mitigation approach based on the collaborative beamforming (CB) method in multi-UAV network systems. Specifically, the UAV swarm forms a UAV-enabled virtual antenna array (VAA) to achieve the transmissions of gathered data to multiple base stations (BSs) for data backup and distributed processing. However, there is a trade-off between the effectiveness of CB-based interference mitigation and the energy conservation of UAVs. Thus, by jointly optimizing the excitation current weights and hover position of UAVs as well as the sequence of data transmission to various BSs, we formulate an uplink interference mitigation multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) to decrease interference affection, enhance transmission efficiency, and improve energy efficiency, simultaneously. In response to the computational demands of the formulated problem, we introduce an evolutionary computation method, namely chaotic non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (CNSGA-II) with multiple improved operators. The proposed CNSGA-II efficiently addresses the formulated MOOP, outperforming several other comparative algorithms, as evidenced by the outcomes of the simulations. Moreover, the proposed CB-based uplink interference mitigation approach can significantly reduce the interference caused by UAVs to non-receiving BSs.</description>

      <title>Computational models of learning and synaptic plasticity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many mathematical models of synaptic plasticity have been proposed to explain the diversity of plasticity phenomena observed in biological organisms. These models range from simple interpretations of Hebb's postulate, which suggests that correlated neural activity leads to increases in synaptic strength, to more complex rules that allow bidirectional synaptic updates, ensure stability, or incorporate additional signals like reward or error. At the same time, a range of learning paradigms can be observed behaviorally, from Pavlovian conditioning to motor learning and memory recall. Although it is difficult to directly link synaptic updates to learning outcomes experimentally, computational models provide a valuable tool for building evidence of this connection. In this chapter, we discuss several fundamental learning paradigms, along with the synaptic plasticity rules that might be used to implement them.</description>

      <title>STONet: A novel neural operator for modeling solute transport in micro-cracked reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a novel neural operator, the Solute Transport Operator Network (STONet), to efficiently model contaminant transport in micro-cracked reservoirs. The model combines different networks to encode heterogeneous properties effectively. By predicting the concentration rate, we are able to accurately model the transport process. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our neural operator approach achieves accuracy comparable to that of the finite element method. The previously introduced Enriched DeepONet architecture has been revised, motivated by the architecture of the popular multi-head attention of transformers, to improve its performance without increasing the compute cost. The computational efficiency of the proposed model enables rapid and accurate predictions of solute transport, facilitating the optimization of reservoir management strategies and the assessment of environmental impacts. The data and code for the paper will be published at https://github.com/ehsanhaghighat/STONet.</description>

      <title>LLMs as Debate Partners: Utilizing Genetic Algorithms and Adversarial Search for Adaptive Arguments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces DebateBrawl, an innovative AI-powered debate platform that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs), Genetic Algorithms (GA), and Adversarial Search (AS) to create an adaptive and engaging debating experience. DebateBrawl addresses the limitations of traditional LLMs in strategic planning by incorporating evolutionary optimization and game-theoretic techniques. The system demonstrates remarkable performance in generating coherent, contextually relevant arguments while adapting its strategy in real-time. Experimental results involving 23 debates show balanced outcomes between AI and human participants, with the AI system achieving an average score of 2.72 compared to the human average of 2.67 out of 10. User feedback indicates significant improvements in debating skills and a highly satisfactory learning experience, with 85% of users reporting improved debating abilities and 78% finding the AI opponent appropriately challenging. The system's ability to maintain high factual accuracy (92% compared to 78% in human-only debates) while generating diverse arguments addresses critical concerns in AI-assisted discourse. DebateBrawl not only serves as an effective educational tool but also contributes to the broader goal of improving public discourse through AI-assisted argumentation. The paper discusses the ethical implications of AI in persuasive contexts and outlines the measures implemented to ensure responsible development and deployment of the system, including robust fact-checking mechanisms and transparency in decision-making processes.</description>

      <title>Object Detection using Event Camera: A MoE Heat Conduction based Detector and A New Benchmark Dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Object detection in event streams has emerged as a cutting-edge research area, demonstrating superior performance in low-light conditions, scenarios with motion blur, and rapid movements. Current detectors leverage spiking neural networks, Transformers, or convolutional neural networks as their core architectures, each with its own set of limitations including restricted performance, high computational overhead, or limited local receptive fields. This paper introduces a novel MoE (Mixture of Experts) heat conduction-based object detection algorithm that strikingly balances accuracy and computational efficiency. Initially, we employ a stem network for event data embedding, followed by processing through our innovative MoE-HCO blocks. Each block integrates various expert modules to mimic heat conduction within event streams. Subsequently, an IoU-based query selection module is utilized for efficient token extraction, which is then channeled into a detection head for the final object detection process. Furthermore, we are pleased to introduce EvDET200K, a novel benchmark dataset for event-based object detection. Captured with a high-definition Prophesee EVK4-HD event camera, this dataset encompasses 10 distinct categories, 200,000 bounding boxes, and 10,054 samples, each spanning 2 to 5 seconds. We also provide comprehensive results from over 15 state-of-the-art detectors, offering a solid foundation for future research and comparison.

      <title>SpiKernel: A Kernel Size Exploration Methodology for Improving Accuracy of the Embedded Spiking Neural Network Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01685v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) can offer ultra-low power/energy consumption for machine learning-based application tasks due to their sparse spike-based operations. Currently, most of the SNN architectures need a significantly larger model size to achieve higher accuracy, which is not suitable for resource-constrained embedded applications. Therefore, developing SNNs that can achieve high accuracy with acceptable memory footprint is highly needed. Toward this, we propose SpiKernel, a novel methodology that improves the accuracy of SNNs through kernel size exploration. Its key steps include (1) investigating the impact of different kernel sizes on the accuracy, (2) devising new sets of kernel sizes, (3) generating SNN architectures using neural architecture search based on the selected kernel sizes, and (4) analyzing the accuracy-memory trade-offs for SNN model selection. The experimental results show that our SpiKernel achieves higher accuracy than state-of-the-art works (i.e., 93.24% for CIFAR10, 70.84% for CIFAR100, and 62% for TinyImageNet) with less than 10M parameters and up to 4.8x speed-up of searching time, thereby making it suitable for embedded applications.</description>

      <title>Guiding a Diffusion Model with a Bad Version of Itself</title>

Abstract: The primary axes of interest in image-generating diffusion models are image quality, the amount of variation in the results, and how well the results align with a given condition, e.g., a class label or a text prompt. The popular classifier-free guidance approach uses an unconditional model to guide a conditional model, leading to simultaneously better prompt alignment and higher-quality images at the cost of reduced variation. These effects seem inherently entangled, and thus hard to control. We make the surprising observation that it is possible to obtain disentangled control over image quality without compromising the amount of variation by guiding generation using a smaller, less-trained version of the model itself rather than an unconditional model. This leads to significant improvements in ImageNet generation, setting record FIDs of 1.01 for 64x64 and 1.25 for 512x512, using publicly available networks. Furthermore, the method is also applicable to unconditional diffusion models, drastically improving their quality.</description>

      <title>Dynamical similarity analysis uniquely captures how computations develop in RNNs</title>

Abstract: Methods for analyzing representations in neural systems have become a popular tool in both neuroscience and mechanistic interpretability. Having measures to compare how similar activations of neurons are across conditions, architectures, and species, gives us a scalable way of learning how information is transformed within different neural networks. In contrast to this trend, recent investigations have revealed how some metrics can respond to spurious signals and hence give misleading results. To identify the most reliable metric and understand how measures could be improved, it is going to be important to identify specific test cases which can serve as benchmarks. Here we propose that the phenomena of compositional learning in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) allows us to build a test case for dynamical representation alignment metrics. By implementing this case, we show it enables us to test whether metrics can identify representations which gradually develop throughout learning and probe whether representations identified by metrics are relevant to computations executed by networks. By building both an attractor- and RNN-based test case, we show that the new Dynamical Similarity Analysis (DSA) is more noise robust and identifies behaviorally relevant representations more reliably than prior metrics (Procrustes, CKA). We also show how test cases can be used beyond evaluating metrics to study new architectures. Specifically, results from applying DSA to modern (Mamba) state space models, suggest that, in contrast to RNNs, these models may not exhibit changes to their recurrent dynamics due to their expressiveness. Overall, by developing test cases, we show DSA's exceptional ability to detect compositional dynamical motifs, thereby enhancing our understanding of how computations unfold in RNNs.</description>

      <title>Reducing ADC Front-end Costs During Training of On-sensor Printed Multilayer Perceptrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08674</link>

Abstract: Printed electronics technology offers a cost-effectiveand fully-customizable solution to computational needs beyondthe capabilities of traditional silicon technologies, offering ad-vantages such as on-demand manufacturing and conformal, low-cost hardware. However, the low-resolution fabrication of printedelectronics, which results in large feature sizes, poses a challengefor integrating complex designs like those of machine learn-ing (ML) classification systems. Current literature optimizes onlythe Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) circuit within the classificationsystem, while the cost of analog-to-digital converters (ADCs)is overlooked. Printed applications frequently require on-sensorprocessing, yet while the digital classifier has been extensivelyoptimized, the analog-to-digital interfacing, specifically the ADCs,dominates the total area and energy consumption. In this work,we target digital printed MLP classifiers and we propose thedesign of customized ADCs per MLP's input which involvesminimizing the distinct represented numbers for each input,simplifying thus the ADC's circuitry. Incorporating this ADCoptimization in the MLP training, enables eliminating ADC levelsand the respective comparators, while still maintaining highclassification accuracy. Our approach achieves 11.2x lower ADCarea for less than 5% accuracy drop across varying MLPs.</description>

      <title>FabuLight-ASD: Unveiling Speech Activity via Body Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active speaker detection (ASD) in multimodal environments is crucial for various applications, from video conferencing to human-robot interaction. This paper introduces FabuLight-ASD, an advanced ASD model that integrates facial, audio, and body pose information to enhance detection accuracy and robustness. Our model builds upon the existing Light-ASD framework by incorporating human pose data, represented through skeleton graphs, which minimises computational overhead. Using the Wilder Active Speaker Detection (WASD) dataset, renowned for reliable face and body bounding box annotations, we demonstrate FabuLight-ASD's effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Achieving an overall mean average precision (mAP) of 94.3%, FabuLight-ASD outperforms Light-ASD, which has an overall mAP of 93.7% across various challenging scenarios. The incorporation of body pose information shows a particularly advantageous impact, with notable improvements in mAP observed in scenarios with speech impairment, face occlusion, and human voice background noise. Furthermore, efficiency analysis indicates only a modest increase in parameter count (27.3%) and multiply-accumulate operations (up to 2.4%), underscoring the model's efficiency and feasibility. These findings validate the efficacy of FabuLight-ASD in enhancing ASD performance through the integration of body pose data. FabuLight-ASD's code and model weights are available at https://github.com/knowledgetechnologyuhh/FabuLight-ASD.</description>
