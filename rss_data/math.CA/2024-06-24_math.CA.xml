      <title>On the null space of the backprojection operator and Rubin's conjecture for the spherical mean transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spherical mean transform associates to a function $f$ its integral averages over all spheres. We consider the spherical mean transform for functions supported in the unit ball $\mathbb{B}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for odd $n$, with the centers of integration spheres restricted to the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$. In this setup, Rubin employed properties of Erd\'elyi-Kober fractional integrals and analytic continuation to re-derive the explicit inversion formulas proved earlier by Finch, Patch, and Rakesh using wave equation techniques. As part of his work, Rubin stated a conjecture relating spherical mean transform, its associated backprojection operator and the Riesz potential. Furthermore, he pointed to the necessity of a detailed analysis of injectivity of the backprojection operator as a crucial step toward the resolution of his conjecture. This article addresses both questions posed by Rubin by providing a characterization of the null space of the backprojection operator, and disproving the conjecture through the construction of an explicit counterexample. Crucial to the proofs is the range characterization for the spherical mean transform in odd dimensions derived recently by the authors.</description>

      <title>Highly localized kernels on space of homogeneous type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly localized kernels based on orthogonal polynomials have been studied and utilized over several regular domains. Much of the results deduced via these kernels can be treated uniformly in the framework of localizable spaces of homogeneous type. We clarify the concept of localness and provide a list of such localizable spaces.</description>

      <title>Endpoint multilinear restricted weak type extrapolation theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a generalization in the context of multilinear Muckenhoupt classes of the endpoint extrapolation theorem on restricted weights due to Carro, Grafakos and Soria. Moreover, our main result is obtained on limited ranges of boundedness and to this aim we introduce a new limited range, off-diagonal extrapolation theorem in the context of restricted weights. In addition, as one of the applications, we prove endpoint estimates of certain bi-sublinear maximal functions associated with the study of return time theorems in ergodic theory.</description>

      <title>$L^q$ Estimates on the Restriction of Schr\"odinger Eigenfunctions with singular potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider eigenfunction estimates in $L^p$ for Schr\"odinger operators, $H_V=-\Delta_g+V(x)$, on compact Riemannian manifolds $(M, g)$. Eigenfunction estimates over the full manifolds were already obtained by Sogge \cite{Sogge1988concerning} for $V\equiv 0$ and the first author, Sire, and Sogge \cite{BlairSireSogge2021Quasimode}, and the first author, Huang, Sire, and Sogge \cite{BlairHuangSireSogge2022UniformSobolev} for critically singular potentials $V$. For the corresponding restriction estimates for submanifolds, the case $V\equiv 0$ was considered in Burq, G\'erard, and Tzvetkov \cite{BurqGerardTzvetkov2007restrictions}, and Hu \cite{Hu2009lp}. In this article, we will handle eigenfunction restriction estimates for some submanifolds $\Sigma$ on compact Riemannian manifolds $(M, g)$ with $n:=\dim M\geq 2$, where $V$ is a singular potential.</description>

      <title>On well-posedness for parabolic Cauchy problems of Lions type with rough initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a complete picture for well-posedness of parabolic Cauchy problems with time-independent, uniformly elliptic, bounded measurable complex coefficients. We exhibit a range of $p$ for which tempered distributions in homogeneous Hardy--Sobolev spaces $\dot{H}^{s,p}$ with regularity index $s \in (-1,1)$ are initial data. Source terms of Lions' type lie in weighted tent spaces, and weak solutions are built with their gradients in weighted tent spaces as well. A similar result can be achieved for initial data in homogeneous Besov spaces $\dot{B}^{s}_{p,p}$.</description>

      <title>Sharp local Bernstein estimates for Laplace eigenfunctions on Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we focus on local growth properties of Laplace eigenfunctions on a compact Riemannian manifold. The principal theme is that a Laplace eigenfunction behaves locally as a polynomial function of degree proportional to the square root of the eigenvalue. In this direction, we notably prove sharp local Bernstein estimates, conjectured by Donnelly and Fefferman in 1990.</description>

      <title>{Nonlinear lattices from the physics of ecosystems: The Lefever-Lejeune nonlinear lattice in $\mathbb{Z}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that the spatial discretization of the strongly nonlinear Lefever-Lejeune partial differential equation defines a nonlinear lattice that is physically relevant in the context of the nonlinear physics of ecosystems, modelling the dynamics of vegetation densities in dry lands. We study the system in the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^2$, which is especially relevant because of its natural dimension for the emergence of pattern formation. Theoretical results identify parametric regimes for the system that distinguish between extinction and potential convergence to non-trivial states. Importantly, we analytically identify conditions for Turing instability, detecting thresholds on the discretization parameter for the manifestation of this mechanism. Numerical simulations reveal the sharpness of the analytical conditions for instability and illustrate the rich potential for pattern formation even in the strongly discrete regime, emphasizing the importance of the interplay between higher dimensionality and discreteness.</description>

      <title>On the boundedness of Dunkl multipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we use Littlewood-Paley-Stein theory to prove two versions of Dunkl multiplier theorem when the multiplier $ m $ satisfies a modified H\"ormander condition. When $ m $ is radial we give a simple proof of a known result. For general $ m $ we prove that the Dunkl multiplier operator takes radial functions in $ L^p $ boundedly into $ L^p $ for all $ p \geq 2.$</description>

      <title>A multiplicative surface signature through its Magnus expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last decade, the concept of path signature has found great success in data science applications, where it provides features describing the path. This is partly explained by the fact that it is possible to compute the signature of a path in linear time, owing to a dynamic programming principle, based on Chen's identity.
  The path signature can be regarded as a specific example of product or time-/path-ordered integral. In other words, it can be seen as a 1-parameter object build on iterated integrals over a path.
  Increasing the number of parameters by one, which amounts to considering iterated integrals over surfaces, is more complicated. An observation that is familiar in the context of higher gauge theory where multiparameter iterated integrals play an important role.
  The 2-parameter case is naturally related to a non-commutative version of Stokes' theorem, which is understood to be fundamentally linked to the concept of crossed modules of groups. Indeed, crossed modules with non-trivial kernel of the feedback map permit to compute features of a surface that go beyond what can be expressed by computing line integrals along the boundary of a surface.
  A good candidate for the crossed analog of free Lie algebra then seems to be a certain free crossed module over it.
  Building on work by Kapranov, we study the analog to the classical path signature taking values in such a free crossed module of Lie algebra.
  In particular, we provide a Magnus-type expression for the logarithm of surface signature as well as a sewing lemma for the crossed module setting.</description>

Abstract: We establish identities for the composition $T_{k,n}(|\widehat{gd\sigma}|^2)$, where $g\mapsto \widehat{gd\sigma}$ is the Fourier extension operator associated with a general smooth $k$-dimensional submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^n$, and $T_{k,n}$ is the $k$-plane transform. Several connections to problems in Fourier restriction theory are presented.</description>

      <title>Limit point and limit circle trichotomy for Sturm-Liouville problems with complex potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The limit point and limit circle classification of real Sturm-Liouville problems by H. Weyl more than 100 years ago was extended by A.R. Sims around 60 years ago to the case when the coefficients are complex. Here, the main result is a collection of various criteria which allow us to decide to which class of Sims' scheme a given Sturm-Liouville problem with complex coefficients belongs. This is subsequently applied to a second order differential equation defined on a ray in $\mathbb C$ which is motivated by the recent intensive research connected with $\mathcal P \mathcal T$-symmetric Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of Polynomials Orthogonal With Respect to a Generalized Freud Weight With Application to Special Function Solutions of Painlev\'e-IV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain asymptotics of polynomials satisfying the orthogonality relations $$ \int_{\mathbb{R}} z^k P_n(z; t , N) \mathrm{e}^{-N \left(\frac{1}{4}z^4 + \frac{t}{2}z^2 \right)} \mathrm{d} z = 0 \quad \text{ for } \quad k = 0, 1, ..., n-1, $$ where the complex parameter $t$ is in the so-called two-cut region. As an application, we deduce asymptotic formulas for certain families of solutions of Painlev\'e-IV which are indexed by a non-negative integer and can be written in terms of parabolic cylinder functions. The proofs are based on the characterization of orthogonal polynomials in terms of a Riemann-Hilbert problem and the Deift-Zhou non-linear steepest descent method.</description>
