      <title>Relationship between mis\`ere NIM and two-player GOISHI HIROI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In combinatorial game theory, there are two famous winning conventions, normal play and mis\`ere play. Under normal play convention, the winner is the player who moves last and under mis\`ere play convention, the loser is the player who moves last. The difference makes these conventions completely different, and usually, games under mis\`ere play convention is much difficult to analyze than games under normal play convention. In this study, we show an interesting relationship between rulesets under different winning conventions; we can determine the winner of two-player GOISHI HIROI under normal play convention by using NIM under mis\`ere play convention. We also analyze two-player GOISHI HIROI under mis\`ere play convention.</description>

      <title>Facility Location Games with Scaling Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18908v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We take the classic facility location problem and consider a variation, in which each agent's individual cost function is equal to their distance from the facility multiplied by a scaling factor which is determined by the facility placement. In addition to the general class of continuous scaling functions, we also provide results for piecewise linear scaling functions which can effectively approximate or model the scaling of many real world scenarios. We focus on the objectives of total and maximum cost, describing the computation of the optimal solution. We then move to the approximate mechanism design setting, observing that the agents' preferences may no longer be single-peaked. Consequently, we characterize the conditions on scaling functions which ensure that agents have single-peaked preferences. Under these conditions, we find a characterization of continuous, strategyproof, and anonymous mechanisms, and compute the total and maximum cost approximation ratios achievable by these mechanisms.</description>

      <title>On the Formation of Steady Coalitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the formation of the grand coalition of a cooperative game by investigating its possible internal dynamics. Each coalition is capable of forcing all players to reconsider the current state of the game when it does not provide sufficient payoff. Different coalitions may ask for contradictory evolutions, leading to the impossibility of the grand coalition forming. In this paper, we give a characterization of the impossibility, for a given state, of finding a new state dominating the previous one such that each aggrieved coalition has a satisfactory payoff. To do so, we develop new polyhedral tools related to a new family of polyhedra, appearing in numerous situations in cooperative game theory.</description>
