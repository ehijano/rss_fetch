      <title>Online Contract Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of online contracts, which integrate the game-theoretic considerations of economic contract theory, with the algorithmic and informational challenges of online algorithm design. Our starting point is the classic online setting with preemption of Buchbinder et al. [SODA'15], in which a hiring principal faces a sequence of adversarial agent arrivals. Upon arrival, the principal must decide whether to tentatively accept the agent to their team, and whether to dismiss previous tentative choices. Dismissal is irrevocable, giving the setting its online decision-making flavor. In our setting, the agents are rational players: once the team is finalized, a game is played where the principal offers contracts (performance-based payment schemes), and each agent decides whether or not to work. Working agents reward the principal, and the goal is to choose a team that maximizes the principal's utility. Our main positive result is a 1/2-competitive algorithm when agent rewards are additive, which matches the best-possible competitive ratio. Our algorithm is randomized and this is necessary, as we show that no deterministic algorithm can attain a bounded competitive ratio. Moreover, if agent rewards are allowed to exhibit combinatorial structure known as XOS, even randomized algorithms might fail. En route to our competitive algorithm, we develop the technique of balance points, which can be useful for further exploration of online contracts in the adversarial model.</description>

      <title>Modeling Concurrent Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work in the field of multi-agent systems has sought to use techniques and concepts from the field of formal methods to provide rigorous theoretical analysis and guarantees on complex systems where multiple agents strategically interact, leading to the creation of the field of equilibrium analysis, which studies equilibria concepts from the field of game theory through a complexity-theoretic lens. Multi-agent systems, however, are complex mathematical objects, and, therefore, defining them in a precise mathematical manner is non-trivial. As a result, researchers often considered more restrictive models that are easier to model but lack expressive power or simply omit critical complexity-theoretic results in their analysis. This paper addresses this problem by carefully analyzing and contrasting complexity-theoretic results in the explicit model, a mathematically precise formulation of the models commonly used in the literature, and the circuit-based model, a novel model that addresses the problems found in the literature. The utility of the circuit-based model is demonstrated through a comprehensive analysis that considers upper and lower bounds for the realizability and verification problems, the two most important decision problems in equilibrium analysis, for both models. By conducting this analysis, we see that problematic issues that are endemic to the explicit model and the equilibrium analysis literature as a whole are adequately handled by the circuit-based model.</description>

      <title>A General Theory of Proportionality with Additive Utilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a model where a subset of candidates must be selected based on voter preferences, subject to general constraints that specify which subsets are feasible. This model generalizes committee elections with diversity constraints, participatory budgeting (including constraints specifying how funds must be allocated to projects from different pools), and public decision-making. Axioms of proportionality have recently been defined for this general model, but the proposed rules apply only to approval ballots, where each voter submits a subset of candidates she finds acceptable. We propose proportional rules for cardinal ballots, where each voter assigns a numerical value to each candidate corresponding to her utility if that candidate is selected. In developing these rules, we also introduce methods that produce proportional rankings, ensuring that every prefix of the ranking satisfies proportionality.</description>

      <title>An Automata-Based Approach to Games with $\omega$-Automatic Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies multiplayer turn-based games on graphs in which player preferences are modeled as $\omega$-automatic relations given by deterministic parity automata. This contrasts with most existing work, which focuses on specific reward functions. We conduct a computational analysis of these games, starting with the threshold problem in the antagonistic zero-sum case. As in classical games, we introduce the concept of value, defined here as the set of plays a player can guarantee to improve upon, relative to their preference relation. We show that this set is recognized by an alternating parity automaton APW of polynomial size. We also establish the computational complexity of several problems related to the concepts of value and optimal strategy, taking advantage of the $\omega$-automatic characterization of value. Next, we shift to multiplayer games and Nash equilibria, and revisit the threshold problem in this context. Based on an APW construction again, we close complexity gaps left open in the literature, and additionally show that cooperative rational synthesis is $\mathsf{PSPACE}$-complete, while it becomes undecidable in the non-cooperative case.</description>

      <title>Approximate-EFX Allocations with Ordinal and Limited Cardinal Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a discrete fair division problem where $n$ agents have additive valuation functions over a set of $m$ goods. We focus on the well-known $\alpha$-EFX fairness criterion, according to which the envy of an agent for another agent is bounded multiplicatively by $\alpha$, after the removal of any good from the envied agent's bundle. The vast majority of the literature has studied $\alpha$-EFX allocations under the assumption that full knowledge of the valuation functions of the agents is available. Motivated by the established literature on the distortion in social choice, we instead consider $\alpha$-EFX algorithms that operate under limited information on these functions. In particular, we assume that the algorithm has access to the ordinal preference rankings, and is allowed to make a small number of queries to obtain further access to the underlying values of the agents for the goods. We show (near-optimal) tradeoffs between the values of $\alpha$ and the number of queries required to achieve those, with a particular focus on constant EFX approximations. We also consider two interesting special cases, namely instances with a constant number of agents, or with two possible values, and provide improved positive results.</description>

      <title>Distortion of Metric Voting with Bounded Randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the design of voting rules in the metric distortion framework. It is known that any deterministic rule suffers distortion of at least $3$, and that randomized rules can achieve distortion strictly less than $3$, often at the cost of reduced transparency and interpretability. In this work, we explore the trade-off between these paradigms by asking whether it is possible to break the distortion barrier of $3$ using only "bounded" randomness. We answer in the affirmative by presenting a voting rule that (1) achieves distortion of at most $3 - \varepsilon$ for some absolute constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, and (2) selects a winner uniformly at random from a deterministically identified list of constant size. Our analysis builds on new structural results for the distortion and approximation of Maximal Lotteries and Stable Lotteries.</description>

      <title>Maximin Shares with Lower Quotas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fair division of indivisible items among $n$ agents with heterogeneous additive valuations, subject to lower and upper quotas on the number of items allocated to each agent. Such constraints are crucial in various applications, ranging from personnel assignments to computing resource distribution. This paper focuses on the fairness criterion known as maximin shares (MMS) and its approximations. Under arbitrary lower and upper quotas, we show that a $\left(\frac{2n}{3n-1}\right)$-MMS allocation of goods exists and can be computed in polynomial time, while we also present a polynomial-time algorithm for finding a $\left(\frac{3n-1}{2n}\right)$-MMS allocation of chores. Furthermore, we consider the generalized scenario where items are partitioned into multiple categories, each with its own lower and upper quotas. In this setting, our algorithm computes an $\left(\frac{n}{2n-1}\right)$-MMS allocation of goods or a $\left(\frac{2n-1}{n}\right)$-MMS allocation of chores in polynomial time. These results extend previous work on the cardinality constraints, i.e., the special case where only upper quotas are imposed.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity analysis of the perturbed utility stochastic traffic equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08347v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a sensitivity analysis framework for the perturbed utility route choice (PURC) model and the accompanying stochastic traffic equilibrium model. We derive analytical sensitivity expressions for the Jacobian of the individual optimal PURC flow and equilibrium link flows with respect to link cost parameters under general assumptions. This allows us to determine the marginal change in link flows following a marginal change in link costs across the network. We show how to implement these results while exploiting the sparsity generated by the PURC model. Numerical examples illustrate the use of our method for estimating equilibrium link flows after link cost shifts, identifying critical design parameters, and quantifying uncertainty in performance predictions. Finally, we demonstrate the method in a large-scale example. The findings have implications for network design, pricing strategies, and policy analysis in transportation planning and economics, providing a bridge between theoretical models and real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Online Learning for Uninformed Markov Games: Empirical Nash-Value Regret and Non-Stationarity Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study online learning in two-player uninformed Markov games, where the opponent's actions and policies are unobserved. In this setting, Tian et al. (2021) show that achieving no-external-regret is impossible without incurring an exponential dependence on the episode length $H$. They then turn to the weaker notion of Nash-value regret and propose a V-learning algorithm with regret $O(K^{2/3})$ after $K$ episodes. However, their algorithm and guarantee do not adapt to the difficulty of the problem: even in the case where the opponent follows a fixed policy and thus $O(\sqrt{K})$ external regret is well-known to be achievable, their result is still the worse rate $O(K^{2/3})$ on a weaker metric.
  In this work, we fully address both limitations. First, we introduce empirical Nash-value regret, a new regret notion that is strictly stronger than Nash-value regret and naturally reduces to external regret when the opponent follows a fixed policy. Moreover, under this new metric, we propose a parameter-free algorithm that achieves an $O(\min \{\sqrt{K} + (CK)^{1/3},\sqrt{LK}\})$ regret bound, where $C$ quantifies the variance of the opponent's policies and $L$ denotes the number of policy switches (both at most $O(K)$). Therefore, our results not only recover the two extremes -- $O(\sqrt{K})$ external regret when the opponent is fixed and $O(K^{2/3})$ Nash-value regret in the worst case -- but also smoothly interpolate between these extremes by automatically adapting to the opponent's non-stationarity. We achieve so by first providing a new analysis of the epoch-based V-learning algorithm by Mao et al. (2022), establishing an $O(\eta C + \sqrt{K/\eta})$ regret bound, where $\eta$ is the epoch incremental factor. Next, we show how to adaptively restart this algorithm with an appropriate $\eta$ in response to the potential non-stationarity of the opponent, eventually achieving our final results.</description>

      <title>Online Algorithm for Fractional Matchings with Edge Arrivals in Graphs of Maximum Degree Three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study online algorithms for maximum cardinality matchings with edge arrivals in graphs of low degree. Buchbinder, Segev, and Tkach showed that no online algorithm for maximum cardinality fractional matchings can achieve a competitive ratio larger than $4/(9-\sqrt 5)\approx 0.5914$ even for graphs of maximum degree three. The negative result of Buchbinder et al. holds even when the graph is bipartite and edges are revealed according to vertex arrivals, i.e. once a vertex arrives, all edges are revealed that include the newly arrived vertex and one of the previously arrived vertices. In this work, we complement the negative result of Buchbinder et al. by providing an online algorithm for maximum cardinality fractional matchings with a competitive ratio at least $4/(9-\sqrt 5)\approx 0.5914$ for graphs of maximum degree three. We also demonstrate that no online algorithm for maximum cardinality integral matchings can have the competitive guarantee $0.5807$, establishing a gap between integral and fractional matchings for graphs of maximum degree three. Note that the work of Buchbinder et al. shows that for graphs of maximum degree two, there is no such gap between fractional and integral matchings, because for both of them the best achievable competitive ratio is $2/3$. Also, our results demonstrate that for graphs of maximum degree three best possible competitive ratios for fractional matchings are the same in the vertex arrival and in the edge arrival models.</description>

      <title>Punishment in bipartite societies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From ant-acacia mutualism to performative conflict resolution among Inuit, dedicated punishments between distinct subsets of a population are widespread and can reshape the evolutionary trajectory of cooperation. Existing studies have focused on punishments within a homogeneous population, paying little attention to cooperative dynamics in a situation where belonging to a subset is equally important to the actual strategy represented by an actor. To fill this gap, we here study a bipartite population where cooperator agents in a public goods game penalize exclusively those defectors who belong to the alternative subset. We find that cooperation can emerge and remain stable under symmetric intergroup punishment. In particular, at low punishment intensity and at a small value of the enhancement factor of the dilemma game, intergroup punishment promotes cooperation more effectively than a uniformly applied punishment. Moreover, intergroup punishment in bipartite populations tends to be more favorable for overall social welfare. When this incentive is balanced, cooperators can collectively restrain defectors of the alternative set via aggregate interactions in a randomly formed working group, offering a more effective incentive. Conversely, breaking the symmetry of intergroup punishment inhibits cooperation, as the imbalance creates an Achilles' heel in the enforcement structure. Our work, thus, reveals symmetry in intergroup punishment as a unifying principle behind cooperation across human and biological systems.</description>

      <title>Beyond Arrow: From Impossibility to Possibilities in Multi-Criteria Benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern benchmarks such as HELM MMLU account for multiple metrics like accuracy, robustness and efficiency. When trying to turn these metrics into a single ranking, natural aggregation procedures can become incoherent or unstable to changes in the model set. We formalize this aggregation as a social choice problem where each metric induces a preference ranking over models on each dataset, and a benchmark operator aggregates these votes across metrics. While prior work has focused on Arrow's impossibility result, we argue that the impossibility often originates from pathological examples and identify sufficient conditions under which these disappear, and meaningful multi-criteria benchmarking becomes possible. In particular, we deal with three restrictions on the combinations of rankings and prove that on single-peaked, group-separable and distance-restricted preferences, the benchmark operator allows for the construction of well-behaved rankings of the involved models. Empirically, we investigate several modern benchmark suites like HELM MMLU and verify which structural conditions are fulfilled on which benchmark problems.</description>

      <title>Talk, Judge, Cooperate: Gossip-Driven Indirect Reciprocity in Self-Interested LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indirect reciprocity, which means helping those who help others, is difficult to sustain among decentralized, self-interested LLM agents without reliable reputation systems. We introduce Agentic Linguistic Gossip Network (ALIGN), an automated framework where agents strategically share open-ended gossip using hierarchical tones to evaluate trustworthiness and coordinate social norms. We demonstrate that ALIGN consistently improves indirect reciprocity and resists malicious entrants by identifying and ostracizing defectors without changing intrinsic incentives. Notably, we find that stronger reasoning capabilities in LLMs lead to more incentive-aligned cooperation, whereas chat models often over-cooperate even when strategically suboptimal. These results suggest that leveraging LLM reasoning through decentralized gossip is a promising path for maintaining social welfare in agentic ecosystems. Our code is available at https://github.com/shuhui-zhu/ALIGN.</description>

      <title>Constraint-Aware Generative Auto-bidding via Pareto-Prioritized Regret Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Auto-bidding systems aim to maximize marketing value while satisfying strict efficiency constraints such as Target Cost-Per-Action (CPA). Although Decision Transformers provide powerful sequence modeling capabilities, applying them to this constrained setting encounters two challenges: 1) standard Return-to-Go conditioning causes state aliasing by neglecting the cost dimension, preventing precise resource pacing; and 2) standard regression forces the policy to mimic average historical behaviors, thereby limiting the capacity to optimize performance toward the constraint boundary. To address these challenges, we propose PRO-Bid, a constraint-aware generative auto-bidding framework based on two synergistic mechanisms: 1) Constraint-Decoupled Pareto Representation (CDPR) decomposes global constraints into recursive cost and value contexts to restore resource perception, while reweighting trajectories based on the Pareto frontier to focus on high-efficiency data; and 2) Counterfactual Regret Optimization (CRO) facilitates active improvement by utilizing a global outcome predictor to identify superior counterfactual actions. By treating these high-utility outcomes as weighted regression targets, the model transcends historical averages to approach the optimal constraint boundary. Extensive experiments on two public benchmarks and online A/B tests demonstrate that PRO-Bid achieves superior constraint satisfaction and value acquisition compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Altruism and Fair Objective in Mixed-Motive Markov games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooperation is fundamental for society's viability, as it enables the emergence of structure within heterogeneous groups that seek collective well-being. However, individuals are inclined to defect in order to benefit from the group's cooperation without contributing the associated costs, thus leading to unfair situations. In game theory, social dilemmas entail this dichotomy between individual interest and collective outcome. The most dominant approach to multi-agent cooperation is the utilitarian welfare which can produce efficient highly inequitable outcomes. This paper proposes a novel framework to foster fairer cooperation by replacing the standard utilitarian objective with Proportional Fairness. We introduce a fair altruistic utility for each agent, defined on the individual log-payoff space and derive the analytical conditions required to ensure cooperation in classic social dilemmas. We then extend this framework to sequential settings by defining a Fair Markov Game and deriving novel fair Actor-Critic algorithms to learn fair policies. Finally, we evaluate our method in various social dilemma environments.</description>

      <title>FLAG-4D: Flow-Guided Local-Global Dual-Deformation Model for 4D Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce FLAG-4D, a novel framework for generating novel views of dynamic scenes by reconstructing how 3D Gaussian primitives evolve through space and time. Existing methods typically rely on a single Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to model temporal deformations, and they often struggle to capture complex point motions and fine-grained dynamic details consistently over time, especially from sparse input views. Our approach, FLAG-4D, overcomes this by employing a dual-deformation network that dynamically warps a canonical set of 3D Gaussians over time into new positions and anisotropic shapes. This dual-deformation network consists of an Instantaneous Deformation Network (IDN) for modeling fine-grained, local deformations and a Global Motion Network (GMN) for capturing long-range dynamics, refined through mutual learning. To ensure these deformations are both accurate and temporally smooth, FLAG-4D incorporates dense motion features from a pretrained optical flow backbone. We fuse these motion cues from adjacent timeframes and use a deformation-guided attention mechanism to align this flow information with the current state of each evolving 3D Gaussian. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FLAG-4D achieves higher-fidelity and more temporally coherent reconstructions with finer detail preservation than state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Welfarist Formulations for Diverse Similarity Search</title>

Abstract: Nearest Neighbor Search (NNS) is a fundamental problem in data structures with wide-ranging applications, such as web search, recommendation systems, and, more recently, retrieval-augmented generations (RAG). In such recent applications, in addition to the relevance (similarity) of the returned neighbors, diversity among the neighbors is a central requirement. In this paper, we develop principled welfare-based formulations in NNS for realizing diversity across attributes. Our formulations are based on welfare functions -- from mathematical economics -- that satisfy central diversity (fairness) and relevance (economic efficiency) axioms. With a particular focus on Nash social welfare, we note that our welfare-based formulations provide objective functions that adaptively balance relevance and diversity in a query-dependent manner. Notably, such a balance was not present in the prior constraint-based approach, which forced a fixed level of diversity and optimized for relevance. In addition, our formulation provides a parametric way to control the trade-off between relevance and diversity, providing practitioners with flexibility to tailor search results to task-specific requirements. We develop efficient nearest neighbor algorithms with provable guarantees for the welfare-based objectives. Notably, our algorithm can be applied on top of any standard ANN method (i.e., use standard ANN method as a subroutine) to efficiently find neighbors that approximately maximize our welfare-based objectives. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach is practical and substantially improves diversity while maintaining high relevance of the retrieved neighbors.</description>

      <title>Faster Game Solving via Hyperparameter Schedules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) algorithms are a foundational class of methods for solving imperfect-information games, with the time average of their iterates converging to a Nash equilibrium in two-player zero-sum games. Prior state-of-the-art variants, Discounted CFR (DCFR) and Predictive CFR$^+$ (PCFR$^+$), achieved the fastest known practical performance by improving convergence rates over vanilla CFR through discounting early iterations with a fixed discounting scheme. More recently, Dynamic DCFR (DDCFR) introduced agent-learned dynamic discounting schemes to further accelerate convergence, at the cost of increased complexity. To address this, we propose Hyperparameter Schedules (HSs), a remarkably simple, training-free framework that dynamically adjusts CFR discounting over time. HSs aggressively downweight early updates and gradually transition to trusting late-stage strategies, leading to substantially faster convergence with only a few lines of code modifications. We show that HSs derived from just three small extensive-form games generalize effectively to 17 diverse games (including large-scale realistic poker) in both extensive-form and normal-form settings, without any game-specific tuning. Our method establishes a new state of the art for solving two-player zero-sum games.</description>

      <title>On Sybil-proof Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14485v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that in the single-parameter mechanism design environment, the only non-wasteful, symmetric, incentive compatible and Sybil-proof direct mechanism is a second price auction with symmetric tie-breaking. Thus, if there is private information, lotteries or other mechanisms that do not always allocate to a highest-value bidder are not Sybil-proof or not incentive compatible. Moreover, we show that our main (im)possibility result extends beyond linear valuations, but not to multi-unit object allocation with capacity constrained bidders.
  We also provide examples of mechanisms (with higher interim payoff for the bidders than a second price auction) that satisfy all of the other axioms and a weaker, Bayesian notion of Sybil-proofness. Thus, our (im)possibility result does not generalize to the Bayesian setting and we have a larger design space: With Sybil constraints, equivalence between dominant strategy and Bayesian implementation (that holds in classical single-parameter mechanism design without Sybils) no longer holds.</description>

      <title>The Oracle Complexity of Simplex-based Matrix Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06990v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of solving matrix games of the form $\min_{\mathbf{p}\in\Delta}\max_{\mathbf{w}\in\mathcal{W}}\mathbf{p}^{\top}A\mathbf{w}$, where $A$ is a matrix and $\Delta$ is the probability simplex. This problem encapsulates canonical tasks such as finding a linear separator and computing Nash equilibria in zero-sum games. However, perhaps surprisingly, its inherent complexity (as formalized in the standard framework of oracle complexity) is not well understood. In this work, we first identify different oracle models that are implicitly used by prior algorithms, corresponding to multiplying the matrix $A$ by a vector from either one or both sides. We then prove complexity lower bounds for algorithms under both access models, which in particular imply a separation between them. As our main result, we prove that in the general $\ell_p$/simplex setting where $\mathcal{W}$ is an $\ell_p$ ball for $p\in[1,\infty]$, any algorithm that utilizes two-sided matrix-vector multiplications requires $\tilde{\Omega}(\epsilon^{-2/3})$ iterations to return an $\epsilon$-suboptimal solution. For any $p\in[1,\infty]$, this is either the first lower bound for such problems, or an exponential improvement over the previously best-known results. Moreover, for the canonical tasks of finding a linear separator and computing a Nash equilibrium, our lower bounds match (up to log factors) recent algorithms of Karmarkar, O'Carroll and Sidford (2026), thereby resolving their oracle complexities in a natural setting.</description>

      <title>Strategy-robust Online Learning in Contextual Pricing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning effective pricing strategies is crucial in digital marketplaces, especially when buyers' valuations are unknown and must be inferred through interaction. We study the online contextual pricing problem, where a seller observes a stream of context-valuation pairs and dynamically sets prices. Moreover, departing from traditional online learning frameworks, we consider a strategic setting in which buyers may misreport valuations to influence future prices, a challenge known as strategic overfitting (Amin et al. 2013).
  We introduce a strategy-robust notion of regret for multi-buyer online environments, capturing worst-case strategic behavior in the spirit of the Price of Anarchy. Our first contribution is a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for learning linear pricing policies in adversarial, adaptive environments, enabled by a novel online sketching technique. Building on this result, we propose our main construction: the Sparse Update Mechanism (SUM), a simple yet effective sequential mechanism that ensures robustness to all Nash equilibria among buyers. Moreover, our construction yields a black-box reduction from online expert algorithms to strategy-robust learners.</description>

      <title>From No-Regret to Strategically Robust Learning in Repeated Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Bayesian single-item auctions, a monotone bidding strategy--one that prescribes a higher bid for a higher value type--can be equivalently represented as a partition of the quantile space into consecutive intervals corresponding to increasing bids. Kumar et al. (2024) prove that agile online gradient descent (OGD), when used to update a monotone bidding strategy through its quantile representation, is strategically robust in repeated first-price auctions: when all bidders employ agile OGD in this way, the auctioneer's average revenue per round is at most the revenue of Myerson's optimal auction, regardless of how she adjusts the reserve price over time.
  In this work, we show that this strategic robustness guarantee is not unique to agile OGD or to the first-price auction: any no-regret learning algorithm, when fed gradient feedback with respect to the quantile representation, is strategically robust, even if the auction format changes every round, provided the format satisfies allocation monotonicity and voluntary participation. In particular, the multiplicative weights update (MWU) algorithm simultaneously achieves the optimal regret guarantee and a strong strategic robustness guarantee in this auction setting. At a technical level, our results are established via a simple relation that bridges Myerson's auction theory and standard no-regret learning theory.</description>

      <title>A two-player version of the assignment problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the competitive assignment problem, a two-player version of the well-known assignment problem. Given a set of tasks and a set of agents with different efficiencies for different tasks, Alice and Bob take turns picking agents one by one. Once all agents have been picked, Alice and Bob compute the optimal values $s_A$ and $s_B$ for the assignment problem on their respective sets of agents, i.e. they assign their own agents to tasks (with at most one agent per task and at most one task per agent) so as to maximize the sum of the efficiencies. The score of the game is then defined as $s_A-s_B$. Alice aims at maximizing the score, while Bob aims at minimizing it. This problem can model drafts in sports and card games, or more generally situations where two entities fight for the same resources and then use them to compete against each other. We show that the problem is PSPACE-complete, even restricted to agents that have at most two nonzero efficiencies. On the other hand, in the case of agents having at most one nonzero efficiency, the problem lies in XP parameterized by the number of tasks, and the optimal score can be computed in linear time when there are only two tasks.</description>

      <title>Stake-governed tug-of-war and the biased infinity Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.08300v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In tug-of-war, two players compete by moving a counter along edges of a graph, each winning the right to move at a given turn according to the flip of a possibly biased coin. The game ends when the counter reaches the boundary, a fixed subset of the vertices, at which point one player pays the other an amount determined by the boundary vertex. Economists and mathematicians have independently studied tug-of-war for many years, focussing respectively on resource-allocation forms of the game, in which players iteratively spend precious budgets in an effort to influence the bias of the coins that determine the turn victors; and on PDE arising in fine mesh limits of the constant-bias game in a Euclidean setting.
  In this article, we offer a mathematical treatment of a class of tug-of-war games with allocated budgets: each player is initially given a fixed budget which she draws on throughout the game to offer a stake at the start of each turn, and her probability of winning the turn is the ratio of her stake and the sum of the two stakes. We consider the game played on a tree, with boundary being the set of leaves, and the payment function being the indicator of a single distinguished leaf. We find the game value and the essentially unique Nash equilibrium of a leisurely version of the game, in which the move at any given turn is cancelled with constant probability after stakes have been placed. We show that the ratio of the players' remaining budgets is maintained at its initial value $\lambda$; game value is a biased infinity harmonic function; and the proportion of remaining budget that players stake at a given turn is given in terms of the spatial gradient and the $\lambda$-derivative of game value. We also indicate examples in which the solution takes a different form in the non-leisurely game.</description>

      <title>On the Trail of Lost Pennies: player-funded tug-of-war on the integers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.07451v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study random-turn resource-allocation games. In the Trail of Lost Pennies, a counter moves on $\mathbb{Z}$. At each turn, Maxine stakes $a \in [0,\infty)$ and Mina $b \in [0,\infty)$. The counter $X$ then moves adjacently, to the right with probability $\tfrac{a}{a+b}$. If $X_i \to -\infty$ in this infinte-turn game, Mina receives one unit, and Maxine zero; if $X_i \to \infty$, then these receipts are zero and $x$. Thus the net receipt to a given player is $-A+B$, where $A$ is the sum of her stakes, and $B$ is her terminal receipt. The game was inspired by unbiased tug-of-war in~[PSSW] from 2009 but in fact closely resembles the original version of tug-of-war, introduced [HarrisVickers87] in the economics literature in 1987. We show that the game has surprising features. For a natural class of strategies, Nash equilibria exist precisely when $x$ lies in $[\lambda,\lambda^{-1}]$, for a certain $\lambda \in (0,1)$. We indicate that $\lambda$ is remarkably close to one, proving that $\lambda \leq 0.999904$ and presenting clear numerical evidence that $\lambda \geq 1 - 10^{-4}$. For each $x \in [\lambda,\lambda^{-1}]$, we find countably many Nash equilibria. Each is roughly characterized by an integral {\em battlefield} index: when the counter is nearby, both players stake intensely, with rapid but asymmetric decay in stakes as it moves away. Our results advance premises [HarrisVickers87,Konrad12] for fund management and the incentive-outcome relation that plausibly hold for many player-funded stake-governed games. Alongside a companion treatment [HP22] of games with allocated budgets, we thus offer a detailed mathematical treatment of an illustrative class of tug-of-war games. We also review the separate developments of tug-of-war in economics and mathematics in the hope that mathematicians direct further attention to tug-of-war in its original resource-allocation guise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11984v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We axiomatically define a cardinal social inefficiency function, which, given a set of alternatives and individuals' vNM preferences over the alternatives, assigns a unique number -- the social inefficiency -- to each alternative. These numbers -- and not only their order -- are uniquely defined by our axioms despite no exogenously given interpersonal comparison, outside option, or disagreement point. We interpret these numbers as per-capita losses in endogenously normalized utility. We apply our social inefficiency function to a setting in which interpersonal comparison is notoriously hard to justify -- object allocation without money -- leveraging techniques from computer science to prove an approximate-efficiency result for the Random Serial Dictatorship mechanism.</description>

      <title>Right Reward Right Time for Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Critical learning periods (CLPs) in federated learning (FL) refer to early stages during which low-quality contributions (e.g., sparse training data availability) can permanently impair the performance of the global model owned by the model owner (i.e., a cloud server). However, existing incentive mechanisms exhibit temporal homogeneity, treating all training rounds as equally important, thereby failing to prioritize and attract high-quality contributions during CLPs. This inefficiency is compounded by information asymmetry due to privacy regulations, where the cloud lacks knowledge of client training capabilities, leading to adverse selection. Thus, in this article, we propose a time-aware contract-theoretic incentive framework, named Right Reward Right Time (R3T), to encourage client involvement, especially during CLPs, to maximize the utility of the cloud server. We formulate a cloud utility function that captures the trade-off between the achieved model performance and rewards allocated for clients' contributions, explicitly accounting for client heterogeneity in time and system capabilities, effort, and joining time. Then, we devise a CLP-aware incentive mechanism deriving an optimal contract design that satisfies individual rationality, incentive compatibility, and budget feasibility constraints, motivating rational clients to participate early and contribute efforts. By providing the right reward at the right time, our approach can attract the highest-quality contributions during CLPs. Simulation and proof-of-concept studies show that R3T mitigates information asymmetry, increases cloud utility, and yields superior economic efficiency compared to conventional incentive mechanisms. Our proof-of-concept results demonstrate up to a 47.6% reduction in the total number of clients and up to a 300% improvement in convergence time while achieving competitive test accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proof-Number Search is a best-first search algorithm with many successful applications, especially in game solving. As large-scale computing clusters become increasingly accessible, parallelization is a natural way to accelerate computation. However, existing parallel versions of Proof-Number Search are known to scale poorly on many CPU cores. Using two parallelized levels and shared information among workers, we present the first massively parallel version of Proof-Number Search that scales efficiently even on a large number of CPUs. We apply our solver, enhanced with Grundy numbers for reducing game trees of impartial games, to the Sprouts game, a case study motivated by the long-standing Sprouts Conjecture. Our algorithm achieves 332.9$\times$ speedup on 1024 cores, significantly improving previous parallelizations and outperforming the state-of-the-art Sprouts solver GLOP by four orders of magnitude in runtime while generating proofs 1,000$\times$ more complex. Despite exponential growth in game tree size, our solver verified the Sprouts Conjecture for 42 new positions, nearly doubling the number of known outcomes.</description>
