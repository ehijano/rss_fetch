      <title>A Nonlinear Extension of the Variable Projection (VarPro) Method for NURBS-based Conformal Surface Flattening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of computer graphics, conformal surface flattening has been widely studied for tasks such as texture mapping, geometry processing, and mesh generation. Typically, existing methods aim to flatten a given input geometry while preserving conformality as much as possible, meaning the result is only as conformal as possible. By contrast, this study focuses on surfaces that can be flattened conformally without singularities, making the process a coupled problem: the input (or target) surface must be recursively refined while its flattening is computed.
  Although the uniformization theorem or the Riemann mapping theorem guarantees the existence of a conformal flattening for any simply connected, orientable surface, those theorems permit singularities in the flattening. If singularities are not allowed, only a special class of surfaces can be conformally flattened-though many practical surfaces do fall into this class.
  To address this, we develop a NURBS-based approach in which both the input surface and its flattening are refined in tandem, ensuring mutual conformality. Because NURBS surfaces cannot represent singularities, the resulting pair of surfaces is naturally singularity-free. Our work is inspired by the form-finding method by [Miki and Mitchell 2022, 2024], which solves bilinear PDEs by iteratively refining two surfaces together. Building on their demonstration of the effectiveness of variable projection (VarPro), we adopt a similar strategy: VarPro alternates between a linear projection and a nonlinear iteration, leveraging a partially linear (separable) problem structure. However, since our conformal condition separates into two nonlinear subproblems, we introduce a nonlinear extension of VarPro. Although this significantly increases computational cost, the quality of the results is noteworthy.</description>

      <title>Computing Connection Matrix and Persistence Efficiently from a Morse Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Morse decompositions partition the flows in a vector field into equivalent structures. Given such a decomposition, one can define a further summary of its flow structure by what is called a connection matrix.These matrices, a generalization of Morse boundary operators from classical Morse theory, capture the connections made by the flows among the critical structures - such as attractors, repellers, and orbits - in a vector field. Recently, in the context of combinatorial dynamics, an efficient persistence-like algorithm to compute connection matrices has been proposed in~\cite{DLMS24}. We show that, actually, the classical persistence algorithm with exhaustive reduction retrieves connection matrices, both simplifying the algorithm of~\cite{DLMS24} and bringing the theory of persistence closer to combinatorial dynamical systems. We supplement this main result with an observation: the concept of persistence as defined for scalar fields naturally adapts to Morse decompositions whose Morse sets are filtered with a Lyapunov function. We conclude by presenting preliminary experimental results.</description>

      <title>A cohomology-based Gromov-Hausdorff metric approach for quantifying molecular similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13887v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce, for the first time, a cohomology-based Gromov-Hausdorff ultrametric method to analyze 1-dimensional and higher-dimensional (co)homology groups, focusing on loops, voids, and higher-dimensional cavity structures in simplicial complexes, to address typical clustering questions arising in molecular data analysis. The Gromov-Hausdorff distance quantifies the dissimilarity between two metric spaces. In this framework, molecules are represented as simplicial complexes, and their cohomology vector spaces are computed to capture intrinsic topological invariants encoding loop and cavity structures. These vector spaces are equipped with a suitable distance measure, enabling the computation of the Gromov-Hausdorff ultrametric to evaluate structural dissimilarities. We demonstrate the methodology using organic-inorganic halide perovskite (OIHP) structures. The results highlight the effectiveness of this approach in clustering various molecular structures. By incorporating geometric information, our method provides deeper insights compared to traditional persistent homology techniques.</description>
