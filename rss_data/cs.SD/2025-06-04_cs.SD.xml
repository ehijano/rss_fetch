      <title>Local Equivariance Error-Based Metrics for Evaluating Sampling-Frequency-Independent Property of Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio signal processing methods based on deep neural networks (DNNs) are typically trained only at a single sampling frequency (SF) and therefore require signal resampling to handle untrained SFs. However, recent studies have shown that signal resampling can degrade performance with untrained SFs. This problem has been overlooked because most studies evaluate only the performance at trained SFs. In this paper, to assess the robustness of DNNs to SF changes, which we refer to as the SF-independent (SFI) property, we propose three metrics to quantify the SFI property on the basis of local equivariance error (LEE). LEE measures the robustness of DNNs to input transformations. By using signal resampling as input transformation, we extend LEE to measure the robustness of audio source separation methods to signal resampling. The proposed metrics are constructed to quantify the SFI property in specific network components responsible for predicting time-frequency masks. Experiments on music source separation demonstrated a strong correlation between the proposed metrics and performance degradation at untrained SFs.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Fast and High-Fidelity Neural Vocoders for Low-Latency Streaming Synthesis in Resource-Constrained Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In real-time speech synthesis, neural vocoders often require low-latency synthesis through causal processing and streaming. However, streaming introduces inefficiencies absent in batch synthesis, such as limited parallelism, inter-frame dependency management, and parameter loading overhead. This paper proposes multi-stream Wavehax (MS-Wavehax), an efficient neural vocoder for low-latency streaming, by extending the aliasing-free neural vocoder Wavehax with multi-stream decomposition. We analyze the latency-throughput trade-off in a CPU-only environment and identify key bottlenecks in streaming neural vocoders. Our findings provide practical insights for optimizing chunk sizes and designing vocoders tailored to specific application demands and hardware constraints. Furthermore, our subjective evaluations show that MS-Wavehax delivers high speech quality under causal and non-causal conditions while being remarkably compact and easily deployable in resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Conformer-based Ultrasound-to-Speech Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have shown promising potential for ultrasound-to-speech conversion task towards Silent Speech Interfaces. In this work, we applied two Conformer-based DNN architectures (Base and one with bi-LSTM) for this task. Speaker-specific models were trained on the data of four speakers from the Ultrasuite-Tal80 dataset, while the generated mel spectrograms were synthesized to audio waveform using a HiFi-GAN vocoder. Compared to a standard 2D-CNN baseline, objective measurements (MSE and mel cepstral distortion) showed no statistically significant improvement for either model. However, a MUSHRA listening test revealed that Conformer with bi-LSTM provided better perceptual quality, while Conformer Base matched the performance of the baseline along with a 3x faster training time due to its simpler architecture. These findings suggest that Conformer-based models, especially the Conformer with bi-LSTM, offer a promising alternative to CNNs for ultrasound-to-speech conversion.</description>

      <title>From Spikes to Speech: NeuroVoc -- A Biologically Plausible Vocoder Framework for Auditory Perception and Cochlear Implant Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present NeuroVoc, a flexible model-agnostic vocoder framework that reconstructs acoustic waveforms from simulated neural activity patterns using an inverse Fourier transform. The system applies straightforward signal processing to neurogram representations, time-frequency binned outputs from auditory nerve fiber models. Crucially, the model architecture is modular, allowing for easy substitution or modification of the underlying auditory models. This flexibility eliminates the need for speech-coding-strategy-specific vocoder implementations when simulating auditory perception in cochlear implant (CI) users. It also allows direct comparisons between normal hearing (NH) and electrical hearing (EH) models, as demonstrated in this study. The vocoder preserves distinctive features of each model; for example, the NH model retains harmonic structure more faithfully than the EH model. We evaluated perceptual intelligibility in noise using an online Digits-in-Noise (DIN) test, where participants completed three test conditions: one with standard speech, and two with vocoded speech using the NH and EH models. Both the standard DIN test and the EH-vocoded groups were statistically equivalent to clinically reported data for NH and CI listeners. On average, the NH and EH vocoded groups increased SRT compared to the standard test by 2.4 dB and 7.1 dB, respectively. These findings show that, although some degradation occurs, the vocoder can reconstruct intelligible speech under both hearing models and accurately reflects the reduced speech-in-noise performance experienced by CI users.</description>

      <title>Towards Better Disentanglement in Non-Autoregressive Zero-Shot Expressive Voice Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expressive voice conversion aims to transfer both speaker identity and expressive attributes from a target speech to a given source speech. In this work, we improve over a self-supervised, non-autoregressive framework with a conditional variational autoencoder, focusing on reducing source timbre leakage and improving linguistic-acoustic disentanglement for better style transfer. To minimize style leakage, we use multilingual discrete speech units for content representation and reinforce embeddings with augmentation-based similarity loss and mix-style layer normalization. To enhance expressivity transfer, we incorporate local F0 information via cross-attention and extract style embeddings enriched with global pitch and energy features. Experiments show our model outperforms baselines in emotion and speaker similarity, demonstrating superior style adaptation and reduced source style leakage.</description>

      <title>A Statistics-Driven Differentiable Approach for Sound Texture Synthesis and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce TexStat, a novel loss function specifically designed for the analysis and synthesis of texture sounds characterized by stochastic structure and perceptual stationarity. Drawing inspiration from the statistical and perceptual framework of McDermott and Simoncelli, TexStat identifies similarities between signals belonging to the same texture category without relying on temporal structure. We also propose using TexStat as a validation metric alongside Frechet Audio Distances (FAD) to evaluate texture sound synthesis models. In addition to TexStat, we present TexEnv, an efficient, lightweight and differentiable texture sound synthesizer that generates audio by imposing amplitude envelopes on filtered noise. We further integrate these components into TexDSP, a DDSP-inspired generative model tailored for texture sounds. Through extensive experiments across various texture sound types, we demonstrate that TexStat is perceptually meaningful, time-invariant, and robust to noise, features that make it effective both as a loss function for generative tasks and as a validation metric. All tools and code are provided as open-source contributions and our PyTorch implementations are efficient, differentiable, and highly configurable, enabling its use in both generative tasks and as a perceptually grounded evaluation metric.</description>

      <title>Towards Source Attribution of Singing Voice Deepfake with Multimodal Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the task of singing voice deepfake source attribution (SVDSA). We hypothesize that multimodal foundation models (MMFMs) such as ImageBind, LanguageBind will be most effective for SVDSA as they are better equipped for capturing subtle source-specific characteristics-such as unique timbre, pitch manipulation, or synthesis artifacts of each singing voice deepfake source due to their cross-modality pre-training. Our experiments with MMFMs, speech foundation models and music foundation models verify the hypothesis that MMFMs are the most effective for SVDSA. Furthermore, inspired from related research, we also explore fusion of foundation models (FMs) for improved SVDSA. To this end, we propose a novel framework, COFFE which employs Chernoff Distance as novel loss function for effective fusion of FMs. Through COFFE with the symphony of MMFMs, we attain the topmost performance in comparison to all the individual FMs and baseline fusion methods.</description>

      <title>BitTTS: Highly Compact Text-to-Speech Using 1.58-bit Quantization and Weight Indexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a highly compact, lightweight text-to-speech (TTS) model for on-device applications. To reduce the model size, the proposed model introduces two techniques. First, we introduce quantization-aware training (QAT), which quantizes model parameters during training to as low as 1.58-bit. In this case, most of 32-bit model parameters are quantized to ternary values {-1, 0, 1}. Second, we propose a method named weight indexing. In this method, we save a group of 1.58-bit weights as a single int8 index. This allows for efficient storage of model parameters, even on hardware that treats values in units of 8-bit. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieved 83 % reduction in model size, while outperforming the baseline of similar model size without quantization in synthesis quality.</description>

      <title>Efficient Data Selection for Domain Adaptation of ASR Using Pseudo-Labels and Multi-Stage Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained ASR models for specific domains is challenging for small organizations with limited labeled data and computational resources. Here, we explore different data selection pipelines and propose a robust approach that improves ASR adaptation by filtering pseudo-labels generated using Whisper (encoder-decoder) and Zipformer (transducer) models. Our approach integrates multiple selection strategies -- including word error rate (WER) prediction, named entity recognition (NER), and character error rate (CER) analysis -- to extract high-quality training segments. We evaluate our method on Whisper and Zipformer using a 7500-hour baseline, comparing it to a CER-based approach relying on hypotheses from three ASR systems. Fine-tuning on 7500 hours of pseudo-labeled call center data achieves 12.3% WER, while our filtering reduces the dataset to 100 hours (1.4%) with similar performance; a similar trend is observed on Fisher English.</description>

      <title>MFLA: Monotonic Finite Look-ahead Attention for Streaming Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Applying large pre-trained speech models like Whisper has shown promise in reducing training costs for various speech tasks. However, integrating these models into streaming systems remains a challenge. This paper presents a novel prefix-to-prefix training framework for streaming recognition by fine-tuning the Whisper. We introduce the Continuous Integrate-and-Fire mechanism to establish a quasi-monotonic alignment between continuous speech sequences and discrete text tokens. Additionally, we design Monotonic Finite Look-ahead Attention, allowing each token to attend to infinite left-context and finite right-context from the speech sequences. We also employ the wait-k decoding strategy to simplify the decoding process while ensuring consistency between training and testing. Our theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves a controllable trade-off between latency and quality, making it suitable for various streaming applications.</description>

      <title>Brain-tuned Speech Models Better Reflect Speech Processing Stages in the Brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pretrained self-supervised speech models excel in speech tasks but do not reflect the hierarchy of human speech processing, as they encode rich semantics in middle layers and poor semantics in late layers. Recent work showed that brain-tuning (fine-tuning models using human brain recordings) improves speech models' semantic understanding. Here, we examine how well brain-tuned models further reflect the brain's intermediate stages of speech processing. We find that late layers of brain-tuned models substantially improve over pretrained models in their alignment with semantic language regions. Further layer-wise probing reveals that early layers remain dedicated to low-level acoustic features, while late layers become the best at complex high-level tasks. These findings show that brain-tuned models not only perform better but also exhibit a well-defined hierarchical processing going from acoustic to semantic representations, making them better model organisms for human speech processing.</description>

      <title>Acoustically Precise Hesitation Tagging Is Essential for End-to-End Verbatim Transcription Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Verbatim transcription for automatic speaking assessment demands accurate capture of disfluencies, crucial for downstream tasks like error analysis and feedback. However, many ASR systems discard or generalize hesitations, losing important acoustic details. We fine-tune Whisper models on the Speak &amp; Improve 2025 corpus using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), without recourse to external audio training data. We compare three annotation schemes: removing hesitations (Pure), generic tags (Rich), and acoustically precise fillers inferred by Gemini 2.0 Flash from existing audio-transcript pairs (Extra). Our challenge system achieved 6.47% WER (Pure) and 5.81% WER (Extra). Post-challenge experiments reveal that fine-tuning Whisper Large V3 Turbo with the "Extra" scheme yielded a 5.5% WER, an 11.3% relative improvement over the "Pure" scheme (6.2% WER). This demonstrates that explicit, realistic filled-pause labeling significantly enhances ASR accuracy for verbatim L2 speech transcription.</description>

      <title>A Novel Data Augmentation Approach for Automatic Speaking Assessment on Opinion Expressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated speaking assessment (ASA) on opinion expressions is often hampered by the scarcity of labeled recordings, which restricts prompt diversity and undermines scoring reliability. To address this challenge, we propose a novel training paradigm that leverages a large language models (LLM) to generate diverse responses of a given proficiency level, converts responses into synthesized speech via speaker-aware text-to-speech synthesis, and employs a dynamic importance loss to adaptively reweight training instances based on feature distribution differences between synthesized and real speech. Subsequently, a multimodal large language model integrates aligned textual features with speech signals to predict proficiency scores directly. Experiments conducted on the LTTC dataset show that our approach outperforms methods relying on real data or conventional augmentation, effectively mitigating low-resource constraints and enabling ASA on opinion expressions with cross-modal information.</description>

      <title>UniCUE: Unified Recognition and Generation Framework for Chinese Cued Speech Video-to-Speech Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cued Speech (CS) enhances lipreading through hand coding, providing precise speech perception support for the hearing-impaired. CS Video-to-Speech generation (CSV2S) task aims to convert the CS visual expressions (CS videos) of hearing-impaired individuals into comprehensible speech signals. Direct generation of speech from CS video (called single CSV2S) yields poor performance due to insufficient CS data. Current research mostly focuses on CS Recognition (CSR), which convert video content into linguistic text. Based on this, one straightforward way of CSV2S is to combine CSR with a Text-to-Speech system. This combined architecture relies on text as an intermediate medium for stepwise cross-modal alignment, which may lead to error propagation and temporal misalignment between speech and video dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that directly generates speech from CS videos without relying on intermediate text. Building upon this, we propose UniCUE, the first unified framework for CSV2S, whose core innovation lies in the integration of the CSR task that provides fine-grained visual-semantic information to facilitate speech generation from CS videos. More precisely, (1) a novel fine-grained semantic alignment pool to ensure precise mapping between visual features and speech contents; (2) a VisioPhonetic adapter to bridge cross-task representations, ensuring seamless compatibility between two distinct tasks (i.e., CSV2S and CSR); (3) a pose-aware visual processor is introduced to enhance fine-grained spatiotemporal correlations between lip and hand movements in CS video. Experiments on our new established Chinese CS dataset (14 cuers1: 8 hearing-impaired and 6 normal-hearing) show that our UniCUE significantly reduces Word Error Rate by 78.3% and improves lip-speech synchronization by 32% compared to the single CSV2S.</description>

Abstract: Generating accurate sounds for complex audio-visual scenes is challenging, especially in the presence of multiple objects and sound sources. In this paper, we propose an {\em interactive object-aware audio generation} model that grounds sound generation in user-selected visual objects within images. Our method integrates object-centric learning into a conditional latent diffusion model, which learns to associate image regions with their corresponding sounds through multi-modal attention. At test time, our model employs image segmentation to allow users to interactively generate sounds at the {\em object} level. We theoretically validate that our attention mechanism functionally approximates test-time segmentation masks, ensuring the generated audio aligns with selected objects. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that our model outperforms baselines, achieving better alignment between objects and their associated sounds.

      <title>Neural Scoring: A Refreshed End-to-End Approach for Speaker Recognition in Complex Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern speaker verification systems primarily rely on speaker embeddings and cosine similarity. While effective, these methods struggle with multi-talker speech due to the unidentifiability of embedding vectors. We propose Neural Scoring (NS), a novel end-to-end framework that directly estimates verification posterior probabilities without relying on test-side embeddings, making it more powerful and robust to complex conditions, e.g., with multiple talkers. To address the challenge of training such end-to-end models, we introduce a multi-enrollment training strategy, which pairs each test utterance with multiple enrolled speakers and proves essential to the model's success. Experiments on the VoxCeleb dataset demonstrate that NS consistently outperforms both the baseline and several competitive methods, achieving an overall 70.36% reduction in Equal Error Rate (EER) compared to the baseline.</description>

      <title>ATRI: Mitigating Multilingual Audio Text Retrieval Inconsistencies by Reducing Data Distribution Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14627v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multilingual audio-text retrieval (ML-ATR) is a challenging task that aims to retrieve audio clips or multilingual texts from databases. However, existing ML-ATR schemes suffer from inconsistencies for instance similarity matching across languages. We theoretically analyze the inconsistency in terms of both multilingual modal alignment direction error and weight error, and propose the theoretical weight error upper bound for quantifying the inconsistency. Based on the analysis of the weight error upper bound, we find that the inconsistency problem stems from the data distribution error caused by random sampling of languages. We propose a consistent ML-ATR scheme using 1-to-k contrastive learning and audio-English co-anchor contrastive learning, aiming to mitigate the negative impact of data distribution error on recall and consistency in ML-ATR. Experimental results on the translated AudioCaps and Clotho datasets show that our scheme achieves state-of-the-art performance on recall and consistency metrics for eight mainstream languages, including English. Our code will be available at https://github.com/ATRI-ACL/ATRI-ACL.</description>

      <title>InSerter: Speech Instruction Following with Unsupervised Interleaved Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in speech large language models (SpeechLLMs) have attracted considerable attention. Nonetheless, current methods exhibit suboptimal performance in adhering to speech instructions. Notably, the intelligence of models significantly diminishes when processing speech-form input as compared to direct text-form input. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this semantic inconsistency between speech and text representations through techniques such as representation and behavior alignment, which involve the meticulous design of data pairs during the post-training phase. In this paper, we introduce a simple and scalable training method called InSerter, which stands for Interleaved Speech-Text Representation Pre-training. InSerter is designed to pre-train large-scale unsupervised speech-text sequences, where the speech is synthesized from randomly selected segments of an extensive text corpus using text-to-speech conversion. Consequently, the model acquires the ability to generate textual continuations corresponding to the provided speech segments, obviating the need for intensive data design endeavors. To systematically evaluate speech instruction-following capabilities, we introduce SpeechInstructBench, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for speech-oriented instruction-following tasks. Our proposed InSerter achieves SOTA performance in SpeechInstructBench and demonstrates superior or competitive results across diverse speech processing tasks.</description>

      <title>PAST: Phonetic-Acoustic Speech Tokenizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present PAST, a novel end-to-end framework that jointly models phonetic information alongside signal reconstruction, eliminating the need for external pretrained models. Unlike previous approaches that rely on pretrained self-supervised models, PAST employs supervised phonetic data, directly integrating domain knowledge into the tokenization process via auxiliary tasks. Additionally, we introduce a streamable, causal variant of PAST, enabling real-time speech applications. Results demonstrate that PAST surpasses existing evaluated baseline tokenizers across common evaluation metrics, including phonetic representation and speech reconstruction. Notably, PAST also achieves superior performance when serving as a speech representation for speech language models, further highlighting its effectiveness as a foundation for spoken language generation. To foster further research, we release the full implementation. For code, model checkpoints, and samples see: https://pages.cs.huji.ac.il/adiyoss-lab/PAST</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.11607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The remarkable success of transformers in the field of natural language processing has sparked the interest of the speech-processing community, leading to an exploration of their potential for modeling long-range dependencies within speech sequences. Recently, transformers have gained prominence across various speech-related domains, including automatic speech recognition, speech synthesis, speech translation, speech para-linguistics, speech enhancement, spoken dialogue systems, and numerous multimodal applications. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey that aims to bridge research studies from diverse subfields within speech technology. By consolidating findings from across the speech technology landscape, we provide a valuable resource for researchers interested in harnessing the power of transformers to advance the field. We identify the challenges encountered by transformers in speech processing while also offering insights into potential solutions to address these issues.</description>

      <title>Language-Codec: Bridging Discrete Codec Representations and Speech Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12208v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, large language models have achieved significant success in generative tasks related to speech, audio, music, and other signal domains. A crucial element of these models is the discrete acoustic codecs, which serve as an intermediate representation replacing the mel-spectrogram. However, there exist several gaps between discrete codecs and downstream speech language models. Specifically, 1) Due to the reconstruction paradigm of the Codec model and the structure of residual vector quantization, the initial channel of the codebooks contains excessive information, making it challenging to directly generate acoustic tokens from weakly supervised signals such as text in downstream tasks. 2) numerous codebooks increases the burden on downstream speech language models. Consequently, leveraging the characteristics of speech language models, we propose Language-Codec. In the Language-Codec, we introduce a Masked Channel Residual Vector Quantization (MCRVQ) mechanism along with improved fourier transform structures and attention blocks, refined discriminator design to address the aforementioned gaps. We compare our method with competing audio compression algorithms and observe significant outperformance across extensive evaluations. Furthermore, we also validate the efficiency of the Language-Codec on downstream speech language models.

      <title>ControlSpeech: Towards Simultaneous and Independent Zero-shot Speaker Cloning and Zero-shot Language Style Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01205v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present ControlSpeech, a text-to-speech (TTS) system capable of fully cloning the speaker's voice and enabling arbitrary control and adjustment of speaking style. Prior zero-shot TTS models only mimic the speaker's voice without further control and adjustment capabilities while prior controllable TTS models cannot perform speaker-specific voice generation. Therefore, ControlSpeech focuses on a more challenging task: a TTS system with controllable timbre, content, and style at the same time. ControlSpeech takes speech prompts, content prompts, and style prompts as inputs and utilizes bidirectional attention and mask-based parallel decoding to capture codec representations corresponding to timbre, content, and style in a discrete decoupling codec space. Moreover, we analyze the many-to-many issue in textual style control and propose the Style Mixture Semantic Density (SMSD) module, which is based on Gaussian mixture density networks, to resolve this problem. To facilitate empirical validations, we make available a new style controllable dataset called VccmDataset. Our experimental results demonstrate that ControlSpeech exhibits comparable or state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in terms of controllability, timbre similarity, audio quality, robustness, and generalizability. The relevant code and demo are available at https://github.com/jishengpeng/ControlSpeech .</description>

      <title>Sonic: Shifting Focus to Global Audio Perception in Portrait Animation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of talking face generation mainly explores the intricacies of synchronizing facial movements and crafting visually appealing, temporally-coherent animations. However, due to the limited exploration of global audio perception, current approaches predominantly employ auxiliary visual and spatial knowledge to stabilize the movements, which often results in the deterioration of the naturalness and temporal inconsistencies.Considering the essence of audio-driven animation, the audio signal serves as the ideal and unique priors to adjust facial expressions and lip movements, without resorting to interference of any visual signals. Based on this motivation, we propose a novel paradigm, dubbed as Sonic, to {s}hift f{o}cus on the exploration of global audio per{c}ept{i}o{n}.To effectively leverage global audio knowledge, we disentangle it into intra- and inter-clip audio perception and collaborate with both aspects to enhance overall perception.For the intra-clip audio perception, 1). \textbf{Context-enhanced audio learning}, in which long-range intra-clip temporal audio knowledge is extracted to provide facial expression and lip motion priors implicitly expressed as the tone and speed of speech. 2). \textbf{Motion-decoupled controller}, in which the motion of the head and expression movement are disentangled and independently controlled by intra-audio clips. Most importantly, for inter-clip audio perception, as a bridge to connect the intra-clips to achieve the global perception, \textbf{Time-aware position shift fusion}, in which the global inter-clip audio information is considered and fused for long-audio inference via through consecutively time-aware shifted windows. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the novel audio-driven paradigm outperform existing SOTA methodologies in terms of video quality, temporally consistency, lip synchronization precision, and motion diversity.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Flow-Matching-Based Text-to-Speech via Empirically Pruned Step Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flow-matching-based text-to-speech (TTS) models, such as Voicebox, E2 TTS, and F5-TTS, have attracted significant attention in recent years. These models require multiple sampling steps to reconstruct speech from noise, making inference speed a key challenge. Reducing the number of sampling steps can greatly improve inference efficiency. To this end, we introduce Fast F5-TTS, a training-free approach to accelerate the inference of flow-matching-based TTS models. By inspecting the sampling trajectory of F5-TTS, we identify redundant steps and propose Empirically Pruned Step Sampling (EPSS), a non-uniform time-step sampling strategy that effectively reduces the number of sampling steps. Our approach achieves a 7-step generation with an inference RTF of 0.030 on an NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU, making it 4 times faster than the original F5-TTS while maintaining comparable performance. Furthermore, EPSS performs well on E2 TTS models, demonstrating its strong generalization ability.</description>
