      <title>A novel approach to trading strategy parameter optimization using double out-of-sample data and walk-forward techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel approach to walk-forward optimization by parameterizing the lengths of training and testing windows. We demonstrate that the performance of a trading strategy using the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) evaluated within a walk-forward procedure based on the Robust Sharpe Ratio is highly dependent on the chosen window size. We investigated the strategy on intraday Bitcoin data at six frequencies (1 minute to 60 minutes) using 81 combinations of walk-forward window lengths (1 day to 28 days) over a 19-month training period. The two best-performing parameter sets from the training data were applied to a 21-month out-of-sample testing period to ensure data independence. The strategy was only executed once during the testing period. To further validate the framework, strategy parameters estimated on Bitcoin were applied to Binance Coin and Ethereum. Our results suggest the robustness of our custom approach. In the training period for Bitcoin, all combinations of walk-forward windows outperformed a Buy-and-Hold strategy. During the testing period, the strategy performed similarly to Buy-and-Hold but with lower drawdown and a higher Information Ratio. Similar results were observed for Binance Coin and Ethereum. The real strength was demonstrated when a portfolio combining Buy-and-Hold with our strategies outperformed all individual strategies and Buy-and-Hold alone, achieving the highest overall performance and a 50 percent reduction in drawdown. A conservative fee of 0.1 percent per transaction was included in all calculations. A cost sensitivity analysis was performed as a sanity check, revealing that the strategy's break-even point was around 0.4 percent per transaction. This research highlights the importance of optimizing walk-forward window lengths and emphasizing the value of single-time out-of-sample testing for reliable strategy evaluation.</description>

      <title>Trading in CEXs and DEXs with Priority Fees and Stochastic Delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a mixed control framework that combines absolutely continuous controls with impulse interventions subject to stochastic execution delays. The model extends current impulse control formulations by allowing (i) the controller to choose the mean of the stochastic delay of their impulses, and allowing (ii) for multiple pending orders, so that several impulses can be submitted and executed asynchronously at random times. The framework is motivated by an optimal trading problem between centralized (CEX) and decentralized (DEX) exchanges. In DEXs, traders control the distribution of the execution delay through the priority fee paid, introducing a fundamental trade-off between delays, uncertainty, and costs. We study the optimal trading problem of a trader exploiting trading signals in CEXs and DEXs. From a mathematical perspective, we derive the associated dynamic programming principle of this new class of impulse control problems, and establish the viscosity properties of the corresponding quasi-variational inequalities. From a financial perspective, our model provides insights on how to carry out execution across CEXs and DEXs, highlighting how traders manage latency risk optimally through priority fee selection. We show that employing the optimal priority fee has a significant outperformance over non-strategic fee selection.</description>

      <title>Information Structures in Stablecoin Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stablecoins have historically depegged due from par to large sales, possibly of speculative nature, or poor reserve asset quality. Using a global game which addresses both concerns, we show that the selling pressure on stablecoin holders increases in the presence of a large sale. While precise public knowledge reduces (increases) the probability of a run when fundamentals are strong (weak), interestingly, more precise private signals increase (reduce) the probability of a run when fundamentals are strong (weak), potentially explaining the stability of opaque stablecoins. The total run probability can be decomposed into components representing risks from large sales and poor collateral. By analyzing how these risk components vary with respect to information uncertainty and fundamentals, we can split the fundamental space into regions based on the type of risk a stablecoin issuer is more prone to. We suggest testable implications and connect our model's implications to real-world applications, including depegging events and the no-questions-asked property of money.</description>
