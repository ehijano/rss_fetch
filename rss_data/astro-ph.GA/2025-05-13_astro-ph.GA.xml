      <title>The ALMA-CRISTAL survey: Gas, dust, and stars in star-forming galaxies when the Universe was ~1 Gyr old I. Survey overview and case studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the ALMA-CRISTAL survey, an ALMA Cycle 8 Large Program designed to investigate the physical properties of star-forming galaxies at $4 \lesssim z \lesssim 6$ through spatially resolved, multi-wavelength observations. This survey targets 19 star-forming main-sequence galaxies selected from the ALPINE survey, using ALMA Band 7 observations to study [CII] 158 $\mu$m line emission and dust continuum, complemented by JWST/NIRCam and HST imaging to map stellar and UV emission. The CRISTAL sample expanded to 39 after including newly detected galaxies in the CRISTAL fields, archival data, and pilot study targets. The resulting dataset provides a detailed view of gas, dust, and stellar structures on kiloparsec scales at the end of the era of reionization. The survey reveals diverse morphologies and kinematics, including rotating disks, merging systems, [CII] emission tails from potential interactions, and clumpy star formation. Notably, the [CII] emission in many cases extends beyond the stellar light seen in HST and JWST imaging. Scientific highlights include CRISTAL-10, exhibiting an extreme [CII] deficit similar to Arp 220; and CRISTAL-13, where feedback from young star-forming clumps likely causes an offset between the stellar clumps and the peaks of [CII] emission. CRISTAL galaxies exhibit global [CII]/FIR ratios that decrease with increasing FIR luminosity, similar to trends seen in local galaxies but shifted to higher luminosities, likely due to their higher molecular gas content. CRISTAL galaxies also span a previously unexplored range of global FIR surface brightness at high-redshift, showing that high-redshift galaxies can have elevated [CII]/FIR ratios. These elevated ratios are likely influenced by factors such as lower metallicity gas, the presence of significant extraplanar gas, and contributions from shock-excited gas.</description>

      <title>Disruptions of stars and binary systems on chaotic orbits in the axisymmetric Milky Way center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-spherical potentials allow a wide range of trajectories, both regular and chaotic, whose periapse distances can vary orbit to orbit. In particular chaotic trajectories can bring a system arbitrarily close to the central massive black hole leading to a disruption. In this paper, we work with an observationally benchmarked model of the innermost 200 pc of the Milky Way and show that low z-angular momentum trajectories are commonly chaotic. We compute the timescales and properties of close pericenter passages, and compare the implied collisionless disruption rate to the well-studied collisional rate from 2-body scatterings. We find that the relative collisionless rate can dominate by orders of magnitude. Our calculations are relevant for a wide range of disruption phenomena, including the production of hypervelocity stars (HVSs) and tidal disruption events (TDEs). Most of these disruptions involve stars come from the Nuclear Stellar Cluster, with a pericenter distribution that strongly favours shallow encounters, and a preference for high inclination interactions. The latter implies that unbound disrupted material - whether ejected stars or stellar debris - would be preferentially directed towards the galactic poles. Many of our conclusions apply generally to any galaxy with a non-spherical galactic centre potential and central massive black hole.</description>

      <title>SIEGE IV: compact star clusters in cosmological simulations with high star formation efficiency and sub-parsec resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of compact high-redshift star-forming clumps, the physical processes driving their evolution and their potential connection to present-day Globular Clusters are key open questions in galaxy formation. In this work, we aim to shed light on these aspects using the SImulating the Environment where Globular clusters Emerged (SIEGE) project, a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations with sub-parsec resolution specifically designed to investigate the physical conditions behind the origin of compact stellar systems in high-redshift environments. The simulation object of this study focuses on a dwarf galaxy with a virial mass of a few $10^9$ $M_\odot$ at $z=6.14$, where the spatial resolution reaches 0.3 pc $h^{-1}$. Individual stars are formed directly by sampling the initial mass function with a 100\% star formation efficiency, a setup designed to explore the impact of a high star formation efficiency under high-redshift conditions. The simulation reveals the emergence of numerous stellar clumps with sizes of 1-3 pc, stellar surface densities up to almost $10^4$ $M_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$, and masses predominantly spanning from $10^3$ $M_\odot$ to several $10^4$ $M_\odot$, with a few reaching $10^5$ $M_\odot$ and up to $10^6$ $M_\odot$. All clumps form during intense, short bursts of star formation lasting less than a Myr, often with negligible dark matter content (dark-to-stellar mass ratios below 1 within three times their effective radii). We measure a clear correlation between mass and size, and a clump mass function described by a power-law with a slope of -2. Star formation conditions in the simulation behave similarly to those of a feedback-free starburst scenario, where dense clumps form due to inefficient stellar feedback over small timescales. Notably, some clumps exhibit properties closely resembling those of present-day globular clusters.</description>

      <title>When relics were made: vigorous stellar rotation and low dark matter content in the massive ultra-compact galaxy GS-9209 at z=4.66</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST observations uncovered a large number of massive quiescent galaxies (MQGs) at z&gt;3, which theoretical models struggle to reproduce. Explaining the number density of such objects requires extremely high conversion efficiency of baryons into stars in early dark matter halos. Using stellar kinematics, we can investigate the processes shaping the mass assembly histories of MQGs. We present high-resolution JWST/NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy of GS-9209, a massive, compact quiescent galaxy at z=4.66 ($\log \left (M_{\ast}/M_{\odot} \right) = 10.52 \pm 0.06 $, $R_{eff} = 220 \pm 20$ pc). Full spectral fitting of the spatially resolved stellar continuum reveals a clear rotational pattern, yielding a spin parameter of $\lambda_{R_{eff}} = 0.65 \pm 0.12$. With its high degree of rotational support, this galaxy challenges the scenario of MQGs growing mainly by dry major mergers. This study suggests that at least a fraction of the earliest quiescent galaxies were fast rotators and that quenching was dynamically gentle process, preserving the stellar disc even in highly compact objects. Using Jeans anisotropic modelling (JAM) and a NFW profile, we measure a dark matter fraction of $f_{\rm DM} \left (&lt; R_{eff} \right ) = 6.3^{+2.8}_{-1.7}%$, which is plausible given that this galaxy is extremely compact. Our findings use kinematics to independently confirm the massive nature of early quiescent galaxies, previously inferred from stellar population modelling. We suggest that GS-9209 has a similar structure to low-redshift 'relic' galaxies. However, unlike relic galaxies which have bottom-heavy initial mass functions (IMF), the dynamically inferred stellar mass-to-light ratio of GS-9209 is consistent with a Milky-Way like IMF. The kinematical properties of GS-9209 are different from those of z&lt;1 early-type galaxies and more similar to those of recently quenched post-starburst galaxies at z&gt;2.</description>

      <title>Mapping neutral islands during end stages of reionization with photometric intergalactic medium tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the epoch of reionization (EoR), the first generation of luminous sources in our Universe emitted ionizing photons that almost completely ionized the gas in the intergalactic medium (IGM). The growth of ionized bubbles and the persistence of neutral islands within the IGM hold vital clues to understanding the morphology and timeline of cosmic reionization. We explore the potential of photometric IGM tomography using deep narrow-band (NB) imaging to observe the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest transmission in background galaxies with the Subaru/Hyper-Suprime Cam (HSC). Based on our simulations, we find that the currently available NB filter is suitable for mapping the IGM at $z\simeq 5.7$, corresponding to the late stages of reionization. Our findings indicate that over $\sim$500 background galaxies are needed to accurately reconstruct the IGM at scales greater than 200 Mpc, achieving more than 40 per cent correlation with the true distribution. This technique can help detect final remaining neutral islands that span more than 20 Mpc lengths. Using the superpixel method built to identify physical patterns in noisy image data, we find that the neutral island size distribution can be recovered with an accuracy of $\sim$0.3 dex. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these reconstructed maps are correlated with the galaxy distribution and anti-correlated with the cosmological 21-cm signal from neutral hydrogen in the IGM. Lastly, we find that these reconstructed maps are anti-correlated with the patchy optical depth to the cosmic microwave background. As such, multiple measurements can be employed for confirmed detection of neutral islands during the end stages.</description>

      <title>JWST/NIRSpec Observations of High Ionization Emission Lines in Galaxies at High Redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST spectroscopy has built large emission line samples at $z\gtrsim4$, but it has yet to confidently reveal many galaxies with the hard radiation fields commonly associated with AGN photoionization. While this may indicate a weaker UV ionizing spectrum in many $z&gt;4$ AGNs or obscuration from dense neutral gas and dust, the complete picture remains unclear owing to the small number of deep rest-UV spectra. Here we characterize the strength of high ionization lines in $53$ new galaxies observed with NIRSpec $R=2700$ grating spectroscopy. We present new detections of narrow NV$\lambda1240$ in two galaxies. One is a previously-confirmed $z=6.98$ Little Red Dot (LRD) with broad H$\beta$, and the other is a $z=8.72$ galaxy with a narrow line spectrum. Neither source exhibits CIV or HeII emission, indicating large NV/CIV and NV/HeII ratios that may reflect a combination of nitrogen-enhancement and resonant scattering effects. We investigate the incidence of narrow high ionization lines in a large database of $851$ NIRSpec grating spectra, and we separately quantify the fraction of LRDs with narrow high ionization UV emission lines. Our results likely suggest that hard radiation fields are indeed present in a small subset of LRDs ($12.5^{+23.7}_{-10.4}\%$) and UV-selected galaxies ($2.2^{+1.7}_{-1.0}\%$) at $z&gt;4$. The identification of narrow high ionization lines in the population of LRDs with strong Balmer absorption suggests the dense neutral hydrogen gas may not uniformly cover the nucleus. The NV/CIV and NV/HeII ratios suggest that efforts to identify high ionization lines should extend down in wavelength to the NV doublet.</description>

      <title>EXP: a Python/C++ package for basis function expansion methods in galactic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the public release of EXP, a basis function expansion C++ library and Python package for running N-body galactic simulations and dynamical discovery. EXP grew out of the need for methodology that seamlessly connects theoretical descriptions of dynamics, N-body simulations, and compact descriptions of observed data. EXP decomposes a galaxy into multiple bases for a variety of scales and geometries and is thus able to represent arbitrarily complex simulations with many components (e.g., disk, bulge, dark matter halo, satellites). pyEXP provides a full Python interface to the EXP C++ libraries. Example workflows based on previously published work are available and distributed as accompanying examples and tutorials. The examples and tutorials flatten the learning curve for adopting basis function expansion tools to generate and analyze the significance of coefficients and discover dynamical relationships using time series analysis. The current release uses a powerful, non-parametric technique for time series analysis that decomposes basis function expansion coefficients into interpretable components without assuming a specific model structure. This enables the automated discovery of dynamical signals from simulations. We provide a full online manual hosted by Read the Docs.</description>

      <title>RM jitter: Wavelength-dependent Scatter in Rotation Measure Related to Faraday Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relation between Faraday Rotation Measure (RM) and differential Faraday rotation by unresolved structure of a turbulent plasma is investigated for extragalactic radio sources. The RM scatter of a sample of sources affected by turbulent Faraday screens with identical power spectra of Faraday depth structure, is referred to as RM jitter. For fixed amplitude and slope of the power spectrum, the range of possible RMs depends on the wavelength coverage of the survey. RM jitter is independent of Faraday depth resolution as it results from the true Faraday depth dispersion and effects of wavelength-dependent depolarization. RM jitter for a flux density limited sample is sensitive to the power law index gamma of the power spectrum of Faraday depth structure. Assuming depolarization by a turbulent Faraday screen for all sources, a simulated flux-density-limited sample can reproduce the high RM scatter found by Vanderwoude et al. (2024) for sources that are less than 3% polarized. RM jitter of sources that are more than 3% polarized, is found to be smaller than the observed scatter, indicating that plasma other than the near-source environment dominates the RM scatter for the more polarized sources. The significance of RM jitter for applications of the RM grid is discussed.</description>

      <title>Superluminal Motion and Jet Parameters in the High-Redshift Blazar J1429+5406</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relativistic jet of the powerful radio-emitting blazar J1429+5406 at redshift z=3.015. Our understanding of jet kinematics in z&gt;3 quasars is still rather limited, based on a sample of less than about 50 objects. The blazar J1429+5406 was observed at a high angular resolution using the method of very long baseline interferometry over more than two decades, between 1994 and 2018. These observations were conducted at five radio frequencies, covering a wide range from 1.7 to 15 GHz. The outer jet components at ~20-40 milliarcsecond (mas) separations from the core do not show discernible apparent motion. On the other hand, three jet components within the central 10 mas region exhibit significant proper motion in the range of (0.045-0.16)mas/year, including one that is among the fastest-moving jet components at z&gt;3 known to date. Based on the proper motion of the innermost jet component and the measured brightness temperature of the core, we estimated the Doppler factor, the bulk Lorentz factor, and the inclination angle of the jet with respect to the line of sight. The core brightness temperature is at least 3.6 x 10^{11} K, well exceeding the equipartition limit, indicating Doppler-boosted radio emission. The low jet inclination (&lt;5.4 deg) firmly places J1429+5406 into the blazar category.</description>

      <title>Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus star formation history as revealed by detailed elemental abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus was the last major merger and central turning point in the Milky Way's story. This event, comparable in mass to the Large Magellanic Cloud today, left behind significant debris that provides valuable insights into the assembly history of our Galaxy and the chemical evolution of dwarf galaxies. By examining the aftermath of the GSE merger, we can delve deeper into understanding how the Milky Way's formation unfolded and how dwarf galaxies evolved chemically. Specifically, the distinct patterns of neutron capture elements such as Eu and Ba, along with Mg, offer clues about the star formation history. Through a comprehensive analysis of data compiled in the SAGA database, we investigated the Gaia Sausage-Enceladus' star formation history. Elemental abundance ratios ([Eu/Mg], [Ba/Mg], and [Eu/Ba]) derived from this study, when compared with those of surviving Milky Way satellites, indicate that the GSE experienced a prolonged period of slow star formation, lasting over 2 Gyr, until it was eventually quenched by merging with the Milky Way. Consequently, these elemental signatures serve as a unique window into the complex history of both surviving and accreted satellites orbiting our Galaxy.</description>

      <title>The frozen outskirts: a cold Hubble flow and the mass of the Local Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the velocity field of peripheral members of the Local Group. The Hubble flow at distances from 400 to 1400~kpc, formed by 7 of 11 nearby galaxies, is characterized by an extremely small line-of-sight velocity dispersion of 15 km/s, which differs significantly from the predictions of cosmological simulations of about 70 km/s. This fact allows us to determine the total mass of the Local Group as $M_{LG} = (2.47 \pm 0.15) \times 10^{12}$ $M_\odot$ using an analytical model of the Hubble flow around a spherical overdensity in the standard flat \LCDM{} universe. The practical equality of this mass to the sum of the masses of our Galaxy and the Andromeda Galaxy, as well as the absence of mass growth in the range of distances under consideration, gives grounds to conclude that the entire mass of the Local Group is confined within the virial radii around its two main galaxies. The barycenter, found from the minimal scatter of mass estimates, corresponds to the mass ratio of the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy equal to $M_{MW}/M_{M31} = 0.74\pm0.10$. The velocity of our Galaxy to the barycenter turns out to be $62.6\pm2.6$ km/s. This allows us to determine the apex of the Sun relative to the barycenter of the Local Group to be $(l,b,V) = ( +94.0^\circ \pm 0.7^\circ, -2.7^\circ \pm 0.3^\circ, 301 \pm 3$ km/s in the Galactic coordinates.</description>

      <title>A catalogue of candidate milli-parsec separation massive black hole binaries from long term optical photometric monitoring</title>

Abstract: The role of mergers in the evolution of massive black holes is still unclear, and their dynamical evolution, from the formation of pairs to binaries and the final coalescence, carries large physical uncertainties. The identification of the elusive population of close massive binary black holes (MBBHs) is crucial to understand the importance of mergers in the formation and evolution of supermassive black holes. It has been proposed that MBBHs may display periodic optical/ultra-violet variability. Optical surveys provide photometric measurements of a large variety of objects, over decades and searching for periodicities coming from galaxies in their long-term optical/UV lightcurves may help identify new MBBH candidates. Using the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey (CRTS) and Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data, we studied the long-term periodicity of variable sources in the centre of galaxies identified using the galaxy catalogue Glade+. We report 36 MBBHs candidates, with sinusoidal variability with amplitudes between 0.1 and 0.8 magnitudes over 3-5 cycles, through fitting 15 years of data. The periodicities are also detected when adding a red noise contribution to the sine model. Moreover, the periodicities are corroborated through Generalized Lomb Scargle (GLS) periodograms analysis, providing supplementary evidence for the observed modulation. We also indicate 58 objects, that were previously proposed to be MBBH candidates from analysis of CRTS data only. Adding ZTF data clearly shows that the previously claimed modulation is due to red noise. We also created a catalogue of 221 weaker candidates which require further observations over the coming years to help validate their nature. Based on our 36 MBBHs candidates, we expect ~20 MBBHs at z&lt;1, which is commensurate with simulations. Further observations will help confirm these results.</description>

      <title>Insights into the dependence of galaxy properties on the environment with explainable machine learning models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxies reside within dark matter halos, but their properties are influenced not only by their halo properties but also by the surrounding environment. We construct an interpretable neural network framework to characterize the surrounding environment of galaxies and investigate the extent to which their properties are affected by neighboring galaxies in IllustrisTNG300 data ($z=0$). Our models predict galaxy properties (stellar mass and star formation rate) given dark matter subhalo properties of both host subhalo and of surrounding galaxies, which serve as an explainable, flexible galaxy-halo connection model. We find that prediction accuracy peaks when incorporating only the nearest neighboring galaxy for stellar mass prediction, while star formation rate prediction benefits from information from up to the third-nearest neighbor. We determine that environmental influence follows a clear hierarchical pattern, with the nearest neighbor providing the dominant contribution that diminishes rapidly with additional neighbors. We confirm that central and satellite galaxies, as well as different galaxy categories based on mass and star-forming activity, exhibit distinct environmental dependencies. Environmental dependence for low-mass galaxies ($\log(M_*/M_\odot) &lt; 10$) shows 35-50% environmental contribution compared to just 8-30% for massive centrals, while satellite galaxies experience consistently stronger environmental effects than centrals across all populations. Furthermore, we find that the most significant attribute from neighboring subhalos for predicting target galaxy properties is its distance to the nearest neighboring galaxy. These quantitative results offer guidance for constructing more sophisticated empirical and semi-analytic models of galaxy formation that explicitly include environmental dependence as a function of galaxy type and mass.</description>

      <title>Symmetry in Fundamental Parameters of Galaxies on the Star-forming Main Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Star-Forming Main Sequence (SFMS) serves as a critical framework for understanding galaxy evolution, highlighting the relationship between star formation rates (SFR) and stellar masses M_* across cosmic time. Despite its significance, the origin of the 0.3-0.4 dex dispersion in the SFMS remains a key unresolved question. Uncovering the origin of dispersion is crucial for understanding the evolution of galaxies. Using a large sample of approximately 500,000 galaxies, we reveal an unprecedented symmetry in the distribution of key structural properties-effective radius (R_{\rm e}), stellar surface density (M_*/R_{\rm e}^2), and morphology on the SFMS. This symmetry implies that galaxies with high (above SFMS) and low (below SFMS) SFRs share similar fundamental parameters. Moreover, galaxies with smaller R_{\rm e} or higher M_*/R_{\rm e}^2 exhibit greater dispersion in SFR. This dispersion reflects the response to fluctuations in cosmic accretion flows, while the SFR itself represents the time-averaged effect over the gas consumption timescale. Shorter gas consumption timescales, associated with higher M_*/R_{\rm e}^2, lead to greater SFR dispersion. Our results reveal that the variation of SFR originates from the oscillation of accretion flow and is regulated by the stellar surface density.</description>

      <title>The competing effects of recent and long-term star formation histories on oxygen, nitrogen, and stellar metallicities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) - the three-way trend between galaxy stellar masses, star-formation rates (SFRs) and gaseous metallicities - remains amongst the most studied extragalactic relations. Furthermore, metallicity correlates particularly tightly with gravitational potential. Simulations support a shared origin for these relations relating to long-term gas inflow history variations; however, differences between simulated and observed galaxy samples make it unclear whether this holds for real galaxies. We use MaNGA integral field observations to probe these relations in star-forming galaxies at one effective radius. We confirm the FMR and equivalent relations for stellar metallicity (FMR*) and gaseous N/O (fundamental nitrogen relation, FNR). We find that all relations persist when considering gravitational potential in place of stellar mass and/or considering stellar ages in place of SFR, with the gaseous relations strengthened significantly by considering potential. The gaseous FMR disappears at high masses/potentials, while the FNR persists and the FMR* strengthens. Our results suggest a unified interpretation of galaxies' gaseous and stellar metallicities and their N/O abundances in terms of their formation histories. Deeper gravitational potentials correspond to earlier star-formation histories (SFHs) and faster gas consumption, producing tight potential-abundance relations for stars and gas. In weak potentials, galaxy SFR variations primarily result from recent gas inflows, mostly affecting gas abundances. In deeper potentials, SFR variations instead correspond to broad differences in SFH shapes resulting from differences in long-term gas consumption histories, which is most visible in stellar abundances. This unified interpretation could be confirmed with upcoming higher redshift spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Ray Superdiffusion and Mirror Diffusion in Partially Ionized and Turbulent Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding cosmic ray (CR) diffusion in a partially ionized medium is both crucial and challenging. In this study, we investigate CR superdiffusion in turbulent, partially ionized media using high-resolution 3D two-fluid simulations that treat ions and neutrals separately. We examine the influence of neutral-ion decoupling and the associated damping of turbulence on CR propagation in both transonic and supersonic conditions. Our simulations demonstrate that neutral-ion decoupling significantly damps velocity, density, and magnetic field fluctuations at small scales, producing spectral slopes steeper than those of Kolmogorov and Burgers scaling. We also identify an intermediate coupling regime in which neutrals remain partially coupled with ions, leading to a steepening of kinetic energy spectra in both fluids. Shocks can enhance the neutral-ion coupling, thereby reducing the differences between neutral and ion density structures. Moreover, the damping of magnetic field fluctuations substantially decreases pitch angle scattering, which increases CR parallel mean free paths. As a result, CR perpendicular transport transitions between two distinct superdiffusive regimes: a scattering-dominated regime with perpendicular displacement proportional to $t^{3/4}$, and a scattering-free regime dominated by magnetic field line wandering, with perpendicular displacement scaling as $t^{3/2}$. When the pitch angle is large, the effects of magnetic mirroring, naturally arising in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, become significant, enhancing the confinement (but not fully trapping) of CRs and inducing oscillations in their perpendicular displacement. These results highlight the necessity of incorporating two-fluid effects for accurately modeling CR transport in partially ionized environments such as molecular clouds and dense interstellar clumps.</description>

      <title>Characterizing 3D Magnetic Fields and Turbulence in H I Clouds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Galactic magnetic fields are critical for understanding the interstellar medium, Galactic foreground polarization, and the propagation of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. Leveraging recent theoretical insights into anisotropic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, we introduce a deep learning framework to predict the full 3D magnetic field structure-including the plane-of-sky (POS) position angle, line-of-sight (LOS) inclination, magnetic field strength, sonic Mach number ($M_s$), and Alfv\'en Mach number ($M_A$)-from spectroscopic H~I observations. The deep learning model is trained on synthetic H~I emission data generated from multiphase 3D MHD simulations. We then apply the trained model to observational data from the Commensal Radio Astronomy FAST Survey, presenting maps of 3D magnetic field orientation, magnetic field strength, $M_s$, and $M_A$ for two H~I clouds, a low-velocity cloud (LVC) and an intermediate-velocity cloud (IVC), which overlap in the POS yet reside at different LOS distances. The deep-learning-predicted POS magnetic field position angles align closely with those determined using the velocity gradient technique, whose integrated results are consistent with independent measurements from Planck 353~GHz polarization data. This study demonstrates the potential of deep learning approaches as powerful tools for modeling the 3D distributions of 3D Galactic magnetic fields and turbulence properties throughout the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Origin of the Multi-Phase Interstellar Medium: the Effects of Turbulence and Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interstellar medium (ISM) consists of a multiphase gas, including the warm neutral medium (WNM), the unstable neutral medium (UNM), and the cold neutral medium (CNM). While significant attention has been devoted to understanding the WNM and CNM, the formation of a substantial fraction of the UNM, with temperatures ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand Kelvin, remains less well understood. In this study, we present three-dimensional hydrodynamical and magnetohydrodynamical simulations of turbulent multiphase ISM to investigate the roles of turbulence and magnetic fields in regulating the multiphase ISM. Our results confirm that turbulence is crucial in redistributing energy and producing the UNM. The turbulent mixing effect smooths the phase diagram, flattens the pressure-density relationship, and increases the fraction of gas in the UNM. We find that magnetic fields not only contribute to sustaining the UNM but also influence the dynamics and distribution of gas across all phases. Magnetic fields introduce anisotropy to the turbulent cascade, reducing the efficiency of turbulent mixing in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field. We find the anisotropy results in a less flat phase diagram compared to hydrodynamical cases. Furthermore, the inclusion of magnetic fields shallowens the second-order velocity structure functions across multiple ISM phases, suggesting that more small-scale fluctuations are driven. These fluctuations contribute to the formation of the UNM by altering the energy cascade and thermodynamic properties of the gas. Our findings suggest that the combined effects of turbulence and magnetic fields are important in regulating the multiphase ISM.</description>

      <title>Close-knit relatives: reproducing galactic rotation curves with a two-component bosonic dark matter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bosonic stars,hypothetical astrophysical entities, are generally categorized into two primary classes based on the nature of their constituent particles: Einstein Klein Gordon stars, made up of massive scalar bosons, and Proca stars, their vector ''cousins''. Depending on the boson masses and field frequencies, these objects may exhibit properties of diffuse, massive structures, with sizes comparable to or even exceeding those of galaxies. This concept has inspired the bosonic dark matter halo hypothesis, providing a theoretical framework to effectively model the dark matter content of galactic halos. In this paper we build on our previous work to explore the possibility of using vector and scalar bosons to model the components of galactic dark matter halos and subhalos in order to reproduce the observed rotation curves of galaxies. By employing diverse combinations of those bosonic dark matter models in conjunction with observable data for a sample of galaxies, we show that our two component dark matter approach notably improves the agreement between observations and theoretical predictions with respect to our previous investigation. Our framework may shed new light on the enduring mystery surrounding the apparent matter deficit observed in dwarf and spiral galaxies.</description>

      <title>Rapid formation of a very massive star &gt;50000 $M_\odot$ and subsequently an IMBH from runaway collisions. Direct N-body and Monte Carlo simulations of dense star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. We present simulations of a massive young star cluster using \textsc{Nbody6++GPU} and \textsc{MOCCA}. The cluster is initially more compact than previously published models, with one million stars, a total mass of $5.86 \times 10^5~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, and a half-mass radius of $0.1~\mathrm{pc}$.
  Aims. We analyse the formation and growth of a very massive star (VMS) through successive stellar collisions and investigate the subsequent formation of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) in the core of a dense star cluster.
  Methods. We use both direct \textit{N}-body and Monte Carlo simulations, incorporating updated stellar evolution prescriptions (SSE/BSE) tailored to massive stars and VMSs. These include revised treatments of stellar radii, rejuvenation, and mass loss during collisions. While the prescriptions represent reasonable extrapolations into the VMS regime, the internal structure and thermal state of VMSs formed through stellar collisions remain uncertain, and future work may require further refinement.
  Results. We find that runaway stellar collisions in the cluster core produce a VMS exceeding $5 \times 10^4~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ within 5 Myr, which subsequently collapses into an IMBH.
  Conclusions. Our model suggests that dense stellar environments may enable the formation of very massive stars and massive black hole seeds through runaway stellar collisions. These results provide a potential pathway for early black hole growth in star clusters and offer theoretical context for interpreting recent JWST observations of young, compact clusters at high redshift.</description>

      <title>Edge-on galaxies relative to edge-on view of the Local Supercluster</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological theories suggest that the angular momentum of galaxies should be closely linked to the structure of the cosmic web. The Local Supercluster is the closest and most studied structure where the orientation of galaxy spins can be studied. As noted by Navarro et al. (2004), the use of edge-on galaxies greatly simplifies this task by reducing it to an analysis of the distribution of position angles in the Supergalactic coordinates. We reexamine this correlation using modern catalogs that allow us to perform a more robust statistical analysis. We test the dependence on redshift, spatial position, luminosity, and color. We find that the spins of galaxies with stellar mass $M_*&lt;10^{8.7}$ $M_\odot$ show a weak tendency to be aligned perpendicular to the plane of the Local Supercluster at the 2-sigma level. Other subsamples do not show statistically significant correlations.</description>

      <title>Emission Line Diagnostics for IMBHs in Dwarf Galaxies: Accounting for BH Seeding and ULX Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dwarf AGN serve as the ideal systems for identifying intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) down to the most elusive regimes ($\sim 10^3 - 10^4 M_{\odot}$). However, the ubiquitously metal-poor nature of dwarf galaxies gives rise to ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) that can mimic the spectral signatures of IMBH excitation. We present a novel photoionization model suite that simultaneously incorporates IMBHs and ULXs in a metal-poor, highly star-forming environment. We account for changes in $M_{BH}$ according to formation seeding channels and metallicity, and changes in ULX populations with post-starburst age and metallicity. We find that broadband X-rays and UV emission lines are insensitive to $M_{BH}$ and largely unable to distinguish between ULXs and IMBHs. Many optical diagnostic diagrams cannot correctly identify dwarf AGN. The notable exceptions include He~II~$\lambda$4686 and [O~I]~$\lambda$6300, for which we redefine typical demarcations to account for ULX contributions. Emission lines in the mid-IR show the most promise in separating stellar, ULX, IMBH, and shock excitation while presenting sensitivity to $M_{BH}$ and $f_{\text{AGN}}$. Overall, our results expose the potential biases in identifying and characterizing dwarf AGN purely on strong line ratios and diagnostic diagrams rather than holistically evaluating the entire spectrum. As a proof of concept, we argue that recently discovered over-massive BHs in high-$z$ JWST AGN might not represent the overall BH population, with many galaxies in these samples potentially being falsely classified as purely star-forming.</description>

      <title>Gravitationally Bound Gas Determines Star Formation in the Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars form from molecular gas under complex conditions influenced by multiple competing physical mechanisms, such as gravity, turbulence, and magnetic fields. However, accurately identifying the fraction of gas actively involved in star formation remains challenging. Using dust continuum observations from the Herschel Space Observatory, we derived column density maps and their associated probability distribution functions (N-PDFs). Assuming the power-law component in the N-PDFs corresponds to gravitationally bound (and thus star-forming) gas, we analyzed a diverse sample of molecular clouds spanning a wide range of mass and turbulence conditions. This sample included 21 molecular clouds from the solar neighborhood ($d&lt;$500 pc) and 16 high-mass star-forming molecular clouds. For these two groups, we employed the counts of young stellar objects (YSOs) and mid-/far-infrared luminosities as proxies for star formation rates (SFR), respectively. Both groups revealed a tight linear correlation between the mass of gravitationally bound gas and the SFR, suggesting a universally constant star formation efficiency in the gravitationally bound gas phase. The star-forming gas mass derived from threshold column densities ($N_{{\mbox {threshold}}}$) varies from cloud to cloud and is widely distributed over the range of $\sim$1--17$\times$10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ based on N-PDF analysis. But in solar neighborhood clouds, it is in rough consistency with the traditional approach using $A_{\rm V}$ $\ge$ 8 mag. In contrast, in high turbulent regions (e.g., the Central Molecular Zone) where the classical approach fails, the gravitationally bound gas mass and SFR still follow the same correlation as other high-mass star-forming regions in the Milky Way. Our findings also strongly support the interpretation that gas in the power-law component of the N-PDF is undergoing self-gravitational collapse to form stars.</description>

      <title>Why is the Star Formation Rate Proportional to Dense Gas Mass?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most profound empirical laws of star formation is the Gao-Solomon relation, a linear correlation between the star formation rate (SFR) and the dense molecular gas mass. It is puzzling how the complicated physics in star-formation results in this surprisingly simple proportionality. Using archival Herschel and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Observations, we derived the masses of the most massive cores ($M^{\rm max}_{\rm core}$) and masses of the gravitationally bound gas ($ M_{\rm gas}^{\rm bound}$) in the parent molecular clouds for a sample of low-mass and high-mass star-forming regions. We discovered a significant correlation $\log(M^{\rm max}_{\rm core}/M_{\odot}) = 0.506 \log(M_{\rm gas}^{\rm bound}/M_{\odot})-0.32$. Our discovered $M^{\rm max}_{\rm core}$-$M_{\rm gas}^{\rm bound}$ correlation can be approximately converted to the Gao-Solomon relation if there is (1) a constant 30% efficiency of converting $M^{\rm max}_{\rm core}$ to the mass of the most massive star ($m^{\rm max}_{\rm star}$), and (2) if SFR and $m^{\rm max}_{\rm star}$ are tightly related through $\log({\rm SFR}/(M_{\odot} {\rm yr}^{-1})) = 2.04 \log(m^{\rm max}_{\rm star}/M_{\odot})-5.80$. Intriguingly, both requirements have been suggested by previous theoretical studies (c.f. Yan et al. 2017). Based on this result, we hypothesize that the Gao-Solomon relation is a consequence of combining the following three non-trivial relations (i) SFR vs. $m^{\rm max}_{\rm star}$, (ii) $m^{\rm max}_{\rm star}$ vs. $M^{\rm max}_{\rm core}$, and (iii) $M^{\rm max}_{\rm core}$ vs. $M_{\rm gas}^{\rm bound}$. This finding may open a new possibility to understand the Gao-Solomon relation in an analytic sense.</description>

      <title>The CHIMERAS Project: Design Framework for the Collisionless HIgh-beta Magnetized Experiment Researching Astrophysical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From the near-Earth solar wind to the intracluster medium of galaxy clusters, collisionless, high-beta, magnetized plasmas pervade our universe. Energy and momentum transport from large-scale fields and flows to small scale motions of plasma particles is ubiquitous in these systems, but a full picture of the underlying physical mechanisms remains elusive. The transfer is often mediated by a turbulent cascade of Alfv{\'e}nic fluctuations as well as a variety of kinetic instabilities; these processes tend to be multi-scale and/or multi-dimensional, which makes them difficult to study using spacecraft missions and numerical simulations alone (Dorfman et al. 2023; Lichko et al. 2020, 2023). Meanwhile, existing laboratory devices struggle to produce the collisionless, high ion beta ($\beta_i \gtrsim 1$), magnetized plasmas across the range of scales necessary to address these problems. As envisioned in recent community planning documents (Carter et al. 2020; Milchberg and Scime 2020; Baalrud et al. 2020; Dorfman et al. 2023; National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 2024, it is therefore important to build a next generation laboratory facility to create a $\beta_i \gtrsim 1$, collisionless, magnetized plasma in the laboratory for the first time. A Working Group has been formed and is actively defining the necessary technical requirements to move the facility towards a construction-ready state. Recent progress includes the development of target parameters and diagnostic requirements as well as the identification of a need for source-target device geometry. As the working group is already leading to new synergies across the community, we anticipate a broad community of users funded by a variety of federal agencies (including NASA, DOE, and NSF) to make copious use of the future facility.</description>

      <title>The Abundance Origin Of A Highly r-process-Enhanced r-II Star: LAMOST J020623.21+494127.9</title>

Abstract: Object LAMOST J020623.21+494127.9 (program star) in the thin disk of the Milky Way (MW) is reported as a highly r-process-enhanced (RPE) r-II star with[Eu/Fe]= +1.32 and [Fe/H]= -0.54. The chemical profile of the star reflects the intrinsic composition of the gas cloud present at its birth. Using an abundance decomposition method, we fit 25 elements from the abundance dataset, including 10 heavy neutron capture elements. We explore the astrophysical origin of the elements in this star through its abundance ratios and component ratios. We find that the contributions from the massive stars played a significant role in the production of light elements in the program star. Our analysis reveals that the heavy neutron-capture elements are produced purely by the main r-process. However, the adopted main r-process model does not adequately fit the observed data, suggesting another main r-process pattern may exist.</description>

      <title>Systematic Investigation into Radio Supernovae with Markov Chain Monte Carlo Analysis: Implications for Massive Stars' Mass Loss and Shock Acceleration Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic analysis of radio supernovae (SNe) to investigate the statistical tendencies of SN progenitors' mass-loss rates and shock acceleration efficiencies. We conduct parameter estimation through Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis for 32 radio SN samples with a clear peak observed in their light curves, and successfully fit 27 objects with the widely-used radio SN model. We find the inferred mass-loss rates of stripped-envelope SN progenitors are by an order of magnitude greater ($\sim 10^{-3}\,M_\odot{\rm yr}^{-1}$) than those of SN II progenitors ($&lt;10^{-4}\,M_\odot{\rm yr}^{-1}$). The efficiencies of electron acceleration and magnetic field amplification are found to be less than $10^{-2}$, and the possibility of their energy equipartition is not ruled out. On the other hand, we find the following two properties that might be related to limitations of the standard model for radio SNe; one is the extremely high magnetic field amplification efficiency, and the other is the shallower density gradient of the outer ejecta. We suggest the new interpretation that these peculiar results are misleading due to the setup that is not included in our model, and we identify the missing setup as a dense CSM in the vicinity of the progenitor. This means that a large fraction of radio SN progenitors might possess dense CSM in the vicinity of the progenitor, which is not smoothly connected with the outer CSM.</description>

      <title>Radio polarization from runaway star bowshocks-I. The general case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High velocity stars move through the interstellar medium with V &gt; 30 km/s. When the star has powerful winds, under the appropriate conditions, the interaction of the wind with the interstellar material produces a system of shocks. The outer shock, called the bowshock, perturbs the ambient medium, heating and compressing the gas. The dust in the compressed bowshock cools, producing infrared radiation. This emission appears as extended coma-shape structures. The discovery of radio nonthermal emission from two stellar bowshock nebulae indicates that these sources might be accelerating electrons up to relativistic energies. The produced nonthermal radio emission is most probably synchrotron which has a high degree of polarization. In this work we model the synchrotron emission of runaway massive star bowshocks aiming to produce synthetic radio emission and polarization maps for two frequencies: 1.40 and 4.86 GHz. We model the interacting plasmas in a steady-state regime by means of magnetohydrodynamics simulations and we compute the injection and transport of the relativistic electrons in the diffusion approximation. We include in the model the most important depolarization effects. Our main conclusions are i) the effects of Faraday rotation within the source are important at the lowest frequency considered, ii) inferring the local magnetic field direction from polarization measurements only can be misleading, iii) thermal radio emission produced by ionized plasma within the bowshock structure and surroundings can surpass the polarized one for the considered frequencies, and iv) the contribution from the background electrons is minor.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Envelopes in Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope have uncovered a population of compact, red object ($z\sim 4\text{--}7$) known as little red dots (LRDs). The presence of broad Balmer emission lines indicates active galactic nuclei powered by supermassive black holes (BHs), while LRDs exhibit unusually weak X-ray and radio emission and low variability, suggesting super-Eddington accretion that obscures the central engine. We suggest that such an extreme accretion disc inevitably drives strong outflows, which would disrupt the LRDs themselves unless confined within the nuclear region -- posing a general feedback problem for overmassive BHs. To resolve this, we propose that the BH is embedded in a massive, optically thick envelope that gravitationally confines the outflow, making any outflow a no-go. This envelope, powered by accretion on to the BH, radiates at nearly the Eddington limit, and is sustained by an infall of the interstellar medium at a rate on the order of $\sim 1 M_{\odot}~{\rm yr}^{-1}$. A photosphere emerges either within the envelope or in the infalling medium, with a characteristic temperature of $5000$ - $7000 {\rm K}$, near the Hayashi limit. The resulting blackbody emission naturally explains the red optical continuum of the distinct V-shaped spectrum observed in most LRDs. Furthermore, the dynamical time-scale at the photosphere, $\sim 0.01~{\rm pc}$, is consistent with the observed year-scale variabilities. The nuclear structure and spectral features of LRDs are shaped by this envelope, which not only regulates feedback but also acts as a gas reservoir that sustains rapid BH growth in the early universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abundances of M dwarfs, being the most numerous stellar type in the Galaxy, can enhance our understanding of planet formation processes. They can also be used to study the chemical evolution of the Galaxy, where in particular alpha-capture elements play an important role. We aim to obtain abundances for Fe, Ti, and Ca for a small sample of well-known M dwarfs for which interferometric measurements are available. These stars and their abundances are intended to serve as a benchmark for future large-scale spectroscopic studies. We analysed spectra obtained with the GIANO-B spectrograph. Turbospectrum and the wrapper TSFitPy were used with MARCS atmospheric models in order to fit synthetic spectra to the observed spectra. We performed a differential abundance analysis in which we also analysed a solar spectrum with the same method and then subtracted the derived abundances line-by-line. The median was taken as the final abundance for each element and each star. Our abundances of Fe, Ti, and Ca agree mostly within uncertainties when comparing with other values from the literature. However, there are few studies to compare with.</description>

      <title>An Actinide-boost Star Discovered in the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of an actinide-boost, very metal-poor ($\left[\mathrm{Fe/H} \right]=-2.38$), $r$-process-enhanced ($\left[\mathrm{Eu/Fe} \right]=0.80$) star, LAMOST J0804+5740, within the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE). Based on the high-resolution ($R\sim36,000\; and \;60,000$) and high signal-to-noise ratio spectra obtained with the High Dispersion Spectrograph on the Subaru Telescope, the abundances of 48 species are determined. Its $\log\epsilon\rm(\mathrm{Th}/\mathrm{Eu}) = -0.22 $ establishes it as the first confirmed actinide-boost star within the GSE. Comparative analysis of its abundance pattern with theoretical $r$-process models reveals that the magnetorotationally driven jet supernova $r$-process model with $\hat{L}v$ = 0.2 provides the best fit and successfully reproduces the actinide-boost signature. Kinematic analysis of actinide-boost stars reveals that approximately two-thirds of them are classified as $\textit{ex-situ}$ stars, suggesting that actinide-boost stars are more likely to originate from accreted dwarf galaxies. As the first actinide-boost star identified within the GSE, J0804+5740 will provide valuable insights into $r$-process nucleosynthesis in accreted dwarf galaxies like the GSE, especially on the production of the heaviest elements.</description>

Abstract: The radio quasar NVSS~J171822+423948 (J1718+4239) was proposed as the counterpart of the IceCube neutrino event IC-201221A. To reveal the nature of the source, we conducted new very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations of this blazar candidate with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). The observations were carried out in dual-band mode between $4$ and $7$~GHz. Archival radio data from the literature were also collected for comparison. Our analysis revealed highly variable, Doppler-boosted radio emission of the source, with compact structure at both kpc and pc scales, a slightly inverted spectrum, and a maximum jet inclination angle of $\theta\le5\degr$. These results confirm J1718+4239 as a blazar-type object.</description>

      <title>J1406+0102: Dust Obscured Galaxy Hiding Super Eddington Accretion System with Bright Radio Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent high-$z$ quasar observations strongly indicate that super-Eddington accretion is a crucial phase to describe the presence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with $M_\mathrm{BH} \gtrsim 10^9 M_\odot$ at $z \gtrsim 7$. Motivated by theoretical predictions that the super-Eddington phase efficiently produces outflows and jets bright in radio bands, we identify a super-Eddington radio-loud dust-obscured galaxy (DOG) J1406+0102 at $z=0.2367$. This source is discovered by cross-matching the infrared-bright DOGs of Nobriguchi et al. (2019) with the VLA/FIRST 1.4 GHz radio survey data and the SDSS optical spectral catalog. J1406+0102 shows broad components in the Balmer lines, and by assuming that those lines are from the broad line region, they give BH mass estimations of $\log (M_\mathrm{BH}/M_\odot)=7.30 \pm 0.25$. Combined with an AGN luminosity of $\log (L_\mathrm{bol,[OIII]}/\mathrm{erg}~\mathrm{s}^{-1}) = 45.91\pm0.38$ estimated from the intrinsic [OIII] luminosity, this implies a super-Eddington accretion rate of $\lambda_\mathrm{Edd} \simeq 3$. We show that 1) J1406+0102 shows strong AGN feedback, with the [OIII] outflow velocity exceeds the escape velocity of the host galaxy halo and a kinetic efficiency of $\approx$ 8%, sufficient to quench the host galaxy; 2) its expected growth trajectory places it on an over-massive BH track; and 3) if representative of radio-loud DOGs, such sources can contribute significantly to the high-energy ($\gtrsim$ 100 TeV) cosmic neutrino background.</description>

      <title>The stable "Unstable Natural Media" due to the presence of turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The term "unstable neutral media" (UNM) has traditionally been used to describe the transient phase formed between the warm and cold neutral hydrogen (HI) phases and has not been the focus of HI studies. However, recent observations suggest that the UNM phase not only has a significantly longer-than-expected lifetime but also occupies at least 20\% to 40\% of both the volume and mass fraction of HI. In this paper, we argue that the existence and dominance of the UNM can be explained by the presence of strong turbulence using an energy balance argument. The mass fraction of UNM is directly proportional to the turbulent velocity dispersion $\sigma_v$: mass fraction of UNM $\propto \sigma_v^{\frac{2n}{1+n}}$, where $n$ is the absolute value of the adiabatic index in the unstable phase. We discuss the implications of long-lived unstable thermal phases on ISM physics, including cold dense filament formation, cosmic ray acceleration, and measurement of galactic foreground statistics.</description>

      <title>SILCC -- VIII: The impact of far-ultraviolet radiation on star formation and the interstellar medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present magnetohydrodynamic simulations of star formation in the multiphase interstellar medium to quantify the impact of non-ionising far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation within the \textsc{Silcc Project} simulation framework. Our study incorporates the radiative transfer of ionising radiation and self-consistent modelling of variable FUV radiation from star clusters, advancing beyond previous studies using static or simplified FUV fields. This enables a more accurate capture of the dynamic interaction between radiation and the evolving ISM alongside other stellar feedback channels. The interstellar radiation field (ISRF) near young star clusters can reach $G_0 \approx 10^4$ (in Habing units), far exceeding the solar neighbourhood value of $G_0 = 1.7$. Despite these high intensities, FUV radiation minimally impacts the integrated star formation rate compared to ionising radiation, stellar winds, and supernovae. A slight reduction in star formation burstiness is linked to increased photoelectric (PE) heating efficiency by the variable FUV field. photoelectric (PE) heating efficiency by the variable FUV field. Dust near star-forming regions can be heated up to 60 K via the PE effect, with a broad temperature distribution. PE heating rates in variable FUV models exhibit higher peaks but lower averages than static ISRF models. Simulations under solar neighbourhood conditions without stellar winds or ionising radiation but with supernovae yield unexpectedly high star formation rates of $\sim 0.1 \mathrm{M_\odot~yr^{-1}~kpc^{-2}}$. Our analysis reveals increased cold neutral medium (CNM) volume-filling factors (VFF) outside stellar clusters, reduced thermally unstable gas, and sharper warm-cold gas separation. The variable FUV field also promotes a cold diffuse gas phase with a molecular component, exhibiting a VFF of $\sim5-10$~per cent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07349v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental issue in star formation is understanding the precise mechanisms leading to the formation of prestellar cores, and their subsequent gravitationally unstable evolution. To address this question, we carefully construct a suite of turbulent, self-gravitating numerical simulations, and analyze the development and collapse of individual prestellar cores. We show that the numerical requirements for resolving the sonic scale and internal structure of anticipated cores are essentially the same in self-gravitating clouds, calling for the number of cells per dimension to increase quadratically with the cloud's Mach number. In our simulations, we follow evolution of individual cores by tracking the region around each gravitational potential minimum over time. Evolution in nascent cores is towards increasing density and decreasing turbulence, and there is a wide range of critical density for initiating collapse. At given spatial scale the turbulence level also varies widely, and tends to be correlated with density. By directly measuring the radial forces acting within cores, we identify a distinct transition to a state of gravitational runaway. We use our new theory for turbulent equilibrium spheres to predict the onset of each core's collapse. Instability is expected when the critical radius becomes smaller than the tidal radius; we find good agreement with the simulations. Interestingly, the imbalance between gravity and opposing forces is only $\sim 20\%$ during core collapse, meaning that this is a quasi-equilibrium rather than a free-fall process. For most of their evolution, cores exhibit both subsonic contraction and transonic turbulence inherited from core-building flows; supersonic radial velocities accelerated by gravity only appear near the end of the collapse.</description>

Abstract: We present a spectroscopic analysis of MACS J0138$-$2155, at $z=0.336$, the first galaxy cluster hosting two strongly-lensed supernovae (SNe), Requiem and Encore, providing us with a chance to obtain a reliable $H_0$ measurement from the time delays between the multiple images. We take advantage of new data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the Very Large Telescope, covering a central $1 \rm \, arcmin^2$ of the lensing cluster, for a total depth of 3.7 hours, including 2.9 hours recently obtained by our Target of Opportunity programme. Our new spectroscopic catalogue contains reliable redshifts for 107 objects, including 50 galaxy cluster members with secure redshift values in the range $0.324 &lt; z &lt; 0.349$, and 13 lensed multiple images from four background sources between $0.767\leq z \leq 3.420$, including four images of the host galaxy of the two SNe. We exploit the MUSE data to study the stellar kinematics of 14 bright cluster members and two background galaxies, obtaining reliable measurements of their line-of-sight velocity dispersion. Finally, we combine these results with measurements of the total magnitude of the cluster members in the Hubble Space Telescope F160W band to calibrate the Faber-Jackson relation between luminosity and stellar velocity dispersion ($L \propto \sigma^{1/\alpha}$) for the early-type cluster member galaxies, measuring a slope $\alpha=0.25^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$. A pure and complete sample of cluster member galaxies and a reliable characterisation of their total mass structure are key to building accurate total mass maps of the cluster, mitigating the impact of parametric degeneracies, which is necessary for inferring the value of $H_0$ from the measured time delays between the lensed images of the two SNe.</description>

      <title>The JWST/NIRSpec view of the nuclear region in the prototypical merging galaxy NGC 6240</title>

Abstract: Merger events are thought to be an important phase in the assembly of massive galaxies. At the same time, Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) play a fundamental role in the evolution of their star formation histories. Both phenomena can be observed at work in NGC 6240, a local prototypical merger, classified as an UltraLuminous InfraRed Galaxy (ULIRG) thanks to its elevated infrared luminosity. Interestingly, NGC 6240 hosts two AGN separated by 1.5''(~ 735 pc), detected in both X-ray and radio band. Taking advantage of the unprecedented sensitivity and wavelength coverage provided by the Integral Field Unit (IFU) of the NIRSpec instrument onboard JWST, we observed the nuclear region of NGC 6240 in a FoV of 3.7'' x 3.7''(1.9 x 1.9 kpc^2), to investigate gas kinematics and InterStellar Medium (ISM) properties with a high spatial resolution of ~ 0.1'' (or ~ 50 pc). We separated the different gas kinematic components through multi-Gaussian fitting and studied the excitation properties of the ISM from the NIR diagnostic diagram based on the H_2 1-0 S(1)/BrGamma and [Fe II]1.257micron/PaBeta lines ratios. We isolated the ionization cones of the two nuclei, and detected coronal lines emission from both of them. Using H_2 line ratios, we found that the molecular hydrogen gas is excited mostly by thermal processes. We computed a hot molecular gas mass of 1.3 x 10^5 M_sun and an ionized gas mass in the range of 10^5 - 10^7 M_sun. We studied with unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity the kinematics of the molecular and ionized gas phases. We revealed the complex structure of the molecular gas and found a blueshifted outflow near the Southern nucleus, together with filaments connecting a highly redshifted H_2 cloud with the two nuclei. We speculate on the possible nature of this H_2 cloud and propose two possible scenarios: either outflowing gas, or a tidal cloud falling onto the nuclei.</description>

      <title>PAC in DESI. I. Galaxy Stellar Mass Function into the $10^{6}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ Frontier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Photometric Objects Around Cosmic Webs (PAC) method integrates cosmological photometric and spectroscopic surveys, offering valuable insights into galaxy formation. PAC measures the excess surface density of photometric objects, $\bar{n}_2w_{\rm{p}}$, with specific physical properties around spectroscopic tracers. In this study, we improve the PAC method to make it more rigorous and eliminate the need for redshift bins. We apply the enhanced PAC method to the DESI Y1 BGS Bright spectroscopic sample and the deep DECaLS photometric sample, obtaining $\bar{n}_2w_{\rm{p}}$ measurements across the complete stellar mass range, from $10^{5.3}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ to $10^{11.5}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ for blue galaxies, and from $10^{6.3}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ to $10^{11.9}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ for red galaxies. We combine $\bar{n}_2w_{\rm{p}}$ with $w_{\rm{p}}$ measurements from the BGS sample, which is not necessarily complete in stellar mass. Assuming that galaxy bias is primarily determined by stellar mass and colour, we derive the galaxy stellar mass functions (GSMFs) down to $10^{5.3}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ for blue galaxies and $10^{6.3}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ for red galaxies, while also setting lower limits for smaller masses. The blue and red GSMFs are well described by single and double Schechter functions, respectively, with low-mass end slopes of $\alpha_{\rm{blue}}=-1.54^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ and $\alpha_{\rm{red}}=-2.50^{+0.08}_{-0.08}$, resulting in the dominance of red galaxies below $10^{7.6}{\rm M}_{\odot}$. Stage-IV cosmological photometric surveys, capable of reaching 2-3 magnitudes deeper than DECaLS, present an opportunity to explore the entire galaxy population in the local universe with PAC. This advancement allows us to address critical questions regarding the nature of dark matter, the physics of reionization, and the formation of dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>Chemical signature reveals co-spatial dwarf satellite of an edge-on disc galaxy with MUSE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integral field unit (IFU) spectroscopic observations of resolved galaxies provide an optimal experimental setting for determination of stellar population properties, in particular - age, metallicity and $\alpha$-enhancement, which are key to understanding evolution of galaxies across diverse physical environments. We determine these properties for the edge-on disc galaxy IC 1553, through stellar population models fitted to MUSE IFU observations. From our determined spatial distributions of metallicity and [$\alpha$/Fe], we serendipitiously identify the unique chemical signature of a dwarf galaxy that is co-spatial with the luminous disc of IC 1553. The dwarf galaxy is characterized by the presence of higher [$\alpha$/Fe] and metal-poor stellar populations relative to the disc of IC 1553. The identified dwarf is dynamically cold from its determined kinematics, consistent with being a satellite of IC 1553. From modeling the Spitzer IRAC 3.6 $\mu m$ image of IC 1553, we confirmed the presence of the dwarf galaxy and calculated its stellar mass to be $\sim1.28\times 10^{9} \rm~M_{\odot}$. This is the first such identification of a dwarf galaxy from its unique chemical signature in such integrated light IFU observations, even though its hidden by the luminous body of its massive host.</description>

      <title>CAPERS-LRD-z9: A Gas Enshrouded Little Red Dot Hosting a Broad-line AGN at z=9.288</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present CAPERS-LRD-z9, a little red dot (LRD) which we confirm to be a $z=9.288$ broad-line AGN (BLAGN). First identified as a high-redshift LRD candidate from PRIMER NIRCam photometry, follow-up NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy of CAPERS-LRD-z9 from the CANDELS-Area Prism Epoch of Reionization Survey (CAPERS) has revealed a broad $3500$ km s$^{-1}$ H$\beta$ emission line and narrow [O III]$\lambda\lambda4959,5007$ lines, indicative of a BLAGN. Based on the broad H$\beta$ line, we compute a canonical black-hole mass of $\log(M_{\textrm{BH}}/M_{\odot})=7.58\pm0.15$, although full consideration of systematic uncertainties yields a conservative range of $6.65&lt;\log(M_{\textrm{BH}}/M_{\odot})&lt;8.50$. These observations suggest that either a massive black hole seed, or a lighter stellar remnant seed undergoing periods of super-Eddington accretion, is necessary to grow such a massive black hole in $\lesssim500$ Myr of cosmic time. CAPERS-LRD-z9 exhibits a strong Balmer break, consistent with a central AGN surrounded by dense ($\sim 10^{10}\textrm{ cm}^{-3}$) neutral gas. We model CAPERS-LRD-z9 using CLOUDY to fit the emission red-ward of the Balmer break with a dense gas-enshrouded AGN, and bagpipes to fit the rest-ultraviolet emission as a host-galaxy stellar population. This upper limit on the stellar mass of the host galaxy ($&lt;10^9\,{\rm M_\odot}$) implies that the black-hole to stellar mass ratio may be extremely large, possibly $&gt;5\%$ (although systematic uncertainties on the black-hole mass prevent strong conclusions). However, the shape of the UV continuum differs from typical high-redshift star-forming galaxies, indicating that this UV emission may also be of AGN origin, and hence the true stellar mass of the host may be still lower.</description>

      <title>Evidence for large baryonic feedback at low and intermediate redshifts from kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich observations with ACT and DESI photometric galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in cosmological observations have provided an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the distribution of baryons relative to the underlying matter. In this work, we show that the gas is more extended than the dark matter, and the amount of baryonic feedback at $z \lesssim 1$ disfavors low-feedback models such as that of state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG compared with high-feedback models such as that of the original Illustris simulation. This has important implications for bridging the gap between theory and observations and understanding galaxy formation and evolution. Furthermore, a better grasp of the baryon-dark matter link is critical to future cosmological analyses, which are currently impeded by our limited knowledge of baryonic feedback. Here, we measure the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), stacked on the luminous red galaxy (LRG) sample of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) imaging survey. This is the first analysis to use photometric redshifts for reconstructing galaxy velocities. Due to the large number of galaxies comprising the DESI imaging survey, this is the highest signal-to-noise stacked kSZ measurement to date: we detect the signal at 13$\sigma$, finding strong evidence that the gas is more spread out than the dark matter, as well as a preference for larger feedback compared to some commonly used state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations. Our work opens up the possibility of recalibrating large hydrodynamical simulations using the kSZ effect. In addition, our findings point towards a way of alleviating inconsistencies between weak lensing surveys and cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments, such as the `low $S_8$' tension, and shed light on long-standing enigmas in astrophysics, such as the `missing baryon' problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by known facts about effective field theory and non-Abelian gauge theory, we argue that the post-Newtonian approximation might fail even in the limit of weak fields and small velocities under certain conditions. Namely, the post-Newtonian approximation might break down for wide extended bodies with angular momentum, where angular momentum spans significant spacetime curvature. We construct a novel dimensionless quantity that samples this breakdown, and we evaluate it by means of existing analytical solutions of rotating extended bodies and observational data. We give estimates for galaxies and binary systems, as well as our home in the Cosmos, Laniakea. We thus propose that a novel effective field theory of general relativity is needed to account for the onset of nonlocal angular momentum effetcs, with significant consequences for gravitational physics and cosmology at large.</description>

      <title>Testing tidal theory using Gaia binaries: the red giant branch</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tidal interaction is a major ingredient in the theory of binary evolution. Here, we study tidal circularization in binaries with red giant primaries. We compute the tidal evolution for binaries as their primary stars evolve along the red giant branch, under dissipation of dynamical tides in the convective envelope. We then compare this evolution with a sample of ~30,000 red giant binaries reported by Gaia DR3. These binaries clearly show the expected gradual advance of tidal circularization, as the primary expands. But some tension with theory remains. While our calculations always predict a critical separation for tidal circularization at about 3-4 times the stellar radii, binaries with less evolved giants are observed to be circularized out to about twice as far. They also exhibit an overly extended `cool island', a collection of circular orbits that reach a couple times beyond the circularization limit. These discrepancies are reminiscent of, but less severe than, the situation for main-sequence binaries. We also find that tides can spin giant stars up to rotation rates that should affect their mass-loss. Additionally, many binaries may begin mass transfer while still eccentric.</description>

      <title>Localizing Dynamically-Formed Black Hole Binaries in Milky Way Globular Clusters with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamical formation of binary black holes (BBHs) in globular clusters (GCs) may contribute significantly to the observed gravitational wave (GW) merger rate. Furthermore, LISA may detect many BBH sources from GCs at mHz frequencies, enabling the characterization of such systems within the Milky Way and nearby Universe. In this work, we use Monte Carlo N-body simulations to construct a realistic sample of Galactic clusters, thus estimating the population, detectability, and parameter measurement accuracy of BBHs hosted within them. In particular, we show that the GW signal from $0.7\pm 0.7$, $2.0\pm 1.7$, $3.6\pm 2.3$, $13.4\pm 4.7$ BBHs in Milky Way GCs can exceed the signal-to-noise ratio threshold of $\rm SNR =30$, 5, 3, and 1 for a 10-year LISA observation, with $\sim 50\%$ of detectable sources exhibiting high eccentricities ($e\gtrsim0.9$). Moreover, the Fisher matrix and Bayesian analyses of the GW signals indicate these systems typically feature highly-resolved orbital frequencies ($\delta f_{\rm orb}/ f_{\rm orb} \sim 10^{-7}-10^{-5}$) and eccentricities ($\delta e/ e \sim 10^{-3}-0.1$), as well as a measurable total mass when SNR exceeds $\sim20$. Notably, we show that high-SNR BBHs can be confidently localized to specific Milky Way GCs with a sky localization accuracy of $\delta \Omega \sim 1$~deg$^2$, and address the large uncertainties in their distance measurement ($\delta R \sim 0.3 - 20$~kpc). The detection and localization of even a single BBH in a Galactic GC would allow accurate tracking of its long-term orbital evolution, enable a direct test of the role of GCs in BBH formation, and provide a unique probe into the evolutionary history of Galactic clusters.</description>

Abstract: Next-generation gravitational-wave observatories will reach farther into the universe than currently possible, revealing black-hole mergers from early stellar binary systems such as Population III stars, whose properties are currently poorly constrained. We develop a method to infer the properties of their progenitor populations from gravitational-wave catalogs. Using Bayesian deep learning, we train an emulator for population-synthesis predictions of black-hole merger properties across redshift as a function of the initial stellar mass function, crucially accounting for systematic uncertainty due to the finite number of training simulations. Combined with a nonparametric model for star formation history, we analyze catalogs containing both Population I/II and III sources simulated with full Bayesian parameter estimation for a detector network of Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope with one year of observing time. We demonstrate our ability to separate these two populations at high redshifts where both make comparable contributions to the black-hole merger rate, excluding a Population III merger rate of zero at nearly 100% credibility. Moreover, we can place meaningful constraints on the Population III progenitor distributions; in particular, we constrain the spectral index of the initial mass function to within roughly +/-0.5 of the true value and the log of the star formation rate density to within ~25% over redshifts 10 to 20. By leveraging astrophysics-informed and astrophysics-agnostic models, we demonstrate the discriminative power of our combined inference approach and highlight the potential of next-generation gravitational-wave observatories to uncover the details of high-redshift stellar populations.</description>
