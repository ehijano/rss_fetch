      <title>Accretion onto a Charged Black Hole in Consistent 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In astrophysics, accretion is the process by which a massive object acquires matter. The infall leads to the extraction of gravitational energy. Accretion onto dark compact objects such as black holes, neutron stars, and white dwarfs is a crucial process in astrophysics as it turns gravitational energy into radiation. The accretion process is an effective technique to investigate the properties of other theories of gravity by examining the behavior of their solutions with compact objects. In this paper, we investigate the behavior of test particles around a charged four dimensional Einstein Gauss Bonnet black hole in order to understand their innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and energy flux, differential luminosity, and temperature of the accretion disk. Then, we examine particle oscillations around a central object via applying restoring forces to treat perturbations. Next, we explore the accretion of perfect fluid onto a charged 4D EGB black hole. We develop analytical formulas for four-velocity and proper energy density of the accreting fluid. The EGB parameter and the charge affect properties of the test particles by decreasing their ISCO radius and also decreasing their energy flux. Increasing the EGB parameter and the charge, near the central source reduces both the energy density and the radial component of the infalling fluid's four-velocity.</description>

      <title>Principles for a Distinguished Global Vacuum: Entropy and the Vacuum State in Causal Set Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the framework of real scalar field theory on causal sets, the intimate relation of the Sorkin-Johnston vacuum to entropic purity is elucidated. It is shown that taking a set of sensible principles, and the most natural assumption on the space of fields, leaves the Sorkin-Johnston state as the only candidate for the global vacuum of a quasifree theory.</description>

      <title>AI-driven Conservative-to-Primitive Conversion in Hybrid Piecewise Polytropic and Tabulated Equations of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel AI-based approach to accelerate conservative-to-primitive inversion in relativistic hydrodynamics simulations, focusing on hybrid piecewise polytropic and tabulated equations of state. Traditional root-finding methods are computationally intensive, particularly in large-scale simulations. To address this, we employ feedforward neural networks (NNC2PS and NNC2PL), trained in PyTorch and optimized for GPU inference using NVIDIA TensorRT, achieving significant speedups with minimal loss in accuracy. The NNC2PS model achieves $L_1$ and $L_\infty$ errors of $4.54 \times 10^{-7}$ and $3.44 \times 10^{-6}$, respectively, with the NNC2PL model yielding even lower error values. TensorRT optimization ensures high accuracy, with FP16 quantization offering 7x faster performance than traditional root-finding methods. Our AI models outperform conventional CPU solvers, demonstrating enhanced inference times, particularly for large datasets. We release the scientific software developed for this work, enabling the validation and extension of our findings. These results highlight the potential of AI, combined with GPU optimization, to significantly improve the efficiency and scalability of numerical relativity simulations.</description>

      <title>Hilbert space formalisms for group field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group field theory is a background-independent approach to quantum gravity whose starting point is the definition of a quantum field theory on an auxiliary group manifold (not interpreted as spacetime). Group field theory models can be seen as an extension of matrix and tensor models by additional data, and are traditionally defined through a functional integral whose perturbative expansion generates a sum over discrete geometries. More recently, some efforts have been directed towards formulations of group field theory based on a Hilbert space and operators, in particular in applications to cosmology. This is an attempt to review some of these formulations and their main ideas, to disentangle these constructions as much as possible from applications and phenomenology, and to put them into a wider context of quantum gravity research.</description>

      <title>Diffeomorphism Invariance Breaking in Gravity and Cosmological Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breaking diffeomorphism invariance has been motivated in the literature on several grounds, including the emergence of General Relativity (GR). For this to be a reliable possibility, in a theory with minor violations of general covariance, a healthy behavior is required that is only slightly different from that of GR. In this paper, the cosmological evolution of the scale factor in gravity with broken general covariance is investigated in the (modified) Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime. The model augments the GR Lagrangian with all of the symmetry-breaking terms in the leading order, the terms involving two derivatives. The magnitudes of (minor) violations are kept general modulo the condition for a healthy linearized version of the model. The analytic solutions of the scale factor in the full non-linear theory for the single-component universes are attempted; the radiation and vacuum solutions are found analytically, whereas the matter solution is worked out numerically since there does not exist an analytic solution in the required form. It is observed that the solutions smoothly connect to those of GR in the limit of vanishing symmetry-breaking. The more realistic, two-component, and three-component universes are numerically studied, and no sign of unhealthy behavior is observed: minor diffeomorphism violating modifications to GR do not cause instabilities in the evolution of the scale factor.</description>

      <title>Unitary evolution and cosmic acceleration in Loop Quantum Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loop quantum cosmology was shown to interpolate between de Sitter and FLRW Universe phases through a bounce by including Euclidean and Lorentzian terms of the Hamiltonian constraint with weight one -that corresponding to classical General Relativity. Unitary evolution required self-adjoint extensions of the constraint and a Planckian cosmological constant was obtained. Independent work took a positive weight to get a cosmological constant with the observed value, without considering unitarity. In this work we address the unitary evolution of the model for arbitrary weight. For non positive weight parameter unitary holds but for positive values self-adjoint extensions are required. To encompass observations the extensions here provided are mandatory. These are implemented in a propagator. Finally, we discuss our results and perspectives.</description>

      <title>Geometry of a generalized uncertainty-inspired spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the geometry of a generalized uncertainty-inspired quantum black hole. The diagonal line element is not $t$-$r$ symmetric, i.e. $g_{00} \ne -1/g_{11}$, which leads to an interesting approach to resolving the classical curvature singularity. In this paper, we show, in Schwarzschild coordinates, the $r = 0$ coordinate location is a null surface which is not a transition surface or leads to a black bounce. We find the expansion of null geodesic congruences in the interior turn around then vanishes at $r = 0$, and the energy conditions are predominately violated indicating a repulsive gravitational core. In addition, we show that the line element admits a wormhole solution which is not traversable, and the black hole at its vanishing horizon radius could be interpreted as a remnant.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Notes prepared for the introductory general relativity course PHYSICS 748 at The University of Auckland. They are designed to introduce general relativity to upper-year undergraduate students directly using the modern language of differential geometry but in a physically motivated way, and throughout keeping a logical flow from section to section and chapter to chapter. In doing so, they necessarily cover a number of topics either not normally treated in an introductory course, or from a novel perspective. These include for example: affine spaces, comparing and contrasting rank-2 tensors with matrices, integration on manifolds, the Rindler metric, including a proper near-source boundary condition for the Schwarzschild metric, approaching Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates from a Rindler perspective, and more.</description>

      <title>Testing linear-quadratic GUP modified Kerr Black hole using EHT results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linear-quadratic Generalized uncertainty principle (LQG) is consistent with predictions of a minimum measurable length and a maximum measurable momentum put forth by various theories of quantum gravity. The quantum gravity effect is incorporated into a black hole (BH) by modifying its ADM mass. In this article, we explore the impact of GUP on the optical properties of an LQG modified \k BH (LQKBH). We analyze the horizon structure of the BH, which reveals a critical spin value of $7M/8$. BHs with spin $(a)$ less than the critical value are possible for any real GUP parameter $\a$ value. However, as the spin increases beyond the critical value, a forbidden region in $\a$ values pops up that disallows the existence of BHs. This forbidden region widens as we increase the spin. We then examine the impact of $\a$ on the shape and size of the BH shadow for inclination angles $17^o$ and $90^o$, providing a deeper insight into the unified effect of spin and GUP on the shadow. The size of the shadow has a minimum at $\a=1.0M$, whereas, for the exact value of $\a$, the deviation of the shadow from circularity becomes maximum when the spin is less than the critical value. No extrema is observed for $a\,&gt;\, 7M/8$. The shadow's size and deviation are adversely affected by a decrease in the inclination angle. Finally, we confront theoretical predictions with observational results for supermassive BHs $M87^*$ and $SgrA^*$ provided by the EHT collaboration to extract bounds on the spin $a$ and GUP parameter $\a$. We explore bounds on the angular diameter $\th_d$, axial ratio $D_x$, and the deviation from \s radius $\d$ for constructing constraints on $a$ and $\a$. Our work makes LQKBHs plausible candidates for astrophysical BHs.</description>

      <title>Quasi-normal modes of slowly-rotating Johannsen black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves with ground-based laser interferometers has opened a new window to test and constrain General Relativity (GR) in the strong, dynamical, and non-linear regime. In this paper, we follow an agnostic approach and we study the quasi-normal modes of gravitational perturbations of Johannsen black holes under the assumptions of the validity of the Einstein Equations and of low values of the black hole spin parameter and deformation parameters. We find that the deformation parameter $\alpha_{13}$ has a stronger impact on the quasi-normal modes than the other leading order deformation parameters ($\alpha_{22}$, $\alpha_{52}$, and $\epsilon_{3}$). We derive a fitting formula for the fundamental modes with $l=2$ and $l=3$ for the deformation parameter $\alpha_{13}$ valid in the slow rotation approximation ($a_* &lt; 0.4$). Finally, we constrain $\alpha_{13}$ from the event GW170104; within our analysis, we find that the data of GW170104 are consistent with the predictions of GR.</description>

      <title>The Vanishing of the Non-linear Static Love Number of Kerr Black Holes and the Role of Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the tidal response of Kerr black holes in four-dimensional space-times subjected to external gravitational fields. Using the Ernst formalism and Weyl coordinates, we analyze the non-linear tidal deformation of rotating black holes and demonstrate that their static tidal Love numbers vanish at all orders of the external tidal field. We also show that this result is intimately related to the presence of underlying non-linear symmetries. Our analysis generalizes previous findings for Schwarzschild black holes and confirms the robustness of four-dimensional black holes against tidal forces.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores gravitational phenomena associated with a non-commutative black hole. Geodesic equations are derived, and a thin accretion disk is analyzed to model the black hole shadow image, considering an optically thin, radiating, and infalling gas. Retrolensing effects are examined to trace photon emission configurations, while gravitational lensing is investigated through weak and strong deflection limits, with lensing equations and observables applied to Sagittarius A*. The study also includes calculations of time delay, energy deposition rate from neutrino annihilation, phase and probability of neutrino oscillation, and neutrino gravitational lensing.</description>

      <title>A new class of semiclassical gravity solutions, gravitational quantum stealths and regular Cauchy horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider semiclassical gravity with a Klein-Gordon field with mass $m^2 \geq 0$ and curvature coupling $\xi = 1/2$. We identify a special class of Hadamard two-point functions for which the semiclassical system is quasi-linear hyperbolic and, within this class, provide the first well-posedness result for semiclassical gravity without spacetime symmetries. These two-point functions yield stress-energy expectation values proportional to the spacetime metric (modulo ambiguities). If the proportionality constant vanishes, one has a quantum version of gravitational `stealth' configurations. We discuss that some of these solutions have regular Cauchy horizons in the light of strong cosmic censorship.</description>

      <title>Observational Features of Thin Accretion Disk Around Rotating Regular Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotating regular black hole, as a promising extension beyond general relativity, offer a phenomenological model that resolves spacetime singularities. In this study, we investigate the observational features of thin accretion disk around a well-known rotating regular black hole, which introduce an exponential converge factor $e^{-k/r}$ to the black hole mass M, where $k$ is the regular parameter. By studying the effects of the regular parameter on key quantities such as energy, angular momentum, and the innermost stable circular orbits of a test particle, we are able to analyze the radiative flux, temperature, and differential luminosity of the thin accretion disk in this rotation regular black hole spacetime. By using the ray-tracing method, we also obtain the bolometric images of thin accretion disk around this rotating regular black hole, with various black hole spins and inclination angels. Our results show that the regular parameter significantly impacts the observables, enhancing the radiation efficiency of thin accretion disk and contracting the lensing bands of black hole image, compared to Kerr black hole. These effects become more pronounced for rapidly rotating regular black hole and large inclination angels, making them more detectable in astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>On the low-energy limit of stationary and axisymmetric solutions in General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the low-energy limit of General Relativity in the presence of stationarity and axial symmetry, coupled to dust. Specifically, we demonstrate that differences between the dynamics of General Relativity and those of Newtonian gravity persist even in the weak-field and slow-motion regime. Notably, these differences are driven by dragging terms that are not necessarily small, as is typically the case in the well-known gravitomagnetic limit. To highlight this distinction, we introduce the concept of strong gravitomagnetism. We provide a pedagogical discussion of how these discrepancies arise and outline a systematic procedure to solve the equations of motion for such systems. Furthermore, we present analytical results for specific cases and also give the general solution for the vacuum case. A particularly notable result is our demonstration of how General Relativity can naturally account for a Tully-Fisher-like relation.</description>

      <title>The UV Sensitivity of Axion Monodromy Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit axion monodromy inflation in the context of UV-complete theories and uncover a novel sensitivity of cosmological observables to heavy fields with masses far above the Hubble scale, such as the moduli of flux compactifications. By studying a string-inspired two-field extension of axion monodromy, we reveal that the oscillatory modulation of the axion potential leads to continuous excitation of heavy fields during inflation when the modulation frequency exceeds the field masses. This finding challenges the conventional single-field description, as heavy moduli cannot be simply integrated out. Using a full bootstrap analysis, we demonstrate that this mechanism produces cosmological collider signals that bypass the usual Boltzmann suppression for heavy masses. Specifically, we identify detectably large signatures of heavy moduli in the primordial bispectrum, offering a promising avenue for probing high-energy physics through cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes (as Dark Matter) from the Supercooled Phase Transitions with Radiative Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study in detail the production of primordial black holes (PBHs), as well as their mass and initial spin, due to the phase transitions corresponding to radiative symmetry breaking (RSB) and featuring a large supercooling. The latter property allows us to use a model-independent approach. In this context, we demonstrate that the decay rate of the false vacuum grows exponentially with time to a high degree of accuracy, justifying a time dependence commonly assumed in the literature. Our study provides ready-to-use results for determining the abundance, mass and initial spin of PBHs generated in a generic RSB model with large supercooling. We find that PBHs are generically produced in a broad region of the model-independent parameter space. Notably, we identify the subregion that may explain recently observed microlensing anomalies. Additionally, we show that a simple Standard-Model extension, with right-handed neutrinos and gauged $B-L$ featuring RSB, may explain an anomaly of this sort in a region of its parameter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We synthesize results of previous works to give a coherent and self-consistent account of parametric resonance in a modulated quasi-1D Bose gas in the presence of a dissipative mechanism. The resonant behaviour is shown to be largely in line with the predictions of a phenomenological model published in 2014, while the associated dissipation rate is consistent with that derived in 2022 from three-wave mixing processes between the produced phonons and thermal fluctuations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this invited review, we discuss the evaporation of a black hole, with emphasis on the resulting macroscopically distinct patterns of Hawking radiation. The density matrix of this radiation can approach a pure final state in the form of a highly entangled macroscopic superposition state. We note that this exact property is exhibited in replica wormhole calculations, and also in quantum hair effects on Hawking radiation amplitudes. Finally, we revisit the information paradox (Mathur's theorem and firewalls), showing that it can be resolved by macroscopic entanglement.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of small-scale induced gravitational waves from the soliton/oscillon domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate density fluctuations and scalar-induced gravitational waves (GWs) arising from the production of long-lived solitons and oscillons, which can dominate the early Universe and drive reheating prior to the standard radiation-dominated era. Curvature perturbations are generated not only by the Poisson distribution of these solitons/oscillons but are also amplified during the early matter-dominated phase when the solitons/oscillons dominate. Scalar-induced GWs with characteristic energy spectra emerge from these amplified curvature perturbations, particularly at the sudden transition from matter domination to radiation domination. We analyze this scenario and its GW predictions in detail, focusing on the impact of the initial energy fraction, the lifetime, and the average separation of these solitons/oscillons. This provides a wealth of potential observational targets for various GW detectors. Furthermore, for inflation and preheating models that produce oscillons with large separations, we derive new constraints on these models based on the upper bounds on the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, as anticipated from future cosmic microwave background and large-scale structure observations.</description>

      <title>Effective description of open quantum dynamics in relativistic scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The open dynamics of quantum particles in relativistic scattering is investigated. In particular, we consider the scattering process of quantum particles coupled to an environment initially in a vacuum state. Tracing out the environment and using the unitarity of S-operator, we find the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) generator describing the evolution of the particles. The GKSL generator is exemplified by focusing on the concrete processes: one is the decay of scalar particle ($\phi \rightarrow \chi \chi$), and the others are the pair annihilation and the $2\rightarrow 2$ scattering of scalar particles ($\phi \phi \rightarrow \chi \chi$ and $\phi \phi \rightarrow \phi \phi$). The GKSL generator for $\phi \rightarrow \chi \chi$ has a parameter with the coupling between $\phi$ and $\chi$ and the mass of both fields. The GKSL generator associated with $\phi \phi \rightarrow \chi \chi$ is characterized by a Lorentz-invariant function of initial momenta. Especially, in the pair annihilation process, we show that the probability of pair annihilation varies depending on the superposition state of incident scalar $\phi$ particles. Furthermore, we observe that the GKSL generators derived in this paper have Poincar\'e symmetry. This means that the description by the GKSL generator with Poincar\'e symmetry is effective for the asymptotic behavior of open quantum dynamics in the long-term processes of interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high speeds seen in rapidly rotating pulsars after supernova explosions present a longstanding puzzle in astrophysics. Numerous theories have been suggested over the years to explain this sudden "kick" imparted to the neutron star, yet each comes with its own set of challenges and limitations. Key explanations for pulsar kicks include hydrodynamic instabilities in supernovae, anisotropic neutrino emission, asymmetries in the magnetic field, binary system disruption, and physics beyond the Standard Model. Unraveling the origins of pulsar kicks not only enhances our understanding of supernova mechanisms but also opens up possibilities for exploring new physics. In this brief review, we will introduce pulsar kicks, examine the leading hypotheses, and explore future directions for this intriguing phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Smart Holes: Analogue black holes with the right temperature and entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In analogue gravity studies, the goal is to replicate black hole phenomena, such as Hawking radiation, within controlled laboratory settings. In the realm of condensed matter systems, this may happen in 2D tilted Dirac cone materials based on honeycomb lattice. In particular, we compute the entropy of this system, and find it has the same form as black hole Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, if an analogue horizon forms. Hence, these systems can be potential analogues of quantum black holes. We show that this entropy is primarily concentrated in the region where the tilt parameter is close to one, which corresponds to the location of the analogue black hole horizon. Additionally, when nonlinear effects are taken into account, the entropy is peaked in a small pocket of the Fermi sea that forms behind the analogue event horizon, which we call the \textit{Fermi puddle}. We further refer to this new type of analogue black hole as a {\it smart hole}, since, in contrast to dumb holes, it can simulate both the correct temperature {\it and} entropy of general relativistic black holes. These results provide an opportunity to illuminate various quantum facets of black hole physics in a laboratory setting.</description>

      <title>pp-Waves and the Hidden Symmetries of Black Hole Quasinormal Modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are two interesting classes of trapped null geodesics in any black hole spacetime: those that lie on the photon ring and those that generate the horizon. Recent work introduced a "near-ring" scaling limit that exhibits the emergent symmetries of the eikonal quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum associated to the photon ring. This analysis was reformulated geometrically by Fransen using the Penrose limit, which produces pp-waves from geodesics. We elaborate on and generalize various aspects of this construction for the Schwarzschild black hole. We also discuss the Penrose limit onto the horizon generators. This second limit, although technically simpler, also displays emergent near-horizon symmetries that explain the equally-spaced overtones of the highly-damped QNM spectrum. In both examples, symmetry considerations distinguish the QNM solutions from the scattering states and produce overtones as descendants.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we propose a procedure for calculating the boundary stress tensor of a gravitational theory in asymptotic flat spacetime. As a case study, the stress tensor correctly reproduces the Brown-York charges for the Kerr blackhole i.e. mass and angular momentum. In asymptotic flat spacetime, there are asymptotic symmetries called BMS symmetries. We also compute the charges associated with these symmetries with the proposed stress tensor. The asymptotic charges can be compared with the Wald-Zoupas method. Our result for the stress tensor can be interpreted as the expectation value for the boundary stress tensor.</description>

      <title>A New Approach to the Low Frequency Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background: Constraints from Quasars and the Astrometric Hellings-Downs Curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new astrometric constraints on the stochastic gravitational wave background and construct the first astrometric Hellings-Downs curve using quasar proper motions. From quadrupolar vector spherical harmonic fits to the Gaia proper motions of 1,108,858 quasars, we obtain a frequency-integrated upper limit on the gravitational wave energy density, $h_{70}^2\Omega_{GW} \leq 0.023$ (95% confidence limit), for frequencies between 11.2 nHz and $3.1\times10^{-9}$ nHz ($1.33/t_0$). However, from the astrometric Hellings-Downs curve that describes the correlated proper motions between 2,104,609,881 quasar pairs as a function of their angular separation, we find a much stronger constraint: a characteristic strain of $h_{c} \leq 2.9 \times 10^{-12}$ for $f_{\rm ref} = 1$ yr$^{-1}$ and $h_{70}^2\Omega_{\rm GW} \leq 0.010$ at 95% confidence. We probe down to $\pm$0.005 $\mu$as$^2$ yr$^{-2}$ in correlated power and obtain the lowest astrometric limit to date. This is also the first time that optical wavelength astrometry surpasses limits from radio-frequency interferometry. This astrometric analysis does not yet reach the sensitivity needed to detect the pulsar timing-based red gravitational wave spectrum extrapolated to the quasar gravitational wave sensitivity window, assuming that the turnover in the spectrum occurs at $\sim$1 nHz for massive black hole binaries. The limits presented here may exclude some exotic interpretations of the stochastic gravitational wave background.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a test of the equivalence principle on cosmological scales involving minimal assumptions. Our approach relies on the cross-correlation of two different galaxy populations with large-scale relativistic corrections. We construct a measurable quantity $E_P$ acting as a null test, i.e. deviating from unity whenever the weak equivalence principle is violated. We provide forecasts with the DESI Bright Galaxy Sample and with the Square Kilometre Array Phase 2 (SKA2). The relativistic corrections can be detected with high significance by both surveys, while $E_P$ can only be measured by SKA2. We forecast a precision around 10-15$\%$ across the redshift range between 0.25 and 0.75.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The requirements of unitarity and causality lead to significant constraints on the Wilson coefficients of a EFT expansion, known as positivity bounds. Their standard derivation relies on the crucial assumption of polynomial boundedness on the growth of scattering amplitudes in the complex energy plane, which is a property satisfied by local QFTs, and by weakly coupled string theory in the Regge regime. The scope of this work is to clarify the role of locality by deriving generalized positivity bounds under the assumption of exponential boundedness, typical of non-local QFTs where the Froissart-Martin bound is usually not satisfied. Using appropriately modified dispersion relations, we derive new constraints and find regions in the EFT parameter space that do not admit a local UV completion. Furthermore, we show that there exist ETFs that satisfy IR causality and at the same time can admit a non-local UV completion, provided that the energy scale of non-locality is of the same order or smaller than the EFT cutoff. Finally, we provide explicit examples of non-perturbative amplitudes that simultaneously satisfy the properties of exponential boundedness, unitarity and causality. Our results have far-reaching implications for the question of the uniqueness of string theory as the only consistent ultraviolet completion beyond the framework of local QFT.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of silent and anisotropic big bang singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2101.04955v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is the second of two in which we develop a geometric framework for analysing silent and anisotropic big bang singularities. In the present article, we record geometric conclusions obtained by combining the geometric framework with Einstein's equations. The main features of the results are the following: The assumptions do not involve any symmetry requirements and are weak enough to be consistent with most big bang singularities for which the asymptotic geometry is understood. The framework gives a clear picture of the asymptotic geometry. It also reproduces the Kasner map, conjectured in the physics literature to constitute the essence of the asymptotic dynamics for vacuum solutions to Einstein's equations. When combined with Einstein's equations, the framework yields partial improvements of the assumptions concerning, e.g., the expansion normalised Weingarten map $\mathcal{K}$ (one of the central objects of the framework, defined as the Weingarten map of the leaves of the foliation divided by the mean curvature). For example, the expansion normalised normal derivative of $\mathcal{K}$ can, under suitable assumptions concerning the eigenvalues of $\mathcal{K}$, be demonstrated to decay exponentially and $\mathcal{K}$ can be demonstrated to converge exponentially, even though we initially only impose weighted bounds on these quantities. Finally, the framework gives a unified perspective on the existing results. Moreover, in $3+1$-dimensions, the only parameters necessary to interpret the results are the eigenvalues of $\mathcal{K}$ and an additional scalar function determined by the geometry induced on the leaves of the foliation.
  In the companion article, we obtain conclusions concerning the asymptotic behaviour of solutions to linear systems of wave equations on the backgrounds consistent with the framework.</description>

Abstract: A particular extension of Einstein's General Relativity up to and including quartic terms in the curvature tensor is minimal in the sense that it has a unique maximally symmetric vacuum and only a massless spin-2 excitation in its spectrum around the vacuum. We study the inflation phase of the universe in this minimal quartic extension of Einstein's gravity in the presence of trace anomaly terms coming from the Standard Model fields and the fields of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. We show that the theory allows a quasi-de Sitter phase with sufficient $e$-foldings.</description>

Abstract: The large-scale analysis task of deciphering gravitational wave signals in the LISA data stream will be difficult, requiring a large amount of computational resources and extensive development of computational methods. Its high dimensionality, multiple model types, and complicated noise profile require a global fit to all parameters and input models simultaneously. In this work, we detail our global fit algorithm, called ``Erebor,'' designed to accomplish this challenging task. It is capable of analysing current state-of-the-art datasets and then growing into the future as more pieces of the pipeline are completed and added. We describe our pipeline strategy, the algorithmic setup, and the results from our analysis of the LDC2A Sangria dataset, which contains Massive Black Hole Binaries, compact Galactic Binaries, and a parameterized noise spectrum whose parameters are unknown to the user. The Erebor algorithm includes three unique and very useful contributions: GPU acceleration for enhanced computational efficiency; ensemble MCMC sampling with multiple MCMC walkers per temperature for better mixing and parallelized sample creation; and special online updates to reversible-jump (or trans-dimensional) sampling distributions to ensure sampler mixing and accurate initial estimates for detectable sources in the data. We recover posterior distributions for all 15 (6) of the injected MBHBs in the LDC2A training (hidden) dataset. We catalog $\sim12000$ Galactic Binaries ($\sim8000$ as high confidence detections) for both the training and hidden datasets. All of the sources and their posterior distributions are provided in publicly available catalogs.</description>

      <title>Optimal reconstruction of the Hellings and Downs correlation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10968v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) detect gravitational waves (GWs) via the correlations they create in the arrival times of pulses from different pulsars. The mean correlation, a function of the angle between the directions to two pulsars, was predicted in 1983 by Hellings and Downs (HD). Observation of this angular pattern is crucial evidence that GWs are present, so PTAs "reconstruct the HD curve'' by estimating the correlation using pulsar pairs separated by similar angles. Several studies have examined the amount by which this curve is expected to differ from the HD mean. The variance arises because (a) a finite set of pulsars at specific sky locations is used, (b) the GW sources interfere, and (c) the data are contaminated by noise. Here, for a Gaussian ensemble of sources, we predict that variance by constructing an optimal estimator of the HD correlation, taking into account the pulsar sky locations and the frequency distribution of the GWs and the pulsar noise. The variance is a ratio: the numerator depends upon the pulsar sky locations, and the denominator is the (effective) number of frequency bins for which the GW signal dominates the noise. In effect, after suitable combination, each such frequency bin gives an independent estimate of the HD correlation.</description>

      <title>On the maximally symmetric vacua of generic Lovelock gravities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08094v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We survey elementary features of Lovelock gravity and its maximally symmetric vacuum solutions. The latter is solely determined by the real roots of a dimension-dependent polynomial. We also recover the static spherically symmetric (black hole) solutions of Lovelock gravity using Palais' symmetric criticality principle. We show how to linearize the generic field equations of Lovelock models about a given maximally symmetric vacuum, which turns out to factorize into the product of yet another dimension-dependent polynomial and the linearized Einstein tensor about the relevant background. We also describe how to compute conserved charges using linearized field equations along with the relevant background Killing isometries. We further describe and discuss the special vacua which are defined by the simultaneous vanishing of the aforementioned polynomials.</description>

      <title>Probing dark-matter effects with gravitational waves using the parameterized post-Einsteinian framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A massive black hole can develop a dark-matter overdensity, and the dark matter changes the evolution of a stellar-mass compact object inspiraling around the massive black hole through the dense dark-matter environment. Specifically, dynamical friction speeds up the inspiral of the compact object and causes feedback on the dark-matter distribution. These intermediate mass-ratio inspirals with dark matter are a source of gravitational waves (GWs), and the waves can dephase significantly from an equivalent system in vacuum. Prior work has shown that this dephasing needs to be modeled to detect the GWs from these systems with LISA (the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna); it also showed that the density and distribution of dark matter can be inferred from a GW measurement. In this paper, we study whether the parametrized post-Einsteinian (ppE) framework can be used to infer the presence of dark matter in these systems. We confirm that if vacuum waveform templates are used to model the GWs from an inspiral in a dark-matter halo, then the resulting parameter estimation is biased. We then apply the ppE framework to determine whether it can reduce the parameter-estimation biases, and we find that adding one ppE phase term to a waveform template eliminates the parameter-estimation biases (statistical errors become larger than the systematic ones), but the effective post-Newtonian order in the ppE framework must be specified without uncertainties. When the post-Newtonian order has uncertainty, we find that the systematic errors on the ppE and the binary's parameters exceed the statistical errors. Thus, the simplest ppE framework would not give unbiased results for these systems, and a further extension of it, or dedicated parameter estimation with gravitational waveforms that include dark-matter effects would be needed.</description>

      <title>Analytic weak-signal approximation of the Bayes factor for continuous gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the targeted $\mathcal{B}$-statistic for continuous gravitational waves by modeling the $h_0$-prior as a half-Gaussian distribution with scale parameter $H$. This approach retains analytic tractability for two of the four amplitude marginalization integrals and recovers the standard $\mathcal{B}$-statistic in the strong-signal limit ($H\rightarrow\infty$). By Taylor-expanding the weak-signal regime ($H\rightarrow0$), the new prior enables fully analytic amplitude marginalization, resulting in a simple, explicit statistic that is as computationally efficient as the maximum-likelihood $\mathcal{F}$-statistic, but significantly more robust. Numerical tests show that for day-long coherent searches, the weak-signal Bayes factor achieves sensitivities comparable to the $\mathcal{F}$-statistic, though marginally lower than the standard $\mathcal{B}$-statistic (and the Bero-Whelan approximation). In semi-coherent searches over short (compared to a day) segments, this approximation matches or outperforms the weighted dominant-response $\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{ABw}}$-statistic and returns to the sensitivity of the (weighted) $\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{w}}$-statistic for longer segments. Overall the new Bayes-factor approximation demonstrates state-of-the-art or improved sensitivity across a wide range of segment lengths we tested (from 900s to 10days).</description>

      <title>Constraints on electrophilic scalar coupling from rotating magnetized stars and effects of cosmic neutrino background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An ultralight electrophilic scalar field can produce a long-range Yukawa-like spatial profile around a rotating, magnetized star when coupled to the constant number density of electrons in either the magnetosphere or the star itself. This long-range scalar field generates an effective scalar charge in the star or its magnetosphere, leading to a long-range force between two compact stars in a binary system. The electrophilic scalar can also radiate from isolated pulsars or double pulsar binary systems. Using the Crab pulsar and PSR J0737-3039A/B as test cases, we derive constraints on the scalar-electron coupling by analyzing observations of long-range force, orbital period decay in binary systems, and pulsar spin-down rates. Among these, the most stringent limits on the coupling are obtained from the orbital period decay. However, these constraints can be significantly reduced if the scalar interacts with the pervasive cosmic neutrino background. Enhancing experimental sensitivity and studying compact objects with stronger magnetic fields and higher angular velocities could further strengthen these bounds.</description>

      <title>Accurate Standard Siren Cosmology with Joint Gravitational-Wave and $\gamma$-Ray Burst Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Joint gravitational-wave (GW) and $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) observations are among the best prospects for standard siren cosmology. However, the strong selection effect for the coincident GRB detection, which is possible only for sources with small inclination angles, induces a systematic uncertainty that is currently not accounted for. We show that this severe source of bias can be removed by inferring the \emph{a priori} unknown electromagnetic detection probability directly from multimessenger data. This leads at the same time to an unbiased measurement of the Hubble constant, to constrain the properties of GRB emission, and to accurately measure the viewing angle of each source. Our inference scheme is applicable to real data already in the small-statistics regime, a scenario that might become reality in the near future. Additionally, we introduce a novel likelihood approximant for GW events which treats the dependence on distance and inclination as exact.</description>

      <title>Information content in anisotropic cosmological fields: Impact of different multipole expansion scheme for galaxy density and ellipticity correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multipole expansions have been often used for extracting cosmological information from anisotropic quantities in observation. However, which basis of the expansion is best suited to quantify the anisotropies is not a trivial question in any summary statistics. In this paper, using the Fisher matrix formalism, we investigate the information content in multipole moments of the power spectra of galaxy density and intrinsic ellipticity fields in linear theory from the Alcock-Paczynski effect and redshift-space distortions (RSD). We consider two expansion schemes, the associated Legendre basis as well as the standard Legendre basis conventionally used in literature. We find that the information in the multipoles of the intrinsic alignment (IA) power spectra in the associated Legendre basis converges more slowly to that in the full 2D power spectra than in the Legendre basis. This trend is particularly significant when we consider a high number density sample. In this high number density case, we show that the errors on the Hubble parameter obtained from the multipoles of the IA cross- and auto-power spectra in the associated Legendre basis are respectively about $6 \%$ and $10 \%$ larger than the full 2D case even when we use multipoles up to $\ell = 6$. Our results demonstrate that the choice of basis is arbitrary but changes the information content encoded in multipoles depending on the sample and statistics under consideration.</description>

      <title>Holographic complexity and residual entropy of a rotating BTZ black hole within Horndeski gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work explores the holographic complexity and residual entropy of a rotating BTZ black hole within the framework of Horndeski gravity. The investigation is motivated by the need to understand the emission of information from black holes, as encoded by quantum complexity, which persists even at zero temperature. Traditionally, black holes are considered to cease emitting information upon reaching zero temperature, yet our findings suggest a minimum level of information or minimal entropy. This challenges the classical notion of black hole death. Recent studies in the context of Horndeski gravity and the AdS/BCFT correspondence have identified a non-zero minimal entropy at zero temperature. Our work shows that complexity and entropy provide crucial insights into the information emission from black holes, extending beyond their classical death. These findings significantly affect our understanding of black hole thermodynamics and quantum information theory.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric late-time expansion history reconstruction and implications for the Hubble tension in light of recent DESI and type Ia supernovae data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02365v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We nonparametrically reconstruct the late-time expansion history in light of the latest Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from DESI combined with various Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) catalogs, using interpolation through piece-wise natural cubic splines, and a reconstruction procedure based on Gaussian Processes (GPs). Applied to DESI BAO and PantheonPlus SNeIa data, both methods indicate that deviations from a reference $\Lambda$CDM model in the $z \lesssim 2$ unnormalized expansion rate $E(z)$ are constrained to be $\lesssim 10\%$, but also consistently identify two features in $E(z)$: a bump at $z \sim 0.5$, and a depression at $z \sim 0.9$, which cannot be simultaneously captured by a $w_0w_a$CDM fit. These features, which are stable against assumptions regarding spatial curvature, interpolation knots, and GP kernel, disappear if one adopts the older SDSS BAO measurements in place of DESI, and decrease in significance when replacing the PantheonPlus catalog with the Union3 and DESY5 ones. We infer $c/(r_dH_0)=29.90 \pm 0.33$, with $r_d$ the sound horizon at baryon drag and $H_0$ the Hubble constant. Breaking the $r_d$-$H_0$ degeneracy with the SH0ES prior on $H_0$, the significance of the tension between our nonparametric determination of $r_d=136.20^{+2.20}_{-2.40}\,{\text{Mpc}}$ and the \textit{Planck} $\Lambda$CDM-based determination is at the $5\sigma$ level, slightly lower than the $6\sigma$ obtained when adopting the older SDSS dataset in place of DESI. This indicates the persistence at very high significance of the ``sound horizon tension'', reinforcing the need for pre-recombination new physics. If substantiated in forthcoming data releases, our results tentatively point to oscillatory/nonmonotonic features in the shape of the expansion rate at $z \lesssim 2$, of potential interest for dark energy model-building.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04530v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hubble tension is inherently multidimensional, and bears important implications for parameters beyond $H_0$. We discuss the key role of the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$ and the physical cold dark matter density $\omega_c$. We argue that once $\Omega_m$ and the physical baryon density $\omega_b$ are calibrated, through Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and/or Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) for $\Omega_m$, and via Big Bang Nucleosynthesis for $\omega_b$, any model raising $H_0$ requires raising $\omega_c$ and, under minimal assumptions, also the clustering parameter $S_8$. We explicitly verify that this behaviour holds when analyzing recent BAO and SNeIa data. We argue that a calibration of $\Omega_m$ as reliable and model-independent as possible should be a priority in the Hubble tension discussion, and an interesting possibility in this sense could be represented by galaxy cluster gas mass fraction measurements.</description>

      <title>Breaking the cosmological invariance of the dark matter halos shape as a new probe of modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08597v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper, Alimi &amp; Koskas highlighted in $w$CDM models derived from general relativity (GR) (with Dark Energy Universe numerical simulation data), a cosmological invariance of the distribution of dark-matter (DM) halo shapes when expressed in terms of the nonlinear fluctuations of the cosmic matter field. This paper shows that this invariance persists when tested on numerical simulations performed with a different N-body solver, and that it is also robust to adding massive neutrinos to the cold DM component. However, this discovery raises crucial questions about the validity of this invariance in MG models. Thus, we examined whether the invariance observed by Alimi &amp; Koskas remains robust in the case of Hu &amp; Sawicki model using DUSTGRAIN-pathfinder numerical simulations. By comparing the results of advanced numerical simulations in these different theoretical frameworks, we found significant deviations from the invariance observed in the framework of $w$CDM models of GR. These deviations suggest that the gravitation's nature significantly influences the DM halos' shape. We then interpreted this departure from the GR models' invariance as a manifestation of the scalar-field screening effect corresponding to such $f(R)$-type theories. This one modifies the sphericization process of DM halos during their formation, precisely because the critical mass at which this scalar field becomes non-negligible is the mass at which the deviation appears. To this extent, the departure from cosmological invariance in DM halos' shape is a cosmological probe of the nature of gravity, and the mass scale at which it appears can be used to estimate the $f_{R0}$ parameter of such theories.</description>

      <title>High-redshift cosmography with a possible cosmic distance duality relation violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we used geometric distances at high redshifts (both luminosity and angular) to perform a cosmographic analysis with the Pad\'e method, which stabilizes the behaviour of the cosmographic series in this redshift regime. However, in our analyses, we did not assume the validity of the Cosmic Distance Duality Relation (CDDR), but allowed for potential violations, such as $d_L(z) = \eta(z)(1+z)^2d_A(z)$, where three different functional forms of $\eta(z)$ are considered. By incorporating updated data from supernovae (SN), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and cosmic chronometers (CC), we obtained observational constraints on cosmographic models alongside possible CDDR violations. Interestingly, we found that potential CDDR violations introduce new statistical correlations among cosmographic parameters such as $H_0$, $q_0$, and $j_0$. Nonetheless, within this framework, we did not observe significant deviations from the CDDR, and our results remain consistent with the predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM model. In the same time, this work provides a novel and straightforward method for testing the CDDR by fixing the background evolution through cosmographic techniques, paving the way for new geometric observational tests of possible deviations from standard cosmology.</description>

Abstract: Our paper introduces a new theoretical framework called the Fractional Einstein--Gauss--Bonnet scalar field cosmology, which has important physical implications. Using fractional calculus to modify the gravitational action integral, we derived a modified Friedmann equation and a modified Klein--Gordon equation. Our research reveals non-trivial solutions associated with exponential potential, exponential couplings to the Gauss--Bonnet term, and a logarithmic scalar field, which are dependent on two cosmological parameters, $m$ and $\alpha_{0}=t_{0}H_{0}$ and the fractional derivative order $\mu$. By employing linear stability theory, we reveal the phase space structure and analyze the dynamic effects of the Gauss--Bonnet couplings. The scaling behavior at some equilibrium points reveals that the geometric corrections in the coupling to the Gauss--Bonnet scalar can mimic the behavior of the dark sector in modified gravity. Using data from cosmic chronometers, type Ia supernovae, supermassive Black Hole Shadows, and strong gravitational lensing, we estimated the values of $m$ and $\alpha_{0}$, indicating that the solution is consistent with an accelerated expansion at late times with the values $\alpha_0=1.38\pm 0.05$, $m=1.44\pm 0.05$, and $\mu=1.48 \pm 0.17$ (consistent with $\Omega_{m,0}=0.311\pm 0.016$ and $h=0.712\pm 0.007$), resulting in an age of the Universe $t_{0}=19.0\pm 0.7$ [Gyr] at 1$\sigma$ CL. Ultimately, we obtained late-time accelerating power-law solutions supported by the most recent cosmological data, and we proposed an alternative explanation for the origin of cosmic acceleration other than $\Lambda$CDM. Our results generalize and significantly improve previous achievements in the literature, highlighting the practical implications of fractional calculus in cosmology.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of charged spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles in superposed states minimally coupled to electromagnetism in curved spacetime within the WKB approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the curved-spacetime dynamics of charged spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles minimally coupled to the electromagnetic field and propagating in superposed states of different masses. For that purpose, we make use of a Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation of the Dirac equation with a minimal coupling to the Maxwell field in curved spacetime. We obtain the spin dynamics as well as the deviation from geodesic motion of such particles. The problem of having the mass eigenstates experience different proper times, as opposed to the case of neutral particles, is here dealt with by first extracting the second-order differential equation obeyed by each superposition. This strategy proves to be not only powerful, but also very economical.</description>

      <title>Do Observations Prefer Thawing Quintessence?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In light of recent observations, we study evidence for thawing quintessence over a cosmological constant as dark energy, with emphasis on the effect of the choice of priors. Working with a parametrization for the equation of state parameter motivated by the theory, we find a preference for thawing quintessence compared to a bare cosmological constant only if we use priors which are heavily informed by the data itself. If we extend the priors to physically better motivated ranges, the evidence for thawing quintessence disappears.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Supersymmetry via the Dressing Field Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unconventional supersymmetry is a proposal, introduced by Alvarez-Valenzuela-Zanelli (AVZ), aiming to use the framework of supersymmetric field theory to describe fermionic matter fields and bosonic gauge fields in a unified way, as both parts of a single superconnection. It hinges upon the so-called matter ansatz. Unfortunately, the formal and conceptual status of the ansatz remained unclear, preventing unconventional supersymmetry to be used in a principled way as a general approach beyond the model in which it was first considered. In this letter, we lift this restriction by showing that the ansatz is a special case of the Dressing Field Method, a new systematic tool to exhibit the gauge-invariant content of general-relativistic gauge field theories.</description>
