      <title>Equivalence of stationary dynamical solutions in a directed chain and a Delay Differential Equation of neuroscientific relevance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While synchronized states, and the dynamical pathways through which they emerge, are often regarded as the paradigm to understand the dynamics of information spreading on undirected networks of nonlinear dynamical systems, when we consider directed network architectures, dynamical stationary states can arise. To study this phenomenon we consider the simplest directed network, a single cycle, and excitable FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) neurons. We show numerically that a stationary dynamical state emerges in the form of a self-sustained traveling wave, through a saddle-point bifurcation of limit cycles that does not destabilize the global fixed point of the system. We then formulate an effective model for the dynamical steady state of the cycle in terms of a single-neuron Delay Differential Equation (DDE) featuring an explicitly delayed feedback, demonstrating numerically the possibility of mapping stationary solutions between the two models. The DDE based model is shown to reproduce the entire bifurcation, which also in this case does not destabilize the global fixed point, even though global properties differ in general between the systems. The discrete nature of the cycle graph is revealed as the origin of these coordinated states by the parametric analysis of solutions, and the DDE effective model is shown to preserve this feature accurately. Finally, the scaling of the inter-site propagation times hints to a solitonic nature of the wave state in the limit of large chain size.</description>

      <title>Solving Inverse Problems in Stochastic Self-Organising Systems through Invariant Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-organising systems demonstrate how simple local rules can generate complex stochastic patterns. Many natural systems rely on such dynamics, making self-organisation central to understanding natural complexity. A fundamental challenge in modelling such systems is solving the inverse problem: finding the unknown causal parameters from macroscopic observations. This task becomes particularly difficult when observations have a strong stochastic component, yielding diverse yet equivalent patterns. Traditional inverse methods fail in this setting, as pixel-wise metrics cannot capture feature similarities between variable outcomes. In this work, we introduce a novel inverse modelling method specifically designed to handle stochasticity in the observable space, leveraging the capacity of visual embeddings to produce robust representations that capture perceptual invariances. By mapping the pattern representations onto an invariant embedding space, we can effectively recover unknown causal parameters without the need for handcrafted objective functions or heuristics. We evaluate the method on two canonical models--a reaction-diffusion system and an agent-based model of social segregation--and show that it reliably recovers parameters despite stochasticity in the outcomes. We further apply the method to real biological patterns, highlighting its potential as a tool for both theorists and experimentalists to investigate the dynamics underlying complex stochastic pattern formation.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Constrained Noise Yields Superdiffusive Dynamics in Axonal Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a coarse-grained stochastic model for axonal extension on periodic arrays of parallel micropatterns that integrates three key biophysical mechanisms: (i) the molecular clutch that couples actin retrograde flow to substrate adhesions, (ii) an active biopolymer-based mechanism generating traction-force fluctuations, and (iii) the mechanical interaction of the growth cone with the micropatterned substrate. Using the Shannon-Jaynes maximum entropy principle with constraints derived from experimental observations, we derive a unique probability distribution for the colored acceleration noise that enters the Langevin equation. The resulting stationary process exhibits power-law temporal correlations with negative exponent, which accounts for the observed superdiffusive dynamics of axons. For biologically relevant parameters the model predicts this exponent to be -1/2, in close quantitative agreement with measurements of cortical neurons cultured on patterned substrates.</description>
