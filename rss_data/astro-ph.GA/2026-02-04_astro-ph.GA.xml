      <title>WLM: Dynamics of an isolated Dwarf Irregular Galaxy Under Ram Pressure in the Local Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WLM is an archetypal dwarf irregular galaxy that has not experienced interactions with major Local Group galaxies within the past 8 Gyr. It has recently been shown that WLM is losing its gas due to ram pressure forces exerted by the surrounding intergalactic medium (IGM). In this work, we explore how ram pressure may also affect the WLM gas kinematics, and we show that its dynamics is especially perturbed at its outskirts, explaining the asymmetric rotation between the approaching and receding sides. Moreover, we have been able to decompose WLM in two main components, a compact one with a solid-body rotation that resembles a bar-like structure, and a more extended one with a characteristic double-horn profile suggesting an edge-on disk. The former is relatively unaffected by ram pressure while the latter has its dynamics considerably affected by ram pressure. This study shows that mass estimates of a dwarf galaxy like WLM should account for a full modeling of its dynamical components, especially accounting for its asymmetric rotation curve.</description>

      <title>The Rhythm of the ISM: Tracing the Timescales of Gas Evolution and Star Formation across Galactic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the physical origin of the star formation scaling relations between the gas depletion time, the star-forming gas mass fraction, and the gas surface density, $\Sigma_{\rm gas}$, on kiloparsec scales, all of which are the key ingredients of the observed Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. To elucidate these trends, we employ an analytical framework that explicitly connects these kiloparsec-scale properties to the timescales governing the rapid, continuous ISM gas cycle on the scales of individual star-forming regions, including the formation, dispersal, and local depletion of star-forming gas. Using a suite of idealized disk galaxy simulations spanning a range of environments from dwarf and Milky Way-mass systems to a gas-rich starburst analog, we measure the timescales of the gas cycle and relate them to the dynamical and turbulent properties of the interstellar medium (ISM). We find that star-forming regions form on a timescale close to the vertical turbulent crossing time of the galactic disk, $\sim$3-30 Myr, which decreases at higher $\Sigma_{\rm gas}$ due to the increase in turbulent velocities in the ISM and the decrease in the disk thickness. In contrast, the local star formation and dispersal of such gas are set by the local conditions. Specifically, the local depletion time, $\sim$200-2000 Myr, is decreasing at higher $\Sigma_{\rm gas}$, as star-forming gas becomes denser and more efficient in forming stars. The lifetime of such gas is very short, $\sim$0.4-1 Myr, and only weakly increases with $\Sigma_{\rm gas}$. Together, our results demonstrate how the star formation properties of galaxies on kiloparsec scales emerge directly from the interplay between the galaxy-scale dynamics, ISM turbulence, and the state of star-forming gas.</description>

      <title>Cosmic CO and [CII] backgrounds and the fueling of star formation over 12 Gyr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular gas, modest in mass yet pivotal within the cosmic inventory, regulates baryon cycling as the immediate fuel for star formation. Across most of cosmic history, its reservoir has remained elusive, with only the tip of the iceberg revealed by luminous carbon monoxide (CO) emitting galaxies. Here we report the first detections of the mean cosmic CO background across its rotational ladder at 7$\sigma$, together with ionized carbon ([CII]) at 3$\sigma$, over $0&lt;z&lt;4.2$. This uses tomographic clustering of diffuse broadband intensities with reference galaxies, directly probing aggregate emission in the cosmic web. From CO(1-0) we infer the total molecular gas density, $\Omega_{\rm H_2}$, finding it about twice that resolved in galaxy surveys. The global depletion time is $\sim$1 Gyr, shorter than the Hubble time, requiring sustained inflow. CO excitation links to star-formation surface density and, with depletion time, yields a super-linear Kennicutt-Schmidt law that appears universal. Together these results establish a global picture of galaxy growth fueled by a larger, short-lived molecular reservoir. The CO and [CII] detections mark a turning point for line-intensity mapping, replacing forecasts with empirical line strengths and defining sensitivity requirements for upcoming 3D experiments poised to open new windows on galaxy formation and cosmology.</description>

      <title>IRS 9: The Case for a Dynamically-Ejected Star from the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring stellar motions at the Milky Way's Galactic center (GC) provides unique insight into the dynamical processes within galactic nuclei. We present proper motion measurements for 23 SiO-maser emitting stars within 45'' of SgrA*, including four previously reported to have velocities exceeding their local escape velocities (i.e., they are "locally unbound" from the GC). Derived from 14 epochs of HST WFC3-IR observations (2010 - 2023), our measurements have a median precision of 0.038 mas/yr - up to ~100x more precise then previous constraints for some sources. By combining these proper motions with published radial velocities, we derive updated 3D velocities for the masers and find that only one is locally unbound (IRS 9; v3d = 370 +/- 1.2 km/s). Orbit integrations place the first constraints on the orbit of IRS 9, which is bound to the GC at larger radii with r_peri &gt;= 0.100 +/- 0.005 pc and r_apo &gt;= 5.25 +/- 0.18 pc. IRS 9's high velocity relative to stars at similar radii in the Nuclear Star Cluster makes it a candidate to have experienced a strong dynamical interaction in order to place it on its orbit. We explore the Hills mechanism as a possible origin, but binary evaporation and ejection velocity limits indicate that IRS 9 is unlikely to have experienced such an event in the past 0.4 Myr (the timescale constrained by the orbit integrations). Alternative mechanisms that could produce IRS 9 include binary supernova disruption, two-body interactions, and stellar collisions. Identifying additional stars like IRS 9 will be essential for understanding these various dynamical processes.</description>

      <title>Structure and Evolution of Multi-Cluster within Galactic Disc: Gaia DR3 Insights into Eight Open Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of the structural, astrophysical, and dynamical properties of eight open clusters: NGC 559, NGC 1817, NGC 2141, NGC 7245, Ruprecht 15, Ruprecht 137, Ruprecht 142, and Ruprecht 169, using precise astrometric and photometric data from Gaia Data Release 3. By fitting the King model to the radial density profiles, we determined the structural parameters of the clusters, including core and limiting radii, which were found to range from 3.07 to 16.21 arcmin and from 9.97 to 25.97 arcmin, respectively. Fundamental astrophysical parameters were derived by fitting PARSEC isochrones to the colour-magnitude diagrams. The results show that the clusters have logarithmic ages between 7.95 and 9.34, metallicities in the range 0.007 to 0.015, and heliocentric distances between 1640 and 5203 pc. The total stellar masses of the clusters were estimated to lie between 257 and 1916 solar masses. For most of the clusters, the mass function slopes are consistent with the Salpeter initial mass function. Our dynamical analysis indicates that all clusters, except Ruprecht 15, are dynamically relaxed. In addition, the spatial distribution and the bimodal structure observed in the radial density profile of NGC 7245 provide strong evidence that this object is a binary cluster candidate. Finally, kinematic analysis and orbit integrations demonstrate that all clusters exhibit dynamical properties fully consistent with membership in the Galactic thin disc.</description>

      <title>Overview of The SDSS-V Magellanic Genesis Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sloan Digital Sky Survey-V (SDSS-V) Magellanic Genesis survey is a spectroscopic program designed to map the kinematic and chemical structure of the Magellanic Clouds using APOGEE and BOSS spectroscopy. This overview describes the survey's design, target selection, and science goals, and highlights some first results using these data. In the inner regions of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC), the survey obtained high-resolution near-infrared APOGEE spectra (S/N~45) of ~14,000 bright, oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB-O) stars. These data provide contiguous spatial coverage of the Clouds' main bodies, enabling detailed chemo-dynamical studies. To explore extended structures, the survey includes BOSS optical spectroscopy of fainter red giant (RG) stars selected with \gaia~DR3 data, reaching G~17.5. Many of these targets extend to the outer regions of the Clouds, which are known to span ~20 deg (LMC) and ~12 deg(SMC) and contain diffuse substructures of unclear origin. BOSS data in the inner regions also complement APOGEE by providing elements inaccessible in the near-infrared and enabling cross-calibration between instruments. The survey further includes APOGEE and BOSS observations of ~300 evolved massive stars and a small sample of symbiotic binaries previously observed by APOGEE-1 and -2, enhancing our understanding of massive stellar evolution and complementing the SDSS-V main-sequence massive star program.</description>

      <title>Connecting the Dots: UV-Bright Companions of Little Red Dots as Lyman-Werner Sources Enabling Direct Collapse Black Hole Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compile a sample of 83 Little Red Dots (LRDs) with JWST imaging and find that a substantial fraction ($\sim$43%, rising to $\gtrsim$85% for the most luminous LRDs) host one or more spatially offset, UV-bright companions at projected separations of $0.5\rm \, kpc \lesssim d\lesssim 5 \rm \,kpc$, with median of $\langle d \rangle = 1.0\,\mathrm{kpc}$. This fraction is even higher when smaller spatial scales are probed at high S/N ratio: we show that the two most strongly lensed LRDs known to date, A383-LRD and the newly discovered A68-LRD, both have UV-bright companions at separations of only $d\sim0.3$ kpc, below the resolution limit of most unlensed JWST samples. We explore whether these ubiquitous red/blue configurations may be physically linked to the formation of LRDs, in analogy with the "synchronized pair" scenario originally proposed for direct-collapse black hole formation. In this picture, ultraviolet radiation from the companions, which typically have modest stellar masses ($M_\ast \sim 10^{8-9}M_\odot$), suppresses molecular hydrogen cooling in nearby gas, allowing nearly isothermal collapse and the formation of extremely compact objects, such as massive black holes or quasi-stars. Using component-resolved photometry and SED modeling, we infer Lyman-Werner radiation fields of $J_{21,LW} \sim 10^{2.5}$-$10^{5}$ at the locations of the red components, comparable to those required in direct-collapse models, suggesting that the necessary photodissociation conditions are realized in many LRD systems. This framework provides a simple and self-consistent explanation for the extreme compactness and distinctive spectral properties of LRDs, and links long-standing theoretical models for early compact object formation directly to a population now observed with JWST in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Search for Faint Lone Double-Peaked H$\alpha$ Lines as IMBH Signatures in the MUSE Deep Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double-peaked H$\alpha$ emission profiles can serve as potential signatures of accreting intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), particularly those residing outside galactic nuclei. Such features are expected to arise from rotating disk-like structures around black holes and can be used to identify elusive IMBH candidates. \citet{Almeida2022ApJ...934..100S} reported a sample of such double-peaked H$\alpha$ sources in the MUSE-Wide survey, interpreting them as potential signatures of wandering IMBHs after systematically excluding alternative explanations. Their method relied on constructing H$\alpha$ maps around central galaxies and visually identifying compact emission clumps in the surrounding halo regions. In this work, we revisit the analysis using the deeper MUSE Extremely Deep Field (MXDF) data and an automated detection algorithm tailored to identify such features. However, we do not recover any candidate population in MXDF, resulting in a null detection. This outcome is nevertheless informative, as it (1) highlights the inherent challenges in detecting IMBHs, and (2) demonstrates the potential of automated approaches for future systematic searches, even though it did not yield a positive outcome in this case.</description>

      <title>Probing The Dark Matter Halo of High-redshift Quasar from Wide-Field Clustering Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-redshift quasars have been an excellent tracer to study the astrophysics and cosmology at early Universe. Using 216,949 high-redshift quasar candidates ($5.0 \leq z &lt; 6.3$) selected via machine learning from the Legacy Survey Data Release 9 and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, we perform wide-field clustering analysis to investigate the large-scale environment of those high-redshift quasars. We construct the projected auto correlation function of those high-redshift quasars that is weighted by its predicted probability of being a true high-redshift quasar, from which we derive the bias parameter and the typical dark matter halo mass of those quasars. The dark matter halo mass of quasars estimated from the projected auto correlation function is $\log(M_h/M_{\odot})=12.2 ^{+0.2}_{-0.7}$ ($11.9^{+0.3}_{-0.7}$), with the bias parameter $b$ of $12.34 ^{+4.26}_{-4.37}$ ($11.52^{+4.02}_{-4.14}$) for the redshift interval of $5.0 \leq z &lt;5.7$ ($5.7 \leq z &lt;6.3$). Our results, combined with other measurements of dark matter halo masses for quasars or active galactic nucleus which obtain a lower dark matter halo mass of $\sim 10^{11.5}$ M$_\odot$ at similar redshift, suggest a more complex, and possibly non-monotonic evolution of quasar hosting dark matter halo. Moreover, we estimate the duty cycle of those quasars, which is $0.008^{+0.135}_{-0.007}$ ($0.003+^{+0.047}_{-0.003}$) for the redshift interval of $5.0 \leq z &lt;5.7$ ($5.7 \leq z &lt;6.3$).</description>

      <title>Molecular Gas Morphological Analogues for the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complete catalogs of molecular clouds in the Milky Way allow analysis of the molecular medium and the star formation properties of the Milky Way that closely follows the method used for nearby galaxies. We explore whether the big dip in the radial distribution of molecular gas in the Milky Way is peculiar and find several other galaxies with similar patterns, all with similar morphological classifications of YClxxGnR, indicating a clearly defined, long bar leading to a grand-design spiral. This category is fairly rare among galaxies in the PHANGS sample, but all galaxies with this classification have some evidence for dips in the radial distribution of CO emission. The lengths of the bars correlate with the extents of the dips. The Milky Way and the other galaxies with dips have similar stellar masses and star formation rates, both lying near the high ends of the distributions for all PHANGS galaxies.</description>

      <title>The approximate gravitational lensing multiple plane mass sheet degeneracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing has to deal with many modeling degeneracies, the most notable being the Mass Sheet Degeneracy (MSD). We review the MSD when one needs to model more lens planes, each one with an internal mass sheet. We take into account the non-linear lens-lens coupling and line of sight effects, the latter treated as external mass sheets with associated shear. If second order shear terms on external and internal mass sheets can be neglected, we show that the MSD is always retained, and the mass sheets influence can be reabsorbed in the redefinition of angular diameter distances. In particular, internal and external mass sheets can be placed on the same footing. The version of the MSD discussed here does not require any particular relation between the internal mass sheets in the different planes. Even when including time delays from all sources, a residual degeneracy involving time delays, mass sheets and $ H_0 $ remains. We develop a framework which shows what can actually be constrained in multiple plane lens systems.</description>

      <title>Inferring Interstellar Medium Density, Temperature, and Metallicity from Turbulent H II Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable nebular emission line diagnostics are essential for accurately inferring the physical properties (e.g. electron temperature, density, pressure, and metallicity) of H II regions from spectra. When interpreting spectra, it is typical to adopt a single zone model, e.g. at fixed density, pressure, or temperature, to infer H II region properties. However, such an assumption may not fully capture the complexities of a turbulent interstellar medium. To understand how a complex density field driven by supersonic turbulence impacts nebular emission lines, we simulate 3D H II regions surrounding a single O star, both with and without supersonic turbulence. We find that turbulence directly impacts the values of common strong line ratios. For example turbulent H II regions exhibit systematically higher [N II]/H$\alpha$, lower [O III]/H$\beta$, and lower O32, compared to homogeneous H II regions with the same mean density and ionizing source. These biases can impact inferences of metallicity, ionization parameter, excitation, and ionization source. For our choice of turbulence, direct $T_e$ method metallicity inferences are biased low, by up to 0.1 dex, which is important for metallicity studies, but not enough to explain the abundance discrepancy problem. Finally, we show that large differences between measured electron densities emerge between infrared, optical, and UV density indicators. Our results motivate the need for large grids of turbulent H II regions models that span the range of conditions seen at both high and low redshift to better interpret observed spectra.</description>

Abstract: We present a deep photometric study of the globular cluster NGC 5466 and its tidal stream using Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) imaging with the metallicity-sensitive narrowband filter NB395. We develop an improved member-selection technique based on a k-nearest neighbor algorithm applied to the color-color-magnitude diagram (CCMD), enabling reliable candidate identification down to $i_{2,0} &lt; 23.5$. Photometric metallicities derived from NB395 colors agree with previous measurements, supporting the robustness of our calibration. While modest residual contamination and possible offsets - potentially driven by variations in light-element abundances - may remain beyond 10 arcmin, the metallicity distribution of high-probability inner members matches the known mean metallicity of NGC 5466, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method. The spatial distribution of NB395-selected stars clearly delineates the tidal stream. Beyond the tidal radius, the azimuthally averaged radial surface density profile follows a power law with slope $\alpha = -4.53_{-0.14}^{+0.13}$. We also detect a power-law component perpendicular to the stream, suggestive of multiple apogalactic passages. A density gap is identified at a projected distance of $\sim200$ pc from the cluster center, consistent with eTidal N-body predictions and possibly associated with a recent pericentric passage or Galactic disk interaction. Analysis of the main-sequence mass function reveals a strong negative radial gradient in the slope within the tidal radius, whereas the slope along the outer stream is relatively flat, consistent with preferential tidal stripping of low-mass stars. These results highlight the power of HSC/NB395 photometry for identifying metal-poor populations and deriving photometric metallicities, underscoring its value for future wide-field surveys.</description>

      <title>From Grism to IFU: Revising the Redshift and Nature of the Massive Dusty Galaxy S1 with JWST and ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a revised spectroscopic redshift for the dusty massive galaxy S1, previously inferred with an exceptionally high baryon-to-star conversion efficiency from NIRCam slitless grism data at $z_{\rm grism}=5.58$. Our new JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations reveal multiple rest-frame optical and NIR emission lines, yielding a secure spectroscopic redshift of $z_{\rm spec}=3.2439\pm0.0002$. We show that the earlier grism-based redshift resulted from contamination by a nearby galaxy whose dispersed spectral trace overlaps with S1, illustrating a known challenge of slitless spectroscopy when only a single dispersion angle and single emission feature are available. In addition, we present new ALMA 1 mm observations, which robustly detect dust emission ($S_{\rm 1mm}=0.99\pm0.03$ mJy) and show a dust half-light radius ($R_{\rm e,1mm}=0.73\pm0.10$ kpc) slightly smaller than the stellar size ($R_{\rm e, F444W} = 0.97\pm0.01$ kpc). Using the revised redshift and compiled multi-wavelength photometry, we update the UV-to-FIR SED and find that S1 is less extreme than previously inferred, yet remains a very massive (log$M_{\star}/M_{\odot}\sim10.6$), heavily obscured star-forming galaxy. The updated SED modeling reveals S1 to be a very dust- and gas-rich system with a moderate star formation rate and a long gas depletion time ($\tau_{\rm dep} \sim 1.4$ Gyr), deviating from SMGs and OFGs, but more closely resembling typical massive main-sequence galaxies. We note that, although this revision reduces the number of ultra-massive galaxies reported in Xiao et al. 2024, it does not alter the main conclusions of that work. Overall, our study clarifies the nature of S1 and underscores the importance of multi-line spectroscopic confirmation, slitless observations at multiple position angles, and IFU data for robust redshift and physical characterization of rare massive galaxies in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>The SAMI Galaxy Survey: Quenching of Star Formation in Clusters III. Ram-Pressure-Affected Galaxy Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cluster environments influence galaxy evolution by curtailing star formation activity, notably through ram-pressure stripping (RPS). In this study, using spatially resolved spectroscopic data from the SAMI Galaxy Survey, we identify galaxies undergoing or recently affected by RPS in eight nearby clusters ($0.029 &lt; z &lt; 0.058$), through a visual classification scheme based on the ionised gas ($\rm H\alpha + [NII]\lambda 6584$) morphologies, split into unperturbed, asymmetric, and truncated. The projected phase-space analysis shows that asymmetric galaxies are found in a narrow region in cluster-centric distance ($\rm 0.1 &lt; R/R_{200} &lt; 0.6$) and have a larger dispersion in line-of-sight velocity ($\sigma(|v_{pec}|)_\mathrm{Asym} = 0.71^{+0.09}_{-0.07}\ \sigma_{200}$) compared to the truncated and unperturbed samples. In terms of star formation activity, RPS candidates yield a much steeper resolved star-forming main sequence (rSFMS; $\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR} - \Sigma_\ast$) relation compared to the unperturbed counterparts, primarily emerging from having lower $\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$ values for the low mass density regime, with the steepest gradient deriving from the truncated sample. Moreover, radial star formation profiles reveal that star formation in RPS candidates is suppressed in the outskirts relative to unperturbed galaxies and is more prominent for the truncated sample. In contrast, central ($\rm r/r_{eff}&lt;0.5$) star formation activity in RPS candidates is comparable with that in their unperturbed and field counterparts, suggesting no elevated activity. Taken together, this suggests an evolutionary trend linked to the RPS stage, where unperturbed galaxies likely represent recently accreted systems (pre-RPS), while asymmetric and truncated galaxies may correspond to populations undergoing RPS and post-RPS phases, respectively, favouring outside-in quenching.</description>

      <title>Digging into the chemical complexity in the outer Galaxy: A hot molecular core in Sharpless 2-283</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The outer Galaxy (galactocentric distance $\gtrsim$13.5 kpc) serves as an excellent laboratory for investigating the chemical complexity in low-metallicity environments. Here, we present the chemical analyses for the outer Galactic hot core Sh 2-283-1a SMM1 ($D_\mathrm{GC}$ = 15.7 kpc and $Z$ $\sim$0.3 $Z_\odot$), recently detected by Ikeda et al. (2025) using ALMA. Toward this source, a variety of molecular species, including complex organic molecules (COMs: CH$_3$OH, $^{13}$CH$_3$OH, CH$_2$DOH, and CH$_3$OCH$_3$) are detected. The molecular abundances relative to CH$_3$OH are similar to those of another outer Galactic hot core, demonstrating that chemically rich hot cores exist in different regions of the outer Galaxy. We also compared molecular abundances among hot cores in the inner Galaxy, outer Galaxy, and Magellanic Clouds. This comparison revealed that the metallicity-corrected $N$(SO$_2$)/$N$(H$_2$) ratios of outer Galactic hot cores are significantly lower than those of the inner Galactic ones, while their $N$(CH$_3$OH)/$N$(H$_2$) ratios are similar. The Magellanic hot cores show different trends despite having metallicities similar to those of the outer Galaxy, indicating that the chemical complexity of hot cores is governed by environmental conditions (e.g., cosmic ray intensity and dust temperature) rather than simple metallicity scaling. These environmental differences would also affect the production efficiency of COMs derived from CH$_3$OH, as the $N$(CH$_3$OCH$_3$)/$N$(CH$_3$OH) and $N$(C$_2$H$_5$OH)/$N$(CH$_3$OH) ratios in the outer Galactic sources are moderately lower than those of inner Galactic sources. The $N$(CH$_2$DOH)/$N$(CH$_3$OH) ratio of Sh 2-283-1a SMM1 is 1.5$^{+3.9}_{-1.2}$$\%$, comparable to that of inner Galactic high-mass sources.</description>

      <title>Convolutional Neural Networks for classifying galaxy mergers: Can faint tidal features aid in classifying mergers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying mergers from observational data has been a crucial aspect of studying galaxy evolution and formation. Tidal features, typically fainter than 26 ${\rm mag\,arcsec^{-2}}$, exhibit a diverse range of appearances depending on the merger characteristics and are expected to be investigated in greater detail with the Rubin Observatory Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), which will reveal the low surface brightness universe with unprecedented precision. Our goal is to assess the feasibility of developing a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can distinguish between mergers and non-mergers based on LSST-like deep images. To this end, we used Illustris TNG50, one of the highest-resolution cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to date, allowing us to generate LSST-like mock images with a depth $\sim$ 29 ${\rm mag\,arcsec^{-2}}$ for low-redshift ($z=0.16$) galaxies, with labeling based on their merger status as ground truth. We focused on 151 Milky Way-like galaxies in field environments, comprising 81 non-mergers and 70 mergers. After applying data augmentation and hyperparameter tuning, a CNN model was developed with an accuracy of 65--67\%. Through additional image processing, the model was further optimized, achieving an accuracy of 67--70\% when trained on images containing only faint features. This represents an improvement of $\sim$ 5\% compared to training on images with bright features only. This suggests that faint tidal features can serve as effective indicators for distinguishing between mergers and non-mergers. The future direction for further improvement based on this study is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Kinematic Signatures in the Stellar Halo from Cosmological Encounters between the Milky Way and its Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent theoretical and observational analysis of the interaction between the Milky Way (MW) and LMC suggest that it has a significant dynamical impact on the MW's stellar halo. We investigate this effect using simulations from the Latte project, a simulation suite from the Feedback In Realistic Environments 2 (FIRE-2) Project. By comparing simulations with and without an LMC-analog interaction, we show that fully cosmological LMC interactions create prominent velocity asymmetry in the stellar halo of the MW, resulting from both barycentric displacement (the "reflex motion") and the dynamical wake of the LMC. The strength and direction of this asymmetry depend on the mass ratio at pericenter and orbit of the LMC analog. We perform a spherical-harmonic decomposition of the velocities of halo star particles to confirm that the identified signatures are LMC-induced and persist even when LMC star particles are removed. We also show that this strategy separates and individually detects the dipole (l=1) of the global reflex motion and the quadrupole (l=2) of the local wake. These asymmetries are consistent with those identified in previous work using non-cosmological simulations; the dipole is easily distinguishable from other complex halo substructure using spherical harmonics while the quadrupole is sometimes confused. These findings support the detectability of MW--LMC interaction signatures in upcoming observational surveys of the MW stellar halo.</description>

      <title>Narrow absorption lines from intervening material in supernovae: III. Supernovae and their environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Narrow interstellar absorption features in supernova (SN) spectra serve as valuable diagnostics for probing dust extinction and the presence of circumstellar or interstellar material. In this third paper in a series, we investigate how the strength of narrow interstellar absorption lines in low-resolution spectra varies with SN type and host galaxy properties, both on local and global scales. Using a dataset of over 10000 spectra from $\sim1800$ low-redshift SNe, we find that Type Ia SNe (SNe Ia) in passive galaxies exhibit significantly weaker narrow absorption features compared to CC-SNe and SNe Ia in star-forming hosts (SNe Ia-SF), suggesting lower interstellar gas content in quiescent environments. Within the star-forming hosts, the Na I D equivalent-width distribution of SNe II is much lower than that of both SNe Ia-SF and stripped-envelope SNe (SE-SNe). This result is somewhat unexpected, since CC-SNe are generally associated with star-forming regions and occur deeper within galactic disks, where stronger line-of-sight extinction would be anticipated. This suggests that the observed behaviour cannot be explained solely by absorption from the integrated interstellar medium (ISM) along the line of sight. Instead, if part of the absorption arises from material near the explosion, the similarity between the Na I D EW distributions of SNe Ia-SF and SE-SNe implies that comparable absorption signatures can emerge from distinct progenitor pathways. Possible explanations include (a) circumstellar material (CSM) expelled by the progenitor system before explosion, or (b) interaction of SN radiation with nearby patchy ISM clouds. Our results highlight the diagnostic power of interstellar absorption features in revealing the diverse environments and progenitor pathways of SNe.</description>

      <title>Broadband infrared spectroscopy of methanol isotopologues in pure, H2O-rich, and CO-rich ice analogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deuterium fractionation is highly efficient during the early stages of star formation, particularly in starless and prestellar cores where temperatures are low (&lt;10 K) and molecular freeze-out onto dust grains is significant. Methanol forms early in these environments following CO freeze-out via successive hydrogenation reactions on grain surfaces, while the production of deuterated methanol requires elevated gas-phase D/H ratios generated through dissociative recombination of deuterated H3+. Consequently, large abundances of deuterated methanol are observed toward young stellar objects where prestellar ices have recently sublimated. Here, we present laboratory infrared spectra of methanol and its deuterated isotopologues in astrophysical ice analogues, complemented by anharmonic vibrational calculations used to guide band assignments. Experiments were performed at the CASICE laboratory using a Bruker Vertex 70v spectrometer coupled to a closed-cycle helium cryostat, with isotopologue ices deposited at 10 K under high-vacuum conditions. Infrared transmission spectra were recorded over 6000-30 cm-1 (1.67-333 um) and compared with spectra of pure isotopologue ices. Distinctive mid-infrared band patterns are identified for each deuterated species. In particular, CH2DOH exhibits a characteristic doublet at 1293 and 1326 cm-1 (7.73 and 7.54 um), while CHD2OH shows a similar doublet at 1301 and 1329 cm-1 (7.69 and 7.52 um), both remaining largely invariant across all studied ice mixtures. These robust spectral signatures provide reliable tracers for identifying deuterated methanol in JWST observations and for constraining astrochemical gas-grain models of deuterium enrichment prior to star and planet formation.</description>

      <title>JWST imaging of the Pleiades: anisotropy of turbulence in the cold neutral medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interstellar medium studies rely on magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence as a framework for interpretation. In this context, the statistical characterization of interstellar observations is of prime importance. We open a new perspective on diffuse interstellar matter by analyzing James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of the Pleiades nebula with NIRCam. These observations are remarkable in that they provide a microscope view at the cold neutral medium (CNM) with a spatial resolution of 0.2 mpc (40 au). A two-dimensional Fourier analysis is used to characterize the structure of PAH emission in regions near and far from the Pleiades star Merope. To produce maps of the interstellar emission, stars and galaxies are filtered out. The final step in the data cleaning involves subtracting a component, in Fourier space, which we infer to be a residual of the near-infrared cosmic background. The PAH emission power spectra are highly anisotropic. They are well fitted with a break-free power-law, suggesting that we do not observe a specific scale for energy dissipation. Power-law indices are -3.5 near Merope and -3 in the more distant field. The magnetic field orientation, as derived from the Planck dust polarization data, aligns with the PAH anisotropy. The power anisotropy is constant across scales. These findings are discussed in relation to interstellar turbulence that may be driven by the Pleiades stars. The JWST observations of the Pleiades offer a new viewpoint for comparing observations and theoretical models, as they examine physical scales at which turbulence in the CNM is subsonic and decoupled from the thermal instability. The observations may indicate that the turbulent energy cascade in the CNM is anisotropic.</description>

      <title>JWST Discovery of High-Velocity Mid-Infrared Ionized Outflows in Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies F11119+3257 and F05189-2524</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) are thought to be a driving mechanism of large-scale winds driven by active galactic nuclei, which cause significant galactic feedback through quenching star formation and regulating supermassive black hole growth. We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Mid-Infrared Instrument Medium-Resolution Spectrometer observations of two nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), F11119+3257 and F05189-2524, with nuclear X-ray detected UFOs and kiloparsec-scale outflow. These galaxies show remarkably similar mid-infrared continuum and emission line features, notably including a high-velocity $v_{90}$ $\sim$ 4000 km s$^{-1}$ outflow detected in highly ionized neon emission lines, e.g., \nevi. In F05189-2524, we see a slightly slower biconical outflow extending up to $\sim2$ kpc in the same neon emission lines. Both sources show evidence of AGN-driven radiative feedback through a deficit of rotational molecular hydrogen lines in the nuclear region, $&lt;$1 kpc from the central quasar, but no clear evidence of any molecular gas entrained in the quasar-driven outflow. Energetic analysis shows that the warm ionized gas in both of these sources contributes minimally ($\sim0.1-5\%$) to the momentum outflow rate of these sources and leaves the conclusions of previous literature unchanged: the energetics of these sources are broadly consistent with a momentum-conserving outflow.</description>

      <title>The FLAMINGO Project: Exploring the X-ray--cosmic-shear cross-correlation as a probe of large-scale structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Baryonic feedback processes associated with galaxy formation directly influence the large-scale structure by redistributing gas. Recent measurements of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and stacks of X-ray emission from optically selected galaxy clusters suggest that feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is more efficient at expelling gas from low-mass clusters than previously thought. The measurement of the cross-correlation between cosmic shear and diffuse X-ray emission provides a new probe of the distribution of gas in groups and clusters. We use the FLAMINGO cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations to examine the X-ray--cosmic-shear cross-correlation. The cross-correlation is most sensitive to the distribution of gas in haloes with masses $10^{14}\leq M_{200\mathrm{c}}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot}\leq10^{15}$. It is sensitive to the strength of feedback, but the effects of variations in cosmology and baryonic physics are largely degenerate. We compare the FLAMINGO predictions with the cross-correlation between cosmic shear from the Dark Energy Survey and ROSAT all-sky X-ray maps. We find that, if we neglect the X-ray emission from AGN that would remain unresolved by ROSAT, then the fiducial FLAMINGO model is in excellent agreement with the data, while models with stronger or weaker feedback are ruled out. However, if we account for unresolved AGN, either using the direct FLAMINGO predictions or by abundance matching to the observed (extrapolated) AGN luminosity function, then models with stronger feedback are preferred. We conclude that to exploit the potential of the X-ray--lensing cross-correlation, it will be necessary to resolve fainter AGN, and to use external constraints to break the degeneracy between baryonic feedback and cosmology.</description>

Abstract: A population of anomalous ultra-massive white dwarfs discovered with Gaia, often referred to as the Q branch, show high (multi-Gyr) cooling delays produced by exotic physical mechanisms. They are believed to be the products of stellar mergers, but the exact origin and formation channel remain unclear. We obtained a spectroscopically complete, volume-limited sample of the Q branch region within 100 pc, and found significant differences in atmospheric composition and rotation rates as a function of tangential velocity. In particular, we discover that stellar remnants with the longest cooling delays do not show strong magnetism nor detectable short-period rotational variability, as opposed to what is generally believed for double-degenerate mergers. This indicates that either these white dwarfs arise from a formation channel with no strong magnetism induced, or that the magnetism produced from the merger dissipates over the cooling delay timescales. Our follow-up photometry has also discovered pulsations in the second and third hydrogen-dominated DAQ white dwarfs, one hotter than 15,500 K, possibly extending the boundaries of the DAV instability strip for white dwarfs with thin hydrogen layers.</description>

      <title>Direct power spectral density estimation from structure functions without Fourier transforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Second-order structure functions and power spectral densities are popular tools in the study of statistical properties across scales, particularly for the analysis of turbulent flows. Although intimately related, analyses primarily use one or the other. We introduce a framework for estimating the power spectrum using the second-order structure function without applying Fourier transforms -- enabling one to take advantage of the real-space structure function calculations. We validate and showcase this method, comparing it to classical Fourier power spectrum estimates determined from analytical calculations, fractional Brownian motion, turbulence simulations, and space-physics and astrophysical observations of turbulence. We show that this method is able to robustly obtain the expected power law behaviour where we use turbulence ranges as test-cases.</description>

      <title>Validating the Angular Sizes of Red Clump Stars with Intensity Interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The surface-brightness-color (SBC) relationship for Red Clump stars provides a critical foundation for precision distance ladder measurements, including the 1\% distance determination to the Large Magellanic Cloud. Current SBC calibrations rely on angular diameter measurements of nearby Red Clump stars obtained through long-baseline optical interferometry using the Very Large Telescope Interferometer. We explore the application of intensity interferometry to measure limb-darkened angular diameters of Red Clump stars, offering a complementary approach to traditional amplitude interferometry. We describe the framework for extracting angular diameters from squared visibility measurements in intensity interferometry, accounting for limb darkening through the stellar atmosphere models. For the Red Clump star HD~17652, we show that intensity interferometry in the $H$ band at baselines matching PIONIER ($\sim$100~m) could achieve $&lt;1$\% angular size uncertainties in 2-hour exposures by measuring the primary peak of the visibility function, enabling direct comparison with existing measurements. Critically, observations at shorter wavelengths probe the secondary visibility maximum, providing independent checks of both measurement and systematic errors that are largely insensitive to limb-darkening assumptions. Exploiting the multiplex advantage of simultaneous multi-bandpass observations and the large number of baselines available with telescope arrays such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory can reduce observing times to practical levels, making intensity interferometry a viable tool for validating the angular sizes for a subset of the Red Clump star calibration sample.</description>

      <title>FORGE'd in the Early Universe: The Effect of Protostellar Outflows on Pop III Accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a cosmological zoom-in radiation magneto-hydrodynamic (RMHD) simulation, using FORGE'd in FIRE, that follows the formation, growth, and evolution of a single metal-free Pop. III (proto)star at redshift $z \sim 14$. The simulation captures a rotationally supported circumstellar disk and protostellar jets, both resolved down to $&lt;100$ au scales. We find the star grows to $\sim 27$ M$_{\odot}$ over $31,000$ years, with its final mass regulated by accretion and protostellar jets. Protostellar jets form because the magnetic mass-to-flux ratio lies within the regime that allows jet launching, and they are further enabled by a rotating circumstellar disk with sufficient gas-magnetic-field coupling, both present in this simulation. These jets regulate accretion onto the (proto)star and drive outflows that collide with infalling gas, slowing inflow at large radii due to the substantial momentum they carry. A circumstellar disk forms, extending out to $\sim 0.01$ pc, which remains gravitationally stable (Q $\gg 1$). The stability of the disk is maintained through both thermal support and turbulence. In this paper we focus on how jets play a critical role not only in shaping the final masses of Pop. III stars but also in directly influencing their surroundings by regulating accretion. These results will provide important insights into the initial mass function and feedback processes in the earliest star-forming regions of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Periodic 6.7 GHz $\mathrm{CH_3OH}$ maser emission in G353.273+0.641: First candidate for a pulsating high-mass protostar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the periodic flux variations in the 6.7 GHz $\mathrm{CH_3OH}$ maser associated with the high-mass protostar G353.273+0.641, based on 13 yr of monitoring mainly by the Hitachi 32 m telescope. We identified a periodicity of 309 days based on a nearly complete light curve, with 833 epochs every few days. A strong correlation is found between the maser and the mid-infrared fluxes at 3.4 and 4.6 $\mu$m observed by NEOWISE during these periods, suggesting that the maser emission responds to variations in the protostellar luminosity. The average profile of the maser light curve is asymmetric and shows a steep drop in intensity just before the brightening, resembling that of some pulsating variable stars. Assuming a protostellar pulsation as the origin of maser periodicity, the observed period implies a cool and highly bloated, red supergiant-like structure. Such a bloated structure is consistent with a theoretical model of protostellar evolution under high accretion rates. The inferred protostellar parameters are broadly consistent with the theoretical model of pulsational instability during the early phase of high-mass star formation. However, a periodic accretion scenario caused by an unresolved compact protobinary cannot be completely ruled out. Several irregular peaks that deviate from the periodicity may result from episodic accretion phenomena or jet-launching events independent of the protostellar pulsation. Extremely high-resolution imaging with next-generation interferometers such as the ngVLA will provide a conclusive test for both the protostellar pulsation and the binary accretion scenarios.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the dynamics of Young Stellar Objects: Time-Domain Interferometry with six 4-m class telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of the inner regions of young stellar objects (YSOs) is driven by a variety of physical phenomena, from magnetospheres and accretion to the dust sublimation rim and inner disk flows. These inner environments evolve on timescales of hours to days, exactly when bursts, dips, and rapid structural changes carry the most valuable information about star and planet formations, but remain hardly reachable with current facilities. A better reactive infrastructure with six or more telescopes, combined with alerts from large time-domain surveys (e.g., at the era of LSST/Rubin type facilities), and equipped with instruments spanning from the V-band to the thermal infrared (N), would provide the instantaneous uv-coverage and spectral diagnostics needed to unambiguously interpret and image these events as they happen. Such a world's first time-domain interferometric observatory would enable qualitatively new science: directly linking optical and infrared variability to spatially resolved changes in magnetospheric accretion, inner-disk geometry, and dust and gas dynamics in the innermost astronomical unit. Crucially, connecting these processes to outer-scale unresolved information from JWST, ALMA, and the ELT would yield a complete tomography of the planet-forming region.</description>

      <title>Shells and bubbles around compact clusters of massive stars: 3D MHD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (3D MHD) simulations of the plasma flow structure in the vicinity of a compact cluster of young massive stars. The cluster is considered at the evolutionary stage dominated by Wolf-Rayet stars. This stage occurs in clusters with ages of several million years, close to the onset of supernova explosions; the well-known objects Westerlund 1 and 2 are the prototypes. The collisions of powerful winds from massive stars in the cluster core, calculated as interactions of individual outflows, are accompanied by their partial thermalization and produce a collective cluster wind. The MHD dynamics of the cluster wind bubble expansion into the interstellar medium is considered, depending on the density of the surrounding medium with a uniform magnetic field. We show that when expanding into a cold neutral medium, the cluster wind is able to reshape its surrounding environment over the Wolf-Rayet star lifetime, sweeping up more than $10^4$ $M_{\odot}$ of gas in $\sim 2 \times 10^5$ yr and producing extended, thin and dense shells with an amplified magnetic field. In a cold neutral medium with a density of $\sim 20$ cm$^{-3}$ and a magnetic field of $\sim 3.5$ $\mu$G, a thin shell forms around the cluster wind bubble, characterized by a cellular structure in its density and magnetic field distributions. The cellular magnetic field structure appears in parts of the shell expanding transversely to the orientation of the external magnetic field. Magnetic fields in the shell are amplified to strengths $\gtrsim 50$ $\mu$G. The formation of the cellular structure is associated with the development of instabilities. The expansion of the bubble into a warm neutral interstellar medium also leads to the formation of a shell with an amplified magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Little red dots as young supermassive black holes in dense ionized cocoons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16595v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered many compact galaxies at high redshift with broad hydrogen and helium lines, including the enigmatic population of little red dots (LRDs). The nature of these galaxies is debated and is attributed to supermassive black holes (SMBHs) or intense star formation. They exhibit unusual properties for SMBHs, such as black holes that are overmassive for their host galaxies and extremely weak X-ray and radio emission. Here we show that in most objects studied with the highest-quality JWST spectra, the lines are broadened by electron scattering with a narrow intrinsic core. The data require very high electron column densities and compact sizes (light days), which, when coupled with their high luminosities, can be explained only by SMBH accretion. The narrow intrinsic line cores imply black hole masses of $10^{5-7}$ $M_{\odot}$, two orders of magnitude lower than previous estimates. These are the lowest mass black holes known at high redshift, to our knowledge, and suggest a population of young SMBHs. They are enshrouded in a dense cocoon of ionized gas producing broad lines from which they are accreting close to the Eddington limit, with very mild neutral outflows. Reprocessed nebular emission from this cocoon dominates the optical spectrum, explaining most LRD spectral characteristics, including the weak radio and X-ray emission.</description>

      <title>Die Hard: The On-Off-Cycle of Galaxies on the Star Formation Main Sequence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our picture of galaxy evolution currently assumes that galaxies spend their life on the star formation main sequence (SFMS) until they are eventually quenched. However, recent observations show indications that the full picture might be more complicated. We reveal typical in-situ star formation histories and their relations to large-scale environment as well as gas accretion across cosmic time. We follow the evolution of central galaxies in the highest-resolution box of the Magneticum Pathfinder cosmological hydrodynamical simulations and classify their evolution scenarios with respect to the SFMS. We find that a major fraction of the galaxies undergoes long-term cycles of quenching and rejuvenation on gigayear timescales. This expands the framework of galaxy evolution from a secular evolution to a sequence of multiple active and passive phases. Only 14% of field galaxies on the SFMS at z=0 actually evolved along the scaling relation, while the bulk of star-forming galaxies in the local Universe have undergone cycles of quenching and rejuvenation. In this work we describe the statistics of these galaxy evolution modes and how this impacts their mean stellar masses, ages, and metallicities today. We further explore possible explanations and find that the geometry of gas accretion at the halo outskirts shows a strong correlation with the star formation rate (SFR) evolution, while the density parameter as a tracer of environment shows no significant correlation. A derivation of SFRs from gas accretion with simple assumptions only works in the high-z universe, where accreted gas is quickly converted into stars. We conclude that an evolution scenario consistently on the SFMS is the exception, when regarding galaxies on the SFMS at z=0. Galaxies with rejuvenation cycles can be distinguished well from SFMS-evolved galaxies, both in their halo accretion modes and in their features at z=0.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Zoom-In Simulation of Odd Radio Circles as Merger-Driven Shocks in Galaxy Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Odd Radio Circles (ORCs) are a new class of distinct radio objects that has recently been discovered. The origin of these features is yet unclear because their peculiar properties are a challenge for our current understanding of astrophysical sources for diffuse radio emission. In this work we test the feasibility of major mergers in galaxy groups as a possible formation channel for ORCs. By modeling the assembly of a massive galaxy group with a final virial mass of $M_{200}\sim 10^{13}\, \rm M_\odot$ in a magnetohydrodynamic zoom-in simulation with on-the-fly cosmic ray treatment, we are able to derive the X-ray and radio properties of the system self-consistently and compare them to observations. We show that the X-ray properties for the simulated system are agreeing with characteristics of observed galaxy groups in the regarded mass range, legitimating the comparison between the radio properties of the simulated halo and those of observed ORCs. A major merger between two galaxies in the simulation is triggering a series of strong shocks in the circumgalactic medium, which in unison are forming a ring if the line of sight is perpendicular to the merger axis. The shock is rapidly expanding in radial direction and quickly reaches the virial radius of the halo. This formation channel can hence readily explain the morphology and large extent of ORCs. However, the inferred radio luminosity of these features is lower than for observed counterparts, while the degree of polarization seems to be systematically overpredicted by the simulation. Fossil cosmic ray populations from AGN and stellar feedback might be necessary to explain the full extent of the radio properties of ORCs, since diffusive shock acceleration was the only source term for non-thermal electrons considered in this work.</description>

      <title>The Connection between Dusty Star-Forming Galaxies and the First Massive Quenched Galaxies</title>

Abstract: High-redshift (z &gt; 2) massive quiescent (MQ) galaxies provide an opportunity to probe the key physical processes driving the fuelling and quenching of star formation in the early Universe. Observational evidence suggests a possible evolutionary link between MQs and dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs; or submillimetre galaxies), another extreme high-redshift population. However, galaxy formation models have historically struggled to reproduce these populations - especially simultaneously - limiting our understanding of their formation and connection, particularly in light of recent JWST findings. In previous work, we presented a re-calibrated version of the L-Galaxies semi-analytic model that provides an improved match to observationally-inferred number densities of both DSFG and MQ populations. In this work, we use this new model to investigate the progenitors of MQs at z &gt; 2 and the physical mechanisms that lead to their quenching. We find that most MQs at z &gt; 2 were sub-millimetre-bright ($S_{870}$ &gt; 1 mJy) at some point in their cosmic past. The stellar mass of MQs is strongly correlated with the maximum submillimetre flux density attained over their history, and this relation appears to be independent of redshift. However, only a minority of high-redshift DSFGs evolve into MQs by z = 2. The key distinction between typical DSFGs and MQ progenitors lies in their merger histories: MQ progenitors experience an early major merger that triggers a brief, intense starburst and rapid black hole growth, depleting their cold gas reservoirs. In our model, AGN feedback subsequently prevents further gas cooling, resulting in quenching. In contrast, the broader DSFG population remains sub-millimetre-bright, with star formation proceeding primarily via secular processes, becoming quenched later.</description>

      <title>Extending the Frontier of Spatially-Resolved Supermassive Black Hole Mass Measurements to at $1\lesssim z\lesssim2$: Simulations with ELT/MICADO High-Resolution Mass Models and HARMONI Integral-Field Stellar Kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current spatially resolved kinematic measurements of supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses are largely confined to the local Universe (distances $\lesssim100$ Mpc). We investigate the potential of the Extremely Large Telescope's (ELT) first-light instruments, MICADO and HARMONI, to extend these dynamical measurements to galaxies at redshift $1\lesssim z\lesssim2$. We select a sample of five bright, massive, quiescent galaxies at these redshifts, adopting their S\'ersic profiles from HST photometry as their intrinsic surface brightness distributions. Based on these intrinsic models, we generate mock MICADO images using SimCADO and mock HARMONI integral-field spectroscopic data cubes using HSIM. The HARMONI simulations utilize input stellar kinematics derived from Jeans Anisotropic Models (JAM). We then process these mock observations: the simulated MICADO images are fitted with Multi-Gaussian Expansion to derive stellar mass models, and stellar kinematics are extracted from mock HARMONI cubes with pPXF. Finally, these derived stellar mass models and kinematics are used to constrain JAM dynamical models within a Bayesian framework. Our analysis demonstrates that SMBH masses can be recovered with an accuracy of $\sim$10%. We find that MICADO can provide detailed stellar mass models with $\sim$1 hour of on-source exposure. HARMONI requires longer minimum integrations for reliable stellar kinematic measurements of SMBHs. The required on-source time scales with apparent brightness, ranging from 5-7.5 hours for galaxies at $z\approx1$ (F814W, 20-20.5 mag) to 5 hours for galaxies at $1&lt;z\lesssim2$ (F160W, 20.8 mag). These findings highlight the ELT's capability to push the frontier of SMBH mass measurements to $z\approx2$, enabling crucial tests of SMBH-galaxy co-evolution at the top end of the galaxy mass function.</description>

      <title>The GLEAM 4-Jy (G4Jy) Sample: III. Further host-galaxy identification, and redshift assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present 127 new host-galaxy identifications for G4Jy sources (S_151MHz &gt; 4 Jy), based on radio images from MeerKAT, the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS), and the Rapid ASKAP (Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder) Continuum Survey (RACS). This includes identifications that result from visual inspection of radio contours on K_s-band images, as opposed to the AllWISE-W1 images that were used for the original set of overlays when defining the G4Jy Sample (Papers I and II). Our aim is to achieve 100 per cent spectroscopic completeness for the sample, where all of the spectroscopy is available in digital form online. For now, we have gathered (i) digital optical spectroscopy for 34 per cent of the sample, (ii) photometric redshifts for an additional 21 per cent of the sample, and (iii) further redshifts found through the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (but not recently verified). Our assessment of the redshifts includes visual inspection of all of the digital spectroscopy, and re-fitting redshift templates where necessary. The resulting redshift range is (currently) 0.0 &lt; z &lt; 3.6. We also present 151-MHz luminosities and linear sizes for the G4Jy Sample, based on initial analysis.</description>

      <title>A Spatially Resolved Evolutionary Sequence of Multi-wavelength AGN Host Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the spatially resolved star formation, gas ionisation, and outflow properties of 1813 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) from the MaNGA survey, which we classify into infrared (IR), broad-line (BL), narrow-line (NL), and radio (RD) AGNs based on their mid-infrared colours, optical spectra, and/or radio photometry. We also provide estimations of AGN power at different wavelengths. AGN incidence is found to increase with stellar mass following a power-law, with the high-mass end dominated by RDAGNs and the low-mass end dominated by NLAGNs. Compared to their mass-matched non-AGN counterparts, we find that IRAGNs, BLAGNs, and NLAGNs on average show enhanced specific star formation rates, younger stellar populations, and harder ionisation towards the centre. RDAGNs, in contrast, show radial profiles similar to quiescent galaxies. [OIII] outflows are more common and stronger in BL/IRAGNs, while RDAGNs on average show no outflow features. The outflow incidence increases with [OIII] luminosity, and the features in BL/IRAGNs on average extend to ~2 kpc from the nuclei. We further discuss a possible evolutionary sequence of AGNs and their host galaxies, where AGNs with strong emission lines or dust tori are present in star-forming galaxies. Later, young compact radio jets emerge, the host galaxies gradually quench, and the AGN hosts eventually evolve into globally quiescent systems with larger radio jets that prevent further gas cooling.</description>

      <title>Jet-torus interaction revealed by sub-parsec SO absorption in NGC 1052</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the first {\lambda}2-mm very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations of the radio galaxy NGC 1052, conducted with the Korean VLBI Network (KVN) using a wide-band recording mode. Leveraging the wide bandwidth covering a velocity range at 2300 km/s, we successfully detect broad (&gt; 700 km/s) multi-component SO J_N = 3_3 - 2_2 absorption against the sub-parsec-scale continuum structure. The absorption profile consists of both redshifted and blueshifted components, including a newly identified blueshifted feature at -412 km/s relative to the systemic velocity. Significant SO absorption is confined to the central components, with no substantial detection toward the outer jet components. This constrains the location of SO gas to a compact region smaller than 0.45 pc in the sub-parsec vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH). Our results support the scenario in which SO molecules are evaporated through shock heating caused by jet-torus interaction. The SO gas clumps are likely driven outward by the jet, with some returning toward the SMBH as inflowing material. Comparison with 321 GHz H2O masers reveals partial similarities in spatial distribution and radial velocity, suggesting that the jet-torus interaction may also trigger the excitation of H2O masers.</description>

      <title>MARVELously Dark: the gravothermal evolution of dwarf halos in velocity-dependent SIDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) with a sufficiently large cross section has been shown to naturally produce constant dark matter (DM) cores, as well as core-collapse, at the centers of dwarf halos on cosmic timescales, potentially reducing tensions with observation. Here, we present halos from a new dark matter only (DMO) cosmological (SIDM) simulation: Ms.Marvel DMO with a velocity-dependent self-interaction cross section with $\sigma/m_\text{max} = 50$ cm$^2$/g at $v_\text{max} = 35$ km/s. We compare these to the CDM suite of Storm simulations including both DMO and dark matter + hydrodynamics runs, in order to test core-formation (and core-collapse) across different dark matter models. We show that Ms.Marvel DMO can reproduce core slopes consistent with observations of isolated dwarf galaxies and more massive ($\text{M}_{vir} \gtrsim 10^{10} M_{\odot}$) CDM dwarf halos that include stellar feedback from the matched CDM run (Storm CDM+baryons). We identify nine Ms.Marvel SIDM DMO halos in the core-collapse phase of gravothermal evolution with halo masses below $2\times 10^9 M_{\odot}$. We find that using core slope to measure the core-collapse timescales of Ms.Marvel DMO halos agrees well with predicted collapse times estimated with the parametric model for SIDM halos introduced by Yang et al.(2023). Additionally, compared to central density, core slope is less sensitive to both the radius of measurement and halo merger history. These results indicate that the slope of the inner DM density profile more cleanly differentiates core-collapsed versus core-forming halos than central density amplitude.</description>

      <title>Illuminating gravitational wave sources with Sgr A* flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sagittarius A* exhibits daily energetic flares characterized by non-thermal emission in the infrared and X-ray bands. While the underlying accretion flow is a Radiatively Inefficient Accretion Flow (RIAF) peaking at radio frequencies, the mechanism powering these non-thermal transients remains debated. Stellar dynamics predict a population of faint brown dwarfs orbiting Sgr A*. We investigate whether the tidal stripping of brown dwarfs provides a viable fueling mechanism for the observed flares. These objects are progenitors of Extremely Large Mass Ratio Inspirals (XMRIs), crucial sources of low-frequency gravitational waves for the future LISA mission. We present high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of grazing tidal interactions coupled with a parameterized non-thermal radiation model. We numerically model the stripping of the brown dwarf envelope and the subsequent accretion of this material. We demonstrate that the dynamics of the tidal fallback and subsequent viscous evolution naturally reproduce the fundamental temporal characteristics of observed flares: the peak luminosity and the characteristic 1-hour duration. We show that this fueling mechanism is dynamically viable and energetically consistent, placing strong constraints on the required efficiency of the non-thermal emission process, suggesting extreme radiative inefficiency. These findings provide compelling evidence for a hidden population of brown dwarfs in the Galactic Center. Crucially, the observed high flare frequency implies tight orbits characteristic of advanced inspirals. This establishes a direct link between electromagnetic transients and active gravitational wave sources, alerting the LISA consortium years in advance to the presence of specific XMRI systems promising exceptionally high signal-to-noise ratios for precision tests of general relativity.</description>
