      <title>Relative uniform completion of a vector lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, we revisit several approaches to the concept of uniform completion $X^{\mathrm{ru}}$ of a vector lattice $X$. We show that many of this approaches yield the same result. In particular, if $X$ is a sublattice of a uniformly complete vector lattice $Z$ then $X^{\mathrm{ru}}$ may be viewed as the intersection of all uniformly complete sublattices of $Z$ containing $X$. $X^{\mathrm{ru}}$ may also be constructed via a transfinite process of taking uniform adherences in $Z$ with regulators coming from the previous adherences. If, in addition, $X$ is majorizing in $Z$ then $X^{\mathrm{ru}}$ may be viewed as the uniform closure of $X$ in $Z$. We show that $X^{\mathrm{ru}}$ may also be characterized via a universal property: every positive operator from $X$ to a uniformly complete vector lattice extends uniquely to $X^{\mathrm{ru}}$. Moreover, the class of positive operators here may be replaced with several other important classes of operators (e.g., lattice homomorphisms). We also discuss conditions when the uniform adherence of a sublattice equals its uniform closure, and present an example (based on a construction by R.N. Ball and A.W. Hager) where this fails.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a "deep zero problem" proposed by Hedenmalm. We show that there is a natural connection between Hedenmalm's problem and the classical HRT conjecture in time-frequency analysis. This connection allows us to show that Hedenmalm's problem 5.2 in [5] as well as some of its natural analogs have affirmative answers.</description>

      <title>A Sharp Localized Weighted Inequality Related to Gagliardo and Sobolev Seminorms and Its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we establish a nearly sharp localized weighted inequality related to Gagliardo and Sobolev seminorms, respectively, with the sharp $A_1$-weight constant or with the specific $A_p$-weight constant when $p\in (1,\infty)$. As applications, we further obtain a new characterization of Muckenhoupt weights and, in the framework of ball Banach function spaces, an inequality related to Gagliardo and Sobolev seminorms on cubes, a Gagliardo--Nirenberg interpolation inequality, and a Bourgain--Brezis--Mironescu formula. All these obtained results have wide generality and are proved to be (nearly) sharp.
  The original version of this article was published in [Adv. Math. 481 (2025), Paper No. 110537]. In this revised version, we correct an error appeared in Theorem 1.1 in the case where $p=1$, which was pointed out to us by Emiel Lorist.</description>

      <title>A geometric approach to the compressed shift operator on the Hardy space over the bidisk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the compressed shift operator $S_z$ on the Hardy space over the bidisk via the geometric approach. We calculate the spectrum and essential spectrum of $S_z$ on the Beurling type quotient modules induced by rational inner functions, and give a complete characterization for $S_z^*$ to be a Cowen-Douglas operator. Then we extend the concept of Cowen-Douglas operator to be the generalized Cowen-Douglas operator, and show that $S_z^*$ is a generalized Cowen-Douglas operator. Moreover, we establish the connection between the reducibility of the Hermitian holomorphic vector bundle induced by kernel spaces and the reducibility of the generalized Cowen-Douglas operator. By using the geometric approach, we study the reducing subspaces of $S_z$ on certain polynomial quotient modules.</description>

      <title>Spectral dynamics for the infinite dihedral group and the lamplighter group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a tuple $A=(A_0,A_1,\cdots,A_n)$ of elements in a Banach algebra $\mathfrak{B}$, its projective (joint) spectrum $p(A)$ is the collection of $z\in \mathbb{P}^n$ such that $A(z)=z_0A_0+z_1A_1+\cdots+z_nA_n$ is not invertible. If $\mathfrak{B}$ is the group $C^*$-algebra for a discrete group $G$ generated by $A_0, A_1,\dots, A_n$ with a representation $\rho$, then $p(A)$ is an invariant of (weak) equivalence for $\rho$. In \cite{BY}, B. Goldberg and R. Yang proved that the Julia set $\mathcal{J}(F)$ of the induced rational map $F$ for the infinite dihedral group $D_\infty$ is the union of the projective spectrum with the extended indeterminacy set. But the extended indeterminacy set $E_F$ is complicated. To obtain a better relationship between the projective spectrum and the Julia set, by replacing $A_\pi(z)=z_0+z_1\pi(a)+z_2\pi(t)$ with the extended pencil $A_\pi(z)=z_0+z_1\pi(a)+z_2\pi(t)+z_3\pi(at)$, where $\pi$ is the Koopman representation, and using the method of operator recursions, we show that $p(A_\pi)=\mathcal{J}(F).$ Further, we study the spectral dynamics for the Lamplighter group $\mathcal{L}$, and prove that $\mathcal{J}(Q)=E_Q$, where $Q$ is the rational map associated with $\mathcal{L}$.</description>

      <title>Norm attaining dual truncated Toeplitz operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a complete framework for understanding when a dual truncated Toeplitz operator (DTTO) attains its norm. Given a nonconstant inner function $u$, the DTTO associated with a symbol $\varphi \in L^{\infty}(\mathbb{T})$ acts on the orthogonal complement ${\mathcal{K}_u}^{\perp} = uH^{2} \oplus H^{2}_{-}$ of the model space $\mathcal{K}_u = H^{2}\ominus uH^{2}$. Assuming $\|\varphi\|_{\infty}=1$, we give a characterization of the norm attaining property of $D_{\varphi}$ and describe all extremal vectors. A sharp analytic and coanalytic dichotomy emerges $D_{\varphi}$ attains its norm precisely when the symbol admits either $\varphi=\overline{u}\overline{\psi}_{+}\chi_{+}$ or $\varphi=u\psi_{-}\overline{\chi}_{-},$ where $\psi_{\pm},\chi_{\pm}$ are inner functions. The first condition corresponds to norm attainment on the analytic component $uH^{2}$, while the second corresponds to norm attainment on the coanalytic component $H^{2}_{-}$ via the natural conjugation $C_{u}$. A key feature of the theory is that the dual compressed shift $D_{u}$ (the case $\varphi(z)=z$) always attains its norm. We also obtain a coupled Toeplitz, Hankel system governing analytic and coanalytic components of extremal vectors, and provide several concrete examples including nonanalytic unimodular symbols illustrating how the factorization criteria govern norm attainment.</description>

      <title>The wanted extension of Fujii and Tsurumaru's formula for the spectral radius of the Bell-CHSH operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is motivated by a recent paper
  of Yuki Fujii and Toyohiro Tsurumaru in which they established a beautiful formula
  for the spectral radius of the Bell-CHSH operator on finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.
  To tackle the operator on infinite-dimensional spaces, they elaborated a method based
  on appropriate approximation of commutators of infinite-dimensional orthogonal projections by
  commutators of orthogonal projections on finite-dimensional spaces. We here give a proof of
  Fujii and Tsurumaru's original formula that works in all dimensions. We also simplify and correct
  some arguments employed by Fujii and Tsurumaru.</description>

      <title>On masas of the Calkin algebra generated by projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06580v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assuming the continuum hypothesis CH, we obtain complete $*$-isomorphic classification of maximal abelian self-adjoint subalgebras (masas) of the Calkin algebra $\mathcal Q(\ell_2)$ (bounded operators on a separable Hilbert space modulo compact operators) generated by projections. In particular, for any compact totally disconnected Hausdorff space $K$ of weight not exceeding the continuum and not admitting $G_\delta$ points we construct under CH a masa of $\mathcal Q(\ell_2)$ which is $*$-isomorphic to the algebra $C(K)$ of complex-valued continuous functions on $K$.
  This, among others, shows that masas of the Calkin algebra could have rather unexpected properties compared to the previously known three $*$-isomorphic types of them generated by projections: $\ell_\infty/c_0$, $L_\infty$ and $\ell_\infty/c_0\oplus L_\infty$.
  It can be shown that some additional set-theoretic hypothesis, like CH, is necessary for such results. However, without making any additional set-theoretic assumptions we still construct a family of maximal possible cardinality (of the power set of $\mathbb R$) of pairwise non-$*$-isomorphic masas of $\mathcal Q(\ell_2)$ generated by projections and with properties unlike the three above examples.</description>

      <title>Twisted representations of product systems of $C^*$-correspondences: Wold decomposition and unitary extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate Wold-type decompositions and unitary extension problems for multivariable isometric covariant representations associated with product systems of $C^*$-correspondences. First, we establish an operator-theoretic characterization for the existence of a Wold decomposition for the tuple $(\sigma, T_1, T_2, \ldots, T_n)$, where each $(\sigma,T_i)$ is an isometric covariant representation of a $C^*$\nobreakdash-correspondence. We then introduce twisted and doubly twisted covariant representations of product systems. For doubly twisted isometric representations, we prove the existence of a Wold decomposition, recovering earlier results for doubly commuting representations as special cases. We further obtain explicit descriptions of the resulting Wold summands and develop concrete Fock-type models realizing each component. We present non-trivial examples of these families. Finally, we construct unitary extensions via a direct-limit procedure. As applications, we obtain unitary extensions for several previously studied classes of operator tuples, including doubly twisted, doubly non-commuting, and doubly commuting isometries, and for a special class of doubly twisted representations of product system.</description>

      <title>A metric characterization of projections among positive norm-One elements in unital C$^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize projections among positive norm-one elements in unital C$^*$-algebras in pure geometric terms determined by the norm of the underlying Banach space. Concretely, let $A$ be a C$^*$-algebra (or a JB$^*$-algebra) whose positive cone and unit sphere are denoted by ${A}^+$ and $\mathrm{S}_{A}$, respectively. The positive portion of the unit sphere in $A$, denoted by $\mathrm{S}_{{A}^+}$, is the set ${A}^+ \cap \mathrm{S}_{A}$, while the unit sphere of positive norm-one elements around a subset $\mathscr{S}$ in $\mathrm{S}_{A^+}$ is the set $$\hbox{Sph}_{_{\mathrm{S}_{{A}^+}}} (\mathscr{S}) :=\Big\{ x\in \mathrm{S}_{{A}^+} : \|x-s\|=1 \hbox{ for all } s\in \mathscr{S} \Big\}.$$ Assuming that $A$ is unital, we establish that an element $a\in \mathrm{S}_{{A}^+}$ is a projection if, and only if, it satisfies the double sphere property, that is, $ \hbox{Sph}_{_{\mathrm{S}_{{A}^+}}} \left(\hbox{Sph}_{_{\mathrm{S}_{{A}^+}}} \left(\{a\}\right) \right) = \{a\}.$</description>

      <title>Model agnostic signal encoding by leaky integrate and fire, performance and uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12994v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrate-and-fire is a resource efficient time-encoding mechanism that summarizes into a signed spike train those time intervals where a signal's charge exceeds a certain threshold. We analyze the IF encoder in terms of a very general notion of approximate bandwidth, which is shared by most commonly-used signal models. This complements results on exact encoding that may be overly adapted to a particular signal model. We take into account, possibly for the first time, the effect of uncertainty in the exact location of the spikes (as may arise by decimation), uncertainty of integration leakage (as may arise in realistic manufacturing), and boundary effects inherent to finite periods of exposure to the measurement device. The analysis is done by means of a concrete bandwidth-based Ansatz that can also be useful to initialize more sophisticated model specific reconstruction algorithms, and uses the earth mover's (Wasserstein) distance to measure spike discrepancy.</description>

      <title>Cyclic polynomials in Dirichlet-type Spaces of the unit bidisk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $\alpha \in \mathbb{R},$ we consider the scale of function spaces, namely the Dirichlet-type space $\mathcal{D}_{\alpha}$ consisting of holomorphic functions on the unit bidisk $\mathbb{D}^2$, $f(z,w)=\sum_{k,l=0}^{\infty}a_{kl}z^kw^l$ such that $$\sum_{k,l=0}^{\infty}(k+l+1)^\alpha|a_{kl}|^2 &lt; \infty.$$ In this paper, we solve an open problem posed in \cite[Open problem~1]{Z25}, which asks whether the polynomial $2 - z_1 - z_2$ is cyclic in $\mathcal{D}_\alpha$ for $\frac{3}{2}&lt;\alpha \le 2$. We provide an affirmative answer and, as a consequence, complete the characterization of cyclic polynomials in $\mathcal{D}_\alpha$. In addition, we establish several properties of cyclic functions and present alternative proofs of some cases previously obtained by P. T. Ziarati.</description>

      <title>Relative $h$-principles for closed stable forms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper uses convex integration to develop a new, general method for proving relative $h$-principles for closed, stable, exterior forms on manifolds. This method is applied to prove the relative $h$-principle for 4 classes of closed stable forms which were previously not known to satisfy the $h$-principle, $\textit{viz.}$ stable $(2k-2)$-forms in $2k$ dimensions, stable $(2k-1)$-forms in $2k+1$ dimensions, $\widetilde{\mathrm{G}}_2$ 3-forms and $\widetilde{\mathrm{G}}_2$ 4-forms. The method is also used to produce new, unified proofs of all three previously established $h$-principles for closed, stable forms, $\textit{viz.}$ the $h$-principles for closed stable 2-forms in $2k+1$ dimensions, closed $\mathrm{G}_2$ 4-forms and closed $\mathrm{SL}(3;\mathbb{C})$ 3-forms. In addition, it is shown that if a class of closed stable forms satisfies the relative $h$-principle, then the corresponding Hitchin functional (whenever defined) is necessarily unbounded above.
  Due to the general nature of the $h$-principles considered in this paper, the application of convex integration requires an analogue of Hodge decomposition on arbitrary $n$-manifolds (possibly non-compact, or with boundary) which cannot, to the author's knowledge, be found elsewhere in the literature. Such a decomposition is proven in Appendix A.</description>

      <title>Pairs of Clark Unitary Operators on the Bidisk and their Taylor Joint Spectra</title>

Abstract: We develop a Clark theory for commuting compressed shift operators on model spaces $K_{\phi}$ associated with inner functions $\phi$ on the bidisk, which exhibits both similarities and marked differences compared to the classical one-variable version. We first identify the adjoint of the embedding operator $J_{\alpha} \colon K_{\phi}\to L^2(\sigma_{\alpha})$ as a weighted Cauchy transform of the Clark measure $\sigma_{\alpha}$. Under natural assumptions, which generically include the case when $\phi$ is rational inner, we obtain commuting unitaries on $K_{\phi}$ that are (often infinite-dimensional) perturbations of the compressed shift operators $K_{\phi}$. We prove that these unitaries are unitarily equivalent to multiplication by the coordinate functions on $L^2(\sigma_\alpha)$ and then establish a number of related properties and simplified results in special cases. Finally, we show that the Taylor joint spectrum of these Clark unitaries coincides with level sets of $\phi$ when $\phi$ is a rational inner function.</description>

      <title>Horizon Activation Mapping for Neural Networks in Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks for time series forecasting have relied on error metrics and architecture-specific interpretability approaches for model selection that don't apply across models of different families. To interpret forecasting models agnostic to the types of layers across state-of-the-art model families, we introduce Horizon Activation Mapping (HAM), a visual interpretability technique inspired by grad-CAM that uses gradient norm averages to study the horizon's subseries where grad-CAM studies attention maps over image data. We introduce causal and anti-causal modes to calculate gradient update norm averages across subseries at every timestep and lines of proportionality signifying uniform distributions of the norm averages. Optimization landscape studies with respect to changes in batch sizes, early stopping, train-val-test splits, architectural choices, univariate forecasting and dropouts are studied with respect to performances and subseries in HAM. Interestingly, batch size based differences in activities seem to indicate potential for existence of an exponential approximation across them per epoch relative to each other. Multivariate forecasting models including MLP-based CycleNet, N-Linear, N-HITS, self attention-based FEDformer, Pyraformer, SSM-based SpaceTime and diffusion-based Multi-Resolution DDPM over different horizon sizes trained over the ETTm2 dataset are used for HAM plots in this study. NHITS' neural approximation theorem and SpaceTime's exponential autoregressive activities have been attributed to trends in HAM plots over their training, validation and test sets. In general, HAM can be used for granular model selection, validation set choices and comparisons across different neural network model families.</description>
