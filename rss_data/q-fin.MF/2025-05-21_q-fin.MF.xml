      <title>Framework for asset-liability management with fixed-term securities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an optimal investment-consumption problem for a utility-maximizing investor who has access to assets with different liquidity and whose consumption rate as well as terminal wealth are subject to lower-bound constraints. Assuming utility functions that satisfy standard conditions, we develop a methodology for deriving the optimal strategies in semi-closed form. Our methodology is based on the generalized martingale approach and the decomposition of the problem into subproblems. We illustrate our approach by deriving explicit formulas for agents with power-utility functions and discuss potential extensions of the proposed framework. In numerical studies, we substantiate how the parameters of our framework impact the optimal proportion of initial capital allocated to the illiquid asset, the monetary value that the investor subjectively assigns to the fixed-term asset, and the potential of the illiquid asset to increase terminal the terminal value of liabilities without loss in the investor's expected utility.</description>

      <title>Filtering in a hazard rate change-point model with financial and life-insurance applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a continuous-time filtering framework for estimating a hazard rate subject to an unobservable change-point. This framework arises naturally in both financial and insurance applications, where the default intensity of a firm or the mortality rate of an individual may experience a sudden jump at an unobservable time, representing, for instance, a shift in the firm's risk profile or a deterioration in an individual's health status. By employing a progressive enlargement of filtration, we integrate noisy observations of the hazard rate with default-related information. We characterise the filter, i.e. the conditional probability of the change-point given the information flow, as the unique strong solution to a stochastic differential equation driven by the innovation process enriched with the discontinuous component. A sensitivity analysis and a comparison of the filter's behaviour under various information structures are provided. Our framework further allows for the derivation of an explicit formula for the survival probability conditional on partial information. This result applies to the pricing of credit-sensitive financial instruments such as defaultable bonds, credit default swaps, and life insurance contracts. Finally, a numerical analysis illustrates how partial information leads to delayed adjustments in the estimation of the hazard rate and consequently to mispricing of credit-sensitive instruments when compared to a full-information setting.</description>

      <title>Solutions to Equilibrium HJB Equations for Time-Inconsistent Deterministic Linear Quadratic Control: Characterization and Uniqueness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study a class of HJB equations which solve for equilibria for general time-inconsistent deterministic linear quadratic control problems within the intra-personal game theoretic framework, where the inconsistency arises from non-exponential discount functions. We characterize the solutions to the HJB equations using a class of Riccati equations with integral terms. By studying the uniqueness of solutions to the integro-differential Riccati equations, we prove the uniqueness of solutions to the equilibrium HJB equations.</description>
