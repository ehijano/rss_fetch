      <title>Geometric theories for real number algebra without sign test or dependent choice axiom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this memoir, we seek to construct a constructive theory that is as complete as possible to describe the algebraic properties of the real number field in constructive mathematics without a dependent choice axiom. To this purpose, we use a dynamical version of geometric theories. We obtain a nice description of the algebraic properties of the real number field, but also a first outline for a constructive theory of certain o-minimal structures. The memoir we present here is an unfinished development of the article by the authors https://inria.hal.science/hal-01426164. Compared to that paper, however, we have modified the definition of continuous semialgebraic functions, in the same spirit in which Bishop defines a continuous real function as a uniformly continuous function on any bounded interval. Despite its unfinished nature and the many questions that we do not currently know how to answer, we hope that this paper will arouse interest for its original approach to the subject. This paper is an English translation of a French version on arXiv:2406.15218</description>

      <title>Clarifying ordinals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use forcing over admissible sets to show that, for every ordinal $\alpha$ in a club $C\subset\omega_1$, there are copies of $\alpha$ such that the isomorphism between them is not computable in the join of the complete $\Pi^1_1$ set relative to each copy separately. Assuming $\mathsf{V=L}$, this is close to optimal; on the other hand, assuming large cardinals the same (and more) holds for every projective functional.</description>

      <title>G\"odel Incompleteness Theorem for PAC Learnable Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Different from the view that information is objective reality, we adopts the idea that all information needs to be compiled by the interpreter before it can be observed. Then, the interpreter-based information theory with its complexity is given by formula. Through the relationship between complexity and PAC learnability, the general PAC learnability corresponding to general complexity is derived. Then we generalize the observation process to the formal system with functors, in which we give concrete proof of the generalized G\"odel incompleteness theorem. Finally, the Cantor set, the original G\"odel incompleteness theorem, the Turing halting problem and the EPR paradox are put into the same mathematical framework as the specific applications of the general G\"odel incompleteness theorem.</description>

      <title>The short exact sequence in definable Galois cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Remarks on Galois Cohomology and Definability [2], Pillay introduced definable Galois cohomology, a model-theoretic generalization of Galois cohomology. Let $M$ be an atomic and strongly $\omega$-homogeneous structure over a set of parameters $A$. Let $B$ be a normal extension of $A$ in $M$. We show that a short exact sequence of automorphism groups $1 \to \text{Aut}(M/B) \to \text{Aut}(M/A) \to \text{Aut}(B/A) \to 1$ induces a short exact sequence in definable Galois cohomology. We also discuss compatibilities with [3]. Our result complements the long exact sequence in definable Galois cohomology developed in More on Galois cohomology, definability and differential algebraic groups [4].</description>

      <title>Various Properties of Various Ultrafilters, Various Graph Width Parameters, and Various Connectivity Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02299v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Filters are collections of sets that are closed under supersets and finite intersections, serving as fundamental tools in topology and set theory. An ultrafilter, a maximal filter on a set, plays a crucial role in these fields by rigorously handling limits, convergence, and compactness. A connectivity system is defined as a pair (X,f) , where X is a finite set and f is a symmetric submodular function. Understanding the duality in these parameters elucidates the relationship between different decompositions and measures of a graph's complexity. In this paper, we delve into ultrafilters on connectivity systems, applying Tukey's Lemma to these systems. Additionally, we explore prefilters, ultra-prefilters, and subbases within the context of connectivity systems. Furthermore, we introduce and investigate new parameters related to width, length, and depth, enhancing our understanding of these mathematical structures.</description>
