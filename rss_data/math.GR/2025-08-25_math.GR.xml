      <title>On $L^1$-approximation of groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A longstanding open problem in the intersection of group theory and operator algebras is whether all groups are MF, that is, approximated by representations with respect to the operator norm. More generally, for $1 \leq p \leq \infty$, it has been asked by Thom whether there exist groups which are not approximated with respect to the Schatten $p$-norm. The cases of $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$ were addressed in previous works. We settle the case $p=1$, solving a case left out by Lubotzky and Oppenheim.</description>

      <title>Relatively closed subgroups of permutation groups with a cyclic regular normal subgroup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by some known problems concerning combinatorial structures associated with finite one-dimensional affine permutation groups, we study subgroups which are closed in $\operatorname{\Gamma{L}}_1(q)$. This brings us to a description of the relatively closed subgroups of permutation groups with a cyclic regular normal subgroup. Our results, in particular, provide a classification of the minimal nontrivial one-dimensional affine association schemes which generalizes the recent Muzychuk classification of the one-dimensional affine rank 3 graphs.</description>

      <title>Twisted conjugacy classes in Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider twisted conjugacy classes of continuous automorphisms $\varphi$ of a Lie group $G$. We obtain
  a necessary and sufficient condition on $\varphi$ for its Reidemeister number, the number of twisted conjugacy classes,
  to be infinite when $G$ is connected and solvable or compactly generated and nilpotent. We also show
  for a general connected Lie group $G$ that the number of conjugacy classes is infinite. We prove that for
  a connected non-nilpotent Lie group $G$, there exists $n\in\mathbb{N}$ such that Reidemeister number of $\varphi^n$ is infinite for every
  $\varphi$. We say that $G$ has topological $R_\infty$-property if the Reidemeister number of every $\varphi$ is infinite. We obtain
  conditions on a connected solvable Lie group under which it has topological $R_\infty$-property; which, in particular, enables us to
  prove that the group of invertible $n\times n$ upper triangular real matrices has this property for every $n\ge 2$. We show that
  $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ and $\mathrm{GL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ have topological $R_\infty$-property, and construct many examples of connected Lie groups
  with this property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skew braces are one of the main algebraic tools controlling the structure of a non-degenerate bijective set-theoretic solution of the Yang-Baxter equation. The aim of this paper is to study model-theoretically tame skew braces, with particular attention to the notions of solubility and nilpotency.</description>

      <title>Indecomposable non-degenerate 2-permutational solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a complete characterization of all indecomposable non-degenerate, not necessarily involutive, solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation of multipermutation level~2. We show that every such solution is a homomorphic image of a special, ``largest'' solution called \emph{the universal} one. On the other hand we prove that there is much simpler description. At first, on the product of a group $Z_n^2$ and an abelian group $G$, we construct some family of indecomposable non-degenerate solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation of multipermutation level $2$. Next, applying Rosenbaum's theorem of subgroups of a semidirect product and isolating a triple: a subgroup of $G$, a subgroup of $Z_n^2$ and one group homomorphism, we obtain a~full description of each epimorphism which gives the desired solutions. Such a construction provides a tool how to find (and possibly enumerate) all indecomposable non-degenerate solutions of multipermutation level $2$. We also argue that the automorphism group of the discussed solutions is regular.</description>

      <title>On rational and real elements in a class of Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a class of groups $G$ over a field $\mathbb{F}$, including certain Lie groups, Algebraic groups and finite groups, we develop a general method to determine rational and real elements, thereby unifying earlier group-specific results into a wider framework. As an application, we classify all real and rational elements in the semidirect product ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{R}) \ltimes \mathrm{Sym}^n(\mathbb{R}^2)$. Furthermore, for affine groups of the form ${\rm GL}(n,\mathbb{R}) \ltimes \mathbb{R}^n$, we show that if $x \in {\rm GL}(n,\mathbb{R})$ is rational, then $(x,v)$ is rational for every $v \in \mathbb{R}^n$.</description>

      <title>Answer to a Question of Hung and Tiep on Conductors of Cyclotomic Integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Question 5.2 of [5], Hung and Tiep asked the following: If $\alpha$ is a sum of $k$ complex roots of unity and $\mathbb{Q}_{c(\alpha)}$ is the smallest cyclotomic field containing $\alpha$, is it true that $|\mathbb{Q}_{c(\alpha)}:\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)| \leq k$? We answer this question in the negative. Using known results on minimal vanishing sums, we also characterize all cyclotomic integers with $k \leq 4$ for which the inequality fails. In \S 6, we bound the growth of $|\mathbb{Q}_{c(\alpha)}:\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)|$ as a function of $k$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We completely describe good involutions of free quandles and subquandles of twisted conjugation quandles of groups, including all Alexander quandles. As an application, we enumerate good involutions of linear quandles, and we provide explicit mappings for those up to order 23 via a computer search. Along the way, we completely characterize connected, involutory Alexander quandles, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Classification of Unitary Representations for E6(-14) via Root Embedding and $\theta$-Projection: A Rank-2 Reduction Framework with Sp(4)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classification of unitary representations for the non-compact real form E6(-14) of the exceptional Lie group E6 has long been hindered by computational bottlenecks due to its complex root system (72 roots) and large Weyl group (order 51840). This paper proposes a dimensional reduction method integrating root subsystem embedding, $\theta$-weight projection, and Langlands parameterization: by embedding the non-compact root subsystem of E6(-14) into the C2 root system of Sp(4), combined with weight space quotient (eliminating compact root redundancy), the problem is reduced from 6 dimensions to 2; the rationality of $\theta$-projection is verified from both algebraic and analytic perspectives, including analytic realization on representation spaces, redundancy of compact weight sublattices, and compatibility with analytic continuation of Langlands parameters; based on Langlands parameter restriction, the injectivity of representation correspondence and type preservation for discrete series, principal series, and complementary series are proven. This framework provides an algorithmic classification tool for E6(-14) unitary representations, which can be generalized to higher-rank exceptional groups.</description>

      <title>Hilbert transforms on Coxeter groups and groups acting on buildings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Hilbert transforms and their boundedness on $L_p$-spaces associated with Coxeter groups and groups acting on buildings. We establish new models for Hilbert transforms on these groups through the geometric objects they act on, and we show that these Hilbert transforms satisfy a Cotlar identity which was developed in earlier work of Mei and Ricard, and that of Gonz\'alez-P\'erez, Parcet and the second named author, thus conclude the $L_p$-boundedness. We manage to solve the problem firstly for the case when the Coxeter group satisfies a certain nested condition, and then extend it to any finitely generated Coxeter groups and groups that admit actions on buildings satisfying the nested condition. Our results give the first example of groups with property (F$\mathbb{R}$) on which $L_p$-bounded Hilbert transforms can be defined, and generalize the work of Gonz\'alez-P\'erez, Parcet and the second named author for groups acting on simplicial trees.</description>

      <title>On Graham's rearrangement conjecture over $\mathbb{F}_2^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A sequence $s_1,s_2,\ldots, s_k$ of elements of a group $G$ is called a valid ordering if the partial products $s_1, s_1 s_2, \ldots, s_1\cdots s_k$ are all distinct. A long-standing problem in combinatorial group theory asks whether, for a given group $G$, every subset $S \subseteq G\setminus \{\mathrm{id}\}$ admits a valid ordering; the instance of the additive group $\mathbb{F}_p$ is the content of a well-known 1971 conjecture of Graham. Most partial progress to date has concerned the edge cases where either $S$ or $G \setminus S$ is quite small. Our main result is an essentially complete resolution of the problem for $G=\mathbb{F}_2^n$: we show that there is an absolute constant $C&gt;0$ such that every subset $S\subseteq \mathbb{F}_2^n \setminus \{0\}$ of size at least $C$ admits a valid ordering. Our proof combines techniques from additive and probabilistic combinatorics, including the Freiman--Ruzsa theorem and the absorption method.
  Along the way, we also solve the general problem for moderately large subsets: there is a constant $c&gt;0$ such that for every group $G$ (not necessarily abelian), every subset $S \subseteq G\setminus \{\mathrm{id}\}$ of size at least $|G|^{1-c}$ admits a valid ordering. Previous work in this direction concerned only sets of size at least $(1-o(1))|G|$. A main ingredient in our proof is a structural result, similar in spirit to the Arithmetic Regularity Lemma, showing that every Cayley graph can be efficiently decomposed into mildly quasirandom components.</description>

Abstract: We look at isometric actions on arbitrary hyperbolic spaces of generalised Baumslag - Solitar groups of arbitrary dimension (the rank of the free abelian vertex and edge subgroups). It is known that being a hierarchically hyperbolic group is not a quasi-isometric invariant. We show that virtually being a hierarchically hyperbolic group is not invariant under quasi-isometry either, and nor is property (QT).</description>

Abstract: We prove that the word problem for the infinite cyclic group is not EDT0L, and obtain as a corollary that a finitely generated group with EDT0L word problem must be torsion. In addition, we show that the property of having an EDT0L word problem is invariant under change of generating set and passing to finitely generated subgroups. This represents significant progress towards the conjecture that all groups with EDT0L word problem are finite (i.e. precisely the groups with regular word problem).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00952v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The class-breadth conjecture of Leedham-Green, Neumann and Wiegold states that for each $p$-group, $cl(G)\leq b(G) + 1$, where $cl(G)$, $b(G)$ denote the nilpotency class and the breadth of $G$. While several counter-examples to this conjecture have been found for $p = 2$, it is still open in general for $p &gt; 2$. This article is dedicated to the general case $p &gt; 2$ of the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Remarks on discrete subgroups with full limit sets in higher rank Lie groups</title>

Abstract: We show that real semi-simple Lie groups of higher rank contain (infinitely generated) discrete subgroups with full limit sets in the corresponding Furstenberg boundaries. Additionally, we provide criteria under which discrete subgroups of $G = \operatorname{SL}(3,\mathbb{R})$ must have a full limit set in the Furstenberg boundary of $G$.
  In the appendix, we show the the existence of Zariski-dense discrete subgroups $\Gamma$ of $\operatorname{SL}(n,\mathbb{R})$, where $n\ge 3$, such that the Jordan projection of some loxodromic element $\gamma \in\Gamma$ lies on the boundary of the limit cone of $\Gamma$.</description>

      <title>On semigroups that are prime in the sense of Tarski, and groups prime in the senses of Tarski and of Rhodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If $\mathcal{C}$ is a category of algebras closed under finite direct products, and $M_\mathcal{C}$ the commutative monoid of isomorphism classes of members of $\mathcal{C},$ with operation induced by direct product, A.Tarski defined a nonidentity element $p$ of $M_\mathcal{C}$ to be prime if, whenever it divides a product of two elements in that monoid, it divides one of them, and called an object of $\mathcal{C}$ prime if its isomorphism class has this property.
  McKenzie, McNulty and Taylor ask whether the category of nonempty semigroups has any prime objects. We show in section 2 that it does not. However, for the category of monoids, and some other subcategories of semigroups, we obtain examples of prime objects in sections 3-4. In section 5, two related questions open so far as I know, are recalled.
  In section 6, which can be read independently of the rest of this note, we recall two related conditions that are called primeness by semigroup theorists, and obtain results and examples on the relationships among those two conditions and Tarski's, in categories of groups. Section 7 notes an interesting characterization of one of those conditions when applied to finite algebras in an arbitrary variety.
  Various questions are raised.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An explicit formula for the bracket of the exceptional simple Lie algebra E8 based on triality and oct-octonions is obtained, following the Barton-Sudbery description of E8.</description>

      <title>A localization algebra approach to the Baum-Connes conjecture for extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For an extension $1\rightarrow N \rightarrow \Gamma \xrightarrow{q} \Gamma / N \rightarrow 1$ of discrete countable groups, it is known that the Baum-Connes conjecture with coefficients holds for $\Gamma$ if it holds for $\Gamma / N$ and $q^{-1}(F)$ for any finite subgroup $F$ of $\Gamma / N$. In this paper, we employ a localization algebra approach to prove this result.</description>

      <title>Splittings in a complete local ring and decomposition its group of units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(R,M,k)$ be a complete local ring (not necessarily Noetherian). Then we prove that the natural surjective ring map $R\rightarrow k$ admits a splitting if and only if $\Char(R)=\Char(k)$. In addition, if $\Char(R)\neq\Char(k)$, then we prove that the natural surjective map between the groups of units $R^{\ast}\rightarrow k^{\ast}$ admits a splitting. As an application of this theorem, we show that the following short exact sequence of Abelian groups: $$\xymatrix{1\ar[r]&amp;1+M\ar[r]&amp; R^{\ast}\ar[r]&amp;k^{\ast} \ar[r]&amp;1}$$ is always split. We also show with an example that the above exact sequence does not split for many incomplete local rings.</description>
