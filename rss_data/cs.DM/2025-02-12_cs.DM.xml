      <title>Minimal non-comparability graphs and semi-transitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of word-representable graphs has been widely explored in the literature. The class of word-representable graphs is characterized by the existence of a semi-transitive orientation. Specifically, a graph is word-representable if and only if it admits such an orientation. Comparability graphs form a subclass of word-representable graphs. Both word-representable and comparability graphs belong to hereditary graph classes. Every hereditary class can be characterized in terms of their forbidden induced subgraphs. The minimal forbidden induced subgraphs of comparability graphs and word-representable graphs are referred to as minimal non-comparability graphs and minimal non-word-representable graphs, respectively.
  While the complete set of minimal non-comparability graphs is known, identifying the set of all minimal non-word-representable graphs remains an open problem. In this paper, we precisely determine the set of all minimal non-comparability graphs that are minimal non-word-representable graphs as well. To achieve this, we categorize all minimal non-comparability graphs into those that are semi-transitive and those that are not.
  Furthermore, as a byproduct of our classification, we establish a characterization and a complete list of minimal non-word-representable graphs that contain an all-adjacent vertex. This is accomplished by introducing an all-adjacent vertex to each minimal non-comparability graph that is semi-transitive. As a result of our study, we identify several infinite families of minimal non-word-representable graphs, expanding the understanding of their structural properties.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Search on a Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the diverse set of technologies used in underground object detection and imaging, we introduce a novel multimodal linear search problem whereby a single searcher starts at the origin and must find a target that can only be detected when the searcher moves through its location using the correct of $p$ possible search modes.
  The target's location, its distance $d$ from the origin, and the correct search mode are all initially unknown to the searcher. We prove tight upper and lower bounds on the competitive ratio for this problem. Specifically, we show that when $p$ is odd, the optimal competitive ratio is given by $2p+3+\sqrt{8(p+1)}$, whereas when $p$ is even, the optimal competitive ratio is given by $c$: the unique solution to $(c-1)^4-4p(c+1)^2(c-p-1)=0$ in the interval $\left[2p+1+\sqrt{8p},\infty\right)$. This solution $c$ has the explicit bounds $2p+3+\sqrt{8(p-1)}\leq c\leq 2p+3+\sqrt{8p}$. The optimal algorithms we propose require the searcher to move infinitesimal distances and change directions infinitely many times within finite intervals. To better suit practical applications, we also propose an approximation algorithm with a competitive ratio of $c+\varepsilon$ (where $c$ is the optimal competitive ratio and $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ is an arbitrarily small constant). This algorithm involves the searcher moving finite distances and changing directions a finite number of times within any finite interval.</description>

      <title>Barbara Rokowska's combinatorial research with her extensive biography (1926--2012)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the significance of some interesting results by Barbara Rokowska about combinatorial constructions. Her interest in finite mathematics and number theory began with an embellishment and detailing of some work by Erdos. Rokowska and Schinzel then solved the problem posed by Paul Erdos concerning the existence of prime numbers of a certain kind. Her subsequent work highlighted the difficulty in constructing Steiner systems with certain properties and showed the importance of rigorous proof techniques in this area of mathematics. This is the first such summary of the main results obtained by Rokowska, her collaborators and PhD students.
  A biography of Barbara Rokowska has been added as an appendix.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Regret Concentration of UCB for Non-Deterministic State Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) has proven effective in solving decision-making problems in perfect information settings. However, its application to stochastic and imperfect information domains remains limited. This paper extends the theoretical framework of MCTS to stochastic domains by addressing non-deterministic state transitions, where actions lead to probabilistic outcomes. Specifically, building on the work of Shah et al. (2020), we derive polynomial regret concentration bounds for the Upper Confidence Bound algorithm in multi-armed bandit problems with stochastic transitions, offering improved theoretical guarantees. Our primary contribution is proving that these bounds also apply to non-deterministic environments, ensuring robust performance in stochastic settings. This broadens the applicability of MCTS to real-world decision-making problems with probabilistic outcomes, such as in autonomous systems and financial decision-making.</description>

      <title>Efficient Sparsification of Simplicial Complexes via Local Densities of States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simplicial complexes (SCs), a generalization of graph models for relational data that account for higher-order relations between data items, have become a popular abstraction for analyzing complex data using tools from topological data analysis or topological signal processing. However, the analysis of many real-world datasets leads to dense SCs with a large number of higher-order interactions. Unfortunately, analyzing such large SCs often has a prohibitive cost in terms of computation time and memory consumption. The sparsification of such complexes, i.e., the approximation of an original SC with a sparser simplicial complex with only a log-linear number of high-order simplices while maintaining a spectrum close to the original SC, is of broad interest.
  In this work, we develop a novel method for a probabilistic sparsifaction of SCs. At its core lies the efficient computation of sparsifying sampling probability through local densities of states as functional descriptors of the spectral information. To avoid pathological structures in the spectrum of the corresponding Hodge Laplacian operators, we suggest a "kernel-ignoring" decomposition for approximating the sampling probability; additionally, we exploit error estimates to show asymptotically prevailing algorithmic complexity of the developed method. The performance of the framework is demonstrated on the family of Vietoris--Rips filtered simplicial complexes.</description>

      <title>An efficient uniqueness theorem for overcomplete tensor decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a new, constructive uniqueness theorem for tensor decomposition. It applies to order 3 tensors of format $n \times n \times p$ and can prove uniqueness of decomposition for generic tensors up to rank $r=4n/3$ as soon as $p \geq 4$. One major advantage over Kruskal's uniqueness theorem is that our theorem has an algorithmic proof, and the resulting algorithm is efficient. Like the uniqueness theorem, it applies in the range $n \leq r \leq 4n/3$. As a result, we obtain the first efficient algorithm for overcomplete decomposition of generic tensors of order 3.
  For instance, prior to this work it was not known how to efficiently decompose generic tensors of format $n \times n \times n$ and rank $r=1.01n$ (or rank $r \leq (1+\epsilon) n$, for some constant $\epsilon &gt;0$). Efficient overcomplete decomposition of generic tensors of format $n \times n \times 3$ remains an open problem.
  Our results are based on the method of commuting extensions pioneered by Strassen for the proof of his $3n/2$ lower bound on tensor rank and border rank. In particular, we rely on an algorithm for the computation of commuting extensions recently proposed in a companion paper, and on the classical diagonalization-based "Jennrich algorithm" for undercomplete tensor decomposition.
  This is an updated version of a paper presented at SODA 2025. As a new result, we answer a question from that paper by giving a NP-hardness result for the computation of commuting extensions. The proof relies on a recent construction by Shitov. After the paper appearing in the SODA proceedings was written, another algorithm for the overcomplete decomposition of generic tensors of order~3 was proposed by Kothari, Moitra and Wein.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks and (Virtual) Extended Formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks with piecewise linear activation functions, such as rectified linear units (ReLU) or maxout, are among the most fundamental models in modern machine learning. We make a step towards proving lower bounds on the size of such neural networks by linking their representative capabilities to the notion of the extension complexity $\mathrm{xc}(P)$ of a polytope $P$. This is a well-studied quantity in combinatorial optimization and polyhedral geometry describing the number of inequalities needed to model $P$ as a linear program. We show that $\mathrm{xc}(P)$ is a lower bound on the size of any monotone or input-convex neural network that solves the linear optimization problem over $P$. This implies exponential lower bounds on such neural networks for a variety of problems, including the polynomially solvable maximum weight matching problem.
  In an attempt to prove similar bounds also for general neural networks, we introduce the notion of virtual extension complexity $\mathrm{vxc}(P)$, which generalizes $\mathrm{xc}(P)$ and describes the number of inequalities needed to represent the linear optimization problem over $P$ as a difference of two linear programs. We prove that $\mathrm{vxc}(P)$ is a lower bound on the size of any neural network that optimizes over $P$. While it remains an open question to derive useful lower bounds on $\mathrm{vxc}(P)$, we argue that this quantity deserves to be studied independently from neural networks by proving that one can efficiently optimize over a polytope $P$ using a small virtual extended formulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cooperative 2-matching games are a generalization of cooperative matching games, where the value function is given by maximum-weight b-matchings, for a vertex capacity vector $b \leq 2$. We show how to separate over the core of 2-matching games in polynomial time, fixing a small flaw in the literature, and prove the existence of a compact extended formulation for it.</description>

      <title>Pessimistic bilevel optimization approach for decision-focused learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent interest in contextual optimization problems, where randomness is associated with side information, has led to two primary strategies for formulation and solution. The first, estimate-then-optimize, separates the estimation of the problem's parameters from the optimization process. The second, decision-focused optimization, integrates the optimization problem's structure directly into the prediction procedure. In this work, we propose a pessimistic bilevel approach for solving general decision-focused formulations of combinatorial optimization problems. Our method solves an $\varepsilon$-approximation of the pessimistic bilevel problem using a specialized cut generation algorithm. We benchmark its performance on the 0-1 knapsack problem against estimate-then-optimize and decision-focused methods, including the popular SPO+ approach. Computational experiments highlight the proposed method's advantages, particularly in reducing out-of-sample regret.</description>
