      <title>Field-induced spin dynamics in i-MAX Tb compound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive study of spin dynamics in the (Mo2/3Tb1/3)2AlC i-MAX compound using ac susceptibility measurements across a range of magnetic fields. Unique behaviors were observed, including spin dynamics in the kHz range between mu_0 H~0.2T-6T, indicating a non-trivial superparamagnetic state, suggesting that the compound acts as a transitional system within the i-MAX family, bridging stable spin-dynamic materials and fluctuation-dominated ones. Field- and frequency-dependent magnetic phase transitions, coupled with relaxation behaviors, reveal complex interactions between spin density waves and superparamagnetic components. These findings, corroborated by uSR studies, deepen our understanding of magnetic phase diagrams and field-induced phenomena in i-MAX systems, laying the groundwork for further exploration of their unique properties and applications.</description>

      <title>Striped Spin Density Wave in a Graphene/Black Phosphorous Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A bilayer formed by stacking two distinct materials creates a moir\'e lattice, which can serve as a platform for novel electronic phases. In this work we study a unique example of such a system: the graphene-black phosphorus heterostructure (G/BP), which has been suggested to have an intricate band structure. Most notably, the valence band hosts a quasi-one-dimensional region in the Brillouin zone of high density of states, suggesting that various many-body electronic phases are likely to emerge. We derive an effective tight-binding model that reproduces this band structure, and explore the emergent broken-symmetry phases when interactions are introduced. Employing a mean-field analysis, we find that the favored ground-state exhibits a striped spin density wave (SDW) order, characterized by either one of two-fold degenerate wave-vectors that are tunable by gating. Further exploring the phase-diagram controlled by gate voltage and the interaction strength, we find that the SDW-ordered state undergoes a metal to insulator transition via an intermediate metallic phase which supports striped SDW correlations. Possible experimental signatures are discussed, in particular a highly anisotropic dispersion of the collective excitations which should be manifested in electric and thermal transport.</description>

      <title>Weyl semimetallic, N\'eel, spiral, and vortex states in the Rashba-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of magnetic phases in the Hubbard model under strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling on a square lattice. By using Lanczos exact diagonalization and determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulations, we explore the emergence of various magnetic alignments as the ratio between the regular hopping amplitude, $t$, and the Rashba hopping term, $t_R$, is varied over a broad range of Hubbard interaction strengths, $U$. In the limit $t_R \rightarrow 0$, the system exhibits N\'eel antiferromagnetic order, while when $t \sim t_R$, a spiral magnetic phase emerges due to the induced anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. For $t_R &gt; t$, we identify the onset of a spin vortex phase. At the extreme limit $t = 0$($t_R \neq 0 $), we perform finite-size scaling analysis in the Weyl semimetal regime to pinpoint the quantum critical point associated with the spin vortex phase, employing sign-free quantum Monte Carlo simulations - the extracted critical exponents are consistent with a Gross-Neveu-type quantum phase transition.</description>

      <title>Quasi-two-dimensional magnetism and antiferromagnetic ground state in Li$_2$FeSiO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our experimental (neutron diffraction, M\"ossbauer spectroscopy, magnetic susceptibility, specific heat) and numerical studies on the evolution of short- and long-range magnetic order in $\gamma_{\rm II}$-Li\(_2\)FeSiO\(_4\) suggest a quasi-two-dimensional (2D) nature of magnetism. The experimental data obtained on single crystals imply long-range antiferromagnetic order below $T_{\rm N}= 17$~K. A broad maximum in magnetic susceptibility $\chi$ at $T_{\rm m}\simeq 28$~K, observation of magnetic entropy changes up to 100~K and anisotropy in $\chi$ are indicative of low-dimensional magnetism and suggest short-range magnetic correlations up to 200~K. Neutron diffraction shows that long-range antiferromagnetic order is characterised by the propagation vector k=(1/2,0,1/2). The ordered moment $\mu = 2.50(2) \mu_B$ /Fe, at $T = 1.5$~K, is along the crystallographic $a$-axis. This is consistent with the observed static hyperfine field of $B_{\rm hyp}=14.8(3)$\,T by M\"ossbauer spectroscopy which indicates significant orbital contributions. The temperature dependence of $B_{\rm hyp}$ yields the critical exponent $\beta=0.116(12)$ which is in the regime of the 2D Ising behaviour. LSDA+U studies exploiting the experimental spin structure suggest dominating magnetic exchange coupling within the $ac$-layers (i.e., $J_3\simeq -6$~K and $J_6\simeq-2$~K) while interlayer coupling is much smaller and partly frustrated. This confirms the 2D nature of magnetism and is in full agreement with the experimental findings.</description>

      <title>Ohm's law, Joule heat, and Planckian dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We will show that the Planckian dissipation observed in strange metals including cuprate superconductors can be attributed to the dissipation due to the gauge fluctuation of the Berry connection. In the due course, we revisit the well-studied dissipation problem, Joule heating by electric current in metallic wires. It is known that Poynting's theorem explains it in a strange manner: The energy for the Joule heat enters from the outside of the wire as radiation; and consumed in the wire. This explanation is rectified by considering the generation of the chemical potential gradient inside the wire by the battery connection. Then, the Joule heat is obtained as the energy of the emitted radiation from the wire with its energy supplied by the connected battery. We also examine discharging of a capacitor and supercurrent flow through the Josephson junction.</description>

      <title>Electronic band structures of topological kagome materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kagome lattice has garnered significant attention due to its ability to host quantum spin Fermi liquid states. Recently, the combination of unique lattice geometry, electron-electron correlations, and adjustable magnetism in solid kagome materials has led to the discovery of numerous fascinating quantum properties. These include unconventional superconductivity, charge and spin density waves (CDW/SDW), pair density waves (PDW), and Chern insulator phases. These emergent states are closely associated with the distinctive characteristics of the kagome lattice's electronic structure, such as van Hove singularities, Dirac fermions, and flat bands, which can exhibit exotic quasi-particle excitations under different symmetries and magnetic conditions. Recently, various quantum kagome materials have been developed, typically consisting of kagome layers stacked along the $z$-axis with atoms either filling the geometric centers of the kagome lattice or embedded between the layers. In this topical review, we begin by introducing the fundamental properties of several kagome materials. To gain an in-depth understanding of the relationship between topology and correlation, we then discuss the complex phenomena observed in these systems. These include the simplest kagome metal $T_3X$, kagome intercalation metal $TX$, and the ternary compounds $AT_6X_6$ and $RT_3X_5$ ($A$ = Li, Mg, Ca, or rare earth; $T$ = V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni; $X$ = Sn, Ge; $R$ = K, Rb, Cs). Finally, we provide a perspective on future experimental work in this field.</description>

      <title>Cavity Quantum Hall Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments, we study the coupling of quantum Hall (QH) hydrodynamics to quantum electrodynamics (QED) within a resonance cavity. In agreement with experimental observations, we find that the Hall conductivity remains unchanged. However, the coupling to the cavity induces a second-order quantum reactance effect, contributing distinctly to the longitudinal AC conductivity. This effect arises from the exchange of energy between the QH fluid and cavity photons. Beyond the topological response, we show that the cavity couples to collective excitations, resulting in a shift of the Kohn mode frequency. Our methods are broadly applicable to both integral and fractional QH liquids, and our results offer a universal perspective on the protection of topological properties against long-range interactions induced by electromagnetic cavity modes.</description>

      <title>Dissipation-enhanced non-reciprocal superconductivity: application to multi-valley superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We here propose and study theoretically a non-equilibrium mechanism for the superconducting diode effect, which applies specifically to the case where time-reversal-symmetry -- a prerequisite for the diode effect -- is spontaneously broken by the superconducting electrons themselves. We employ a generalized time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau formalism to capture dissipation effects in the non-equilibrium current-carrying state via phase slips and show that the coupling of the resistive current to the symmetry-breaking order is enough to induce a diode effect. Depending on parameters, the critical current asymmetry can be sizeable, asymptotically reaching a perfect diode efficiency; the competition of symmetry-breaking order, superconducting and resistive currents gives rise to rich physics, such as current-stabilized, non-equilibrium superconducting correlations. Although our mechanism is more general, the findings are particularly relevant to twisted trilayer and rhombohedral tetralayer graphene, where the symmetry-breaking order parameter refers to the imbalance of the two valleys of the systems.</description>

      <title>Visualization of intervalley coherent phase in PtSe2/HOPG heterojunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intervalley coherent (IVC) phase in graphene systems arises from the coherent superposition of wave functions of opposite valleys, whose direct microscopic visualization provides pivotal insight into the emergent physics but remains elusive. Here, we successfully visualize the IVC phase in a heterostructure of monolayer PtSe2 on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite. Using spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy, we observe a Root3 by Root3 modulation pattern superimposed on the higher-order moire superlattice of the heterostructure, which correlates with a small gap opening around the Fermi level and displays an anti-phase real-space conductance distribution of the two gap edges. Such modulation pattern and small-gap vanish on the heterostructure of monolayer PtSe2 on bilayer-graphene-covered SiC substrate, due to the increased carrier density in the bilayer graphene. We provide a theoretical mechanism that the Root3 by Root3 modulation pattern originates from the IVC phase of few-layer graphene, which is magnified by the higher-order moire superlattice. Our work achieves visualization of the IVC phase, and develops an avenue for its generation and amplification via a moir\'e interface.</description>

      <title>Reentrant topological phases and spin density wave induced by 1D moir\'e potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exotic topological and correlated phases induced by moir\'e potentials have recently been explored in 2D twisted bilayer graphene systems. Here we investigate spin-$1/2$ interacting fermionic atoms in the 1D moir\'e optical superlattice formed by the superposition of two commensurate potentials. We reveal the reentrant topological phases and periodic-moir\'e-spin density wave (PM-SDW) of the ground states in both non-interacting and interacting cases. The reentrant topological phases are driven by the moir\'e potential with the sequent trivial-topological-trivial-topological-trivial transition. The critical exponent of topological transitions and the localization properties of the single-particle eigenstates are studied. The PM-SDW order of the many-body ground state is contributed from the moir\'e potential, and is enhanced by the on-site interaction but suppressed by the nearest-neighbor interaction. Our results enrich the topological physics with multiple transitions and spin-density orders in 1D moir\'e systems, which might be experimentally realized with ultracold atoms in tunable optical lattices.</description>

      <title>The coherence peak of unconventional superconductors in the charge channel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we carry out a systematic investigation of the coherence peak in unconventional superconductors as they transition into the superconducting phase at $T_c$. Using $d$-wave cuprates as an example, we reveal the presence of a coherence peak below $T_c$ in the charge channel. The nuclear quadrupole relaxation rate is shown to be an effective method for detecting this unconventional coherence peak, with the superconducting coherence factor playing a pivotal role in its emergence. Additionally, we explore the influence of correlation effects, which further enhance this phenomenon. Extending our analysis, we demonstrate the existence of a similar coherence peak in ultrasonic attenuation and iron-based superconductors. Our findings offer a fresh perspective on probing superconducting gap symmetry in unconventional superconductors.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the theory of a generic rank-2 tensor field in three spacetime dimensions, which involves a symmetric tensor field transforming under infinitesimal diffeomorphisms, and a vector field, whose gauge transformation depends on a local vector parameter. The gauge fixing shows a non-trivial structure, and some non-intuitive possibilities are listed. Despite the fact that the theory is not topological, the energy-momentum tensor vanishes on-shell, which justifies the quasi-topological appellation we give to this theory. We show that the theory has three degrees of freedom. Moreover we find an interesting physical interpretation, which consists in a generalized planar electromagnetism and in the emergence of two vector charges with restricted mobility. These are typical fractonic behaviours which can be related to the so called traceless scalar and vector charge theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quenched randomness strongly affects properties of magnetic materials. Two-dimensional (2D) random singlet (RS) states emerge in random $J$-$Q$ model by destroying valence bond solid order with spatial randomness. We examine the 2D RS state in magnetic field with quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The magnetization and susceptibilities show power-law scaling with magnetic field at low temperature. Moreover, they show one-parameter scaling behavior with $B/T$, and the scaling functions are remarkably consistent with a phenomenological model of random spin pairs with a singular distribution of interactions. These universal scaling functions can be used to diagnose 2D RS states in experiments.</description>

      <title>External field induced metal-to-insulator transition in dissipative Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a non-equilibrium steady-state non-crossing approximation (NESS-NCA) impurity solver applicable to general impurity problems. The choice of the NCA as the impurity solver enables both a more accurate description of correlation effects with larger Coulomb interaction and scalability to multi-orbital systems. Based on this development, we investigate strongly correlated non-equilibrium states of a dissipative lattice system under constant electric fields. Both the electronic Coulomb interaction and the electric field are treated non-perturbatively using dynamical mean-field theory in its non-equilibrium steady-state form (NESS-DMFT) with the NESS-NCA impurity solver. We validate our implementation using a half-filled single-band Hubbard model attached to a fictitious free Fermion reservoir, which prevents temperature divergence. As a result, we identify metallic and insulating phases as functions of the electric field and the Coulomb interaction along with a phase coexistence region amid the metal-to-insulator transition (MIT). We find that the MIT driven by the electric field is qualitatively similar to the equilibrium MIT as a function of temperature, differing from results in previous studies using the iterative perturbation theory (IPT) impurity solver. Finally, we highlight the importance of the morphology of a correlated system under the influence of an electric field.</description>

      <title>On the Wiedemann-Franz law violation in Graphene and quark-gluon plasma systems</title>

Abstract: A comparative study of the thermodynamic and transport properties of the ultra-relativistic quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in Heavy ion collisions (HIC) with the "quasi-relativistic" massless electron-hole plasma in graphene sample has been performed. We observe that the enthalpy per net carrier density emerges as a useful physical quantity determining the hydrodynamic domain's transport variables. Lorenz ratio is defined as thermal to electrical conductivity ratio, normalized by temperature. In searching whether the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law is obeyed or violated by checking the Lorenz ratio as one or deviated from one, we find that the Lorenz ratio determined from the fluid-based framework will always be responsible for the violation of the WF law. The reason is the proportional relation between Lorenz ratio and enthalpy per particle in the fluid. Based on the experimental observation, graphene, and QGP, both systems at low net charge density, exhibit WF law violation due to their fluid nature. However, graphene at high net charge density obeys the WF law, followed by metals with high Fermi energy or density. It indicates a fluid to the non-fluid transition of the graphene system from low to high-density domain. In this regard, the fluid or non-fluid aspect of QGP at high density is yet to be explored by future facilities like Compressed Baryonic matter (CBM) and Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility (NICA) experiments.</description>

      <title>Linear-in-temperature conductance in two-dimensional electron fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08556v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear temperature dependence of transport coefficients in metals is often ascribed to non-Fermi-liquid physics. Here we demonstrate the $T$-linear behavior of nonlocal conductivity in a clean 2D electron fluid, where carrier collisions assist conduction and lead to hydrodynamic transport with conductance rather than resistance growing with temperature. The key aspect is the occurrence of multiple hydrodynamic modes representing odd-parity modulations of the Fermi surface evolving in space and time. A cascade of such modes results in a linear $T$ dependence that extends to lowest temperatures, as well as a Kolmogorov-like fractional power $-5/3$ scaling of conductivity vs. wavenumber. These dependences provide a smoking gun for nonclassical hydrodynamics driven by such modes, expected to be generic for 2D electron fluids with simple near-circular Fermi surfaces.</description>

      <title>Exciton Condensation in Landau Levels of Quantum Spin Hall Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study the quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) in a perpendicular magnetic field. In the noninteracting case, the QSHI with space inversion and/or uniaxial spin rotation symmetry undergoes a topological transition into a normal insulator phase at a critical magnetic field $B_{\rm c}$. The exciton condensation in the lowest Landau levels is triggered by Coulomb interactions in the vicinity of $B_{\rm c}$ at low temperature and spontaneously breaks the inversion and the spin rotation symmetries. We propose that the electron spin resonance spectroscopy with the ac magnetic field also aligned in the perpendicular direction can directly probe the exciton condensation order. Our results should apply to QSHIs such as the InAs/GaSb quantum wells and monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Polarization in One-dimensional Aperiodic Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14916v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By implementing a charge pumping scheme for one-dimensional aperiodic chains, we confirm the existence of topological phases in these systems whenever their finite-size realizations admit inversion symmetry. These phases are usually characterized by an anomalous edge response as a result of the bulk-boundary correspondence. We show that these signatures are all present in various chains, each representing a different class of structural aperiodicity: the Fibonacci quasicrystal, the Tribonacci quasicrystal, and the Thue-Morse chain. More specifically, we calculate three quantities: the Berry phase of the crystalline approximation of the finite-size systems, the polarization response to an inifintesimal static and constant electric field in systems with open boundary conditions, and the degeneracy of the entanglement spectrum. We find that all of them provide signatures of a topologically nontrivial phase.</description>

      <title>Protocols for Creating Anyons and Defects via Gauging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Creating and manipulating anyons and symmetry defects in topological phases, especially those with a non-Abelian character, constitutes a primitive for topological quantum computation. We provide a physical protocol for implementing the ribbon operators of non-Abelian anyons and symmetry defects. We utilize dualities, in particular the Kramers-Wannier or gauging map, which have previously been used to construct topologically ordered ground states by relating them to simpler states. In this work, ribbon operators are implemented by applying a gauging procedure to a lower-dimensional region of such states. This protocol uses sequential unitary circuits or, in certain cases, constant-depth adaptive circuits. We showcase this for anyons and defects in the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ toric code and $S_3$ quantum double. The general applicability of our method is demonstrated by deriving unitary expressions for ribbon operators of various (twisted) quantum doubles.</description>
