      <title>The characteristic sequence of the integers that are the sum of two squares is not morphic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(s_2(n))_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ be a $0,1$-sequence such that, for any natural number $n$, $s_2(n) = 1$ if and only if $n$ is a sum of two squares. In a recent article, Tahay proved that the sequence $(s_2(n))_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ is not $k$-automatic for any integer $k$, and asked if this sequence can be morphic. In this note, we give a negative answer to this question.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ be an algebraic closure of $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{Q}^{tr}$ be the subfield of $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ obtained by taking the union of all totally real number fields. For any prime $p\geq 3$, let $F_p/\mathbb{Q}$ be the Fermat curve of equation $x^p+y^p+z^p=0$. In 1996, Pop has shown that the field $\mathbb{Q}^{tr}$ is large. In particular, the set $F_p(\mathbb{Q}^{tr})$ of the points of $F_p$ rational over $\mathbb{Q}^{tr}$ is infinite. How to explicit non-trivial points $(xyz\neq 0$) in $F_p(\mathbb{Q}^{tr})$ ? If one has $p\geq 5$, it seems that the only points already known in $F_p(\mathbb{Q}^{tr})$ are those of $F_p(\mathbb{Q})$ and they are trivial. In this paper, we investigate this question in case $p=5$. There are no totally real fields whose degree over $\mathbb{Q}$ is at most $5$ over which $F_5$ has non-trivial points. We propose here to explicit infinitely many points of $F_5$ rational over totally real fields of degree $6$ over $\mathbb{Q}$.</description>

      <title>Irreducibility of three dimensional automorphic Galois representations over totally real fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\rho_\ell$ be a semisimple $\ell$-adic representation of a number field $K$ that is unramified almost everywhere. We introduce a new notion called weak abelian direct summands of $\rho_\ell$ and completely characterize them, for example, if the algebraic monodromy of $\rho_\ell$ is connected. If $\rho_\ell$ is in addition $E$-rational for some number field $E$, we prove that the weak abelian direct summands are locally algebraic (and thus de Rham). We also show that the weak abelian parts of a connected semisimple Serre compatible system form again such a system.
  Using our results on weak abelian direct summands, when $K$ is totally real and $\rho_\ell$ is the three-dimensional $\ell$-adic representation attached to a regular algebraic cuspidal automorphic, not necessarily polarizable representation $\pi$ of $\mathrm{GL}_3(\mathbb{A}_K)$ together with an isomorphism $\mathbb{C}\simeq \overline{\mathbb{Q}}_\ell$, we prove that $\rho_\ell$ is irreducible. We deduce in this case also some $\ell$-adic Hodge theoretic properties of $\rho_\ell$ if $\ell$ belongs to a Dirichlet density one set of primes.</description>

      <title>Statistics for Iwasawa invariants of elliptic curves, $\rm{III}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a prime $p\geq 5$, a conjecture of Greenberg predicts that the $\mu$-invariant of the $p$-primary Selmer group should vanish for most elliptic curves with good ordinary reduction at $p$. In support of this conjecture, I show that the $5$-primary Iwasawa $\mu$- and $\lambda$-invariants simultaneously vanish for an explicit positive density of elliptic curves $E_{/\mathbb{Q}}$. The elliptic curves in question have good ordinary reduction at $5$, and are ordered by their height. The results are proven by leveraging work of Bhargava and Shankar on the distribution of $5$-Selmer groups of elliptic curves defined over $\mathbb{Q}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce concise expressions for the complex Bessel integral that enables us to improve the spectral large sieve inequality of Watt for $\mathrm{PGL}_2 (\mathbb{Z}[i]) \backslash \mathrm{PGL}_2 (\mathbb{C})$. Our result is optimistic in the case when the average of spectral parameters is on a square centered at $(0, 0)$.</description>

      <title>Linear independence of $q$-analogue of the generalized Stieltjes constants over number fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we aim to extend the research conducted by Chatterjee and Garg in 2024, particularly focusing on the $q$-analogue of the generalized Stieltjes constants. These constants constitute the coefficients in the Laurent series expansion of a $q$-analogue of the Hurwitz zeta function around $s=1$. Chatterjee and Garg previously established arithmetic results related to $\gamma_0(q,x)$, for $q&gt;1$ and $0 &lt; x &lt;1$ over the field of rational numbers. Here, we broaden their findings to encompass number fields $\mathbb{F}$ in two scenarios: firstly, when $\mathbb{F}$ is linearly disjoint from the cyclotomic field $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_b)$, and secondly, when $\mathbb{F}$ has non-trivial intersection with $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_b)$, with $b \geq 3$ being any positive integer.</description>

      <title>On the solutions of the generalized Fermat equation over totally real number fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a totally real number field, and $ \mathcal{O}_K$ be the ring of integers of $K$. In this article, we study the asymptotic solutions of the generalized Fermat equation, i.e., $Ax^p+By^p+Cz^p=0$ over $K$ of prime exponent $p$, where $A,B,C \in \mathcal{O}_K \setminus \{0\}$ with $ABC$ is even (in the sense that $\mathfrak{P}| ABC$, for some prime ideal $\mathfrak{P}$ of $ \mathcal{O}_K$ with $\mathfrak{P} |2$). For certain class of fields $K$, we prove that the equation $Ax^p+By^p+Cz^p=0$ has no asymptotic solution in $K^3$ (resp., of certain type in $K^3$), under some assumptions on $A,B,C$ (resp., for all $A,B,C \in \mathcal{O}_K \setminus \{0\}$ with $ABC$ is even). We also present several purely local criteria of $K$ such that $Ax^p+By^p+Cz^p=0$ has no asymptotic solutions in $K^3$.</description>

      <title>Expansions in completions of global function fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that any power series over a finite field represents a rational function if and only if its sequence of coefficients is ultimately periodic. The famous Christol's Theorem states that a power series over a finite field is algebraic if and only if its sequence of coefficients is $p$-automatic. In this paper, we extend these two results to expansions of elements in the completion of a global function field under a nontrivial valuation. As application of our generalization of Christol's theorem, we answer some questions about $\beta$-expansions of formal Laurent series over finite fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain new bounds on some trilinear and quadrilinear character sums, which are non-trivial starting from very short ranges of the variables. An application to a modular analogue of a multiplicative hybrid problem of Iwaniec and S\'ark\"ozy (1987) is given. Moreover, we show that for all large primes $p$, there are primes $p_1, p_2, p_3$ of sizes $p^{{\frac 15}+\frac 1{1987}}$ such that $p_1p_2+p_3 $ is a quadratic non-residue modulo $p$, and there are also primes $q_1, q_2, q_3, q_4$ of sizes $p^{{\frac 18}+\frac 1{2024}}$ such that $q_1q_2+q_3 q_4 $ is a quadratic non-residue modulo $p$.</description>

Abstract: Given a binary quadratic form $F \in \mathbb{Z}[X, Y]$, we define its value set $F(\mathbb{Z}^2)$ to be $\{F(x, y) : (x, y) \in \mathbb{Z}^2\}$. If $F$ and $G$ are two binary quadratic forms with integer coefficients, we give necessary and sufficient conditions on $F$ and $G$ for $F(\mathbb{Z}^2) = G(\mathbb{Z}^2)$.</description>

      <title>Rational approximation of Euler's constant using multiple orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct new rational approximants to Euler's constant that improve those of Aptekarev et al. (2007) and Rivoal (2009). The approximants are given in terms of certain (mixed type) multiple orthogonal polynomials associated with the exponential integral. The dual family of multiple orthogonal polynomials leads to new rational approximants of the Gompertz constant that improve those of Aptekarev et al. (2007). Our approach is motivated by the fact that we can reformulate Rivoal's construction in terms of type I multiple Laguerre polynomials of the first kind by making use of the underlying Riemann-Hilbert problem. As a consequence, we can drastically simplify Rivoal's approach, which allows us to study the Diophantine and asymptotic properties of the approximants more easily.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an affirmative answer to the Grunwald problem for new families of non-solvable finite groups G, away from the set of primes dividing |G|. Furthermore, we show that such G verify the condition (BM), that is, the Brauer-Manin obstruction to weak approximation is the only one for quotients of SL_n by G. These new families include extensions of groups satisfying (BM) by kernels which are products of symmetric groups S_m, with $m\neq 2,6$, and alternating groups A_5. We also investigate (BM) for small groups by giving an explicit list of small order groups for which (BM) is unknown and we show that for many of them (BM) holds under Schinzel's hypothesis.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by Nakamura's work (arXiv:1305.0880) on $\epsilon$-isomorphisms for $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules over (relative) Robba rings with respect to the cyclotomic theory, we formulate an analogous conjecture for $L$-analytic Lubin-Tate $(\varphi_L,\Gamma_L)$-modules over (relative) Robba rings for any finite extension $L$ of $\mathbb{Q}_p.$ In contrast to Kato's and Nakamura's setting, our conjecture involves $L$-analytic cohomology instead of continuous cohomology within the generalized Herr complex. Similarly, we restrict to the identity components of $D_{cris}$ and $D_{dR},$ respectively. For rank one modules of the above type or slightly more generally for trianguline ones, we construct $\epsilon$-isomorphisms for their Lubin-Tate deformations satisfying the desired interpolation property.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by Berkovich's nine $q$-binomial identities involving the Legendre symbol $(\frac{d}{3})$, we establish a unified form of $q$-binomial identities of this type through a combinatorial approach. This unified form includes Berkovich's nine identities as special cases. Many such identities can be also deduced from this unified form.</description>

Abstract: We give a generalization of Goncharov's Hodge correlator twistor connection. Our generalized version is a connection 1-form with values in a DG Lie algebra of uni-trivalent graphs which may have loops and satisfies some Maurer--Cartan equation. This connection and the Maurer--Cartan equation can be viewed as an arithmetic analogue of effective action and quantum master equation respectively in non-acyclic Chern--Simons perturbation theory associated with the trivial local system.</description>

Abstract: We establish dimension formulas for the Witt vector affine Springer fibers associated to a reductive group over a mixed characteristic local field, under the assumption that the group is essentially tamely ramified and the residue characteristic is not bad. Besides the discriminant valuations that show up in classical works on the usual affine Springer fibers, our formula also involves the Artin conductors and the Kottwitz invariants of the relevant conjugacy classes.</description>

Frobenius' result states that for $|q|&lt;1$, $\lim_{q\to 1}(1-q)\sum_{n\geq 1} f(n) q^n $ is equal to the average value $\lim_{N\to \infty}$ $\frac{1}{N}\sum_{k=1}^{N}f(k)$ of the sequence $\{f(n)\}$ as $n\to \infty$, if the average value exists.</description>

      <title>Ramanujan-Shen's differential equations for Eisenstein series of level 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ramanujan (1916) and Shen (1999) discovered differential equations for classical Eisenstein series. Motivated by them, we derive new differential equations for Eisenstein series of level 2 from the second kind of Jacobi theta function. This gives a new characterization of a system of differential equations by Ablowitz-Chakravarty-Hahn (2006), Hahn (2008), Kaneko-Koike (2003), Maier (2011) and Toh (2011). As application, we show some arithmetic results on Ramanujan's tau function.</description>

      <title>Classicality of derived Emerton-Gee stack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05066v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a derived stack $\chi$ of Laurent $F$-crystals on $(\mathcal{O}_K)_{\mathbb{\Delta}}$, where $\mathcal{O}_K$ is the ring of integers of a finite extension $K$ of $\mathcal{Q}_p$. We first show that its underlying classical stack $^{\rm cl}\chi$ coincides with the Emerton-Gee stack $\chi_{\rm EG}$, i.e., the moduli stack of \'etale $(\phi, \Gamma)$-modules. Then we prove that this derived stack is classical in the sense that when restricted to truncated animated rings, $\chi$ is equivalent to the sheafification of the left Kan extension of $\chi_{\rm EG}$ along the inclusion from the classical commutative rings to animated rings.</description>

      <title>Numerical Investigations of the Keiper-Li Criterion for the Riemann Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06294v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Keiper-Li criterion gives a necessary and sufficient condition for the Riemann hypothesis. It requires that a set of quantities $\lambda_n$ be positive, and involves auxiliary constants $a_n$, known to be positive. A recently derived expression for the $a_n$ is used to provide accurate numerical values for the first four thousand $a_n$'s, and asymptotic expressions together with bounds for them are investigated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute a formula for the $a$-number of curve $\mathbb{X}$ given by the equation $y^{q^2 + q + 1} = x^{q^2 + 1} - x^q$ over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$. The $a$-number is an invariant of the isomorphism class of the $p$-torsion group scheme. In this paper, we compute a closed formula for the $a$-number of $\mathbb{X}$ using the action of the Cartier operator on $H^0(\mathbb{X}, \Omega^1)$.</description>

      <title>On the intersection of local Arthur packets for classical groups and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.10539v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, for symplectic and split odd special orthogonal groups, we develop an account of theory on the intersection problem of local Arthur packets. Specifically, following Atobe's reformulation on M{\oe}glin's construction of local Arthur packets, we give a complete set of operators on the construction data, based on which, we provide algorithms and Sage codes to determine whether a given representation is of Arthur type. Furthermore, for any representation $\pi$ of Arthur type, we give a precise formula for the set $$ \Psi(\pi)=\{ \text{local Arthur parameter }\psi \ | \ \text{the local Arthur packet } \Pi_{\psi} \text{ contains } \pi\}.$$
  Our results have many applications, including the precise counting of tempered representations in any local Arthur packet, specifying and characterizing "the" local Arthur parameter in $\Psi(\pi)$ for $\pi$, especially when $\pi$ belongs to several local Arthur packets but does not belong to any local $L$-packet of Arthur type.</description>

      <title>Multivariate elliptic kites and tetrahedral tadpoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.01962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work deals with two types of Feynman integrals in perturbative quantum field theory: the 2-loop 2-point kite, with 5 arbitrary internal masses, and its completion by a sixth propagator, to give a 3-loop tetrahedral tadpole, with 6 arbitrary masses. These general-mass cases cover broken and unbroken gauge theories, based on the Lie algebras U(1), SU(2) and SU(3), for the electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions. The elliptic substructure of these integrals should not be regarded as an obstruction. Rather, it is a bonus, thanks to the arithmetic-geometric mean of Gauss. Compact formulae are given, to handle all cases. Zero-mass limits are carefully considered. Anomalous thresholds of triangles in the kite pose no problem. The number theory of tadpoles is investigated, with intriguing results.</description>

      <title>Riemann zeros as quantized energies of scattering with impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct an integrable physical model of a single particle scattering with impurities spread on a circle. The $S$-matrices of the scattering with the impurities are such that the quantized energies of this system, coming from the Bethe Ansatz equations, correspond to the imaginary parts of the non-trivial zeros of the the Riemann $\zeta(s) $ function along the axis $\Re ( s )= \half$ of the complex $s$-plane. A simple and natural generalization of the original scattering problem leads instead to Bethe Ansatz equations whose solutions are the non-trivial zeros of the Dirichlet $L$-functions again along the axis $\Re (s) = \half$. The conjecture that all the non-trivial zeros of these functions are aligned along this axis of the complex $s$-plane is known as the Generalised Riemann Hypothesis (GRH). In the language of the scattering problem analysed in this paper the validity of the GRH is equivalent to the completeness of the Bethe Ansatz equations. Moreover the idea that the validity of the GRH requires both the duality equation (i.e. the mapping $s \rightarrow 1 - s$) and the Euler product representation of the Dirichlet $L$-functions finds additional and novel support from the physical scattering model analysed in this paper. This is further illustrated by an explicit counterexample provided by the solutions of the Bethe Ansatz equations which employ the Davenport-Heilbronn function $\CD (s) $, i.e. a function whose completion satisfies the duality equation $\chi(s) = \chi(1-s)$ but that does not have an Euler product representation. In this case, even though there are infinitely many solutions of the Bethe Ansatz equations along the axis $\Re (s) = \half$, there are also infinitely many pairs of solutions away from this axis and symmetrically placed with respect to it.</description>

      <title>On the arithmetic of the join rings over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a collection $\{ G_i\}_{i=1}^d$ of finite groups and a ring $R$, we have previously introduced and studied certain foundational properties of the join ring $\mathcal{J}_{G_1, G_2, \ldots, G_d}(R)$. This ring bridges two extreme worlds: matrix rings $M_n(R)$ on one end, and group rings $R[G]$ on the other. The construction of this ring was motivated by various problems in graph theory, network theory, nonlinear dynamics, and neuroscience. In this paper, we continue our investigations of this ring, focusing more on its arithmetic properties. We begin by constructing a generalized augmentation map that gives a structural decomposition of this ring. This decomposition allows us to compute the zeta function of the join of group rings. We show that the join of group rings is a natural home for studying the concept of simultaneous primitive roots for a given set of primes. This concept is related to the order of the unit group of the join of group rings. Finally, we characterize the join of group rings over finite fields with the property that the order of every unit divides a fixed number. Remarkably, Mersenne and Fermat primes unexpectedly emerge within the context of this exploration.</description>

      <title>Isocrystals and limits of rigid local Langlands correspondences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that, over a nonarchimedean local field, the rigid refined local Langlands correspondence and associated endoscopic character identities for connected reductive $G$ follow if one only has them for all such $G$ with connected center. The strategy is to construct a projective system of central extensions and then take limits of the Langlands correspondences (and endoscopic data) of each group in the system. As an application, we prove the equivalence of the rigid refined local Langlands correspondence and its analogue for isocrystals, generalizing the work of [Kal18] in the $p$-adic case.</description>

Abstract: We prove a conjecture of Guarnieri and Vendramin on the number of braces of a given order whose multiplicative group is a generalised quaternion group. At the same time, we give a similar result where the multiplicative group is dihedral. We also enumerate Hopf-Galois structures of abelian type on Galois extensions with generalised quaternion or dihedral Galois group.</description>

      <title>Uniform approximation of Betti numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05104v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that Lefschetz's principle of approximating the cohomology of a possibly singular affine scheme of finite type over a field by the cohomology of a suitable (thickening of a) hyperplane section can be made uniform: in the affine case, we can choose the hyperplane section independently of the cohomology. Using Jouanolou's trick, this gives a new way to bound the Betti numbers of quasi-projective schemes over a field, independently of the cohomology. This is achieved through a motivic version of Deligne's generic base change formula and an axiomatic presentation of the theory of perverse sheaves. These methods produce generating families of Voevodsky motivic sheaves that are realized in perverse sheaves over any base of equal characteristic.</description>

Abstract: In the paper, we searh for monochromatic infinite additive structures involving polynomials on $\mathbb{N}$. Ultimately, we can prove that for any $r\in \mathbb{N}$, any distinct natural numbers $a,b$ and any $2$-coloring of $\mathbb{N}$, there exist subsets $B,C\subset \mathbb{N}$ with $|B|=r$ and $|C|=\infty$ such that there exists a color containing $B+aC$ and $B+bC$. In fact, for the specific question considered by us, we give a complete answer.</description>

      <title>Good bounds for sets lacking skew corners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A skew corner is a triple of points in $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$ of the form $(x,y), (x, y + a)$ and $(x + a, y')$. Pratt posed the following question: how large can a set $A \subseteq [n] \times [n]$ be, provided it contains no non-trivial skew corner (i.e. one for which $a\not=0$)? We prove that $|A| \leq \exp(- c\log^c n) n^2$, for an absolute constant $c &gt; 0$, which, along with a construction of Beker, essentially resolves Pratt's question.
  Our argument is represents a two-dimensional variant of the method of Kelley and Meka, which they used to prove Behrend-type bounds in Roth's theorem. A very similar result was obtained independently and simultaneously by Jaber, Lovett and Ostuni.</description>

      <title>Strong bounds for skew corner-free sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications to matrix multiplication algorithms, Pratt asked (ITCS'24) how large a subset of $[n] \times [n]$ could be without containing a skew-corner: three points $(x,y), (x,y+h),(x+h,y')$ with $h \ne 0$. We prove any skew corner-free set has size at most $\exp(-\Omega(\log^{1/12} n))\cdot n^2$, nearly matching the best known lower bound of $\exp(-O(\sqrt{\log n}))\cdot n^2$ by Beker (arXiv'24). Our techniques generalize those of Kelley and Meka's recent breakthrough on three-term arithmetic progression (FOCS'23), answering a question of Beker (arXiv'24). We note that a similar bound was obtained concurrently and independently by Mili\'cevi\'c (arXiv'24).</description>
