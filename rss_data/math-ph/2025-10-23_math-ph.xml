      <title>Resonant Weighted Nonlocal Schr\"odinger Equation with Gauge Invariance, Conservation Laws and Measurable Phase Detuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a gauge-invariant Schr\"odinger-type evolution that combines (i) weighted local diffusion, (ii) symmetric nonlocal exchange through a kernel operator, and (iii) a mean-free phase-resonant drive. The resulting Resonant Weighted Nonlocal Schr\"odinger (RWNS) equation exactly conserves mass and, when the drive is absent, admits a Hamiltonian structure with energy conservation. Under standard assumptions on the weight, kernel, and nonlinearity, we establish local well-posedness in $H^1$ and provide defocusing conditions for global continuation. Linearization yields a dispersion relation in which the nonlocal kernel and the mean-free phase field contribute additively to a measurable spectral detuning. Building on this, we define two observables: a wavenumber-resolved detuning $\Delta\omega(k)$ and a kernel-contrast functional $\Xi[\psi]$ that isolates the nonlocal exchange. We outline feasible implementations in nonlinear-optical lattices and cavity-assisted cold-atom platforms, and discuss conceptual links to propagation-induced phase signatures in astrophysical media. The RWNS model thus offers a compact and analytically tractable framework that unifies weighted local dynamics, symmetric nonlocality, and a mean-free phase drive, yielding clear, testable predictions for laboratory measurements and, in principle, precision timing data.</description>

      <title>Foundations of Noncommutative Carrollian Geometry via Lie-Rinehart Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carroll manifolds offer an intrinsic geometric framework for the physics in the ultra-relativistic limit. The recently introduced Carrollian Lie algebroids are generalised to the setting of $\rho$-commutative geometry, (also known as almost commutative geometry), where the underlying algebras commute up to a numerical factor. Via $\rho$-Lie-Rinehart pairs, it is shown that the foundational tenets of Carrollian geometry have analogous statements in the almost commutative world. We explicitly build two toy examples: we equip the extended quantum plane and the noncommutative $2$-torus with Carrollian structures. This opens up the rigorous study of noncommutative Carrollian geometry via almost commutative geometry.</description>

      <title>On the maximum purity of absolutely separable bipartite states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the problem of determining the maximum purity for absolutely separable and absolutely PPT quantum states. From the geometric viewpoint, this problem is equivalent to asking for the exact Euclidean radius of the smallest ball around the maximally mixed state that encompasses the set of all absolutely separable or absolutely PPT states. Our results provide an analytic solution for two qubit states. Based on numerical computation, we propose a conjectured maximum purity for absolutely separable qubit-qudit states and absolutely PPT qutrit-qudit states.</description>

      <title>Resonance-induced nonlinear bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study nonlinear bound states -- time-harmonic and spatially decaying ($L^2$) solutions -- of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger / Gross--Pitaevskii equations (NLS/GP) with a compactly supported linear potential. Such solutions are known to bifurcate from the $L^2$ bound states of an underlying Schr\"odinger operator $H_V=-\partial_x^2+V$. In this article we prove an extension of this result: for the 1D NLS/GP, nonlinear bound states also arise via bifurcation from the scattering resonance states and transmission resonance states of $H_V$, associated with the poles and zeros, respectively, of the reflection coefficients, $r_\pm(k)$, of $H_V$. The corresponding resonance states are non-decaying and only $L^2_{\rm loc}$. In contrast to nonlinear states arising from $L^2$ bound states of $H_V$, these resonance bifurcations initiate at a strictly positive $L^2$ threshold which is determined by the position of the complex scattering resonance pole or transmission resonance zero.</description>

      <title>Identifying the simple finite-dimensional Lie algebras over $\mathbb{C}$ by means of simple sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel method of determining which Dynkin diagrams represent simple finite-dimensional Lie algebras over $\mathbb{C}$ is presented. It is based on a condition that is both necessary and sufficient for a suitably defined Cartan matrix to be expressible by scalar products in a Euclidean vector space. The sufficiency of this condition makes unnecessary subsequent verification of the existence of a Lie algebra or root system corresponding to each Dynkin diagram by explicit construction. The Dynkin diagrams are selected by examination of an easily calculated sequence of minors of a symmetrised Cartan matrix. These minors are mostly integers.</description>

      <title>Finsler geometry in anisotropic superconductivity: a Ginzburg-Landau approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a rigorous generalization of the classical Ginzburg--Landau model to smooth, compact Finsler manifolds without boundary. This framework provides a natural analytic setting for describing anisotropic superconductivity within Finsler geometry. The model is constructed via the Finsler--Laplacian, defined through the Legendre transform associated with the fundamental function F, and by employing canonical Finsler measures such as the Busemann--Hausdorff and Holmes--Thompson volume forms. We introduce an anisotropic Ginzburg--Landau functional for complex scalar fields coupled to gauge potentials and establish the existence of minimizers in the appropriate Finsler--Sobolev spaces by the direct method in the calculus of variations. Furthermore, we analyze the asymptotic regime as the Ginzburg--Landau parameter epsilon to 0 and prove a precise Gamma--convergence result: the rescaled energies converge to the Finslerian length functional associated with the limiting vortex filaments. In particular, the limiting vortex energy is shown to equal $\pi$ times the Finslerian length of the corresponding current, thereby extending the classical Bethuel--Brezis--He'lein result to anisotropic settings. These findings demonstrate that Finsler geometry unifies metric anisotropy and variational principles in gauge-field models, broadening the geometric scope of the Ginzburg--Landau theory beyond the Riemannian framework.</description>

      <title>Weight-dependent and weight-independent measures of quantum incompatibility in multiparameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiparameter quantum estimation faces a fundamental challenge due to the inherent incompatibility of optimal measurements for different parameters, a direct consequence of quantum non-commutativity. This incompatibility is quantified by the gap between the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound, which is not always attainable, and the asymptotically achievable Holevo bound. This work provides a comprehensive analysis of this gap by introducing and contrasting two scalar measures. The first is the weight-independent quantumness measure $R$, which captures the intrinsic incompatibility of the estimation model. The second is a tighter, weight-dependent measure $T[W]$ which explicitly incorporates the cost matrix $W$ assigning relative importance to different parameters. We establish a hierarchy of bounds based on these two measures and derive necessary and sufficient conditions for their saturation. Through analytical and numerical studies of tunable qubit and qutrit models with SU(2) unitary encoding, we demonstrate that the weight-dependent bound $C_{T}[W]$ often provides a significantly tighter approximation to the Holevo bound $C_{H}[W]$ than the $R$-dependent bound, especially in higher-dimensional systems. We also develop an approach based on $C_{T}[W]$ to compute the Holevo bound $C_{H}[W]$ analytically. Our results highlight the critical role of the weight matrix's structure in determining the precision limits of multiparameter quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Generalised Pinching Inequality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hayashi's Pinching Inequality, which establishes a matrix inequality between a semidefinite matrix and a multiple of its "pinched" version via a projective measurement, has found many applications in quantum information theory and beyond. Here, we show a very simple proof of it, which lends itself immediately to natural generalisations where the different projections of the measurement have different weights, and where the matrix inequality can be reversed. As an application we show how the generalised pinching inequality in the case of binary measurements gives rise to a novel gentle measurement lemma, where matrix ordering replaces approximation in trace norm.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative Gauge Theories: Yang-Mills extensions and beyond - An overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The status of several representative gauge theories on various quantum space-times, mainly focusing on Yang-Mills type extensions together with a few matrix model formulations is overviewed. The common building blocks are derivation based differential calculus possibly twisted and noncommutative analog of the Koszul connection. The star-products related to the quantum space-times are obtained from a combination of harmonic analysis of group algebras combined with Weyl quantization. The remaining problems inherent to gauge theories on Moyal spaces in their two different formulations are outlined. A family of gauge invariant matrix models on $\mathbb{R}^3_\lambda$, a deformation of $\mathbb{R}^3$ is presented among which a solvable model. The characterization of 11 new quantum Minkowski space-times through their $*$-algebras is given. A gauge theory of Yang-Mills type is constructed on one recently explored of these space-times and compared to its counterpart built on the popular $\kappa$-Minkowski.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider initial boundary value problems arising in mathematical models for joint motion of two immiscible viscous liquids in a pore space of the solid skeleton. First, we consider this physical process at the microscopic level (the pore size $\varepsilon$ is approximately 5-20 microns) governed by the model $\textbf{A}^{\varepsilon}$, consisting of Lame equations for the solid skeleton and the Stokes equations for the liquid components.
  Next, assuming the existence of a weak solution to the corresponding initial boundary value problem at the microscopic level for the model the $\textbf{B}^{\varepsilon}$, that approximate the model $\textbf{A}^{\varepsilon}$, and using the homogenization procedure we derive the Biot's model describing the physical process in consideration at the macroscopic level for two weakly viscous immiscible fluids in the elastic solid skeleton at the macroscopic level.</description>

      <title>The Eckhaus instability: from initial to final stages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A systematic analysis of the Eckhaus instability in the one-dimensional Ginzburg-Landau equation is presented. The analysis is based on numerical integration of the equation in a large (xt)-domain. The initial conditions correspond to a stationary, unstable spatially periodic solution perturbed by "noise." The latter consists of a set of spatially periodic modes with small amplitudes and random phases. The evolution of the solution is examined by analyzing and comparing the dynamics of three key characteristics: the solution itself, its spatial spectrum, and the value of the Lyapunov functional. All calculations exhibit four distinct, mutually agreed, well-defined regimes: (i) rapid decay of stable perturbations; (ii) latent changes, when the solution and the Lyapunov functional undergo minimal alterations while the Fourier spectrum concentrates around the most unstable perturbations; (iii) a phase-slip period, characterized by a sharp decrease in the Lyapunov functional; (iv) slow relaxation to a final stable state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a sextic tensor model where the interaction terms are given by all $O(N)^3$-invariant bubbles. The class of invariants studied here is thus a larger one that the class of the $U(N)^3$-invariant sextic tensor model. We implement the large $N$ limit mechanism for this general model and we explicitly identify the dominant graphs in the $1/N$ expansion. This class of dominant graphs contains tadpole graphs, melonic graphs but also new types of tensor graphs. Our analysis adapts the tensorial intermediate field method, previously applied only to the prismatic interaction, to all connected sextic interactions except the wheel interaction, which we treat separately using a cycle analysis.</description>

Abstract: We give a rigorous mathematical result, supported by numerical simulations, of the aggregation of a concentrated vortex blob with an underlying non-constant vorticity field: the blob moves in the direction of the gradient of the field. It is a unique example of a Lagrangian explanation of aggregation of vortex structures of the same sign in 2D inviscid fluids. The result is also extended to almost vertical vortex filaments in a (possibly thin) three-dimensional domain.</description>

      <title>A piecewise linear homeomorphism of the circle which is periodic under renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.05825v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of a piecewise linear homeomorphism $f$ of $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ which maps rationals to rationals, whose slopes are powers of $\frac{2}{3}$, and whose rotation number is $\sqrt{2}-1$. This is achieved by showing that a renormalization procedure becomes periodic when applied to $f$. Our construction gives a negative answer to a question of D. Calegari. When combined with work of the 2nd and 3rd authors, our result also shows that $F_{\frac{2}{3}}$ does not embed into $F$, where $F_{\frac{2}{3}}$ is the subgroup of the Stein-Thompson group $F_{2,3}$ consisting of those elements whose slopes are powers of $\frac{2}{3}$. Finally, we produce some evidence suggesting a positive answer to a variation of Calegari's question and record a number of computational observations.</description>

      <title>Universal distributions of overlaps from generic dynamics in quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10057v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the distribution of overlaps with the computational basis of a quantum state generated under generic quantum many-body chaotic dynamics, without conserved quantities, for a finite time $t$. We argue that, scaling time logarithmically with the system size $t \propto \log L$, the overlap distribution converges to a universal form in the thermodynamic limit, forming a one-parameter family that generalizes the celebrated Porter-Thomas distribution. The form of the overlap distribution only depends on the spatial dimensionality and, remarkably, on the boundary conditions. This picture is justified in general by a mapping to Ginibre ensemble of random matrices and corroborated by the exact solution of a random quantum circuit. Our results derive from an analysis of arbitrary overlap moments, enabling the reconstruction of the distribution. Our predictions also apply to Floquet circuits, i.e., in the presence of mild quenched disorder. Finally, numerical simulations of two distinct random circuits show excellent agreement, thereby demonstrating universality.</description>

      <title>Sarma-Bogomol'nyi equations in superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological defects occurring in nonlinear classical field theories are described by a system of second-order differential equations. A breakthrough was made in 1976 by E. B. Bogomoln'yi who demonstrated that in several field theories these equations can be reduced to first-order provided the coupling constants take on particular values. One of the examples involved a string in the Abelian Higgs model which is equivalent to the Abrikosov flux line of the Ginzburg-Landau theory of superconductivity. In a similar vein, in the 1966 textbook Superconductivity of Metals and Alloys P. G. de Gennes explained how to reduce the second-order Ginzburg-Landau equations to first-order at a particular value of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter by a method due to G. Sarma. We analyze the two ways of arriving at the first-order Sarma-Bogomol'nyi equations and conclude that while they both rely on the same operator identity, Sarma's method is free of the assumption that there is a topological defect. The implication is that Bogomol'nyi equations found in other field theories may be a source of a wider range of solutions beyond topological defects.</description>

      <title>Global Well-Posedness and Soliton Resolution for the Half-Wave Maps Equation with Rational Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03351v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the energy-critical half-wave maps equation: \[ \partial_t \mathbf{u} = \mathbf{u} \times |D| \mathbf{u} \] for $\mathbf{u} : [0, T) \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{S}^2$. Our main result establishes the global existence and uniqueness of solutions for all rational initial data $\mathbf{u}_0 : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{S}^2$. This demonstrates global well-posedness for a dense subset within the scaling-critical energy space $\dot{H}^{1/2}(\mathbb{R}; \mathbb{S}^2)$. Furthermore, we prove soliton resolution for a dense subset of initial data in the energy space, with uniform bounds for all higher Sobolev norms $\dot{H}^s$ for $s &gt; 0$.
  Our analysis utilizes the Lax pair structure of the half-wave maps equation on Hardy spaces in combination with an explicit flow formula. Extending these results, we establish global well-posedness for rational initial data (along with a soliton resolution result) for a generalized class of matrix-valued half-wave maps equations with target spaces in the complex Grassmannians $\mathbf{Gr}_k(\mathbb{C}^d)$. Notably, this includes the complex projective spaces $ \mathbb{CP}^{d-1} \cong \mathbf{Gr}_1(\mathbb{C}^d)$ thereby extending the classical case of the target $\mathbb{S}^2 \cong \mathbb{CP}^1$.</description>

      <title>The exact convex roof for GHZ-W mixtures for three qubits and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I present an exact solution for the convex roof of the square root of the threetangle for all states within the Bloch sphere. The working horse that optimal decompositions contain as many states from the zero-polytope as possible which can be called zero-state locking is proved and an inequality is derived which decides about the optimality of the decompositions under consideration here. The footprint of the measure of entanglement consists in a characteristic pattern for the fixed pure states on the surface which form the optimal solution. The solution is subject to transformation properties due to the SL-invariance of the entanglement measure.</description>

      <title>Chiral non-Abelian domain walls in the Ginzburg-Landau theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study chiral non-Abelian domain walls in a phase of unconventional vacua of the Ginzburg-Landau model for dense QCD, by considering a wider range of parameters space not directly deduced from QCD. The phase is characterized by asymmetric vacuum-expectation values (VEVs), for example with the left scalar field, corresponding to the left quark-quark condensate, having a nonvanishing VEV and the right field having a vanishing one. The domain wall soliton interpolates between this vacuum and another where the left and right scalar fields switch roles. We study this formal possibility, but not any mechanism to generate these vacua non-perturbatively at finite density or finite temperature. Using a strong-coupling, or sigma-model limit, we are able to reduce the full dynamical complex matrix valued equations of motion to the sine-Gordon, a generalization of the sine-Gordon and a generalization of the double sine-Gordon equations. In this limit, we prove nonexistence of domain walls in one of the vacua studied here and we find full numerical computations to converge to the sigma-model limit for many cases, with some exceptions that we discuss.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Properties of a Special Solution to the (3,4) String Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22646v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the asymptotic properties a special solution of the $(3,4)$ string equation, which appears in the study of the multicritical quartic $2$-matrix model. In particular, we show that in a certain parameter regime, the corresponding $\tau$-function has an asymptotic expansion which is `topological' in nature. Consequently, we show that this solution to the string equation with a specific set of Stokes data exists, at least asymptotically. We also demonstrate that, along specific curves in the parameter space, this $\tau$-function degenerates to the $\tau$-function for a tritronqu\'{e}e solution of Painlev\'{e} I (which appears in the critical quartic $1$-matrix model), indicating that there is a `renormalization group flow' between these critical points. This confirms a conjecture from [1].

Abstract: We present the explicit form of the "hatted star product" within the Cahill-Glauber correspondence framework, which is a commutative mapping of two Hilbert space operators that encodes the quantization prescription. It serves as the structural mirror to the star product, which encodes the noncommutative nature of quantum mechanics in phase space.</description>

      <title>Observability of Schr\"odinger propagators on tori in rough settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On tori of arbitrary dimensions, Schr\"odinger propagators with bounded potentials are conjectured to be observable from space-time domains of positive Lebesgue measure. We reduce this conjecture to certain integrability bounds for free Schr\"odinger waves, thereby proving the conjecture on the one-dimensional torus and producing new examples of observation domains. These bounds are far weaker than Bourgain's conjectured periodic Strichartz estimates, yet remain highly nontrivial.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Sum Rule from Higher-Form Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove an entanglement sum rule for $(d{-}1)$-dimensional quantum lattice models with finite abelian higher-form symmetries, obtained by minimally coupling a sector on $p$-simplices carrying a $p$-form $G$ symmetry to a sector on $(p{+}1)$-simplices carrying the dual $(d{-}p{-}2)$-form $\widehat G$ symmetry (with $\widehat G$ the Pontryagin dual of $G$). The coupling is introduced by conjugation with a symmetry-preserving operator $\mathcal{U}$ that dresses symmetry-invariant operators with appropriate Wilson operators. Our main result concerns symmetric eigenstates of the coupled model that arise by acting with $\mathcal{U}$ on direct-product, symmetric eigenstates of the decoupled model: provided a topological criterion formulated via the Mayer--Vietoris sequence holds for the chosen bipartition, $\mathcal{U}$ factorizes across the cut when acting on the symmetric state, and the bipartite entanglement entropy equals the sum of the entropies of the two sectors. The framework explains and generalizes known examples in fermion-$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory, identifies when topology obstructs the factorization, and provides a procedure to construct new examples by gauging higher-form symmetries.</description>
