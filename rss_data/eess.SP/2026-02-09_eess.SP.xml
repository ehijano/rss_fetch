      <title>PAPR Reduction in OFDM Systems Using Neural Networks: A Case Study on the Importance of Dataset Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [1], we introduced a NN designed to reduce the PAPR in OFDM systems. However, the original study did not include explicit generalization tests to assess how well the NN would perform on previously unseen data, which prevented a comprehensive evaluation of the model's robustness and applicability in diverse scenarios. To address this gap, we conducted additional generalization assessments, the results of which are presented in this case study. These results serve both to complement and to refine the original analysis reported in [1]. Most importantly, the overall conclusions of the initial study remain valid: the NN is still able to reduce the PAPR level to a desired reference value, also with a lower computational cost, confirming the effectiveness and practical applicability of the proposed method across a more generalized setting.</description>

      <title>Hybrid-Field Joint Channel and Visible Region Estimation for RIS-Assisted Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication systems, the large-scale RIS introduces pronounced geometric effects that lead to the coexistence of far-field and near-field propagation. Furthermore, random blockages induce spatial non-stationarity across the RIS array, causing signals from different scatterers to illuminate only partial regions, referred to as visible regions (VRs). This renders conventional far-field and fully visible array-based channel models inadequate and makes channel estimation particularly challenging. In this paper, we investigate the non-stationary cascaded channel estimation problem in a hybrid-field propagation environment, where the RIS-base station (BS) link operates in the far-field, while the user-RIS link exhibits near-field characteristics with partial visibility. To address the resulting high-dimensional and coupled estimation problem, a reduced-dimensional sparse bilinear representation is developed by exploiting the structural characteristics of the cascaded channel. In particular, a dictionary compression technique is proposed to represent the high-dimensional coupled dictionary using a low-dimensional polar-domain dictionary weighted by a visibility matrix, thereby significantly reducing the problem scale. Based on this representation, a turbo-structured joint Bayesian estimation (TS-JBE) approach is proposed to simultaneously estimate the channel gains, VRs, and off-grid parameters, thereby avoiding error propagation inherent in existing sequential methods. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the estimation accuracy compared with existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Xona Pulsar Single-Satellite Positioning: System Perspective and Experimental Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Xona is deploying Pulsar, a low Earth orbit (LEO) commercial navigation system designed to deliver resilient positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) where traditional solutions fall short. Pulsar satellites broadcast dedicated signals optimized for commercial users. This brings rapid geometry change, strong Doppler observability, and robust timing, enabling new approaches to positioning even when only one satellite is visible. Internet of Things (IoT) applications often prioritize availability over sub-meter accuracy in urban canyons, semi-indoor spaces, and other constrained environments. Many platforms are battery-powered, have strict size, weight, and power (SWaP) limits, and cannot support complex multi-sensor architectures. Leveraging LEO dynamics and signal strength, Pulsar can maintain navigation capability under these conditions without specialized user hardware.
  Here we present a single-satellite positioning (SSP) concept that uses available Pulsar measurements to estimate user position and receiver clock states without external aiding. Early in Pulsar deployment, only one or two satellites may be in view, yet this still benefits stationary or near-stationary users, including in semi-indoor and indoor settings. We discuss algorithmic details and system implications: SSP enables positioning with minimal satellite visibility, reduces reliance on dense constellations, and supports integration into resource-constrained platforms. We present simulation and live sky results. High-fidelity constellation simulations configured for Pulsar provide controlled performance assessment. We also present early findings from a Pulsar-enabled receiver using observations from the Pulsar-0 satellite on orbit. Preliminary tests demonstrate meter-level accuracy outdoors and indoors, highlighting potential under varied reception conditions.</description>

      <title>ARIS-RSMA Enhanced ISAC System: Joint Rate Splitting and Beamforming Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter proposes an active reconfigurable intelligent surface (ARIS) assisted rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system to overcome the fairness bottleneck in multi-target sensing under obstructed line-of-sight environments. Beamforming at the transceiver and ARIS, along with rate splitting, are optimized to maximize the minimum multi-target echo signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio under multi-user rate and power constraints. The intricate non-convex problem is decoupled into three subproblems and solved iteratively by majorization-minimization (MM) and sequential rank-one constraint relaxation (SROCR) algorithms. Simulations show our scheme outperforms nonorthogonal multiple access, space-division multiple access, and passive RIS baselines, approaching sensing-only upper bounds.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Pilot Estimation on LEO Satellite Signals for Enhanced SOP Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computation of positioning, navigation and timing (PNT) via signal of opportunity (SOP), where signals originally transmitted for communication, such as 5G, Wi-Fi, or DVB-S, are exploited due to their ubiquity and spectral characteristics, is an emerging research field. However, relying on these signals presents challenges, including limited knowledge of the signal modulation and the need to identify recurring sequences for correlation. We offer a guide to implement a receiver capable of capturing broadband downlink Ku-band signals from low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites (e.g., Starlink and OneWeb) and estimating the recurring symbols for SOP measurements. The methodology integrates recent approaches in the literature, highlighting the most effective aspects while guiding the replication of experiments even under limitations on the front-end gain and bandwidth. Using the proposed model, we can identify recurring symbols transmitted by Starlink satellites, which are then used to collect Doppler shift measurements over a 600 s interval. A position, velocity, and time (PVT) solution is also computed via least squares (LS), which achieves a positioning error of approximately 268 m after a post-fit refinement.</description>

      <title>Multi-Functional RIS-enabled Radar and Communication Coexistence: Channel Modeling and a Sub-6 GHz Indoor Measurement Campaign</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze a multi-functional reconfigurable intelligent surface (MF-RIS)-enabled radar and communication coexistence (RCC) system, detailing the key aspects of its phase synthesis codebook generation and the implemented localization algorithm for real-time user tracking based on density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN), which features a Kalman filter for the prediction of user mobility. We derived a 3GPP-compatible radar cross-section (RCS) and re-radiation pattern-based channel model for the described MF-RIS system, supplementing it with channel measurements. We obtained large and small-scale characteristics, including path loss, shadow fading, Rician K-factor, cluster powers, and RMS delay spread. The study finds that Sub-6 GHz indoor propagation is largely free of blind spots, even with a blocked line-of-sight (LoS) path. Therefore, the proposed channel model includes non-line-of-sight (NLoS) paths, including the ones created by the MF-RIS. We also performed an experimental evaluation of the channel throughput in a fifth generation (5G) new radio (NR) single user multiple-input-multiple-output (SU-MIMO) system, reporting a 74\% reduction in throughput variance and a 12.5\% sum-rate improvement within the MF-RIS near-field compared to the no-RIS setup. This result shows that the MF-RIS can minimize delay spread and increase the coherence bandwidth by creating virtual-LoS (vLoS) path for the moving user, thereby effectively hardening wireless MIMO channels.</description>

      <title>On the Design of an Optimal Multi-Tone Jammer Against the Wiener Interpolation Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of civilian and military communications, anti-jamming techniques are essential to ensure information integrity in the presence of malicious interference. A conventional time-domain approach relies on computing the Wiener interpolation filter to estimate and suppress the jamming waveform from the received samples. It is widely acknowledged that this method is effective for protecting wideband systems against narrowband interference. In this work, this paradigm is questioned through the design of a $K$-tone jamming waveform that is intrinsically difficult to estimate assuming a $L$-tap Wiener interpolation filter. This design relies on an optimization procedure that maximizes the analytical Bayesian mean squared error associated with the jamming waveform estimate. Additionally, an analytical proof is provided showing that a multi-tone jamming waveform composed of $L/2+1$ tones is sufficient to render the Wiener-filter-based anti-jamming module completely ineffective. The analytical results are validated through Monte Carlo simulations assuming both perfect knowledge and practical estimates of the correlation functions of the received signal.</description>

      <title>Bridging 6G IoT and AI: LLM-Based Efficient Approach for Physical Layer's Optimization Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the role of large language models (LLMs) in sixth-generation (6G) Internet of Things (IoT) networks and proposes a prompt-engineering-based real-time feedback and verification (PE-RTFV) framework that perform physical-layer's optimization tasks through an iteratively process. By leveraging the naturally available closed-loop feedback inherent in wireless communication systems, PE-RTFV enables real-time physical-layer optimization without requiring model retraining. The proposed framework employs an optimization LLM (O-LLM) to generate task-specific structured prompts, which are provided to an agent LLM (A-LLM) to produce task-specific solutions. Utilizing real-time system feedback, the O-LLM iteratively refines the prompts to guide the A-LLM toward improved solutions in a gradient-descent-like optimization process. We test PE-RTFV approach on wireless-powered IoT testbed case study on user-goal-driven constellation design through semantically solving rate-energy (RE)-region optimization problem which demonstrates that PE-RTFV achieves near-genetic-algorithm performance within only a few iterations, validating its effectiveness for complex physical-layer optimization tasks in resource-constrained IoT networks.</description>

      <title>UAV-Mounted Aerial Relays in Military Communications: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relays are pivotal in military communication networks, expanding coverage and ensuring reliable connectivity in challenging operational environments. While traditional terrestrial relays (TR) are constrained by fixed locations and vulnerability to physical obstructions, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted aerial relays (AR) offer a dynamic and flexible alternative by operating above obstacles and adapting to changing battlefield conditions. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of AR systems in military communications, presenting a detailed comparison between AR and TR paradigms and examining two specific AR technologies: active aerial relays (AAR) and aerial reconfigurable intelligent surface (ARIS) relays. The survey delves into their operation, benefits, challenges, and military applications, supported by a qualitative analysis across metrics such as coverage, flexibility, security, and cost. A novel multi-dimensional metric, the mission-critical relay effectiveness score (MCRES), is introduced as a quantitative method for evaluating relay suitability based on mission-specific weights for critical attributes like mobility, jamming resilience, deployment speed, stealth, coverage, and autonomy. Furthermore, we present Algorithm 1, a decision-making framework that leverages the MCRES to guide the systematic selection of the optimal relay type, AR or TR, and subsequently AAR or ARIS, tailored to the unique demands of a given military scenario, such as dynamic battlefield operations, electronic warfare, or covert missions. Finally, the paper addresses current implementation challenges and outlines promising future research directions to advance the deployment of robust and resilient UAV-mounted relay systems in contested military environments.</description>

      <title>AI-Generated Music Detection in Broadcast Monitoring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI music generators have advanced to the point where their outputs are often indistinguishable from human compositions. While detection methods have emerged, they are typically designed and validated in music streaming contexts with clean, full-length tracks. Broadcast audio, however, poses a different challenge: music appears as short excerpts, often masked by dominant speech, conditions under which existing detectors fail. In this work, we introduce AI-OpenBMAT, the first dataset tailored to broadcast-style AI-music detection. It contains 3,294 one-minute audio excerpts (54.9 hours) that follow the duration patterns and loudness relations of real television audio, combining human-made production music with stylistically matched continuations generated with Suno v3.5. We benchmark a CNN baseline and state-of-the-art SpectTTTra models to assess SNR and duration robustness, and evaluate on a full broadcast scenario. Across all settings, models that excel in streaming scenarios suffer substantial degradation, with F1-scores dropping below 60% when music is in the background or has a short duration. These results highlight speech masking and short music length as critical open challenges for AI music detection, and position AI-OpenBMAT as a benchmark for developing detectors capable of meeting industrial broadcast requirements.</description>

      <title>EEG-MACS: Manifold Attention and Confidence Stratification for EEG-based Cross-Center Brain Disease Diagnosis under Unreliable Annotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00734v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cross-center data heterogeneity and annotation unreliability significantly challenge the intelligent diagnosis of diseases using brain signals. A notable example is the EEG-based diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, which features subtler abnormal neural dynamics typically observed in small-group settings. To advance this area, in this work, we introduce a transferable framework employing Manifold Attention and Confidence Stratification (MACS) to diagnose neurodegenerative disorders based on EEG signals sourced from four centers with unreliable annotations. The MACS framework's effectiveness stems from these features: 1) The Augmentor generates various EEG-represented brain variants to enrich the data space; 2) The Switcher enhances the feature space for trusted samples and reduces overfitting on incorrectly labeled samples; 3) The Encoder uses the Riemannian manifold and Euclidean metrics to capture spatiotemporal variations and dynamic synchronization in EEG; 4) The Projector, equipped with dual heads, monitors consistency across multiple brain variants and ensures diagnostic accuracy; 5) The Stratifier adaptively stratifies learned samples by confidence levels throughout the training process; 6) Forward and backpropagation in MACS are constrained by confidence stratification to stabilize the learning system amid unreliable annotations. Our subject-independent experiments, conducted on both neurocognitive and movement disorders using cross-center corpora, have demonstrated superior performance compared to existing related algorithms. This work not only improves EEG-based diagnostics for cross-center and small-setting brain diseases but also offers insights into extending MACS techniques to other data analyses, tackling data heterogeneity and annotation unreliability in multimedia and multimodal content understanding.</description>

      <title>Path Evolution Model for Endogenous Channel Digital Twin towards 6G Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) is critical for boosting 6G wireless network capacity. Nevertheless, high dimensional Channel State Information (CSI) acquisition becomes the bottleneck of 6G massive MIMO system. Recently, Channel Digital Twin (CDT), which replicates physical entities in wireless channels, has been proposed, providing site-specific prior knowledge for CSI acquisition. However, external devices (e.g., cameras and GPS devices) cannot always be integrated into existing communication systems, nor are they universally available across all scenarios. Moreover, the trained CDT model cannot be directly applied in new environments, which lacks environmental generalizability. To this end, Path Evolution Model (PEM) is proposed as an alternative CDT to reflect physical path evolutions from consecutive channel measurements. Compared to existing CDTs, PEM demonstrates virtues of full endogeneity, self-sustainability and environmental generalizability. Firstly, PEM only requires existing channel measurements, which is free of other hardware devices and can be readily deployed. Secondly, self-sustaining maintenance of PEM can be achieved in dynamic channel by progressive updates. Thirdly, environmental generalizability can greatly reduce deployment costs in dynamic environments. To facilitate the implementation of PEM, an intelligent and light-weighted operation framework is firstly designed. Then, the environmental generalizability of PEM is rigorously analyzed. Next, efficient learning approaches are proposed to reduce the amount of training data practically. Extensive simulation results reveal that PEM can simultaneously achieve high-precision and low-overhead CSI acquisition, which can serve as a fundamental CDT for 6G wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Time-Frequency Analysis of Non-Uniformly Sampled Signals via Sample Density Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The analysis of non-stationary signals in non-uniformly sampled data is a challenging task. Time-integrated methods, such as the generalised Lomb-Scargle (GLS) periodogram, provide a robust statistical assessment of persistent periodicities but are insensitive to transient events. Conversely, existing time-frequency methods often rely on fixed-duration windows or interpolation, which can be suboptimal for non-uniform data. We introduce the non-uniform Stockwell-transform (NUST), a time-frequency framework that applies a localized density adaptive spectral analysis directly to non-uniformly sampled data. NUST employs a doubly adaptive window that adjusts its width based on both frequency and local data density, providing detailed time-frequency information for both transient and persistent signals. We validate the NUST on numerous non-uniformly sampled synthetic signals, demonstrating its superior time-localization performance compared to GLS. Furthermore, we apply NUST to HARPS radial velocity data of the multi-planetary system HD 10180, successfully distinguishing coherent planetary signals from stellar activity.</description>

Abstract: It is well established that the performance of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted systems critically depends on the optimal placement of the RIS. Previous works consider either simple coverage maximization or simultaneous optimization of the placement of the RIS along with the beamforming and reflection coefficients, most of which assume that the location of the RIS, base station (BS), and users are known. However, in practice, only the spatial variation of user density and obstacle configuration are likely to be known prior to deployment of the system. Thus, we formulate a non-convex problem that optimizes the position of the RIS over the expected minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the system with user randomness, assuming that the system employs joint beamforming after deployment. To solve this problem, we propose a recursive coarse-to-fine methodology that constructs a set of candidate locations for RIS placement based on the obstacle configuration and evaluates them over multiple instantiations from the user distribution. The search is recursively refined within the optimal region identified in each stage to determine the final optimal region for RIS deployment. Detailed numerical results are presented to corroborate our findings.</description>

      <title>Generalizable Learning for Massive MIMO CSI Feedback in Unseen Environments</title>

Abstract: Deep learning is promising to enhance the accuracy and reduce the overhead of channel state information (CSI) feedback, which can boost the capacity of frequency division duplex (FDD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Nevertheless, the generalizability of current deep learning-based CSI feedback algorithms cannot be guaranteed in unseen environments, which induces a high deployment cost. In this paper, the generalizability of deep learning-based CSI feedback is promoted with physics interpretation. Firstly, the distribution shift of the cluster-based channel is modeled, which comprises the multi-cluster structure and single-cluster response. Secondly, the physics-based distribution alignment is proposed to effectively address the distribution shift of the cluster-based channel, which comprises multi-cluster decoupling and fine-grained alignment. Thirdly, the efficiency and robustness of physics-based distribution alignment are enhanced. Explicitly, an efficient multi-cluster decoupling algorithm is proposed based on the Eckart-Young-Mirsky (EYM) theorem to support real-time CSI feedback. Meanwhile, a hybrid criterion to estimate the number of decoupled clusters is designed, which enhances the robustness against channel estimation error. Fourthly, environment-generalizable neural network for CSI feedback (EG-CsiNet) is proposed as a novel learning framework with physics-based distribution alignment. Based on extensive simulations and sim-to-real experiments in various conditions, the proposed EG-CsiNet can robustly reduce the generalization error by more than 3 dB compared to the state-of-the-arts.</description>

      <title>Distributed Uplink Anti-Jamming in LEO Mega-Constellations via Game-Theoretic Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15557v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations have become vital in emerging commercial and defense Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs). However, their predictable orbital dynamics and exposed geometries make them highly susceptible to ground-based jamming. Traditional single-satellite interference mitigation techniques struggle to spatially separate desired uplink signals from nearby jammers, even with large antenna arrays. This paper explores a distributed multi-satellite anti-jamming strategy leveraging the dense connectivity and high-speed inter-satellite links of modern LEO mega-constellations. We model the uplink interference scenario as a convex-concave game between a desired terrestrial transmitter and a jammer, each optimizing their spatial covariance matrices to maximize or minimize achievable rate. We propose an efficient min-max solver combining alternating best-response updates with projected gradient descent, achieving fast convergence of the beamforming strategy to the Nash equilibrium. Using realistic Starlink orbital geometries and Sionna ray-tracing simulations, we demonstrate that while close-proximity jammers can cripple single-satellite links, distributed satellite cooperation significantly enhances resilience, shifting the capacity distribution upward under strong interference.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Evaluation of Noisy ICA Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08468v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was introduced in the 1980's as a model for Blind Source Separation (BSS), which refers to the process of recovering the sources underlying a mixture of signals, with little knowledge about the source signals or the mixing process. While there are many sophisticated algorithms for estimation, different methods have different shortcomings. In this paper, we develop a nonparametric score to adaptively pick the right algorithm for ICA with arbitrary Gaussian noise. The novelty of this score stems from the fact that it just assumes a finite second moment of the data and uses the characteristic function to evaluate the quality of the estimated mixing matrix without any knowledge of the parameters of the noise distribution. In addition, we propose some new contrast functions and algorithms that enjoy the same fast computability as existing algorithms like FASTICA and JADE but work in domains where the former may fail. While these also may have weaknesses, our proposed diagnostic, as shown by our simulations, can remedy them. Finally, we propose a theoretical framework to analyze the local and global convergence properties of our algorithms.</description>

      <title>Towards Scalable Multi-Chip Wireless Networks with Near-Field Time Reversal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17325v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of Wireless Network-on-Chip (WNoC) has emerged as a potential solution to address the escalating communication demands of modern computing systems due to its low-latency, versatility, and reconfigurability. However, for WNoC to fulfill its potential, it is essential to establish multiple high-speed wireless links across chips. Unfortunately, the compact and enclosed nature of computing packages introduces significant challenges in the form of Co-Channel Interference (CCI) and Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI), which not only hinder the deployment of multiple spatial channels, but also severely restrict the symbol rate of each individual channel. In this paper, we posit that Time Reversal (TR) could be effective in addressing both impairments in this static scenario, thanks to its spatiotemporal focusing capabilities even in the near-field. Through comprehensive full-wave simulations and bit error rate analysis in multiple chip layouts with multiple frequency bands, we provide evidence that TR can increase the symbol rate by an order of magnitude, enabling the deployment of multiple concurrent links and achieving aggregate speeds exceeding 100 Gb/s. Finally, we evaluate the impact of reducing the sampling rate of the TR filter on the achievable speeds, paving the way to practical TR-based wireless communications at the chip scale.</description>

      <title>Tokenizing Single-Channel EEG with Time-Frequency Motif Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16060v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models are reshaping EEG analysis, yet an important problem of EEG tokenization remains a challenge. This paper presents TFM-Tokenizer, a novel tokenization framework that learns a vocabulary of time-frequency motifs from single-channel EEG signals and encodes them into discrete tokens. We propose a dual-path architecture with time-frequency masking to capture robust motif representations, and it is model-agnostic, supporting both lightweight transformers and existing foundation models for downstream tasks. Our study demonstrates three key benefits: Accuracy: Experiments on four diverse EEG benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains across both single- and multi-dataset pretraining settings, achieving up to $11\%$ improvement in Cohen's Kappa over strong baselines. Generalization: Moreover, as a plug-and-play component, it consistently boosts the performance of diverse foundation models, including BIOT and LaBraM. Scalability: By operating at the single-channel level rather than relying on the strict 10-20 EEG system, our method has the potential to be device-agnostic. Experiments on ear-EEG sleep staging, which differs from the pretraining data in signal format, channel configuration, recording device, and task, show that our tokenizer outperforms baselines by $14\%$. A comprehensive token analysis reveals strong class-discriminative, frequency-aware, and consistent structure, enabling improved representation quality and interpretability.

      <title>Generative Diffusion Model Driven Massive Random Access in Massive MIMO Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12382v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Massive random access is an important technology for achieving ultra-massive connectivity in next-generation wireless communication systems. It aims to address key challenges during the initial access phase, including active user detection (AUD), channel estimation (CE), and data detection (DD). This paper examines massive access in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, where deep learning is used to tackle the challenging AUD, CE, and DD functions. First, we introduce a Transformer-AUD scheme tailored for variable pilot-length access. This approach integrates pilot length information and a spatial correlation module into a Transformer-based detector, enabling a single model to generalize across various pilot lengths and antenna numbers. Next, we propose a generative diffusion model (GDM)-driven iterative CE and DD framework. The GDM employs a score function to capture the posterior distributions of massive MIMO channels and data symbols. Part of the score function is learned from the channel dataset via neural networks, while the remaining score component is derived in a closed form by applying the symbol prior constellation distribution and known transmission model. Utilizing these posterior scores, we design an asynchronous alternating CE and DD framework that employs a predictor-corrector sampling technique to iteratively generate channel estimation and data detection results during the reverse diffusion process. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed approaches significantly outperform baseline methods with respect to AUD, CE, and DD.</description>

      <title>Mamba-FCS: Joint Spatio- Frequency Feature Fusion, Change-Guided Attention, and SeK Loss for Enhanced Semantic Change Detection in Remote Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semantic Change Detection (SCD) from remote sensing imagery requires models balancing extensive spatial context, computational efficiency, and sensitivity to class-imbalanced land-cover transitions. While Convolutional Neural Networks excel at local feature extraction but lack global context, Transformers provide global modeling at high computational costs. Recent Mamba architectures based on state-space models offer compelling solutions through linear complexity and efficient long-range modeling. In this study, we introduce Mamba-FCS, a SCD framework built upon Visual State Space Model backbone incorporating, a Joint Spatio-Frequency Fusion block incorporating log-amplitude frequency domain features to enhance edge clarity and suppress illumination artifacts, a Change-Guided Attention (CGA) module that explicitly links the naturally intertwined BCD and SCD tasks, and a Separated Kappa (SeK) loss tailored for class-imbalanced performance optimization. Extensive evaluation on SECOND and Landsat-SCD datasets shows that Mamba-FCS achieves state-of-the-art metrics, 88.62% Overall Accuracy, 65.78% F_scd, and 25.50% SeK on SECOND, 96.25% Overall Accuracy, 89.27% F_scd, and 60.26% SeK on Landsat-SCD. Ablation analyses confirm distinct contributions of each novel component, with qualitative assessments highlighting significant improvements in SCD. Our results underline the substantial potential of Mamba architectures, enhanced by proposed techniques, setting a new benchmark for effective and scalable semantic change detection in remote sensing applications. The complete source code, configuration files, and pre-trained models will be publicly available upon publication.</description>

      <title>Learning a distance measure from the information-estimation geometry of data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Information-Estimation Metric (IEM), a novel form of distance function derived from an underlying continuous probability density over a domain of signals. The IEM is rooted in a fundamental relationship between information theory and estimation theory, which links the log-probability of a signal with the errors of an optimal denoiser, applied to noisy observations of the signal. In particular, the IEM between a pair of signals is obtained by comparing their denoising error vectors over a range of noise amplitudes. Geometrically, this amounts to comparing the score vector fields of the blurred density around the signals over a range of blur levels. We prove that the IEM is a valid global distance metric and derive a closed-form expression for its local second-order approximation, which yields a Riemannian metric. For Gaussian-distributed signals, the IEM coincides with the Mahalanobis distance. But for more complex distributions, it adapts, both locally and globally, to the geometry of the distribution. In practice, the IEM can be computed using a learned denoiser (analogous to generative diffusion models) and solving a one-dimensional integral. To demonstrate the value of our framework, we learn an IEM on the ImageNet database. Experiments show that this IEM is competitive with or outperforms state-of-the-art supervised image quality metrics in predicting human perceptual judgments.</description>

      <title>Collective Noise Filtering in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex networks are powerful representations of complex systems across scales and domains, and the field is experiencing unprecedented growth in data availability. However, real-world network data often suffer from noise, biases, and missing data in edge weights, which undermine the reliability of downstream network analyses. Standard noise filtering approaches, whether treating individual edges one-by-one or assuming a uniform global noise level, are suboptimal, because in reality both signal and noise can be heterogeneous and correlated across multiple edges. As a solution, we introduce the Network Wiener Filter, a principled method for collective edge-level noise filtering that leverages both network structure and noise characteristics, to reduce error in the observed edge weights and to infer missing edge weights. We demonstrate the broad practical efficacy of the Network Wiener Filter in two distinct settings, the genetic interaction network of the budding yeast S. cerevisiae and the Enron Corpus email network, noting compelling evidence of successful noise suppression in both applications. With the Network Wiener Filter, we advocate for a shift toward error-aware network science, one that embraces data imperfection as an inherent feature and learns to navigate it effectively.</description>
