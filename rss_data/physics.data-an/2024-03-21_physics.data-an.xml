      <title>Characterizing unstructured data with the nearest neighbor permutation entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Permutation entropy and its associated frameworks are remarkable examples of physics-inspired techniques adept at processing complex and extensive datasets. Despite substantial progress in developing and applying these tools, their use has been predominantly limited to structured datasets such as time series or images. Here, we introduce the k-nearest neighbor permutation entropy, an innovative extension of the permutation entropy tailored for unstructured data, irrespective of their spatial or temporal configuration and dimensionality. Our approach builds upon nearest neighbor graphs to establish neighborhood relations and uses random walks to extract ordinal patterns and their distribution, thereby defining the k-nearest neighbor permutation entropy. This tool not only adeptly identifies variations in patterns of unstructured data, but also does so with a precision that significantly surpasses conventional measures such as spatial autocorrelation. Additionally, it provides a natural approach for incorporating amplitude information and time gaps when analyzing time series or images, thus significantly enhancing its noise resilience and predictive capabilities compared to the usual permutation entropy. Our research substantially expands the applicability of ordinal methods to more general data types, opening promising research avenues for extending the permutation entropy toolkit for unstructured data.</description>

      <title>Machine learning approach to detect dynamical states from recurrence measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We integrate machine learning approaches with nonlinear time series analysis, specifically utilizing recurrence measures to classify various dynamical states emerging from time series. We implement three machine learning algorithms Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine for this study. The input features are derived from the recurrence quantification of nonlinear time series and characteristic measures of the corresponding recurrence networks. For training and testing we generate synthetic data from standard nonlinear dynamical systems and evaluate the efficiency and performance of the machine learning algorithms in classifying time series into periodic, chaotic, hyper-chaotic, or noisy categories. Additionally, we explore the significance of input features in the classification scheme and find that the features quantifying the density of recurrence points are the most relevant. Furthermore, we illustrate how the trained algorithms can successfully predict the dynamical states of two variable stars, SX Her and AC Her from the data of their light curves.</description>
