      <title>On the Cosmological Constant-Graviton Mass correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relations between the graviton mass and the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ have led to some interesting implications. We show that in any approach which leads to a direct correlation between the graviton mass and $\Lambda$, either through direct substitution of gravitational coupling in dispersion relations or through the linearization of Einstein equations with massive spin-2 fields, the Compton wavelength of the graviton lies in the superhorizon scale. As a result any gravitational approaches where the graviton mass is related directly to the cosmological constant are of no observational significance.</description>

      <title>Stability in Cubic Metric-Affine Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the stability issue of the vector and axial modes of the torsion and nonmetricity tensors around general backgrounds in the framework of cubic Metric-Affine Gravity. We show that the presence of cubic order invariants defined from the curvature, torsion and nonmetricity tensors allow the cancellation of the well-known instabilities arising in the vector and axial sectors of quadratic Metric-Affine Gravity. For the resulting theory, we also obtain Reissner-Nordstr\"om-like black hole solutions with dynamical torsion and nonmetricity, which in general include massive tensor modes for these quantities, thus avoiding further no-go theorems that potentially prevent a consistent interaction of massless higher spin fields in the quantum regime.</description>

      <title>Bardeen Spacetime with Charged Dirac Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate soliton solutions in a system involving a charged Dirac field minimally coupled to Einstein gravity and the Bardeen field. We analyze the impact of two key parameters on the properties of the solution family: the magnetic charge $p$ of the Bardeen field and the electric charge $q$ of the Dirac field. We discover that the introduction of the Bardeen field alters the critical charge of the charged Dirac field. In reference [1], solutions named frozen stars are obtained when the magnetic charge is sufficiently large and the frequency approaches zero. In this paper, we define an effective frequency and find that, when the magnetic charge is sufficiently large, a frozen star solution can also be obtained, at which point the effective frequency approaches zero rather than the frequency itself.</description>

      <title>Gravitational entanglement witness through Einstein ring image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between quantum theory and gravity by exploring gravitational lensing and Einstein ring images in a weak gravitational field induced by a mass source in spatial quantum superposition. We analyze a quantum massless scalar field propagating in two distinct models of gravity: the first quantized Newtonian gravity (QG) model, which generates quantum entanglement between the mass source and other systems, and the Schr\"odinger-Newton (SN) gravity model, which does not produce entanglement. Visualizing the two-point correlation function of the scalar field, we find that the QG model produces a composition of multiple Einstein rings, reflecting the spatial superposition of the mass source. By contrast, the SN model yields a single deformed ring image, representing a classical spacetime configuration. Furthermore, we introduce a specific quantity named the which-path information indicator and visualize its image. The QG model again reveals multiple Einstein rings, while the image intensity in the SN model notably vanishes. Our findings provide a visual approach to witness gravity-induced entanglement through distinct features in Einstein ring images. This study advances our understanding of quantum effects in general relativistic contexts and establishes a foundation for future studies of other relativistic phenomena.</description>

      <title>The Image of Scalar Hairy Black Holes with Asymmetric Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black hole accretion disks are a fascinating topic in astrophysics, as they play a crucial role in several high-energy situations. This paper investigates the optical appearance of scalar hairy black holes (SHBHs) with asymmetric potential, a numerical solution obtained in Phys. Rev. D 73, 084002 (2006) and discussed in Phys.Rev.D 108 (2023) 4, 044020. Since the solution is spherically symmetric and surrounded by a thin accretion disk, we base our analysis on the work of J.~P. Lumininet (1979). We discuss the behavior of the effective potential for massive and massless particles, the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCO), and the photon sphere radius for different SHBHs. The study includes the plots of isoradial curves and spectral shifts arising from gravitational and Doppler shifts by considering direct and secondary images. Based on the work of Page and Thorne (1974), we also investigate the intrinsic intensity of radiation emitted by the disk at a given radius, which allows the calculation of the distribution of observed bolometric flux. We use the angular size of the shadow reported by the EHT for Sagittarius A* and M87* to constrain the SHBHs parameters.</description>

      <title>Detectability of Lensed Gravitational Waves in Matched-Filtering Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing by compact, small-scale intervening masses causes frequency-dependent distortions to gravitational-wave events. The optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is often used as a proxy for the detectability of exotic signals in gravitational-wave searches. In reality, the detectability of such signals in a matched-filtering search requires comprehensive consideration of match-filtered SNR, signal-consistency test value, and other factors. In this work, we investigate for the first time the detectability of lensed gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences with a match-filtering search pipeline, GstLAL. Contrary to expectations from the optimal-SNR approximation approach, we show that the strength of a signal (i.e., higher optimal SNR) does not necessarily result in higher detectability. We also demonstrate that lensed gravitational waves with wave optics effects can suffer significantly, from $~90\%$ (unlensed) to $&lt;1\%$ (lensed) detection efficiency, due to downranking by the signal-consistency test values. These findings stress the need to extend current template banks to effectively search for lensed gravitational waves and to reassess current constraints on compact dark matter scenarios.</description>

      <title>Hawking radiation at the zero temperature limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the thermal radiation derived by Hawking can be smoothly extended to the $T=0$ limit for Kerr black holes. The emission of the modes with $\omega &gt; m\Omega $ comes to a halt as the surface gravity vanishes. However, Kerr black holes smoothly continue to radiate both in bosonic and fermionic modes with $\omega &lt; m\Omega$, at the $T=0$ limit. We derive explicit expressions for the absorption probabilities which imply that the highest rate of emission pertains to the modes with $\omega=(m\Omega)/2$, both for bosonic and fermionic cases. At the zero limit of thermal radiation, the number of emitted particles vanishes as $\omega \to 0$, which strictly differentiates it from the non-thermal radiation of soft particles by extremal Kerr black holes. We also note that the thermal radiation at the zero limit, drives the black hole away from extremality in accord with the third law and the cosmic censorship conjecture</description>

      <title>Classification of ten-dimensional embeddings of spherically symmetric static metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The group-theoretic method for constructing symmetric isometric embeddings is used to describe all possible four-dimensional surfaces in flat $(1,9)$-dimensional space, whose induced metric is static and spherically symmetric. For such surfaces, we propose a classification related to the dimension of the elementary blocks forming the embedding function. All suitable 52 classes of embeddings are summarized in one table and analyzed for the unfolding property (wich means that the surface does not belong locally to some subspace of the ambient space), as well as for the presence of smooth embeddings of the Minkowski metric. The obtained results are useful for the analysis of the equations of motion in the Regge-Teitelboim embedding gravity, where the presence of unfolded embeddings of the Minkowski metric is essential.</description>

      <title>Spinning Particle Dynamics and ISCO in Covariant Loop Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the motion of spinning particles in the background of covariant loop quantum gravity black holes, focusing on two distinct effective metric solutions. Both metrics incorporate a quantum parameter $\zeta$, which quantifies loop quantum corrections. When $\zeta$ approaches zero, the spacetime reduces to the classical Schwarzschild solution. Using the pole-dipole approximation, we derive the equations of motion for spinning particles, accounting for the spin-curvature coupling. Our analysis reveals significant deviations in the behavior of the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO) due to quantum effects. In the first effective metric, as $\zeta$ increases, the ISCO's radial position shifts, and for sufficiently large values of $\zeta$ (greater than 4.55), the ISCO disappears, allowing particles to hover above the black hole or oscillate radially. In contrast, in the second metric, ISCOs persist even for large values of $\zeta$, albeit with a more restrictive spin range. These findings highlight the impact of loop quantum gravity corrections on the dynamics of spinning particles and provide insights into potential observational consequences for gravitational wave detections.</description>

      <title>Reanalyzing the ringdown signal of GW150914 using the F-statistic method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ringdown phase of a gravitational wave (GW) signal from a binary black hole merger provides valuable insights into the properties of the final black hole and serves as a critical test of general relativity in the strong-field regime. A key aspect of this investigation is to determine whether the first overtone mode exists in real GW data, as its presence would offer significant implications for our understanding of general relativity under extreme conditions. To address this, we conducted a reanalysis of the ringdown signal from GW150914, using the newly proposed F-statistic method to search for the first overtone mode. Our results are consistent with those obtained through classical time-domain Bayesian inference, indicating that there is no evidence of the first overtone mode in the ringdown signal of GW150914. However, our results show the potentiality of utilizing the F-statistic methodology to unearth nuanced features within GW signals, thereby contributing novel insights into black hole properties.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Lensing in the Kerr Spacetime: An Analytic Approach for Light and High-Frequency Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kerr spacetime is one of the most widely known solutions to Einstein's vacuum field equations and is commonly used to describe a black hole with mass $m$ and spin $a$. Astrophysical observations in the electromagnetic spectrum as well as detected gravitational wave signals indicate that it can be used to describe the spacetime around candidates for rotating black holes. While the geodesic structure of the Kerr spacetime is already well known for decades, using exact analytic solutions to the equations of motion for applications to astrophysical problems has only attracted attention relatively recently. Here, these applications mainly focus on predicting observations for the shadow, the photon rings, and characteristic structures in the accretion disk. Using the exact analytic solutions to investigate exact gravitational lensing of light and gravitational waves emitted by sources outside the accretion disk has only received limited attention so far. Therefore, the focus of this paper will be to address this question. For this purpose we assume that we have a standard observer in the domain of outer communication. We introduce a local orthonormal tetrad to relate the constants of motion of light rays and high-frequency gravitational waves detected by the observer to latitude-longitude coordinates on the observer's celestial sphere. In this parameterisation we derive the radius coordinates of the photon orbits and their latitudinal projections onto the observer's celestial sphere as functions of the celestial longitude. We use the latitude-longitude coordinates to classify the different types of motion, and solve the equations of motion analytically using elementary and Jacobi's elliptic functions as well as Legendre's elliptic integrals. We use the analytic solutions to write down an exact lens equation, and to calculate the redshift and the travel time.</description>

      <title>Extraction of gravitational wave signals in realistic LISA data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission is being developed by ESA with NASA participation. As it has recently passed the Mission Adoption milestone, models of the instruments and noise performance are becoming more detailed, and likewise prototype data analyses must as well. Assumptions such as Gaussianity, Stationarity, and continuous data continuity are unrealistic, and must be replaced with physically motivated data simulations, and data analysis methods adapted to accommodate such likely imperfections. To this end, the LISA Data Challenges have produced datasets featuring time-varying and unequal constellation armlength, and measurement artifacts including data interruptions and instrumental transients. In this work, we assess the impact of these data artifacts on the inference of Galactic Binary and Massive Black Hole properties. Our analysis shows that the treatment of noise transients and gaps is necessary for effective parameter estimation. We find that straightforward mitigation techniques can significantly suppress artifacts, albeit leaving a non-negligible impact on aspects of the science.</description>

      <title>Beyond Classical Thermodynamics: Insight into the Microstructures of Black Holes with Quantum-Triggered Violations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the microstructures of a charged AdS (Anti-de Sitter) black hole exhibiting quantum anomalies through the lens of Ruppeiner geometry. Previous research has established that black holes undergo $P$-$V$ phase transitions and exhibit critical phenomena near their critical points, characterized by four critical exponents that typically obey scaling laws predicted by mean-field theory. However, recent findings have revealed that black holes with quantum anomalies can violate these scaling laws. Motivated by these discoveries, we employ Ruppeiner geometry to probe the thermodynamic fluctuations and gain insights into the microstructure of such black holes. Our analysis aims to elucidate how quantum effects modify the microscopic properties of spacetime, offering a novel perspective on the understanding of black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show for the first time that rotating wormholes are capable of emitting a Poynting flux in the process of accreting magnetized matter. To this end, we analyze the Damour-Solodukhin metric describing a Kerr-type wormhole and calculate the electromagnetic flux assuming a specific geometry for the magnetic field contained by the wormhole ergosphere. We find that for highly rotating wormholes a mechanism similar to that of Blandford and Znajek is possible, and the emitted electromagnetic flux is of the same order as for a Kerr black hole.</description>

      <title>On-shell approach to scalar hair in spinning binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an on-shell description of spinning binary systems in gravitational theories where compact objects display scalar hair. The framework involves matter particles of arbitrary spin which, in addition to the minimal coupling to gravitons, are conformally coupled to a massless scalar mediating non-standard interactions. We use the unitary factorization techniques to derive the on-shell amplitudes relevant for emission of scalars and gravitons in matter scattering, paying attention to parametrize the freedom due to contact terms. Using the KMOC formalism, these amplitudes allow one to derive succinct expressions for the radiation waveforms at the leading post-Minkowskian order, together with the associated memory effects. Furthermore, we compute the power emitted via gravitational and scalar radiation in hyperbolic encounters of compact objects. After a continuation to bound orbits, these can be compared with the results obtained in specific scalar-tensor theories where black holes exhibit scalar hair, such as the scalar-Gauss-Bonnet or dynamical Chern-Simons theories. Finally, we identify possible deformations from the conformal coupling that can contribute to radiation observables at the same post-Newtonian order.</description>

      <title>Non-Newtonian corrections to radiative viscosity: Israel-Stewart theory as a viscosity limiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation is a universal friction-increasing agent. When two fluid layers are in relative motion, the inevitable exchange of radiation between such layers gives rise to an effective force, which tries to prevent the layers from sliding. This friction is often modeled as a Navier-Stokes shear viscosity. However, non-Newtonian corrections are expected to appear at distances of about one optical depth from the layers' interface. Such corrections prevent the viscous stress from becoming too large. Here, we set the foundations of a rigorous theory for these corrections, valid along incompressible flows. We show that, in the linear regime, the infinite Chapman-Enskog series can be computed analytically, leading to universal formulas for all transport coefficients, which apply to any fluid, with any composition, with radiation of any type (also neutrinos), and with nearly any type of radiative process. We then show that, with an appropriate shear-heat coupling coefficient, Israel-Stewart theory can correctly describe most non-Newtonian features of radiative shear stresses.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the usability of the gravitational wave detector LISA for studying the orientational distribution of compact white dwarf binaries in the Galactic bulge. We pay special attention to measuring the dipole pattern of the distribution around the Galactic rotation axis. Based on our new formulation, which leverages the parity properties of the involved systems, we found that the apparent thickness of the bulge in the sky becomes critical for the dipole measurement. We also discuss the extra-Galactic studies for black hole binaries and neutron star binaries with BBO/DECIGO.</description>

      <title>Exploring the effects of dark matter - dark energy interaction on cosmic evolution in viscous dark energy scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the influence of interactions between dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE) on the cosmic evolution of the Universe within a viscous dark energy (VDE) framework. Moving beyond traditional interacting dark energy (IDE) models, we propose a generalized IDE model adaptable to diverse IDE scenarios via IDE coupling parameters. In order to investigate deviations from $\Lambda$CDM across cosmic epochs by highlighting how viscous and the interactions between DM and DE impact cosmic density and expansion rates, we consider a model agnostic form of VDE. Eventually we perform a Bayesian analysis using the Union 2.1 Supernova Ia dataset and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to obtain optimal values of model parameters. This comprehensive analysis provides insights about the interplay between viscous and IDE in shaping the Universe's expansion history.</description>

      <title>The NANOGrav 15 yr Data Set: Harmonic Analysis of the Pulsar Angular Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing array observations have found evidence for an isotropic gravitational wave background with the Hellings-Downs angular correlations, expected from general relativity. This interpretation hinges on the measured shape of the angular correlations, which is predominately quadrupolar under general relativity. Here we explore a more flexible parameterization: we expand the angular correlations into a sum of Legendre polynomials and use a Bayesian analysis to constrain their coefficients with the 15-year pulsar timing data set collected by the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav). When including Legendre polynomials with multipoles $\ell \geq 2$, we only find a significant signal in the quadrupole with an amplitude consistent with general relativity and non-zero at the $\sim 95\%$ confidence level and a Bayes factor of 200. When we include multipoles $\ell \leq 1$, the Bayes factor evidence for quadrupole correlations decreases by more than an order of magnitude due to evidence for a monopolar signal at approximately 4 nHz which has also been noted in previous analyses of the NANOGrav 15-year data. Further work needs to be done in order to better characterize the properties of this monopolar signal and its effect on the evidence for quadrupolar angular correlations.</description>

      <title>Effective Actions for Domain Wall Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a systematic method to derive the effective action for domain walls directly from the scalar field theory that gives rise to their solitonic solutions. The effective action for the Goldstone mode, which characterizes the soliton's position, is shown to consist of the Nambu-Goto action supplemented by higher-order curvature invariants associated to its worldvolume metric. Our approach constrains the corrections to a finite set of Galileon terms, specifying both their functional forms and the procedure to compute their coefficients. We do a collection of tests across various models in $2+1$ and $3+1$ dimensions that confirm the validity of this framework. Additionally, the method is extended to include bound scalar fields living on the worldsheet, along with their couplings to the Goldstone mode. These interactions reveal a universal non-minimal coupling of these scalar fields to the Ricci scalar on the worldsheet. A significant consequence of this coupling is the emergence of a parametric instability, driven by interactions between the bound states and the Goldstone mode.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the scenario of a fluctuating spacetime due to a deformed commutation relation with a fluctuating deformation parameter, or to a fluctuating metric tensor. By computing the resulting dynamics and averaging over these fluctuations, we find that a system experiences a decoherence in the momentum basis. We studied the predictions of the model for a free particle and an harmonic oscillator. Using experimental data taken from a mechanical oscillator prepared in quantum states of motion, we put a bound on the free parameters of the considered model. In addition, we comment on how these measurements can also provide bounds to other phenomenological quantum gravity models, such as the length scale for nonlocal dynamics.</description>

      <title>General Principles of Hamiltonian Formulations of the Metric Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.01871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Principles of successful Hamiltonian approaches, which were developed to describe free gravitational field(s) in the metric gravity, are formulated and discussed. By using the standard $\Gamma-\Gamma$ Lagrangian ${\cal L}_{\Gamma-\Gamma}$ of the metric GR we properly introduce all momenta of the metric gravitational field and derive the both canonical $H_C$ and total $H_t$ Hamiltonians of the metric GR. We also developed an effective method which is used to determine various Poisson brackets between analytical functions of the basic dynamical variables, i.e., generalized coordinates $g_{\alpha\beta}$ and momenta $\pi^{\mu\nu}$. In general, such variables can be chosen either from the straight $\{ g_{\alpha\beta}, \pi^{\mu\nu} \}$, or dual $\{ g^{\alpha\beta}, \pi_{\mu\nu} \}$ sets of symplectic dynamical variables which always arise (and complete each other) in any Hamiltonian formulation developed for the coupled system of tensor fields. By applying canonical transformation(s) of dynamical variables we reduce the canonical Hamiltonian $H_C$ to its natural form. The natural form of canonical Hamiltonian provides numerous advantages in actual applications to the metric GR, since the general theory of dynamical systems with such Hamiltonians is well developed. Furthermore, many analytical and numerically exact solutions have been found and described in detail for dynamical systems with the Hamiltonians already reduced to their natural forms. In particular, reduction of the canonical Hamiltonian $H_C$ to its natural form allows one to derive the Jacobi equation for the free gravitational field(s), which takes a particularly simple form.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological relationship between eccentric and quasi-circular orbital binary black hole waveform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.11227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Eccentricity, an important parameter of gravitational waves, has been paid more and more attention because it can reflect the dynamics of compact object mergers. Obtaining an accurate and fast gravitational waveform template is of great significance for the estimation of gravitational wave parameters. This paper aims to do an extended study of the phenomenological fitting model proposed by Setyawati and Ohme for adding eccentricity to quasi-circular orbital waveforms. It can be applied to higher eccentricity up to e = 0.4. But the higher the eccentricity, the less the accuracy. For e in [0, 0.1], it gives an overlap of more than 99.99%. For e in [0.1, 0.2], it gives an overlap of more than 99.9%. For e in [0.2, 0.3], it gives an overlap of more than 99%. For e in [0.3, 0.4], it gives an overlap of more than 90%. The reason for these phenomena is that the larger the eccentricity, the larger the deviation of the eccentricity estimator from the cosine function due to the large change in the morphology of the eccentric waveform, and the worse the fitting effect of the model. It can be applied to higher-order modes and gives the same overlap behavior. After adding a shift parameter, it can be applied to spin-aligned or spin-antialigned waveforms. After obtaining spin-precessing effect, it can be applied to the spin-precessing case. In summary, non-spining, spin-aligned, spin-antialigned or spin-precessing waveforms with eccentricity can be constructed from quasi-circular non-spining waveforms by the phenomenological model, which is not only helpful for us to quickly construct phenomenological gravitational wave templates, but also reveals a phenomenological and universal relationship between eccentric waveform and quasi-circular orbital waveform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many articles have partially studied the configuration of eccentric orbital binary black hole (BBH) mergers. However, there is a scarcity of systematic and comprehensive research on the effect of eccentricity on BBH dynamics. Thanks to the rich and numerous numerical relativistic simulations of eccentric orbital BBH mergers from RIT catalog, this paper aims to investigate the impact of initial eccentricity $e_0$ on various dynamic quantities such as merger time $T_{\text{merger}}$, peak luminosity $L_{\text{peak}}$ of gravitational waves, recoil velocity $V_f$, mass $M_f$, and spin $\alpha_f$ of merger remnants. We cover configurations of no spin, spin alignment, and spin precession, as well as a broad parameter space of mass ratio ranging from 1/32 to 1 and initial eccentricity from 0 to 1. For non-spinning BBH with an initial coordinate separation of $11.3M$ ($M$ is the total mass of BBH), we make the first discovery of a ubiquitous oscillation in the relationship between dynamic quantities $L_{\text{peak}}$, $V_f$, $M_f$, $\alpha_f$, and initial eccentricity $e_0$. Additionally, at $24.6M$, we observe the same oscillation phenomenon in the case of mass ratio $q=1$, but do not see it in other mass ratios, suggesting that this oscillation will be evident in numerical simulations with sufficiently dense initial eccentricity. abbreviated</description>

      <title>Symplectic mechanics of relativistic spinning compact bodies II.: Canonical formalism in the Schwarzschild spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05049v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work constitutes the second part of a series of studies that aim to utilise tools from Hamiltonian mechanics to investigate the motion of an extended body in general relativity. The first part of this work [Refs. [1, 2]] constructed a ten-dimensional, covariant Hamiltonian framework encompassing all the linear-in-spin corrections to the geodesic motion in arbitrary spacetime. This framework was proven to be integrable in the Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes, specifically. The present work translates this abstract integrability result into tangible applications for linear-in-spin Hamiltonian dynamics of a compact object in a Schwarzschild spacetime. In particular, a canonical system of coordinates is constructed explicitly, which exploits the spherical symmetry of the Schwarzschild spacetime. These coordinates are based on a relativistic generalization of the classical Andoyer variables of Newtonian rigid body motion. This canonical setup allows us to derive ready-to-use formulae for action-angle coordinates and gauge-invariant Hamiltonian frequencies, which automatically include all linear-in-spin effects. No external parameters or ad hoc choices are necessary, and the framework can be used to find complete solutions by quadrature of generic (bound or unbound), linear-in-spin orbits, including orbital inclination, precession and eccentricity, as well as spin precession. The efficacy of the formalism is demonstrated here in the context of circular orbits with arbitrary spin and orbital precession, with the results validated against known results in the literature.</description>

Abstract: We study the effects of a finite mass for the photon on its propagation in a weak gravitational field. In particular, we analyse the gravitational time delay, also known as the Shapiro effect. We work in isotropic coordinates in the weak-field limit and find that the mass-dependent corrections enhance the gravitational time delay. Doppler-tracking data from the Cassini mission allow us to set an upper bound on the photon mass, namely $m_\gamma &lt; 4.9 \times 10^{-7} \, {\rm eV/c^2}$ at $95\%$ CL. We also discuss next-generation solar-system tests of general relativity that could improve this upper limit, potentially by a factor of ten. Though not competitive with the currently best limits, our bound is at the ballpark of earlier ones based on the gravitational bending of light by the Sun.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear effect of absorption on the ringdown of a spinning black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ringdown gravitational wave signal arising e.g., in the final stage of a black hole binary merger, contains important information about the properties of the remnant, and can potentially be used to perform clean tests of general relativity. However, interpreting the ringdown signal, in particular when it is the loudest, requires understanding the role of nonlinearities and their potential impact on modelling this phase using quasinormal modes. Here, we focus on a particular nonlinear effect arising from the change in the black hole's mass and spin due to the partial absorption of a quasinormal perturbation. We isolate and systematically study this third-order, secular effect by evolving the equations governing linear metric perturbations on the background of a spinning black hole, but allowing the properties of the background to evolve in a prescribed way. We find that this leads to the excitation of quasinormal modes with higher polar angular number, retrograde modes (counter-rotating with respect to the black hole), and overtones, as well as giving rise to a component of the signal at early times that cannot be fully described using quasinormal modes. Quantifying these effects, we find that they may be relevant in analyzing the ringdown in black hole mergers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Driven by advances in scattering amplitudes and worldline-based methods, recent years have seen significant progress in our ability to calculate gravitational two-body scattering observables. These observables effectively encapsulate the gravitational two-body problem in the weak-field and high-velocity regime (post-Minkowskian, PM), with applications to the bound two-body problem and gravitational-wave modeling. We leverage PM data to construct a complete inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform model for non-precessing spinning black holes within the effective-one-body (EOB) formalism: SEOBNR-PM. This model is closely based on the highly successful SEOBNRv5 model, used by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration, with its key new feature being an EOB Hamiltonian derived by matching the two-body scattering angle in a perturbative PM expansion. The model performs remarkably well, showing a median mismatch against 441 numerical-relativity (NR) simulations that is somewhat lower than a similarly calibrated version of SEOBNRv5. Comparisons of the binding energy with NR also demonstrate better agreement than SEOBNRv5, despite the latter containing additional calibration to NR simulations.</description>

      <title>The Tolman-Ehrenfest criterion of thermal equilibrium in scalar-tensor gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Tolman-Ehrenfest criterion for the thermal equilibrium of a fluid at rest in a static general-relativistic geometry is generalized to scalar-tensor gravity. Surprisingly, the gravitational scalar field, which fixes the strength of the effective gravitational coupling, does not play a role in determining thermal equilibrium. As a result, heat does not sink more in a gravitational field where gravity is stronger.</description>

      <title>Extracting overlapping gravitational-wave signals of galactic compact binaries: a mini review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) observations have provided a novel tool to explore the universe. In the near future, space-borne detectors will further open the window of low-frequency GW band where abundant sources exist and invaluable information for astrophysics, cosmology, and fundamental physics can be revealed. However, there are various new challenges in data analyses for space-borne detectors coming with the abundance of GW signals. For example, there are Galactic compact binaries (GCBs) with an overwhelming number that can produce continuous GW signals existing the entire mission time of detectors. The enormous overlapping GCB signals tangle and correlate with each other, and blend with other types of sources together in the observed data. Extracting source information from overlapping signals is one of the key problems for data analyses of space-borne detectors. In the paper, we present a review of currently available solutions for extracting overlapping GCB signals as thoroughly as possible aiming at promoting more interest in this question and inspiring further improvements. Current solutions can be roughly categorized by two classes, iterative subtraction and global fitting. There are diverse implementations of both strategies with enhancements focusing on different aspects. Meanwhile, the hybrid approach and the machine learning technique are also used in recent years. In the last, we also present an introduction of the stochastic foreground formed by unresolvable faint GCBs about its separation from extra-galactic backgrounds and its utility in exploring the properties of the Galaxy.</description>

Abstract: The findings discussed in "Apparent Horizons of the Thakurta Spacetime and the Description of Cosmological Black Holes" deviate from prior research, particularly our study in Phys. Rev. D 95, 084031 (2017). We clarify this inconsistency, which arises from employing a coordinate transformation covering a distinct region of spacetime -- specifically one considered inaccessible due to its location beyond a singularity, making it unreachable from infinity. Additionally, we provide a concrete example where the distinct horizons and spacetime regions are readily discernible.</description>

      <title>Exploring thermodynamics inconsistencies in unimodular gravity: a comparative study of two energy diffusion functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study the thermodynamics formulation for unimodular gravity under the election of two different models for the energy diffusion function. Such function encodes the current for the non-conservation of the energy-momentum tensor and is usually termed as $Q(t)$. In analogy to the cosmological scenario where the cosmic expansion is influenced by $Q(t)$, the thermodynamics implications in this scheme are also determined by the choice of the function $Q(t)$, as we discuss in the work. Specifically, we consider the barotropic and the continuous spontaneous localization models as energy diffusion functions, commonly used in the literature as viable candidates to face the well-known $H_{0}$ tension. The consistency conditions demanded for the entropy of the system in terms of the cosmological parameters of the model: positive production ($dS/dt&gt;0$) and convexity condition ($d^{2}S/dt^{2} &lt;0$), are investigated. We show that these conditions strongly constraint the viability of both models. Additionally, we comment about our results and compare with those obtained in recent works where the restriction of the parameters for these two diffusion models was implemented with the use of cosmological data.</description>

      <title>Black bounces in Cotton gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, J. Harada proposed a theory relating gravity to the Cotton tensor, dubbed as ''Cotton gravity'' (CG). This is an extension of General Relativity such that every solution of the latter turns out to be a solution of the former (but the converse is not true) and, furthermore, it is possible to derive the cosmological constant as an integration constant within it. In this work we investigate CG by coupling it to both non-linear electrodynamics (NLED) and scalar fields. We study static and spherically symmetric solutions implementing a bouncing behaviour in the radial function so as to avoid the development of singularities, inspired by the Simpson-Visser black bounce and the Bardeen model, both interpreted as magnetic monopoles. We identify the NLED Lagrangian density and the scalar field potential generating such solutions, and investigate the corresponding gravitational configurations in terms of horizons, behaviour of the metric functions, and regularity of the Kretchsman curvature scalar. Our analysis extends the class of non-singular geometries found in the literature and paves the ground for further analysis of black holes in CG.</description>

      <title>Perturbations of classical fields by gravitational shockwaves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational shockwaves are geometries where components of the transverse curvature have abrupt behaviour across null hypersurfaces, which are fronts of the waves. We develop a general approach to describe classical field theories on such geometries in a linearized approximation, by using free scalar fields as a model. Perturbations caused by shockwaves exist above the wave front and are solutions to a characteristic Cauchy problem with initial data on the wave front determined by a supertranslation of ingoing fields. A special attention is paid to perturbations of fields of pointlike sources generated by plane-fronted gravitational shockwaves. One has three effects: conversion of non-stationary perturbations into an outgoing radiation, a spherical scalar shockwave which appears when the gravitational wave hits the source, and a plane scalar shockwave accompanying the initial gravitational wave. Our analysis is applicable to gravitational shockwaves of a general class including geometries sourced by null particles and null branes.</description>

      <title>Traversable Wormholes with Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an exact, spherically symmetric, static solution of the Einstein field equations minimally coupled to a self-interacting scalar field. The solution does not exhibit any zero proper volume singularity at the centre, and therefore, curvature scalars are always regular. We study the property of radial null geodesics and derive that the metric can describe either a two-way or a one-way traversable wormhole depending on certain parameter ranges. Notably, it lacks a Schwarzschild limit. The scalar field exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking within the coordinate range where a wormhole throat forms. It can be seen as a suggestion that spontaneous symmetry breaking may act as a threshold for wormhole throat formation. Additionally, we compute the radius of the photon sphere, the Lyapunov exponent, the shadow radius, and the innermost stable circular orbits for this spacetime metric.</description>

      <title>The new higher-order generalized uncertainty principle and primordial big bang nucleosynthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As an important class of quantum gravity models, the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) plays an important role in exploring the properties of cosmology and its related problems. In this paper, we explore the influence of the higher-order GUP on the primordial big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). Firstly, based on a new higher-order GUP, we derived the Friedmann equations influenced by quantum gravity and the corresponding thermodynamic properties of the universe. Then, according to these modifications, we investigate BBN within the framework of GUP. Finally, combining the observational bounds of the primordial light element abundances, we constrain the bounds on deformation parameters of the new higher-order GUP. The results show that GUP has a significant effect on the BBN of the universe. Moreover, due to the unique properties of the higher-order GUP, it is found that value of the deformation parameter can be both positive and negative, which is different from the classical case.</description>

      <title>Studying radiation of a white dwarf star falling on a black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.11525v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate electromagnetic and gravitational radiation generated during a process of the tidal stripping of a white dwarf star circulating a black hole. We model a white dwarf star by a Bose-Fermi droplet and use the quantum hydrodynamic equations to simulate evolution of a black hole-white dwarf binary system. While going through the periastron, the white dwarf loses a small fraction of its mass. The mass falling onto a black hole is a source of powerful electromagnetic and gravitational radiation. Bursts of ultraluminous radiation are flared at each periastron passage. This resembles the recurrent flaring of X-ray sources discovered recently by Irwin {\it et al.}. Gravitational energy bursts occur mainly through emission at very low frequencies. The accretion disc, formed due to stripping of a white dwarf, starts at some point to contribute continuously to radiation of both electromagnetic and gravitational types.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.10215v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Riemannian Penrose Inequality holds for Asymptotically Flat $3$-manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature and connected horizon boundary, provided the optimal decay assumptions are met, which result in the $\mathrm{ADM}$ mass being a well-defined geometric invariant. Our proof builds on a novel interplay between the Hawking mass and a potential-theoretic version of it, recently introduced by Agostiniani, Oronzio and the third named author. As a consequence, we establish the equality between $\mathrm{ADM}$ mass and Huisken's Isoperimetric mass under the above sharp assumptions. Moreover, we establish a Riemannian Penrose Inequality in terms of the Isoperimetric mass on any $3$-manifold with nonnegative scalar curvature, connected horizon boundary, and which supports a well-posed notion of weak Inverse Mean Curvature Flow. In particular, such Isoperimetric Riemannian Penrose Inequality does not require the asymptotic flatness of the manifold. The argument is based on a new asymptotic comparison result involving Huisken's Isoperimetric mass and the Hawking mass.</description>

      <title>Measurement in Quantum Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The topic of measurement in relativistic quantum field theory is addressed in this article. Some of the long standing problems of this subject are highlighted, including the incompatibility of an instantaneous ``collapse of the wavefunction'' with relativity of simultaneity, and the difficulty of maintaining causality in the rules for measurement highlighted by ``impossible measurement'' scenarios. Thereafter, the issue is considered from the perspective of mathematical physics. To this end, quantum field theory is described in a model-independent, operator algebraic setting, on generic Lorentzian spacetime manifolds. The process of measurement is modelled by a localized dynamical coupling between a quantum field called the ``system'', and another quantum field, called the ``probe''. The result of the dynamical coupling is a scattering map, whereby measurements carried out on the probe can be interpreted as measurements of induced observables on the system. The localization of the dynamical coupling allows it to derive causal relations for the induced observables. It will be discussed how this approach leads to the concept of selective or non-selective system state updates conditioned on the result of probe measurements, which in turn allows it to obtain conditional probabilities for consecutive probe measurements consistent with relativistic causality and general covariance, without the need for a physical collapse of the wavefunction. In particular, the problem of impossible measurements is resolved. Finally, there is a brief discussion of accelerated detectors and other related work.</description>

Abstract: We investigate $T\bar{T}$ deformation on non-Hermitian coupled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model and the holographic picture. The relationship between ground state and thermofield double state is preserved under the $T\bar{T}$ deformation. We prove that $T\bar{T}$ deformed theory provides a reparameterization in large $N$ limit. These deformation effects is calculated numerically with green functions and free energy. The thermodynamic phase structures show the equivalence of the wormhole-black hole picture between non-Hermitian model and Hermitian model still holds under $T\bar{T}$ deformation. We also study the correlation function in Lorentz time and revival dynamic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16147v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The global isotropy of the universe is analyzed on the scale of the cosmic horizon, using the angular correlation function $C(\Theta)$ of cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature at large angular separation $\Theta$. Even-parity correlation $C_{even}(\Theta)$ is introduced as a direct, precise measure of horizon-scale cosmic anisotropy, independent of the unknown dipole. Correlation in maps from {\sl Planck} at $\Theta\simeq 90^\circ\pm 15^\circ$ is found to be much smaller than in any previous studies. Allowing for measurement errors introduced by Galaxy subtraction, it is shown to be consistent with zero, with an absolute value three to four orders of magnitude smaller than expected in standard theory. Such a small variation from zero is estimated to occur by chance in a fraction $\simeq 10^{-4.3}$ to $\simeq 10^{-2.8}$ of standard realizations. We also consider an alternative interpretation of this result, as a signature of a new causal symmetry of cosmological initial conditions. The measured zero-correlation angular interval is derived geometrically by assuming that quantum fluctuation states have spacelike coherence bounded by compact causal diamonds, and that they convert into classical perturbations when world lines cross horizons. This process differs from the unbounded spacelike coherent evolution and freezing assumed in standard theory. It is argued that such a scale-invariant causal angular symmetry of initial conditions is broadly consistent with cosmological measurements on smaller scales.</description>

      <title>Primordial gravitational wave backgrounds from phase transitions with next generation ground based detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Third generation ground-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors, such as Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, will operate in the $(\text{few}-10^4)$ Hz frequency band, with a boost in sensitivity providing an unprecedented reach into primordial cosmology. Working concurrently with pulsar timing arrays in the nHz band, and LISA in the mHz band, these 3G detectors will be powerful probes of beyond the standard model particle physics on scales $T\gtrsim 10^{7}$GeV. Here we focus on their ability to probe phase transitions (PTs) in the early universe. We first overview the landscape of detectors across frequencies, discuss the relevance of astrophysical foregrounds, and provide convenient and up-to-date power-law integrated sensitivity curves for these detectors. We then present the constraints expected from GW observations on first order PTs and on topological defects (strings and domain walls), which may be formed when a symmetry is broken irrespective of the order of the phase transition. These constraints can then be applied to specific models leading to first order PTs and/or topological defects. In particular we discuss the implications for axion models, which solve the strong CP problem by introducing a spontaneously broken Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry. For post-inflationary breaking, the PQ scale must lie in the $10^{8}-10^{11}$ GeV range, and so the signal from a first order PQ PT falls within reach of ground based 3G detectors. A scan in parameter space of signal-to-noise ratio in a representative model reveals their large potential to probe the nature of the PQ transition. Additionally, in heavy axion type models domain walls form, which can lead to a detectable GW background. We discuss their spectrum and summarise the expected constraints on these models from 3G detectors, together with SKA and LISA.</description>

      <title>Geometric Josephson junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a gravitational dual to a constriction Josephson junction constructed from the AdS/BCFT correspondence. On the gravity side, we consider a planar AdS-Schwarzschild black hole. Our junction is connected by the boundary $\partial\Omega$ with tension $\Sigma$ on the boundary CFT. This approach lead us to analytical solutions rather than usual numerical methods. Our computations on the gravity side reproduce the standard relation between the current across the junction and the phase difference of the condensate controlled by the tension $\Sigma$. We also study the maximum current's dependence on the junction's tension and size and reproduce familiar results.</description>

      <title>Parametrically amplified super-radiance towards hot big bang universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism of preheating stage after inflation, using a new idea of parametrically amplified super-radiance. Highly coherent state, characterized by macro-coherence of scalar field coupled to produced massless particle in pairs, is created by parametric resonance effects associated with field oscillation around its potential minimum, within a Hubble volume. The state is described effectively by the simple Dicke-type of super-radiance model, and super-radiant pulse is emitted within a Hubble time, justifying neglect of cosmic expansion. Produced particles are shown to interact to change their energy and momentum distribution to realize thermal hot big bang universe. A long standing problem of heating after inflation may thus be solved. A new dark matter candidate produced at the emergence of thermalized universe is suggested as well.</description>

      <title>Prospects for searching for sterile neutrinos with gravitational wave and $\gamma$-ray burst joint observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sterile neutrinos can influence the evolution of the universe, and thus cosmological observations can be used to detect them. Future gravitational wave (GW) observations can precisely measure absolute cosmological distances, helping to break parameter degeneracies generated by traditional cosmological observations. This advancement can lead to much tighter constraints on sterile neutrino parameters. This work provides a preliminary forecast for detecting sterile neutrinos using third-generation GW detectors in combination with future short $\gamma$-ray burst observations from a THESEUS-like telescope, an approach not previously explored in the literature. Both massless and massive sterile neutrinos are considered within the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We find that using GW data can greatly enhance the detection capability for massless sterile neutrinos, reaching 3$\sigma$ level. For massive sterile neutrinos, GW data can also greatly assist in improving the parameter constraints, but it seems that effective detection is still not feasible.</description>

      <title>Probing the Holographic Universe: Aspects of Entanglement Entropy Modifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement entropy is crucial for understanding the link between quantum mechanics and information theory. This thesis investigates how energy fluctuations and acceleration affect entanglement entropy through three key scenarios. First, we analyze entanglement between disjoint Rindler observers in de Sitter spacetime. We introduce 1-loop corrections to the partition function of the conformal field theory, disrupting the previously flat entanglement spectrum and resulting in an area law for entanglement entropy, while preserving the finiteness of the Hilbert space. Next, we extend the holographic entanglement entropy framework to field theories with global $U(1)$ symmetry, considering non-linearly charged theories and their thermal and quantum fluctuations. We find that the dual theory experiences spontaneous symmetry breaking and a reduction in the leading-order coefficient of the $\langle TT\rangle$ correlator due to quantum corrections. Using conformal electrodynamics coupled with three-dimensional gravity as an example, we explore a black hole solution and its connection to two-dimensional free bosons. Finally, we investigate three-dimensional accelerating black holes, revealing that increased acceleration reduces the accessible boundary region and, consequently, the entanglement entropy. This suggests a loss of information in the dual theory due to acceleration.</description>

      <title>Systematics in tests of general relativity using LISA massive black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our current understanding is that an environment - mainly consisting of gas or stars - is required to bring massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with total redshifted mass $M_z\sim[10^{4},10^7]~{\rm M}_\odot$ to the LISA band from parsec separation. Even in the gravitational wave (GW) dominated final inspiral, realistic environments can non-negligibly speed up or slow down the binary evolution, or leave residual, measurable eccentricity in the LISA band. Despite this fact, most of the literature does not consider environmental effects or orbital eccentricity in modelling GWs from near-equal mass MBHBs. Considering either a circular MBHB embedded in a circumbinary disc or a vacuum eccentric binary, we explore if ignoring either secular gas effects (migration and accretion) or eccentric corrections to the GW waveform can mimic a failure of General Relativity (GR). We use inspiral-only aligned-spin 3.5 post-Newtonian waveforms, a complete LISA response model, and Bayesian inference to perform a parameterized test of GR. For a four-year LISA observation of an MBHB with $M_z=10^{5}~{\rm M}_\odot$, primary-to-secondary mass ratio $q=8$, and component BHs' dimensionless spins $\chi_{1,2}=0.9$ at redshift $z=1$, even a moderate gas-disc imprint (Eddington ratio ${\rm f}_{\rm Edd}\sim0.1$) or low initial eccentricity ($e_0\sim10^{-2.5}$) causes a false violation of GR in several PN orders. However, correctly modelling either effect can mitigate systematics while avoiding significant biases in vacuum circular systems. The adoption of LISA makes it urgent to consider gas imprints and eccentricity in waveform models to ensure accurate inference for MBHBs.</description>
