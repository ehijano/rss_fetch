      <title>The End of the Road for Far-infrared Reddening Maps? Evidence for Reddening Errors Driven by Changes in PAH Abundance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate correction for extinction by Galactic dust is essential for studying the extragalactic sky. In the low-extinction regions of the Ursa Major molecular cloud complex, we demonstrate that Galactic dust reddening maps constructed from observations of far-infrared emission are insensitive to variations in the abundance of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and, as a result, to PAH-induced variations in reddening. Using galaxy counts to validate various reddening maps, we find evidence that maps based on far-infrared emission erroneously under-predict reddening compared to stellar reddening maps. This underestimation by far-infrared emission based reddening maps -- representing the largest discrepancy between maps of up to $E(B-V)=0.08$ mag -- is correlated with the relative brightness of PAH emission. Furthermore, we demonstrate theoretically that changes in PAH abundance via accretion from the gas phase is capable of altering extinction significantly with only minor changes to far-infrared emission. We show that modeling the extinction of Ursa Major using both far-infrared and mid-infrared emission more accurately traces dust extinction variations due to changes in PAH abundance. Finally, we discuss how SPHEREx observations of the 3.3 $\mu$m PAH feature are a promising way to overcome this limitation of far-infrared emission.</description>

      <title>Blue supergiants in the Pinwheel Galaxy M101: comparison with H II region chemical abundances, spectroscopic distance and an independent determination of the Hubble constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantitative spectroscopic study of 13 blue supergiant stars in the Pinwheel Galaxy M101, based on data obtained with the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer available at the Keck I telescope. The average stellar metallicity decreases from ~1.9 Zsun near the center of the galaxy to ~0.3 Zsun at the optical outskirts. The galactocentric radial metallicity gradient is statistically consistent with previous studies of the gas-phase oxygen abundance from H II regions using the direct method. The H II region-based Cepheid metallicities used by Riess et al. in their determination of the Hubble constant H_0 are in substantial agreement with our measurements. The direct method gas-phase metallicities of the 18 star-forming galaxies we have analyzed so far, when adjusted upward for a mean ~0.15 dex oxygen dust depletion factor, are in good agreement with those we infer from the supergiants, over a factor of 50 in metallicity. From the same data, we derive an expression for the metal-dependent depletion of oxygen in photoionized nebulae. Utilizing the flux-weighted gravity - luminosity relationship (FGLR) of blue supergiants, we measure a distance to M101, D=6.5 +\- 0.2 Mpc (m-M = 29.06 +\- 0.08), which is within 1 sigma from determinations based on the tip of the red giant branch and Cepheids. With M101 as a nearby SN Ia host and using the observed standardized B-band magnitude of the supernova, our FGLR distance yields an independent value H_0 = 72.5 +\- 4.6 km/s/Mpc.</description>

      <title>Mapping feedback signatures in 3C 297: A quasar-host merger at Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of quasar host galaxy 3C 297 which is home to a powerful bent-jet radio source suggesting vigorous interaction with a dense ISM and/or jet precession. Archival HST imaging showed interestingly perturbed morphology of the host with a bright ~30 kpc arc feature, extended filamentary structure of line-emitting gas and clumpy blue excess emission co-spatial with the radio hotspots. Our VLT/SINFONI integral-field observations reveal complex, spatially-resolved H{\alpha}+[NII] emission in this source. A prominent blue-shifted wing in H{\alpha} indicates an ionized gas flow extending out to ~18 kpc from the nuclear region. Combining our SINFONI narrow-H{\alpha} data with archival HST/UV and VLA imaging, we map the young stellar population in the host and compare the spatial distribution of star-forming regions with the ionized gas motion and jet structure. In the attempt to characterize the feedback mechanisms in this chaotic system, we suggest that the powerful radio source dominates the feedback with possible contribution from radiation pressure due to AGN accretion. We also propose that the expanding jet cocoon likely shocked the ISM, triggering a kpc-scale ionized gas outflow and new starbursts that enhanced ongoing merger-induced star formation.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of Gravity through Realistic 3D Modeling of Wide Binary Orbits: General Algorithm and a Pilot Study with HARPS Radial Velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When 3D relative displacement $\mathbf{r}$ and velocity $\mathbf{v}$ between the pair in a gravitationally-bound system are precisely measured, the six measured quantities at one phase can allow elliptical orbit solutions at a given gravitational parameter $G$. Due to degeneracies between orbital-geometric parameters and $G$, individual Bayesian inferences and their statistical consolidation are needed to infer $G$ as recently suggested by a Bayesian 3D modeling algorithm. Here I present a fully general Bayesian algorithm suitable for wide binaries with two (almost) exact sky-projected relative positions (as in the Gaia data release 3) and the other four sufficiently precise quantities. Wide binaries meeting the requirements of the general algorithm to allow for its full potential are rare at present, largely because the measurement uncertainty of the line-of-sight (radial) separation is usually larger than the true separation. As a pilot study, the algorithm is applied to 32 Gaia binaries for which precise HARPS radial velocities are available. The value of $\Gamma \equiv \log_{10}\sqrt{G/G_{\rm N}}$ (where $G_{\rm N}$ is Newton's constant) is $-0.002_{-0.018}^{+0.012}$ supporting Newton for a combination of 24 binaries with Newtonian acceleration $g_{\rm N}&gt;10^{-9}$m s$^{-2}$, while it is $\Gamma=0.063_{-0.047}^{+0.058}$ or $0.134_{-0.040}^{+0.050}$ for $7\text{ or }8$ binaries with $g_{\rm N}&lt;10^{-9}$m s$^{-2}$ (depending on one system) showing tension with Newton. The Newtonian ``outlier'' is at the boundary set by the Newtonian escape velocity, but can be consistent with modified gravity. The pilot study demonstrates the potential of the algorithm in measuring gravity at low acceleration with future samples of wide binaries.</description>

      <title>The origin of extreme N-emitters in star-forming galaxies at z$&lt;$0.5 with DESI DR1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme nitrogen enhancement relative to oxygen, recently found in very high-redshift galaxies, has been seen in local star-forming galaxies displaying high log(N/O) values ($\geq\!-1.1$) at relatively low O abundances, 12+log(O/H)$\leq$8. Understanding the physical origins of these extreme N-emitters at low redshifts enables us to better constrain chemical enrichment mechanisms that drove such high log(N/O) values in the early Universe. With direct N and O abundances derived for 944 SFGs with spectroscopic observational data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1 (DESI DR1), we report the discovery of 19 extreme N-emitters at low-z (z$&lt;$0.5). Our sample of N-emitters represents a five-fold increase in their known number at low-z with 12+log(O/H)$\leq$8, and statistically, $2.21\pm0.91$\% of DESI DR1 SFGs with reliable O and N abundances obtained directly, are extreme N-emitters. The sample spans a mass range of $\sim 10^7$ - $10^{10}$~M$_{\odot}$ with 12+log(O/H) range of $\sim$7.1 - 8.2, and the N-emitter fraction is found to increase with increasing stellar mass and decreasing metallicity. The most extreme N-emitter in our sample has log(N/O)=$-0.53\pm0.13$, while also having the lowest 12+log(O/H)=$7.08\pm0.09$ and the highest stellar mass, log(M$_{*}$/M$_{\odot}$)=$9.95\pm0.13$ among our sample. With galactic chemical evolution models, we show that sustained N-enhancement by asymptotic giant branch stars, in conjunction with presence of outflows, can well explain the high log(N/O) of low-z extreme N-emitters. While single starbursts with outflow are sufficient to explain lower-mass N-emitters, more massive ones require a dual starburst scenario where a secondary starburst is triggered by inflow of gas.</description>

      <title>Examining AGN UV/Optical Variability Beyond the Simple Damped Random Walk. II. Insights from 22 Years Observations of SDSS, PS1 and ZTF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A damped random walk (DRW) process is often used to describe the temporal UV/optical continuum variability of active galactic nuclei (AGN). However, recent investigations have shown that this model fails to capture the full spectrum of AGN variability. In this work, we model the 22-year-long light curves of $21,767$ quasars, spanning the redshift range $0.28 &lt; z &lt; 2.71$, as a noise-driven damped harmonic oscillator (DHO) process. The light curves, in the optical $g$ and $r$ bands, are collected and combined from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System, and the Zwicky Transient Facility. A DHO process can be defined using four parameters, two for describing its long-term behavior/variability, and the other two for describing its short-term behavior/variability. We find that the best-fit DHO model describes the observed variability of our quasar light curves better than the best-fit DRW model. Furthermore, the best-fit DHO parameters exhibit correlations with the rest-frame wavelength, the Eddington ratio, and the black hole mass of our quasars. Based on the power spectral density shape of the best-fit DHOs and these correlations, we suggest that the observed long-term variability of our quasars can be best explained by accretion rate or thermal fluctuations originating from the accretion disk, and the observed short-term variability can be best explained by reprocessing of X-ray variability originating from the corona. The additional information revealed by DHO modeling emphasizes the need to go beyond DRW when analyzing AGN light curves delivered by next-generation wide-field time-domain surveys.</description>

      <title>Origin of High Dark Remnant Fractions in Milky Way Globular Clusters: The Crucial Role of Initial Black Hole Retention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comparing the dynamical and stellar masses of Milky Way (MW) globular clusters (GCs) reveals a discrepancy exceeding a factor of two. Since this substantial invisible mass is concentrated in the cluster centre, it is attributed to stellar remnants. The majority of mass in remnants consists of white dwarfs (WDs). Allocating over half of a GC's current mass to WDs could significantly restrict the dynamical evolution scenarios governing stellar clusters. As the most massive stars in GCs, black holes (BHs) exert a substantial effect on the escape rate of lower mass stars, such as WDs. This paper aims to identify which scenarios of BH natal kicks can accurately reproduce the notable dark remnant fraction observed in MW GCs. We compare the observed remnant fraction of MW GCs with a comprehensive grid of direct \Nbody simulations while adjusting the natal kick received by BHs. Our results reveal that simulations employing low natal kicks to BHs are the only ones capable of mirroring the remnant fraction of MW GCs. According to the Spitzer instability, the presence of a BH population prompts the formation of a BH sub-system (BHSub) at the centre of a star cluster. The BHSub serves as an energetic power plant, continually releasing kinetic energy through few-body encounters between single and binary BHs, and transferring the generated energy to the entire stellar population. This energy induces a significant difference in the ejection rate of stellar remnants and luminous stars, ultimately increasing the fraction of dark remnants within the star cluster.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Kinematics of Molecular Gas in Cometary Globule L1616</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LDN 1616 is a cometary globule located approximately 8 degrees west of the Orion OB1 associations. The massive OB stars in the Orion belt region act as catalysts, triggering the star formation activity observed in the L1616 region, which is a photodissociation region (PDR). This paper provides an in-depth analysis of gas kinematics within the L1616 PDR, leveraging the Heterodyne Array Receiver Program (HARP) on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) to observe 13CO and C18O (3-2) emissions. Employing the Clumpfind algorithm on the C18O emission data, we identify three distinct clumps within this PDR. For each of these clumps, we derive key physical parameters, including the mean kinetic temperature, optical depth, and velocity dispersion. In addition, we compute the non-thermal velocity dispersion and Mach number, providing critical insights into the turbulent dynamics of the gas. A comprehensive evaluation of mass, including virial and energy budget evaluations, is conducted to assess the gravitational stability and star-forming potential of the identified clumps. While previous studies have proposed that radiation-driven implosion (RDI) is the dominant mechanism initiating star formation in LDN 1616, our results suggest that the clumps may represent pre-existing substructures within the PDR. This interpretation is supported by our estimation of a relatively low interstellar radiation field, which, although insufficient to form clumps independently, may enhance gravitational instability through additional compression. Thus, our findings offer a more nuanced perspective on the role of RDI, highlighting its capacity to trigger star formation by amplifying the instability of pre-existing clumpy structures in PDRs like LDN 1616.</description>

      <title>Linking Stochastic Self-Propagating Star Formation and Spatio-Temporal Point Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochastic self-propagating star-formation (SSPSF) model is an important theoretical framework for explaining how localised star-formation events trigger subsequent activity across galactic discs. While widely used to interpret spiral and irregular structures, its probabilistic rules have lacked a formal statistical foundation. In this work, we establish a connection between the SSPSF model and spatio-temporal point processes (STPP), which describe events in space and time through history-dependent intensities. We show that the SSPSF update law is equivalent to a separable spatio-temporal Hawkes process, and we derive a simple likelihood function that recovers SSPSF parameters from historical star-formation event data under simplifying assumptions. Beyond the statistical formulation, the framework provides a new approach to analysing the propagation of star formation in galaxies, enabling observational surveys of star-forming regions to be interpreted within the STPP framework. Furthermore, the approach naturally extends to continuous-time models, offering a more realistic representation of galactic dynamics.</description>

      <title>SMILES Data Release II: Probing Galaxy Evolution during Cosmic Noon and Beyond with NIRSpec Medium-Resolution Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the second data release of the Systematic Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES), focusing on JWST/NIRSpec medium-resolution spectroscopy of galaxies across cosmic time. This release includes spectroscopic observations of 166 galaxies spanning $0 &lt; z &lt; 7.5$, sampling star-forming galaxies, quiescent systems, and active galactic nuclei (AGN), with an emphasis on galaxies at cosmic noon ($z \sim 1$-3). We describe the target selection strategy, the observational setup with the G140M/F100LP and G235M/F170LP gratings, and the data calibration process. The final data products include the reduced spectra, redshift catalog, emission-line catalogs produced with \texttt{GELATO} for emission-line galaxies and \texttt{pPXF} fits for quiescent systems, and ancillary spectral energy distribution (SED) fit results derived from multi-band photometry. The SMILES NIRSpec dataset enables investigations of obscured AGN, multi-phase outflows, ionizing properties, and the role of environment in galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>A Tale of Two Sightlines: Comparison of Hydrocarbon Dust Absorption Bands toward Cygnus OB2-12 and the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12601v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared spectra of hydrocarbon dust absorption bands toward the bright hypergiant Cygnus OB2-12 are compared to published spectra of the Quintuplet Cluster, a sightline to the Galactic center. The Cyg OB2-12 data include a new ground-based 2.86-3.70 microns spectrum and a previously published, but here further analyzed, spectrum of the 5.50-7.34 microns region. Higher spectral resolution data for the Cyg OB2-12 sightline in the 3 micron region allows a detailed comparison of the 3.4 micron aliphatic bands to those observed toward the Quintuplet. Despite differences in interstellar environments along each sightline, strong similarities are observed in the central wavelengths and relative strengths for bands at 3.3, 3.4, 5.85, 6.2, and 6.85 microns. Analysis of these bands, produced by aromatic, aliphatic, olefinic, hydrogenated, and oxygenated components, shows that carbonaceous dust is a significant component of the diffuse interstellar medium, second in abundance only to silicates, and is primarily aromatic in nature. The grains producing these bands likely consist of large aromatic carbon cores with thin aliphatic mantles composed of hydrogenated amorphous carbon (HAC). Laboratory analog spectra reproduce the observed aliphatic absorption bands well, supporting the presence of such mantles. We present evidence that the carriers of both the 3.4 micron aliphatic and the 3.3 micron aromatic bands reside exclusively in the diffuse ISM, and that the 3.3 micron bands observed in the diffuse ISM differ from those seen in dense clouds, implying chemically distinct carriers.</description>

      <title>Spatially and Dynamically Extended Molecular Gas in Stephan's Quintet Revealed by ALMA CO(1-0) Total Power Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ALMA Total Power CO(1-0) mapping of Stephan's Quintet (SQ), a prototypical compact galaxy group, with a uniform noise level at a spatial scale of ~25 kpc. These observations provide the first complete view of molecular gas across the whole system. Molecular gas is found to spread over a wide area (~120 x 80 kpc), mainly over the two main member galaxies (NGC7318B and 7319), but also in the shocked ridges between these galaxies, the tidal tail, and also in intergalactic regions north of the tail. The total CO(1-0) luminosity is $(2.47\pm0.12)\times10^9~\mathrm{K~km~s^{-1}~pc^2}$, corresponding to a molecular gas mass of $(1.07\pm0.05)\times10^{10}~M_\odot$ assuming the Galactic CO-to-H2 conversion factor. The global star formation efficiency of SQ is estimated at 0.29-0.70 $\mathrm{Gyr^{-1}}$, comparable to or lower than that of nearby star-forming galaxies. Molecular gas spans a velocity range of ~1300 km/s, which can be divided into three components (low, mid, high). The low- and mid-velocity components, linked to NGC7318B and the ridge, show relatively active star formation, whereas the high-velocity component, associated with NGC7319, shows suppressed star formation. Our mapping reveals molecular gas extending ~100 kpc in projection along the inner tail and north of it, containing $(1.64\pm0.08)\times10^9~M_\odot$ (15% of total) with low velocity dispersion (~20 km/s) and ongoing star formation. While previous studies suggested in situ molecular gas formation in the tail, our data suggest an additional contribution from gas stripped from NGC7319.</description>

      <title>How many stars form in compact clusters in the local Milky Way?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two main models coexist for the environment in which stars form. The clustered model stipulates that the bulk of star formation occurs within dense embedded clusters, but only a minority of them survive the residual gas expulsion phase caused by massive stellar feedback unbinding the clusters. On the other hand, the hierarchical model predicts that star formation happens at a range of scales and densities, where open clusters (OCs) only emerge from the densest regions. We aim to exploit a recent catalog of compact OCs, corrected for completeness, to obtain an updated estimation of the surface density star formation rate within OCs ($\sum_{\rm SFR,OC}$), which we compare with recent estimates of $\sum_{\rm SFR}$ to determine which model is more likely. We have applied two methods. The first one consisted of integrating over the power law that was fit for the mass function of the youngest OCs using a MC sampling. The second one consisted of counting the total compact mass within these youngest OCs within 1 kpc, so that the result could be directly compared with local values of $\sum_{\rm SFR}$. We estimated new $\sum_{\rm SFR,OC}$ values between $736^{+159}_{-176}$ and $875^{+34}_{-35}$ M$_{\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$, depending on the methodology. These results are significantly higher than previous $\sum_{\rm SFR,OC}$ estimates, which we attribute to the incompleteness of past catalogs, and are consistent with the majority ($\geq$ 50 \%) or even the vast majority ($\geq$ 80 \%) of the star formation occurring in initially compact clusters, through comparisons with $\sum_{\rm SFR}$ from the recent literature. Our new $\sum_{\rm SFR,OC}$ values are consistent with clustered formation being the most dominant mode of star formation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST/NIRCam 0.9 to 2.0 micron images reveal a population of point sources around the major galaxies in the El Gordo cluster at redshift z=0.87. Their distribution in the color--magnitude diagrams shows a narrow sequence well separated from field-galaxy contamination and consistent with their identification as ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) or luminous globular clusters (GCs). The point-source sequence is more luminous by almost a magnitude than the corresponding sequence in Abell 2744 at z=0.31, matching the predicted evolutionary change for GC/UCDs over the 4-Gyr difference in lookback time between these two clusters. Deeper observations should allow direct JWST imaging of GC/UCD populations, even without the help of lensing, up to z ~ 1.4, a lookback time of more than 9 Gyr. Such observations would directly reveal the evolution of these compact stellar systems two-thirds of the way back to the Big Bang.</description>

      <title>Comparing X-ray Emission Line Fluxes of NGC 5548 to NGC 1068</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Unification Model of AGN suggests that all AGN galaxies should exhibit similar line ratios in their spectra. NGC 5548, a Seyfert I, underwent obscuration -- similar to naturally obscured Seyfert II galaxies -- due to an outflowing accretion wind, resulting in absorption. As per the Model, a Seyfert I and a Seyfert II should show similar flux ratios during their respective obscuration states. In this note, we present a comparison of emission fluxes between NGC 5548 and NGC 1068, a Seyfert II. We present the CLOUDY prediction of NGC 5548, which underpredicts the line ratios compared to observations, likely due to SED choices. The differing observed line ratios of NGC 5548 and NGC 1068 suggest additional unknown factors in the unification model.</description>

      <title>A test of Ca ii H &amp; K photometry for isolating massive globular clusters below the metallicity floor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The serendipitous discovery of the M31 globular cluster (GC) EXT8 has presented a significant challenge to current theories for GC formation. By finding other GCs similar to EXT8, it should become clear if and/or how EXT8 can fit into our current understanding of GC formation. We aim to test the potential of integrated-light narrow-band Ca II H &amp; K photometry as a proxy for the metallicity of GCs to be able to provide effective candidate selection for massive GCs below the GC metallicity floor ([Fe/H] $\leq$ -2.5), such as EXT8. We investigate the behaviour of two colours involving the CaHK filter employed by the Pristine survey, CaHK-u and CaHK-g, as a function of metallicity through CFHT MegaCam imaging of EXT8 and a wide set of M31 GCs covering the metallicity range of -2.9 $\leq$ [Fe/H] $\leq$ +0.4. Additionally, we investigate if the CaHK colours are strongly influenced by horizontal branch morphology through available morphology measurements. In both of the CaHK colours, EXT8 and two other potential GCs below the metallicity floor can be selected from other metal-poor GCs ([Fe/H] $\leq$ -1.5) with CaHK-g showing the larger metallicity sensitivity. The RMS of linear fits to the metal-poor GCs show an uncertainty of 0.3 dex on metallicity estimations for both colours. Comparisons with u-g and g-z/F450W-F850L colours reinforce the notion that CaHK photometry can be used for effective candidate selection as they reduce false positive selection rates by at least a factor of 2. We find no strong influence of the horizontal branch morphology on the CaHK colours that would interfere with candidate selection, although the assessment is limited by quantity and quality of available data.</description>

      <title>A 15 Mpc rotating galaxy filament at redshift z = 0.032</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the cold atomic hydrogen gas (HI) within cosmic filaments has the potential to pin down the relationship between the low density gas in the cosmic web and how the galaxies that lie within it grow using this material. We report the discovery of a cosmic filament using 14 HI-selected galaxies that form a very thin elongated structure of 1.7 Mpc. These galaxies are embedded within a much larger cosmic web filament, traced by optical galaxies, that spans at least $\sim 15$~Mpc. We find that the spin axes of the HI galaxies are significantly more strongly aligned with the cosmic web filament ($\langle\lvert \cos \psi \rvert\rangle = 0.64 \pm 0.05$) than cosmological simulations predict, with the optically-selected galaxies showing alignment to a lesser degree ($\langle\lvert \cos \psi \rvert\rangle = 0.55 \pm 0.05$). This structure demonstrates that within the cosmic filament, the angular momentum of galaxies is closely connected to the large-scale filamentary structure. We also find strong evidence that the galaxies are orbiting around the spine of the filament, making this one of the largest rotating structures discovered thus far, and from which we can infer that there is transfer of angular momentum from the filament to the individual galaxies. The abundance of HI galaxies along the filament and the low dynamical temperature of the galaxies within the filament indicates that this filament is at an early evolutionary stage where the imprint of cosmic matter flow on galaxies has been preserved over cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Molecular Hydrogen in High-redshift Damped Lyman-{\alpha} Absorbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulations predict that circumgalactic hydrogen gas surrounding massive ($M_{\rm{halo}}^{z=1}=10^{12}-10^{13}\ M_{\odot}$) galaxies at $z\sim4$ may be predominantly neutral, and could produce damped Ly$\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs) along sight-lines to background quasars \citep{Stern2021}. A circumgalactic medium (CGM) origin for DLAs naturally explains high redshift HI absorption-selected galaxy detections at physical separations much greater than the likely extents of the galaxy disks \citep{Neeleman2017, Neeleman2019}. The observed $z\sim 4$ DLA HI column densities are large and comparable to interstellar (ISM) gas columns at which substantial molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) abundances occur. We therefore investigate the possible molecular content of high-redshift CGM gas, and its potential detectability via (rest-frame) far-ultraviolet (UV) absorption line studies. For this purpose we develop an analytic sub-grid model for HI-to-H$_2$ transitions and incorporate the model with zoom-in FIRE-2 simulations of evolving high-$z$ galaxies. We include dust absorption and scattering computations for the transfer of photodissociating Lyman-Werner (LW) band radiation. We find that the typical extents of detectable H$_2$ sightlines are $\approx 0.1\, R_{\rm vir}$, independent of redshift from $z=2.5$ to 5. We argue that a CGM origin for DLAs naturally explains the low detection rates of H$_2$ in DLA observations, as the low CGM densities and relatively strong far-UV fields lead to molecular fractions much lower than observed in the ISM at comparable HI columns.</description>

      <title>The ALPINE-CRISTAL-JWST survey: spatially resolved star formation relations at $z\sim5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star formation governs galaxy evolution, shaping stellar mass assembly and gas consumption across cosmic time. The Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation, linking star formation rate (SFR) and gas surface densities, is fundamental to understand star formation regulation, yet remains poorly constrained at $z &gt; 2$ due to observational limitations and uncertainties in locally calibrated gas tracers. The [CII] $158 {\rm \mu m}$ line has recently emerged as a key probe of the cold ISM and star formation in the early Universe. We investigate whether the resolved [CII]-SFR and KS relations established at low redshift remain valid at $4 &lt; z &lt; 6$ by analysing 13 main-sequence galaxies from the ALPINE and CRISTAL surveys, using multi-wavelength data (HST, JWST, ALMA) at $\sim2$ kpc resolution. We perform pixel-by-pixel spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling with CIGALE on resolution-homogenised images. We develop a statistical framework to fit the [CII]-SFR relation that accounts for pixel covariance and compare our results to classical fitting methods. We test two [CII]-to-gas conversion prescriptions to assess their impact on inferred gas surface densities and depletion times. We find a resolved [CII]-SFR relation with a slope of $0.87 \pm 0.15$ and intrinsic scatter of $0.19 \pm 0.03$ dex, which is shallower and tighter than previous studies at $z\sim5$. The resolved KS relation is highly sensitive to the [CII]-to-gas conversion factor: using a fixed global $\alpha_{\rm [CII]}$ yields depletion times of $0.5$-$1$ Gyr, while a surface brightness-dependent $W_{\rm [CII]}$, places some galaxies with high gas density in the starburst regime ($&lt;0.1$ Gyr). Future inputs from both simulations and observations are required to better understand how the [CII]-to-gas conversion factor depends on local ISM properties. We need to break this fundamental limit to properly study the KS relation at $z\gtrsim4$.</description>

      <title>Hot, cold, and multi-component accretion flows around supermassive black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a model for supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) accreting below their Eddington limit, focusing on systems where hot, advection-dominated flows become viable. We specifically explore the spectral appearance of multi-component accretion flows where the solution can independently transition between cold, thin disks and hot, advection-dominated torii depending on the local accretion rate. Using a three-disk model, we compute spectral energy distributions for four possible accretion configurations and assess their observational signatures, including which frequencies might reflect variability at the binary orbital period. The spectral modeling reveals that binary accretion can self-consistently account for many of the properties of standard AGN, while the variability analysis shows that hydrodynamic modulation at the binary period is most likely in the thermal emission and low-frequency synchrotron components. Doppler boosting of emitting material bound to a single binary component would also induce periodic variability. We apply our model to the SMBHB candidate PG1302-102 and demonstrate that a mixed-component accretion state (plus a jet feature) can self-consistently capture the observed broadband spectrum. Our model offers a framework for interpreting candidate SMBHBs and motivates future multi-wavelength follow-up of potential multi-messenger sources, as well as more detailed future modeling of multi-component binary accretion.</description>

      <title>The Wrath of KAN: Enabling Fast, Accurate, and Transparent Emulation of the Global 21 cm Cosmology Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), we present a novel emulator of the global 21 cm cosmology signal, $\texttt{21cmKAN}$, that provides extremely fast training speed while achieving nearly equivalent accuracy to the most accurate emulator to date, $\texttt{21cmLSTM}$. The combination of enhanced speed and accuracy facilitated by $\texttt{21cmKAN}$ enables rapid and highly accurate physical parameter estimation analyses of multiple 21 cm models, which is needed to fully characterize the complex feature space across models and produce robust constraints on the early universe. Rather than using static functions to model complex relationships like traditional fully-connected neural networks do, KANs learn expressive transformations that can perform significantly better for low-dimensional physical problems. $\texttt{21cmKAN}$ predicts a given signal for two well-known models in the community in 3.7 ms on average and trains about 75 times faster than $\texttt{21cmLSTM}$, when utilizing the same typical GPU. $\texttt{21cmKAN}$ is able to achieve these speeds because of its learnable, data-driven transformations and its relatively small number of trainable parameters compared to a memory-based emulator. We show that $\texttt{21cmKAN}$ required less than 30 minutes to train and fit these simulated signals and obtain unbiased posterior distributions. We find that the transparent architecture of $\texttt{21cmKAN}$ allows us to conveniently interpret and further validate its emulation results in terms of the sensitivity of the 21 cm signal to each physical parameter. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of KANs and their ability to more quickly and accurately mimic expensive physical simulations in comparison to other types of neural networks.</description>

      <title>MINDS. Strong oxygen depletion in the inner regions of a very low-mass star disk?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JWST is discovering a plethora of species in planet-forming disks around very low-mass stars such as C2H2, C6H6, C4H2, CH3 etc. The column densities of these species retrieved from 0D slab models are very large, e.g. of the order of $10^{20}$\,cm$^{-2}$. This is indicating a carbon-dominated chemistry in a gas with a high C/O ratio. The disk around 2MASS-J1605321-1993159 (M4.5) is one such source showing a molecular pseudo-continuum of C2H2. Still two oxygen-bearing molecules, CO and CO2 are also detected in this source. We aim to take the next step beyond 0D slab models to interpret the spectrum. We examine whether 2D thermo-chemical disk models can produce the large inferred column densities of \ce{C2H2} in the inner regions of the disk and produce a pseudo-continuum in the mid-IR spectrum. We also want to constrain whether depletion of oxygen or enrichment of carbon is causing the high C/O ratio triggering a carbon-dominated chemistry. We utilize the radiative thermo-chemical disk model P{\tiny RO}D{\tiny I}M{\tiny O} to identify a disk structure which is capable of producing the observed molecular emission of species such as CO, CO2, C2H2, and H2O simultaneously. The spectrum is generated using the fast line tracer FLiTs. We derive the gas temperature $\langle T \rangle$, column density $\langle$ log$_{\rm {10}} N\rangle$ and the emitting area $\langle r_{\rm{1}} - r_{\rm{2}} \rangle$ for these molecules from the 2D disk model and compare them to the parameters retrieved originally from 0D slab models. We use the different effect that changing the O or C abundance has on CO and C2H2 respectively to discriminate between O depletion and C enhancement. We find that a disk structure characterised by the presence of a gap can best explain the observations. The inner disk is strongly depleted in dust, especially small grains ($&lt;5\,\mu$m), and ..</description>

      <title>Scalable and robust wide-field facet calibration with LOFAR's longest baselines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has successfully achieved sub-arcsecond wide-field imaging with high-band observations from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR). However, the scalability of this work remains limited due to the need for manual intervention, poor calibration solutions for the Dutch LOFAR stations, and high computational costs. We address these issues by: (1) improving automated self-calibration using a signal-to-noise metric and a neural network for image artefact detection; (2) implementing a refined calibration strategy for the Dutch LOFAR stations; and (3) cutting computational costs by optimising the data processing strategy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our automated processing strategy by reprocessing one previously reduced dataset and a new dataset from the ELAIS-N1 deep field, which features more severe ionospheric conditions. We find calibration artefacts across facet boundaries to be reduced with our improved automated calibration strategy and achieve a computational cost reduction of about a factor of 4 to 6 compared to previous work, where the exact factor depends on whether a single observation is processed or multiple observations of the same sky area are combined. Further optimisation and improved handling of data with baseline-dependent averaging could reduce this in the near future by another factor of two, bringing the total cost for an 8-hour observation below 30,000 CPU core hours. This work enables ultra-deep imaging at sensitivities on the order of a few $\mu$Jy/beam. Furthermore, it also lays the foundation for a fully automated survey pipeline for sub-arcsecond wide-field imaging of the northern sky with LOFAR.</description>

      <title>Magnetars in Binaries as the Engine of Actively Repeating Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12119</link>

Abstract: The association between FRB 20200428D and the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 makes magnetars the leading engine of cosmological fast radio bursts (FRBs). However, there is a list of puzzles for this magnetar-for-all-FRBs scenario: known Galactic magnetars are all isolated and none of them are active repeaters; some cosmological repeaters have extremely high repetition rates but without any measurable spin-related periodicity; some show long-term periodic active windows; and some show diverse rotation measure (RM) evolution patterns, such as quasi-periodic fluctuations, sign reversals, and abrupt RM flares. Here we propose a unified theoretical framework for FRBs within the framework of magnetar engine: Most active repeating FRBs originate from magnetars in binary systems with nearly aligned rotation and magnetic axes, some of which with a triple-aligned geometry, i.e. with an alignment with the orbital axis as well; whereas apparent non-repeaters and inactive repeaters originate from magnetars in isolated systems or in binaries with a misaligned geometry. By studying various magnetar formation channels using population syntheses, we show that a few percent of magnetars in the universe can be in binary systems, most with a massive star companion and some with aligned geometry. We suggest that such binary systems can account for the rich phenomenology of active repeaters. We suggest that the existence of a companion helps to maintain the aligned geometry and that the companion may play an active role in triggering FRBs in an active repeater source.</description>

      <title>How the cosmic voids contribute to stalling and quenching the giant galaxies on their surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a numerical discovery that the formations of cosmic voids are closely linked with the mechanism through which the giant galaxies on void surfaces establish elliptical shapes, redder colors, and lower sSFR. Identifying the voids from the TNG300-1 simulations via the Void-Finder algorithm, we explore if and how the shapes of the TNG galaxies located on void surfaces are aligned with the directions toward the void centers. Noting that only the giant void-surface galaxies with stellar masses $M_{\star}\ge 10^{10.5}\,h^{-1}\,M_{\odot}$ exhibit significant tendency of perpendicular alignments, we dichotomize them into two $M_{\star}$-controlled samples according to their morphologies (elliptical or spiral), colors (redder or bluer), sSFR (lower or higher) and stellar ages (older or younger). It is found that the void-galaxy perpendicular alignment becomes stronger for the cases that the void-surface galaxies have elliptical shapes, redder colors, and lower sSFR. The numerical results are also shown to be well described by the analytical one-parameter model derived under the assumption of the existence of a linear scaling between the covariance matrices of galaxy shape axes and local tidal tensors. Our result implies that the compression of adjacent matter due to the formation and rapid expansion of cosmic voids prevent them from radial infall/accretion, which in turn contribute to stalling and quenching the giant void-surface galaxies. Given that the formation epochs and expansion rates of cosmic voids depend sensitively on the dark energy equation of state, we also discuss a possibility of using the abundance of elliptical void-surface galaxies as a probe of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Detection of young massive white dwarfs in core-collapsed globular cluster NGC 362</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Core-collapsed globular clusters are ideal targets to explore the presence of stellar collision products. Here, we have studied seventeen FUV bright white dwarf members in the globular cluster NGC 362 using data obtained from the Ultra Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) mounted on AstroSat and from HST. Multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are analyzed using UV and optical data sets to characterize and determine the parameters of white dwarfs. Fourteen of the white dwarfs fit single-component SEDs well, while three showed a good fit with a two-component SED model,indicating a binary system comprising a white dwarf and a low-mass main-sequence star. The effective temperature, radius, luminosity, and mass of white dwarfs range between 22000 - 70000 K, 0.008 - 0.028 Rsun, 0.09 - 3.0 Lsun, and 0.30 - 1.13 Msun, respectively. The effective temperature, radius, luminosity, and mass of the companions (low-mass main-sequence stars) are 3500 - 3750 K, 0.150 - 0.234 Rsun,0.003 - 0.01 Lsun, and 0.14 - 0.24 Msun, respectively. The three binary systems (WD-MS), along with the massive WDs may have formed through dynamical processes that occurred during the core collapse of the cluster. This is the first evidence of a massive WD formation in a core-collapsed cluster, which is the missing link in the formation of a fast radio burst (FRB) progenitor in a globular cluster. This study provides evidence that NGC 362 hosts stellar systems that may evolve into exotic stars such as Type Ia supernovae, and/or FRBs in the future. *This is paper VI of the Globular Cluster UVIT Legacy Survey.</description>

      <title>Group Therapy for Halos: Advancing Halo Mass Estimation for Galaxy Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of dark matter halo masses for galaxy groups is central to studies of galaxy evolution and for leveraging group catalogues as cosmological probes. We present a calibration and evaluation of two complementary halo mass estimators: a dynamical estimator based on the virial theorem, and an empirical relation between the sum of the stellar masses of the three most massive group galaxies and the halo mass (SHMR). Using state-of-the-art semi-analytic models (SHARK, SAGE, and GAEA) to generate mock light-cone catalogues, we quantify the accuracy, uncertainty, and model dependence of each method. The calibrated virial theorem achieves negligible systematic bias (mean $\Delta$ = -0.01 dex) and low scatter (mean $\sigma$ = 0.20 dex) with no sensitivity to baryonic physics. The calibrated SHMR yields the highest precision (mean $\Delta$ = 0.02 dex, mean $\sigma$ = 0.14 dex) but shows greater model dependence due to sensitivity to baryonic physics across the models. We demonstrate applications to observational catalogues, including the empirical halo mass function and mapping quenched fractions in the stellar mass-halo mass plane. We provide guidance: the virial theorem is recommended for GAMA-like surveys (i &lt; 19.2) at z &lt; 0.1 where minimal model dependence is required, while the SHMR is optimal for high-precision halo mass estimates across diverse catalogues with limits of z &lt; 0.3. These calibrated estimators will aid upcoming wide-area spectroscopic surveys in probing the connection between galaxies and their host dark matter halos.</description>

      <title>The highest mass Kepler red giants -- II. Spectroscopic parameters, the amplitude-activity relation, and unexpected halo orbits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high-mass (M$&gt;$2 \Msolar{}) Kepler red giant stars are less well-studied than their lower-mass counterparts. In the previous article, we presented a sample of 48 high-mass Kepler red giants and measured their asteroseismic parameters. This article presents spectroscopic measurements from the same sample, using high-resolution Keck/HIRES spectra to determine \Teff{}, [Fe/H], \logg{}, and $v \sin i$. We refined our previous estimates of the stellar masses and radii based on the new \Teff{}. We also examined spectral features that could indicate binary activity, such as the Li line and [C/N] ratios. We found no Li-rich stars or clear [C/N] anomalies, but we observed a correlation between [C/N] and [Fe/H]. We measured chromospheric activity using the $S$-index of the Ca II H \&amp; K lines and found no correlation with internal magnetic fields. However, we confirmed an anti-correlation between surface chromospheric activity and radial mode oscillation amplitudes, which indicates that strong surface magnetic fields weaken stellar oscillations. Finally, we used the Gaia DR3 astrometric data to show that our sample of stars have orbits consistent with all three Galactic kinematic regions. Although these stars are quite young, their orbits carry them into the thick disk and even the halo, raising questions about the accuracy and viability of kinematics in unravelling Galactic history. In future work, we plan to use the spectroscopic parameters measured here to provide better constraints for boutique frequency modelling, which will allow us to test the asteroseismic scaling relations at the high-mass regime.</description>

      <title>The Fraction of Distilled White Dwarfs with Long-Lived Habitable Zones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After carbon and oxygen, $^{22}$Ne is the most abundant element in white dwarf interiors. As C/O white dwarfs (WDs) crystallize, they are predicted to go through a distillation process in the central layers if they have a sufficiently high $^{22}$Ne mass fraction of $\gtrsim2.5$\%. Observational evidence for distillation comes from an over-density of WDs on the Q-branch in Gaia color-magnitude diagrams, which indicates that $\sim6$\% of massive WDs are delayed in their cooling by as much as $\sim10$ Gyr. However, it is unclear how these stars end up with such a high concentration of $^{22}$Ne and if a significant fraction of the more common average-mass WDs go through distillation. We argue that a significant metal-rich stellar population in the solar neighborhood should lead to distilled WDs, without requiring a binary merger. We use MESA along with the CNO abundances derived from high-resolution spectroscopy of stars included in the Hypatia catalog to predict the $^{22}$Ne mass fraction in their descendant WDs. We find that 0.6-2.5\% of the WDs in the solar neighborhood have sufficient $^{22}$Ne in their interiors to go through multi-Gyr cooling delays, which could significantly inflate their numbers in the observed samples. Hence, $^{22}$Ne distillation and long-lived habitable zones around WDs should be relatively common in the solar neighborhood. We also use a Galactic model to predict the fraction of WDs that go through distillation as a function of Galactocentric distance. The fraction of distilled WDs is $\sim2$-8\% near the Galactic center, and declines steadily toward the outer disk.</description>

      <title>Image Profile (IMPRO) Fitting of Massive Protostars. I. Method Development and Test Cases of Cepheus A and G35.20-0.74N</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive stars play a critical role in the evolution of galaxies, but their formation remains poorly understood. One challenge is accurate measurement of the physical properties of massive protostars, such as current stellar mass, envelope mass, outflow cavity properties, and system orientation. Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting is widely-used to test models against observations. The far-infrared SED traces cold dust in envelopes, while the near- and mid-infrared (MIR) probes emission from outflow cavities and/or the inner envelope. However, SED fitting has degeneracy limiting its ability to yield accurate measurements of protostellar properties. Here, we develop image profile (IMPRO) fitting as a method to improve the characterization of protostars. We utilize brightness distributions from multi-wavelength MIR images of massive protostars taken by SOFIA/FORCAST as part of the SOFIA Massive Star Formation (SOMA) survey to constrain protostellar properties via comparison to a grid of radiative transfer models. We develop a fitting pipeline to extract information along the outflow axis, which is then combined with the SED fitting to yield improved constraints on protostellar properties. We apply the IMPRO fitting method on the nearby massive protostar Cepheus A, finding that its properties become more tightly constrained compared to SED fitting, especially in the inclination of the source. However, for the more distant G35.20-0.74N, we find that the spatial resolution of SOFIA/FORCAST limits the utility of this combined fitting pipeline. However, higher resolution MIR observations, e.g., with JWST, are expected to greatly expand the applicability of this fitting technique to protostars across the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>A bird's eye view of stellar evolution through populations of variable stars in Galactic open clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Both star clusters and variable stars are sensitive laboratories of stellar astrophysics and evolution: cluster member stars provide context for interpreting cluster populations, whereas variability reveals the nature of individual stellar systems. The European Space Agency's Gaia mission has revolutionized the census of star clusters in the Milky Way, while simultaneously providing an unprecedented homogeneous all-sky catalog of variable stars. Here, we leverage the third Gaia data release to obtain an empirical bird's eye view of stellar evolution based on 34760 variable stars residing in 1192 Galactic open clusters (OCs) containing 173294 members (variable member fraction 20.0%). Using precise OC distances, dereddened magnitudes, and consistently determined ages, we a) pinpointed regions of pulsational instability across the color-absolute magnitude diagram (CaMD); b) traced the occurrence rate of variables as a function of age, and c) considered the evolution of rotation periods and photometric activity (gyrochronology). The occurrence of pulsating stars can serve as a model- and reddening-independent age estimator. Our results underline that jointly considering stellar variability and OC membership enables a plethora of further applications, such as age dating or dereddening OCs based on expected CaMD locations of variable stars. Upcoming Gaia data releases and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will vastly increase the extent to which the details of variable stars in OCs can empirically unravel the astrophysics and evolution of stellar populations.</description>

      <title>Planetary Nebulae in the eROSITA eRASS1 catalog</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some planetary nebulae (PNe) host X-ray-emitting hot bubbles shaped by stellar wind interactions and/or harbor X-ray-emitting central stars due to accretion, shocks within their fast stellar winds, or even chromospheric emission from binary companions. In both cases, the properties of the X-ray emission critically probe late-stages of stellar evolution for such low- and intermediate-mass stars. While extant Chandra and XMM-Newton observations have detected X-ray emission in PNe, the numbers known remain very small ($\sim40$) compared to the overall Galactic PNe population ($\sim4000$). We have initiated a project aimed at increasing the sample of known PNe with X-ray emission using both current and new space-based X-ray telescopes such as the Einstein probe. To further investigate their X-ray properties to elucidate what drives current X-ray PN detections, we have cross-searched the SRG {\it eROSITA-DE} eRASS1 source catalogue and Hong Kong (HASH) PNe Database. Five known X-ray PNe have been detected (Abell\,30, NGC\,2392, NGC\,3242, NGC\,5315, and LoTr\,5), two new X-ray PNe are revealed (IC\,1297 and NGC\,2867), one (K\,1-27) is removed from previous X-ray compilations, and another 11 previously detected X-ray emitting PNe are not recovered. A comparison of the X-ray flux of detected and undetected X-ray PNe reveals that eROSITA eRASS1 is sensitive to PNe with X-ray fluxes larger than $\approx2\times10^{-14}$ erg~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$. The frequency of occurrence is $\simeq$0.5\% among the 1430 HASH True PNe in the eRASS1 footprint.</description>

      <title>Stochasticity in Stellar Yields Reflected in Theoretical Dust Masses Estimates Across all Type II Supernova Progenitors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are among the primary sources of dust in galaxies. In this study, we derive theoretical upper limits on dust masses as a function of supernova (SN) progenitors with initial masses between 9 and 120 Msun, based on previously established models of dust formation chemistry in CCSNe. We find that O-rich dust, particularly silicates, dominates the dust budget, with masses ranging from 0.02 to 0.9 Msun, and that the total mass of O-rich dust increases with progenitor mass. C-rich amorphous carbon dust is significant for lower-mass progenitors (up to 15 Msun), but its mass never exceeds 0.05 Msun. For progenitors up to 30 Msun, we provide best-fit functions describing the masses of O-rich dust, C-rich dust, and CO molecules. A large stochastic variation is found in the predicted masses of silicate dust, which correlates with the randomness of shell-merger events in the pre-explosion phases of massive stars. Furthermore, we show that the dust mass for a given progenitor can vary by a factor of 2-5, reflecting differences in pre-explosion abundance profiles predicted by the stellar evolution codes KEPLER and MESA. We emphasize that the final dust yield in CCSNe is primarily determined by stochastic stellar yields and uncertainties in pre-explosion nucleosynthesis, while explosion properties mainly influence the timescales of dust formation.</description>

      <title>Dust attenuation evolution in $z \sim 2$-$12$ JWST galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05996v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A sizable fraction of the heavy elements synthesized by stars in galaxies condenses into sub-micron-sized solid-state particles, known as dust grains. Dust produces a wavelength-dependent attenuation, $A_\lambda$, of the galaxy emission, thereby significantly altering its observed properties. Locally, $A_\lambda$ is in general the sum of a power-law and a UV feature ('bump') produced by small, carbon-based grains. However, scant information exists regarding its evolution across cosmic time. Here, leveraging data from 173 galaxies observed by the James Webb Space Telescope in the redshift range z = 2 - 12, we report the most distant detection of the UV bump in a z ~ 7.55 galaxy (when the Universe was only ~ 700 Myr old), and show for the first time that the power-law slope and the bump strength decrease towards high redshifts. We propose that the flat $A_\lambda$ shape at early epochs is produced by large grains newly formed in supernova ejecta, which act as the main dust factories at such early epochs. Importantly, these grains have undergone minimal reprocessing in the interstellar medium due to the limited available cosmic time. This discovery opens new perspectives in the study of cosmic dust origin and evolution.</description>

Abstract: The Quick Ultra-VIolet Kilonova surveyor (QUVIK), a two-band UV space telescope approved for funding as a Czech national science and technology mission, will focus on detecting early UV light of kilonovae (Werner et al., 2024). In addition, it will study the UV emission of stars and stellar systems (Krti\v{c}ka et al., 2024) as well as the intense and variable emission of active galactic nuclei (AGN) or galactic nuclei activated by tidal disruption events (Zaja\v{c}ek et al., 2024). In this contribution, we describe the role of this small ($\sim 30$-cm diameter) UV telescope for studying bright, nearby AGN. With its NUV and FUV bands, the telescope will perform high-cadence ($\sim 0.1$-$1$ day) two-band photometric monitoring of nearby AGN ($z&lt;1$), which will allow us to probe accretion disk sizes/temperature profiles via photometric reverberation mapping. Thanks to its versatility, QUVIK will be able to perform a moderately fast repointing ($&lt;20$ min) to target candidates for tidal disruption events (TDEs). Early detection of the UV emission following a TDE optical flare, in combination with the subsequent two-band UV monitoring performed simultaneously with other observatories, will enable us to infer the time delay (or its lack of) between the optical, UV, and X-ray emission. In combination with theoretical models, it will be possible to shed more light on the origin of the UV/optical emission of TDEs. Furthermore, the two-band monitoring of nuclear transients will be beneficial in distinguishing between TDEs (nearly constant blue colour) and supernovae (progressive reddening) in the era of intensive wide-field surveys.</description>

      <title>JWST/NIRSpec Observations of High Ionization Emission Lines in Galaxies at High Redshift</title>

Abstract: JWST spectroscopy has built large emission line samples at $z\gtrsim4$, but it has yet to confidently reveal many galaxies with the hard radiation fields commonly associated with AGN photoionization. While this may indicate a weaker UV ionizing spectrum in many $z&gt;4$ AGNs or obscuration from dense neutral gas and dust, the complete picture remains unclear owing to the small number of deep rest-UV spectra. Here we characterize the strength of high ionization lines in $53$ new galaxies observed with NIRSpec $R=2700$ grating spectroscopy. We present new detections of narrow NV$\lambda1240$ in two galaxies. One is a previously-confirmed $z=6.98$ Little Red Dot (LRD) with broad H$\beta$, and the other is a $z=8.72$ galaxy with a narrow line spectrum. Neither source exhibits CIV or HeII emission, indicating large NV/CIV and NV/HeII ratios that may reflect a combination of nitrogen-enhancement and resonant scattering effects. We investigate the incidence of narrow high ionization lines in a large database of $851$ NIRSpec grating spectra, and we separately quantify the fraction of LRDs with narrow high ionization UV emission lines. Our results likely suggest that hard radiation fields are indeed present in a small subset of LRDs ($12.5^{+23.7}_{-10.4}\%$) and UV-selected galaxies ($2.2^{+1.7}_{-1.0}\%$) at $z&gt;4$. The identification of narrow high ionization lines in the population of LRDs with strong Balmer absorption suggests the dense neutral hydrogen gas may not uniformly cover the nucleus. The strong NV (coupled with weak CIV and HeII) suggests that efforts to identify high ionization lines should extend down in wavelength to the NV doublet.</description>

      <title>Head-on collisions of fuzzy/cold dark matter subhalos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform head-on collision simulations of compact dark matter subhalos using distinct numerical methods for fuzzy dark matter (FDM) and cold dark matter (CDM) models. For FDM, we solve the Schr\"odinger-Poisson equations with a pseudospectral solver, while for CDM, we utilize a smoothed particle hydrodynamics N-body code. Our results show that velocity decrease of subhalos is significantly greater in FDM model than in CDM, particularly at lower initial velocities, attributed to gravitational cooling-a unique mechanism of stabilizing in FDM with dissipating kinetic energy. This stark contrast in energy dissipation between two DM models suggests that FDM may offer valuable insights into understanding the dynamic behaviors of DM during galaxy cluster collisions, such as those observed in the Bullet cluster and Abell 520. These findings strongly suggest that FDM is not only capable of explaining these complex astrophysical phenomena but also serves as a compelling alternative to the traditional CDM model, offering resolutions to longstanding discrepancies in DM behavior.</description>

      <title>The $z=7.08$ quasar ULAS J1120+0641 May Never Reach a "Normal" Black Hole to Stellar Mass Ratio</title>

Abstract: JWST observations of quasars in the Epoch of Reionization have revealed that many lie in host galaxies that are severely undermassive relative to the supermassive black holes. It is unclear how these systems will evolve to the tight local relation between stellar mass and black hole mass. We search for companions around the z=7.08 quasar ULAS J1120+0641 using JWST/NIRCam narrow, medium, and wide-band photometry to identify [O III] emitters at the quasar redshift, and explore the potential for growth of the host galaxy through future mergers. We find 22 sources near the quasar's redshift across our two 4.4 arcmin$^2$ fields, indicating that environment of ULAS J1120+0641 is strongly overdense in z~7.1 galaxies relative to the field. We estimate the potential future mass budget of the quasar host galaxy by summing the current stellar and gas masses of the quasar host and surrounding galaxies, correcting for incompleteness and selection effects. With no further black hole growth, ULAS J1120+0641 is unlikely to reach a $M_{\mathrm{BH}}/M_*$ ratio less than ~2.5% at z=0, still much higher than typical for local galaxies. However, such systems -- a quiescent black hole in a low-luminosity galaxy -- may have escaped detection locally if they are sufficiently distant.</description>

      <title>Transition metal abundance as a key parameter for the search of Life in the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.03748v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for Life in the Universe generally assumes three basic life's needs: I) building block elements (i.e., CHNOPS), II) a solvent to life's reactions (generally, liquid water) and III) a thermodynamic disequilibrium. It is assumed that similar requirements might be universal in the Cosmos. On our planet, life is able to harvest energy from a wide array of thermodynamic disequilibria, generally in the form of redox disequilibrium. The amount of different redox couples used by living systems has been estimated to be in the range of several thousands of reactions. Each of these energy yielding reactions requires specialised proteins called oxidoreductases, that have one or more metal cofactors acting as catalytic centres to exchange electrons. These metals are de facto the key component of the engines that life uses to tap into the thermodynamic disequilibria needed to fuel metabolism. The availability of these transition metals is not uniform in the Universe, and it is a function of the distribution (in time and space) of complex dynamics. Despite this, Life's need for specific metals to access thermodynamic disequilibria has been so far completely overlooked in identifying astrobiological targets. We argue that the availability of at least some transition elements appears to be an essential feature of habitability, and should be considered a primary requisite in selecting exoplanetary targets in the search for life.</description>

      <title>NutMaat: A Python package for stellar spectral classification on the MK system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stellar spectral classification according to the Morgan-Keenan (MK) system remains fundamental to astrophysical studies, yet modern surveys require automated, scalable tools. We present NutMaat, an open-source Python-based package inspired by MKCLASS, designed to automate MK classification while addressing scalability and usability limitations. It employs modern computational tools for batch processing and offers a modular architecture that enables efficient, platform-independent analysis of large spectral datasets. It also includes modules for detecting classical chemically peculiar stars, such as Am, Ap, and $\lambda$ Boo types, using internal consistency checks between different line diagnostics. Tested on the CFLIB and MILES libraries, NutMaat achieved spectral and luminosity classification accuracies comparable to MKCLASS, with minimal systematic offsets and a robust performance down to S/N $\le$ 10. NutMaat successfully identified chemically peculiar stars, tested on LAMOST DR7 ACV variables, and processed the SDSS-IV MaStar library -- which lacks native MK classifications -- to produce a stellar catalog, demonstrating survey readiness. Future development of NutMaat will focus on extending wavelength coverage beyond the 3800--5600 $\r{A}$ range, computational acceleration via Cython, and refining peculiarity classification. Beyond its technical design, NutMaat can provide consistent, MK-standard classification across large-scale spectroscopic surveys, facilitating reliable stellar population analyses, identification of rare objects, and the construction of high-quality spectral catalogs essential for galactic archaeology and stellar evolution studies. As an open-source tool, NutMaat bridges traditional MK methods with modern data workflows, offering a scalable solution for current and future spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>A non-uniform metal distribution in the ram-pressure stripped circumgalactic medium of M86</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The chemical enrichment of X-ray-emitting hot halos has primarily been studied in closed-box galaxy clusters. Investigating the metal content of lower-mass, open systems can serve as a valuable tracer for understanding their dynamical history and the extent of chemical enrichment mechanisms in the Universe. In this context, we use an 85.6 ks XMM-Newton observation to study the spatial distribution of the abundance ratios of Mg, Si, and S with respect to Fe in the hot gas of the ram-pressure-stripped M86, which has undergone morphological transformations. We report that the chemical composition in the M86 galaxy core is more similar to the rest of the hot gaseous content of the Universe than to its stellar population. This result indicate that even supersonic ram-pressure is insufficient to strip the inner part of a galaxy of its hot atmosphere. Comparison with other galaxies undergoing ram-pressure stripping suggests that stripping the "primordial" atmosphere of a galaxy requires a combination of ram-pressure stripping and strong radio-mechanical AGN activity. The X-ray emission structures within M86, the plume and the tail, are found to be relatively isothermal. We observe that the Mg/Fe ratio in the plume is $3.3\sigma$ higher than in the M86 galaxy core and is consistent with that in the M86 group outskirts and the Virgo ICM, suggesting that the plume might originate from the low-entropy group gas due to a galaxy-galaxy collision rather than from the recent ram-pressure stripping of the dense galaxy core.</description>

      <title>The z=1.03 Merging Cluster SPT-CL J0356-5337: New Strong Lensing Analysis with HST and MUSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a strong lensing analysis and reconstruct the mass distribution of SPT-CL J0356-5337, a galaxy cluster at redshift z = 1.034. Our model supersedes previous models by making use of new multi-band HST data and MUSE spectroscopy. We identify two additional lensed galaxies to inform a more well-constrained model using 12 sets of multiple images in 5 separate lensed sources. The three previously-known sources were spectroscopically confirmed by Mahler et al. (2020) at redshifts of z = 2.363, z = 2.364, and z = 3.048. We measured the spectroscopic redshifts of two of the newly-discovered arcs using MUSE data, at z = 3.0205 and z = 5.3288. We increase the number of cluster member galaxies by a factor of three compared to previous work. We also report the detection of extended Lya emission from several background galaxies. We measure the total projected mass density of the two major sub-cluster components, one dominated by the BCG, and the other by a compact group of luminous red galaxies. We find M_BCG(&lt; 80kpc) = 3.93+0.21-0.14 * 10^13Msun and M_LRG(&lt; 80kpc) = 2.92+0.16 -0.23 * 10^13Msun, yielding a mass ratio of 1.35+0.16 -0.08. The strong lensing constraints offer a robust estimate of the projected mass density regardless of modelling assumptions; allowing more substructure in this line of sight does not change the results or conclusions. Our results corroborate the conclusion that SPT-CL J0356-5337 is dominated by two mass components, and is likely undergoing a major merger on the plane of the sky</description>

      <title>Hubble Space Telescope Observations of the Interstellar Interloper 3I/ATLAS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02934v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present high angular resolution observations of the third known interstellar interloper, 3I/ATLAS, from the Hubble Space Telescope. The object is clearly active at 3.8 au pre-perihelion, showing dust emitted from the hot Sun-facing side of the nucleus and a weak, radiation pressure swept tail away from the Sun. We apply a simple model to estimate the mass loss rate in dust as dM/dt = 6 sqrt(a) kg/s, where a is the mean particle size in microns. With 1 &lt; a &lt; 100, we infer dM/dt = 6 to 60 kg/s. A fit to the surface brightness distribution of the inner coma limits the effective radius of the nucleus to be r &lt; 2.8 km, assuming red geometric albedo 0.04. Conversely, the nucleus cannot be smaller than 0.16 km in radius if its coma is supplied by sublimation of carbon monoxide, and must be larger if a less volatile molecule drives the mass loss.</description>

      <title>The role of migration traps in the formation of binary black holes in AGN disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary black holes (BBHs) forming in the accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) represent a promising channel for gravitational-wave production. BBHs are typically expected to originate at migration traps, i.e. radial locations where the Type I migration of embedded stellar-mass black holes (BHs) transitions from outwards to inwards. In this work, we test this assumption by explicitly simulating the radial migration of BH pairs in AGN disks under different torque prescriptions, including thermal effects and the switch to Type II migration. We map where and when binaries form as a function of supermassive BH (SMBH) mass, disk viscosity, and migrating BH mass. We find that, for SMBH masses below $M_\bullet^{\rm thr} \simeq 3\times 10^7 M_\odot$, the majority of pair-up events occur near migration traps (roughly 80%). In contrast, for higher SMBH masses, differential migration dominates and off-trap pair-ups prevail. Most notably, disks without migration traps ($\alpha = 0.01$, $M_\bullet \gtrsim 10^8 M_\odot$) present a significant overdensity of pair-ups at $R\simeq 10^2 R_{\rm S}$ due to traffic-jam-like accumulations where the gamma profile changes slope sharply. We also investigate hierarchical BBH formation, showing that higher-generation pair-ups cluster more tightly around trap or traffic-jam radii. Our results provide realistic prescriptions for BBH pair-up locations and timescales, highlighting the limitations of assuming fixed BBH formation sites.</description>
