      <title>A high-order, high-efficiency adaptive time filter algorithm for shale reservoir model based on coupled fluid flow with porous media flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a third-order time adaptive algorithm with less computation, low complexity is provided for shale reservoir model based on coupled fluid flow with porous media flow. The algorithm combines the three-step linear time filters method for simple post-processing and the second-order backward differential formula (BDF2), is third-order accurate and provides, at no extra computational complexity. At the same time, the time filter method can also be used to damp non-physical oscillations inherent in the BDF2 method, ensuring stability. We proves the variable time stepsize second-order backward differential formula plus time filter (BDF2-TF) algorithm's stability and the convergence properties of the fluid velocity u and hydraulic head $\phi$ in the $L^2$ norm with an order of $O(k_{n+1}^3 + h^3)$. In the experiments, the adaptive algorithm automatically adjusts the time step in response to the varying characteristics of different models, ensuring that errors are maintained within acceptable limits. This algorithm addresses the issue that high-order algorithms may select inappropriate time steps, resulting in instability or reduced precision of the numerical solution, thereby enhancing calculation accuracy and efficiency. We perform three-dimensional numerical experiments to verify the BDF2-TF algorithm's effectiveness, stability, and third-order convergence. Simultaneously, a simplified model is employed to simulate the process of shale oil extraction from reservoirs, further demonstrating the algorithm's practical applicability.</description>

      <title>Randomized greedy algorithms for neural network optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Greedy algorithms have been successfully analyzed and applied in training neural networks for solving variational problems, ensuring guaranteed convergence orders. However, their practical applicability is limited due to the subproblems, which often require an exhaustive search over a discrete dictionary and incur significant computational costs. This limitation becomes critical, especially in high-dimensional problems. In this paper, we propose a more practical approach of randomly discretizing the dictionary at each iteration of the greedy algorithm. We quantify the required size of the randomized discrete dictionary and prove that, with high probability, the proposed algorithm realizes a weak greedy algorithm, achieving optimal convergence orders. Through numerous numerical experiments, we demonstrate the advantage of using randomized discrete dictionaries over a deterministic one by showing orders of magnitude reductions in the size of the discrete dictionary, particularly in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>3D Adaptive VEM with stabilization-free a posteriori error bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper extends the theory of Adaptive Virtual Element Methods (AVEMs) to the three-dimensional meshes showing the possibility to bound the stabilization term by the residual-type error estimator. This new bound enables a stabilization-free a posteriori control for the energy error. Following the recent studies for the bi-dimensional case, we investigate the case of tetrahedral elements with aligned edges and faces. We believe that the AVEMs can be an efficient strategy to address the mesh conforming requirements of standard three-dimensional Adaptive Finite Element Methods (AFEMs), which typically extend the refinement procedure to non-marked mesh cells. Indeed, numerical tests on the Fichera corner shape domain show that this method can reduce the number of three-dimensional cells generated in the refinement process by about 30% with compared to standard AFEMs, for a given error threshold.</description>

      <title>A robust and time-parallel preconditioner for parabolic reconstruction problems using Isogeometric Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a PDE-constrained optimization problem of tracking type with parabolic state equation. The solution to the problem is characterized by the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) system, which we formulate using a strong variational formulation of the state equation and a super weak formulation of the adjoined state equation. This allows us to propose a preconditioner that is robust both in the regularization and the diffusion parameter. In order to discretize the problem, we use Isogeometric Analysis since it allows the construction of sufficiently smooth basis functions effortlessly. To realize the preconditioner, one has to solve a problem over the whole space time cylinder that is elliptic with respect to certain non-standard norms. Using a fast diagonalization approach in time, we reformulate the problem as a collection of elliptic problems in space only. These problems are not only smaller, but our approach also allows to solve them in a time-parallel way. We show the efficiency of the preconditioner by rigorous analysis and illustrate it with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Automated transport separation using the neural shifted proper orthogonal decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a neural network-based methodology for the decomposition of transport-dominated fields using the shifted proper orthogonal decomposition (sPOD). Classical sPOD methods typically require an a priori knowledge of the transport operators to determine the co-moving fields. However, in many real-life problems, such knowledge is difficult or even impossible to obtain, limiting the applicability and benefits of the sPOD. To address this issue, our approach estimates both the transport and co-moving fields simultaneously using neural networks. This is achieved by training two sub-networks dedicated to learning the transports and the co-moving fields, respectively. Applications to synthetic data and a wildland fire model illustrate the capabilities and efficiency of this neural sPOD approach, demonstrating its ability to separate the different fields effectively.</description>

      <title>Mixed Convection and Entropy Generation Analysis of CNT-Water Nanofluid in a Square Cavity with Cylinders and Flow Deflectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the mixed convection of CNT-water nanofluid within a square cavity containing heated cylinders under the influence of a magnetic field, focusing on three geometric configurations: a single heated cylinder, two heated cylinders, and two heated cylinders with a flow deflector. The impact of various parameters, including Reynolds number (Re), Richardson number (Ri), Hartmann number (Ha), wavy wall peaks (n), nanoparticle volume fraction ({\phi}), Hartmann angle ({\gamma}), rotational speed ({\omega}), and inclination angle ({\alpha}), on thermal and fluid dynamic behaviors is analyzed. Results reveal that MWCNT nanofluids consistently achieve higher Nusselt numbers than SWCNT nanofluids, indicating superior heat transfer capabilities. Introducing a second cylinder and a flow deflector enhances thermal interactions, while increasing Ha stabilizes the flow, improving thermal performance. Wavy wall peaks further enhance fluid mixing and heat transfer efficiency. Additionally, SWCNT nanofluids exhibit higher Bejan numbers, indicating a greater dominance of thermal entropy generation over fluid friction. These findings provide valuable insights for optimizing thermal management systems in engineering applications, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate nanofluids, geometric configurations, and magnetic field parameters to achieve optimal thermal performance and fluid stability.</description>

      <title>Computing an Aircraft's Gliding Range and Minimal Return Altitude in Presence of Obstacles and Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the event of a total loss of thrust a pilot must identify a reachable landing site and subsequently execute a forced landing. To do so this, they must estimate which region on the ground can be reached safely in gliding flight. We call this the gliding reachable region (GRR). To compute the GRR, we employ an optimal control formulation aiming to reach a point in space while minimizing altitude loss. A simplified model of the aircraft's dynamics is used, where the effect of turns is neglected. The resulting equations are discretized on a grid and solved numerically. Our algorithm for computing the GRR is fast enough to run in real time during flight, it accounts for ground obstacles and wind, and for each point in the GRR it outputs the path to reach it with minimal loss of altitude. A related problem is estimating the minimal altitude an aircraft needs to glide to a given airfield in the presence of obstacles. This information enables pilots to plan routes that always have an airport within gliding distance. We formalize this problem using an optimal control formulation based on the same aircraft dynamics model. The resulting equations are solved with a second algorithm that outputs the minimal re-entry altitude and the paths to reach the airfield from any position while avoiding obstacles. The algorithms we develop are based on the Ordered Upwind Method and the Fast Marching Method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present composite Bernstein polynomials as a direct collocation method for approximating optimal control problems. An analysis of the convergence properties of composite Bernstein polynomials is provided, and beneficial properties of composite Bernstein polynomials for the solution of optimal control problems are discussed. The efficacy of the proposed approximation method is demonstrated through a bang-bang example. Lastly, we apply this method to a motion planning problem, offering a practical solution that emphasizes the ability of this method to solve complex optimal control problems.</description>

      <title>Reduction of a nonlinear system and its numerical solution using a fractional iterative method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2007.02776v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A nonlinear algebraic equation system of 5 variables is numerically solved, which is derived from the application of the Fourier transform to a differential equation system that allows modeling the behavior of the temperatures and the efficiencies of a hybrid solar receiver, which in simple terms is the combination of a photovoltaic system with a thermoelectric system. In addition, a way to reduce the previous system to a nonlinear system of only 2 variables is presented. Naturally, reducing algebraic equation systems of dimension N to systems of smaller dimensions has the main advantage of reducing the number of variables involved in a problem, but the analytical expressions of the systems become more complicated. However, to minimize this disadvantage, an iterative method that does not explicitly depend on the analytical complexity of the system to be solved is used. A fractional iterative method, valid for one and several variables, that uses the properties of fractional calculus, in particular the fact that the fractional derivatives of constants are not always zero, to find solutions of nonlinear systems is presented.</description>

Abstract: A nonlinear algebraic equation system of two variables is numerically solved, which is derived from a nonlinear algebraic equation system of four variables, that corresponds to a mathematical model related to investment under conditions of uncertainty. The theory of investment under uncertainty scenarios proposes a model to determine when a producer must expand or close, depending on his income. The system mentioned above is solved using a fractional iterative method, valid for one and several variables, that uses the properties of fractional calculus, in particular the fact that the fractional derivatives of constants are not always zero, to find solutions of nonlinear systems.</description>

Abstract: Stochastic reaction network models arise in intracellular chemical reactions, epidemiological models and other population process models, and are a class of continuous time Markov chains which have the nonnegative integer lattice as state space. We consider the problem of estimating the conditional probability distribution of a stochastic reaction network given exact partial state observations in time snapshots. We propose a particle filtering method called the targeting method. Our approach takes into account that the reaction counts in between two observation snapshots satisfy linear constraints and also uses inhomogeneous Poisson processes as proposals for the reaction counts to facilitate exact interpolation. We provide rigorous analysis as well as numerical examples to illustrate our method and compare it with other alternatives.</description>

      <title>Convergence Acceleration of Favre-Averaged Non-Linear Harmonic Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a numerical procedure to accelerate the convergence of the Favre-averaged Non-Linear Harmonic (FNLH) method. The scheme provides a unified mathematical framework for solving the sparse linear systems formed by the mean flow and the time-linearized harmonic flows of FNLH in an explicit or implicit fashion. The approach explores the similarity of the sparse linear systems of FNLH and leads to a memory efficient procedure, so that its memory consumption does not depend on the number of harmonics to compute. The proposed method has been implemented in the industrial CFD solver HYDRA. Two test cases are used to conduct a comparative study of explicit and implicit schemes in terms of convergence, computational efficiency, and memory consumption. Comparisons show that the implicit scheme yields better convergence than the explicit scheme and is also roughly 7 to 10 times more computationally efficient than the explicit scheme with 4 levels of multigrid. Furthermore, the implicit scheme consumes only approximately $50\%$ of the explicit scheme with four levels of multigrid. Compared with the full annulus unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulations, the implicit scheme produces comparable results to URANS with computational time and memory consumption that are two orders of magnitude smaller.</description>

      <title>Universal Approximation of Dynamical Systems by Semi-Autonomous Neural ODEs and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce semi-autonomous neural ordinary differential equations (SA-NODEs), a variation of the vanilla NODEs, employing fewer parameters. We investigate the universal approximation properties of SA-NODEs for dynamical systems from both a theoretical and a numerical perspective. Within the assumption of a finite-time horizon, under general hypotheses we establish an asymptotic approximation result, demonstrating that the error vanishes as the number of parameters goes to infinity. Under additional regularity assumptions, we further specify this convergence rate in relation to the number of parameters, utilizing quantitative approximation results in the Barron space. Based on the previous result, we prove an approximation rate for transport equations by their neural counterparts. Our numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of SA-NODEs in capturing the dynamics of various ODE systems and transport equations. Additionally, we compare SA-NODEs with vanilla NODEs, highlighting the superior performance and reduced complexity of our approach.</description>

      <title>A New Scalar Auxiliary Variable Approach for Gradient Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) approach is a highly efficient method widely used for solving gradient flow systems. This approach offers several advantages, including linearity, unconditional energy stability, and ease of implementation. By introducing scalar auxiliary variables, a modified system that is equivalent to the original system is constructed at the continuous level. However, during temporal discretization, computational errors can lead to a loss of equivalence and accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a new Constant Scalar Auxiliary Variable (CSAV) approach in which we derive an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) for the constant scalar auxiliary variable r. We also introduce a stabilization parameter ({\alpha}) to improve the stability of the scheme by slowing down the dynamics of r. The CSAV approach provides additional benefits as well. We explicitly discretize the auxiliary variable in combination with the nonlinear term, enabling the solution of a single linear system with constant coefficients at each time step. This new approach also eliminates the need for assumptions about the free energy potential, removing the bounded-from-below restriction imposed by the nonlinear free energy potential in the original SAV approach. Finally, we validate the proposed method through extensive numerical simulations, demonstrating its effectiveness and accuracy.</description>

Abstract: We consider structured approximation of measures in Wasserstein space $\mathrm{W}_p(\mathbb{R}^d)$ for $p\in[1,\infty)$ using general measure approximants compactly supported on Voronoi regions derived from a scaled Voronoi partition of $\mathbb{R}^d$. We show that if a full rank lattice $\Lambda$ is scaled by a factor of $h\in(0,1]$, then approximation of a measure based on the Voronoi partition of $h\Lambda$ is $O(h)$ regardless of $d$ or $p$. We then use a covering argument to show that $N$-term approximations of compactly supported measures is $O(N^{-\frac1d})$ which matches known rates for optimal quantizers and empirical measure approximation in most instances. Additionally, we generalize our construction to nonuniform Voronoi partitions, highlighting the flexibility and robustness of our approach for various measure approximation scenarios. Finally, we extend these results to noncompactly supported measures with sufficient decay. Our findings are pertinent to applications in computer vision and machine learning where measures are used to represent structured data such as images.</description>

      <title>Shortest-path recovery from signature with an optimal control approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10619v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the signature-to-path reconstruction problem from the control theoretic perspective. Namely, we design an optimal control problem whose solution leads to the minimal-length path that generates a given signature. In order to do that, we minimize a cost functional consisting of two competing terms, i.e., a weighted final-time cost combined with the $L^2$-norm squared of the controls. Moreover, we can show that, by taking the limit to infinity of the parameter that tunes the final-time cost, the problem $\Gamma$-converges to the problem of finding a sub-Riemannian geodesic connecting two signatures. Finally, we provide an alternative reformulation of the latter problem, which is particularly suitable for the numerical implementation.</description>

      <title>Neural Fractional Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fractional Differential Equations (FDEs) are essential tools for modelling complex systems in science and engineering. They extend the traditional concepts of differentiation and integration to non-integer orders, enabling a more precise representation of processes characterised by non-local and memory-dependent behaviours.
  This property is useful in systems where variables do not respond to changes instantaneously, but instead exhibit a strong memory of past interactions.
  Having this in mind, and drawing inspiration from Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), we propose the Neural FDE, a novel deep neural network architecture that adjusts a FDE to the dynamics of data.
  This work provides a comprehensive overview of the numerical method employed in Neural FDEs and the Neural FDE architecture. The numerical outcomes suggest that, despite being more computationally demanding, the Neural FDE may outperform the Neural ODE in modelling systems with memory or dependencies on past states, and it can effectively be applied to learn more intricate dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Quantifying variabilities in cardiac digital twin models of the electrocardiogram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cardiac digital twins (CDTs) of human cardiac electrophysiology (EP) are digital replicas of patient hearts that match like-for-like clinical observations. The electrocardiogram (ECG), as the most prevalent non-invasive observation of cardiac electrophysiology, is considered an ideal target for CDT calibration. Recent advanced CDT calibration methods have demonstrated their ability to minimize discrepancies between simulated and measured ECG signals, effectively replicating all key morphological features relevant to diagnostics. However, due to the inherent nature of clinical data acquisition and CDT model generation pipelines, discrepancies inevitably arise between the real physical electrophysiology in a patient and the simulated virtual electrophysiology in a CDT. In this study, we aim to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the impact of these uncertainties on ECG morphology and diagnostic markers. We analyze residual beat-to-beat variability in ECG recordings obtained from healthy subjects and patients. Using a biophysically detailed and anatomically accurate computational model of whole-heart electrophysiology combined with a detailed torso model calibrated to closely replicate measured ECG signals, we vary anatomical factors (heart location, orientation, size), heterogeneity in electrical conductivities in the heart and torso, and electrode placements across ECG leads to assess their qualitative impact on ECG morphology. Our study demonstrates that diagnostically relevant ECG features and overall morphology appear relatively robust against the investigated uncertainties. This resilience is consistent with the narrow distribution of ECG due to residual beat-to-beat variability observed in both healthy subjects and patients.</description>
