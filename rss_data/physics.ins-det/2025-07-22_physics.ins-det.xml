      <title>R&amp;D on a high-performance electromagnetic calorimeter based on oriented crystalline scintillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although inorganic scintillators are widely used in the design of electromagnetic calorimeters for high-energy physics and astrophysics, their crystalline nature and, hence, their lattice orientation are generally neglected in the detector design. However, in general, the features of the electromagnetic field experienced by the particles impinging on a crystal at a small angle with respect to a lattice axis affect their interaction mechanisms. In particular, in case of electrons/photons of $\mathcal{O} (10~\mathrm{GeV})$ or higher impinging on a high-$Z$ crystal at an angle of $\lesssim 1~\mathrm{mrad}$, the so-called strong field regime is attained: the bremsstrahlung and pair production cross sections are enhanced with respect to the case of amorphous or randomly oriented materials. Overall, the increase of these processes leads to an acceleration of the electromagnetic shower development. These effects are thoroughly investigated by the OREO (ORiEnted calOrimeter) team, and pave the way to the development of innovative calorimeters with a higher energy resolution, a higher efficiency in photon detection and an improved particle identification capabilities due to the relative boost of the electromagnetic interactions with respect to the hadronic ones. Moreover, a detector with the same resolution as the current state of the art and reduced thickness could be developed. An overview of the lattice effects at the foundation of the shower boost and of the current status of the development of an operational calorimeter prototype are presented. This concept could prove pivotal for both accelerator fixed-target experiments and satellite-borne $\gamma$-ray observatories.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of a Full Field Fluorescence Imager with Synchrotron Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design and evaluation on the NSLS-II beamline of the 3FI application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) bump-bonded to a simply, planar, two-dimensionally segmented silicon sensor is presented. The ASIC was developed for Full-Field Fluorescence spectral X-ray Imaging (3FI). It is a small-scale prototype that features a square array of 32x32 pixels with a pitch of 100 {\mu}m. The ASIC was implemented in a 65 nm CMOS process. Each pixel incorporates a charge-sensitive amplifier, shaping filter, discriminator, peak detector, and sample-and-hold circuit, allowing detection of events and storing signal amplitudes. The system operates in an event-driven readout mode, outputting analog values for threshold-triggered events, allowing high-speed multi-element X-ray fluorescence imaging. At power consumption of 200 {\mu}W per pixel, consisting almost uniquely of power dissipated in analog blocks, 308 eV full width at half maximum (FWHM) energy resolution at 8.04 keV, that corresponds to 30 e- rms equivalent noise charge (ENC) and 138 eV FWHM energy resolution at 3.69 keV (16 e- rms ENC) were obtained, for Cu and Ca K{\alpha} lines, respectively. Each pixel operates independently, and the detector enables in situ trace element microanalysis in biological and environmental research. Its architecture addresses limitations of X-ray Fluorescence Microscopy (XFM), typically requiring mechanical scanning, by offering frame-lees data acquisition, translating to high-throughput operation. The 3FI ASIC is suitable for example for studies of nutrient cycling in the (mycor)rhizosphere, microbial redox processes, and genotype-phenotype correlations in bio-energy crops. Additional performances, such as enhanced spatial resolution can be further improved with coded-aperture and Wolt, extending the use to environmental, biomedical, and material science studies.</description>

      <title>A GEANT4-Based Simulation of Directional Neutron Detectors Using Liquid Scintillators and Boron Carbide Moderators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simulation-based study of a compact directional neutron detector composed of liquid scintillator, Cesium Iodide, with boron carbide (B4C) moderation, and silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). Using GEANT4, we explored multiple detector geometries and material configurations, finding neutron detection efficiencies ranging from approximately 10% to 30%. To evaluate directionality, spatial energy distributions were analyzed and used to train a machine learning classifier, which achieved 100% accuracy in identifying neutron source directions along four cardinal axes. The model remained effective for sources near detector edges, demonstrating robustness. These results establish the feasibility of the proposed detector for applications in nuclear safety, environmental monitoring, and scientific research applications, with future work focused on experimental validation.</description>

      <title>A Virtual Frisch-Grid Geometry-Based CZT Gamma Detector for In-Field Radioisotope Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Virtual Frisch-Grid geometry-based CZT gamma detector developed for identifying different radioisotopes over an energy range from single keV up to 2 MeV, and useful for efficient characterization of CZT crystals. The detector is built with a 3 x 3 matrix of CZT crystals, each measuring approximately 6 mm x 6 mm x 15 mm. The charge generated within the sensor's active volume is read out via an anode connected directly to the AVG3_Dev integrated circuit. A current signal induced by charge drift is collected on side pads of the crystals, enabling reconstruction of a 3D interaction position. This paper discusses the design, development, and performance of the standalone, mobile detector system, which integrates the AVG3_Dev readout IC developed at Brookhaven National Laboratory, high-speed FPGA-based with per-channel digital signal processing, and embedded system capabilities. The device is compact, battery-powered, and supports wireless data streaming, making it suitable for field operations towards radioisotope identification.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale optimal control for Einstein Telescope active seismic isolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multi-scale optimal control framework for active seismic isolation in the Einstein Telescope, a third-generation gravitational-wave observatory. Our approach jointly optimizes feedback and blending filters in a cross-coupled opto-mechanical system using a unified cost function based on the "acausal optimum," which quantifies sensor signal-to-noise ratios across frequencies. This method enables efficient re-optimization under varying sensor configurations and environmental conditions. We apply the framework to two candidate sensing systems: OmniSens-a six-degree-of-freedom inertial isolation system-and BRS-T360, which combines Beam Rotation Sensor (BRS) as an inertial tilt sensor with T360 as a horizontal seismometer. We demonstrate superior low-frequency isolation with OmniSens, reducing platform motion by up to two orders of magnitude near the microseism. The framework allows for ready optimization and projection of sensor noise to metrics relevant to the performance of the instrument, aiding the design of the Einstein Telescope.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic light detectors with thermal signal amplification for $0\nu\beta\beta$ search experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a step towards the realization of cryogenic-detector experiments to search for neutrinoless double-beta decay (such as CROSS, BINGO, and CUPID), we investigated a batch of 10 Ge light detectors (LDs) assisted by Neganov-Trofimov-Luke (NTL) signal amplification. Each LD was assembled with a large cubic light-emitting crystal (45 mm side) using the recently developed CROSS mechanical structure. The detector array was operated at milli-Kelvin temperatures in a pulse-tube cryostat at the Canfranc underground laboratory in Spain. We achieved good performance with scintillating bolometers from CROSS, made of Li$_{2}$$^{100}$MoO$_4$ crystals and used as reference detectors of the setup, and with all LDs tested (except for a single device that encountered an electronics issue). No leakage current was observed for 8 LDs with an electrode bias up to 100 V. Operating the LDs at an 80 V electrode bias applied in parallel, we obtained a gain of around 9 in the signal-to-noise ratio of these devices, allowing us to achieve a baseline noise RMS of $O$(10 eV). Thanks to the strong current polarization of the temperature sensors, the time response of the devices was reduced to around half a millisecond in rise time. The achieved performance of the LDs was extrapolated via simulations of pile-up rejection capability for several configurations of the CUPID detector structure. Despite the sub-optimal noise conditions of the LDs (particularly at high frequencies), we demonstrated that the NTL technology provides a viable solution for background reduction in CUPID.</description>

      <title>Machine learning-enabled river water quality monitoring using lithography-free 3D-printed sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: River water quality monitoring is important for aquatic life, livestock, and humans because clean water is critical to meeting food demand during the global food crisis. Excessive contaminants, including phosphate, deplete dissolved oxygen and trigger eutrophication, leading to serious health and ecological problems. Continuous sensors that track phosphate levels can therefore help prevent eutrophication. In this work we present a lithography-free phosphate sensor (P-sensor) that detects phosphate in river water at parts-per-billion levels. The device uses a solid-state indicator electrode formed by 3D-printed periodic polymer patterns (8 um feature size) coated with a thin phosphate ion-selective membrane. The P-sensor detects as little as 1 ppb phosphate across 0 - 475 ppm with a response time under 30 seconds. We validated the sensor on Rappahannock River water, Virginia (less than 0.8 ppm phosphate) at sites upstream and downstream of a sewage treatment plant and benchmarked the results against a commercial phosphate meter. A feed-forward neural network was trained to predict phosphate levels, achieving a mean-squared error below 1e-3, zero standard deviation, and a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.997 for river samples. These results demonstrate a practical tool for continuous water-quality monitoring that can inform stakeholders and policymakers and ultimately improve public health.</description>

      <title>Improving 8x8 TeraFET array sensitivity through liquid-nitrogen cooling in a compact low-noise cryostat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sensitivity of antenna-coupled field-effect transistors (TeraFETs) to terahertz (THz) radiation has been shown to improve continuously with decreasing temperature. In this work, we first present a quantitative evaluation of the temperature-dependent noise-equivalent power (NEP) of recently developed patch-antenna-coupled TeraFET detectors resonant at 540 GHz, with measurements down to 20 K. Based on these results, we project NEP values approaching 1 to 2 pW/$\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$ under efficient power coupling-comparable to state-of-the-art superconducting niobium transition-edge sensors (TESs) operated at 4 K. Building on these findings in the sub-1 THz range, a compact, low-noise, liquid-nitrogen-cooled (77 K) TeraFET power detection system for spectroscopy applications was realized. The system incorporates an 8$\times$8 pixel-binned detector array fabricated in a commercial 65 nm Si-CMOS process, optimized for operation in the 2.85- to 3.4 THz band, where fast, sensitive and spectrally specific detectors that do not require helium cooling remain scarce. Final system characterization was performed in the focal plane of a 2.85-THz quantum-cascade laser delivering approximately 2 mW of optical power. An experimental linear dynamic range exceeding 67 dB was achieved without saturation (for 1 Hz-detection bandwidth). The system provides a -3 dB detection bandwidth of 5 MHz vastly exceeding that of conventional thermal detectors (typically 1-kHz), thus potentially enabling advanced applications such as time-resolved THz spectroscopy down to the sub-$\mu$s scale. Combined with its broad temperature operability and compact design, the system is particularly well suited for space- and payload-constrained platforms such as balloon- and satellite-based missions, where deep cryogenic cooling is impractical.</description>

      <title>Opportunities and challenges to study solar neutrinos with a Q-Pix pixel readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of solar neutrinos presents significant opportunities in astrophysics, nuclear physics, and particle physics. However, the low-energy nature of these neutrinos introduces considerable challenges to isolate them from background events, requiring detectors with low-energy threshold, high spatial and energy resolutions, and low data rate. We present the study of solar neutrinos with a kiloton-scale liquid argon detector located underground, instrumented with a pixel readout using the Q-Pix technology. We explore the potential of using volume fiducialization, directional topological information, light signal coincidence and pulse-shape discrimination to enhance solar neutrino sensitivity. We find that discriminating neutrino signals below 5 MeV is very difficult. However, we show that these methods are useful for the detection of solar neutrinos when external backgrounds are sufficiently understood and when the detector is built using low-background techniques. When building a workable background model for this study, we identify {\gamma} background from the cavern walls and from capture of {\alpha} particles in radon decay chains as both critical to solar neutrino sensitivity and significantly underconstrained by existing measurements. Finally, we highlight that the main advantage of the use of Q-Pix for solar neutrino studies lies in its ability to enable the continuous readout of all low-energy events with minimal data rates and manageable storage for further offline analyses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: ICEBERG is a liquid argon time projection chamber at Fermilab for the purpose of testing detector components and software for the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE). The detector features a 1.15m x 1m anode plane following the specifications of the DUNE horizontal drift far detector and a newly installed X-ARAPUCA photodetector. The status of ICEBERG is reported along with analysis of noise, pulser, and cosmic ray data from the ninth run beginning May 2024 with the goal of advising the DUNE collaboration on the optimal wire readout electronics configuration. In addition, development of an absolute energy scale calibration method is currently underway using known sources such as cosmic ray muon Michel electrons at the ~10 MeV scale and $^{39}$Ar decay electrons at the ~100keV scale. Research into AI-based identification of such events at the data acquisition level is introduced.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A RadioFrequency Quadrupole (RFQ) cooler-buncher system has been developed and implemented in a collinear laser spectroscopy setup. This system is dedicated to convert a continuous ion beam into short bunches, while enhancing beam quality and reducing energy spread. The functionality of the RFQ cooler-buncher has been verified through offline tests with stable rubidium and indium beam, delivered from a surface ion source and a laser ablation ion source, respectively. With a transmission efficiency exceeding 60\%, bunched ion beams with a full width at half maximum of approximately 2~$\mu$s in the time-of-flight spectrum have been successfully achieved. The implementation of the RFQ cooler-buncher system also significantly improves the overall transmission efficiency of the collinear laser spectroscopy setup.</description>

      <title>Picogram-Level Nanoplastic Analysis with Nanoelectromechanical System Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy: NEMS-FTIR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a photothermal infrared spectroscopy-based approach for the chemical characterization and quantification of nanoplastics. By combining the high sensitivity of nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) with the wide spectral range and ubiquity of commercially available Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometers, NEMS-FTIR offers a cost-efficient and cryogen-free option for the rapid, routine analysis of nanoplastics in aqueous samples. Polypropylene, polystyrene, and polyvinyl chloride nanoplastics with nominal diameters ranging from 54 to 262 nm were analyzed by NEMS-FTIR with limits of detection ranging from 102 pg to 355 pg. The absorptance measured by NEMS-FTIR could be further converted to absolute sample mass using the attenuation coefficient, as demonstrated for polystyrene. Thanks to the wide spectral range of NEMS-FTIR, nanoplastic particles from different polymers could be readily identified, even when present in a mixture. The potential of NEMS-FTIR for the analysis of real samples was demonstrated by identifying the presence of nanoplastics released in water during tea brewing. Polyamide leachates were identified in the brewing water without sample pre-concentration. Accelerated aging of the tea bags under elevated temperature and UV radiation showed further release of polyamide over time.</description>

      <title>First Event-by-Event Identification of Cherenkov Radiation from Sub-MeV Particles in Liquid Argon</title>

Abstract: This Letter reports the event-by-event observation of Cherenkov light from sub-MeV electrons in a high scintillation light-yield liquid argon (LAr) detector by the Coherent CAPTAIN-Mills (CCM) experiment. The CCM200 detector, located at Los Alamos National Laboratory, instruments 7 tons (fiducial volume) of LAr with 200 8-inch photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), 80% of which are coated in a wavelength shifting material and the remaining 20% are uncoated. In the prompt time region of an event, defined as $-6 \leq t \leq 0$ ns relative to the event start time $t=0$, the uncoated PMTs are primarily sensitive to visible Cherenkov photons. Using gamma-rays from a $^{22}$Na source for production of sub-MeV electrons, we isolated prompt Cherenkov light with $&gt;5\sigma$ confidence and developed a selection to obtain a low-background electromagnetic sample. This is the first event-by-event observation of Cherenkov photons from sub-MeV electrons in a high-yield scintillator detector, and represents a milestone in low-energy particle detector development.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the Liquid Argon Scintillation Pulse Shape Using Differentiable Simulation in the Coherent CAPTAIN-Mills Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Coherent CAPTAIN-Mills (CCM) experiment is a liquid argon (LAr) light collection detector searching for MeV-scale neutrino and Beyond Standard Model physics signatures. Two hundred 8-inch photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) instrument the 7 ton fiducial volume with 50% photocathode coverage to detect light produced by charged particles. CCM's light-based approach reduces requirements of LAr purity, compared to other detection technologies, such that sub-MeV particles can be reliably detected without additional LAr filtration and with O(1) parts-per-million of common contaminants. We present a measurement of LAr light production and propagation parameters, with uncertainties, obtained from a sample of MeV-scale electromagnetic events. The optimization of this high-dimensional parameter space was facilitated by a differentiable optical photon Monte-Carlo simulation, and detailed PMT response characterization. This result accurately predicts the timing and spatial distribution of light due to scintillation and Cherenkov emission in the detector. This is the first description of photon propagation in LAr to include several effects, including: anomalous dispersion of the index of refraction near the ultraviolet resonance, Mie scattering from impurities, and Cherenkov light production.</description>

      <title>Multislice Hollow Ptychography for Simultaneous Atomic-Layer-Resolved 3D Structural Imaging and Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron matter interactions in electron microscopy produce both elastic and inelastic scattering, forming the basis for imaging and spectroscopy. However, the integration of electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) with 4D-STEM and electron ptychography remains challenging because of detector geometry conflicts. Song et al. solved this issue by introducing a hollow type pixelated detector that enables hollow ptychography and allows low angle electrons to go through to the EELS spectrometer. The single-slice approach of hollow ptychography proves effective for 2D thin materials but struggles with multiple scattering in thicker specimens. Here, we introduce multislice hollow ptychography (MHP), a robust imaging modality that overcomes these limitations by accounting for multiple scattering. MHP enables high-resolution structural imaging from hollow diffraction patterns while remaining compatible with simultaneous EELS acquisition. It potentially can provide sub-angstrom lateral resolution at intermediate doses and supports full 3D atomic-layer reconstruction at ultrahigh doses, with up to 70% of total electrons available for spectroscopy. This flexible framework facilitates correlative 3D imaging and chemical mapping in complex materials, including interfaces, defects, and dopants.</description>
