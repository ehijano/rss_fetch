      <title>Pairing symmetry and superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity with a transition temperature $T_c$ over 40 K in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and (La,Pr)$_{3}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films at ambient pressure marks an important step in the field of nickelate superconductors. Here, we perform a renormalized mean-field theory study of the superconductivity in $\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$ thin films, using a bilayer two-orbital $t-J$ model. Our result reveals an $s_\pm$-wave pairing symmetry driven by the strong interlayer superexchange coupling of $d_{z^2}$ orbital, resembling the pressurized bulk case. Also, we roughly reproduce the experimentally reported nodeless shape of the superconducting gap at the $\beta$ pocket and the superconducting $T_c$. To gain insight into the orbital feature of superconductivity, we explore the projection of different pairing bonds on Fermi surface. We find that the nodeless gap at $\beta$ pocket is related to the interlayer pairing within both $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, in which the latter is triggered by the former through hybridization, and both hold the same sign.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Chiral Superconductivity via Impurity Bound States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the symmetry of Cooper pairs remains a central challenge in the study of unconventional superconductors, particularly for chiral states that spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry. Here we demonstrate that point-like impurities in chiral superconductors generate in-gap bound states with a distinctive asymmetry: the local density of states at the impurity site vanishes at one bound-state energy, but not at its particle-hole conjugate. We prove this behavior analytically in generic two-dimensional, single-band chiral superconductors, showing it arises from a fundamental interplay between pairing chirality and crystalline rotation symmetry. Our numerical simulations confirm that this diagnostic feature persists in multiband systems and for spatially extended impurities. Our results establish a symmetry-enforced real-space diagnostic for chiral superconductivity at the atomic scale.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in spin-orbit coupled BaBi$_3$ formed by \textit{in situ} reduction of bismuthate films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oxygen-scavenging at oxide heterointerfaces has emerged as a powerful route for stabilizing metastable phases that exhibit interesting phenomena, including high-mobility two-dimensional electron gases and high T$_{c}$ superconductivity. We investigate structural and chemical interactions at the heterointerface formed between Eu metal and the charged-ordered insulator, BaBiO$_3$, which leads to emergent superconductivity at 6 K. A combination of X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy measurements shows that oxygen scavenging by the Eu adlayer leads to the formation of EuO$_x$ and the superconducting intermetallic BaBi$_3$. The superconducting state is quasi-two-dimensional, as evidenced by the angle-dependent magnetotransport measurements and current-voltage characteristics. An in-plane upper critical field B$_{c2}$ significantly exceeding the Pauli paramagnetic limit is observed, possibly reflecting features of Ising superconductivity. The strong spin-orbit coupling at the Bi sites may pave the way for the realization of high-T$_{c}$ topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Visualization and manipulation of four-leaf clover-shaped electronic state in cuprate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-Tc superconductivity in cuprates arises from carrier doping of an antiferromagnetic Mott insulator. Associated with these changes are spectral-weight transfers from the high-energy to low-energy, giving rise to a variety of intriguing electronic phenomena. In this study, for the first time, we discovered a 2a0 sized four-leaf clover-shaped (FLC) electronic state at low-energy, accompanied with the emergence of a characteristic "kink" around 16meV. With increasing doping, the number of FLC pattern decreases and ultimately vanishes in the overdoped region. Remarkably, we achieved real-time electric-field manipulation of this FLC state, through innovative in-situ scanning tunneling microscopy probe. This novel FLC state may not only redefine our understanding of precursor states of pairing, but also reveals its crucial role as a tunable electronic phase in high-Tc superconductors.</description>

      <title>Optimal superconductivity near a Lifshitz transition in strained (La,Pr)$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-temperature superconductivity in pressurized and strained bilayer nickelates (La,Pr)$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has emerged as a new frontier. One of the key unresolved issues concerns the fermiology that underlies superconductivity. On both theoretical and experimental sides, no general consensus has been reached, and conflicting results exist regarding whether the relevant Fermi surface involves a hole $\gamma$ pocket, or not. Here, we address this issue by unveiling a Janus-faced role of the $\gamma$ pocket in spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity. We show that this pocket simultaneously induces dominant pair-breaking and pair-forming fluctuations for the leading $s_\pm$-wave pairing. Consequently, an optimal superconducting transition temperature $T_\mathrm{c}$ is achieved when the $\gamma$ pocket surfaces at the Fermi level, placing the system near a Lifshitz transition. This suggests that superconductivity can emerge provided the maximum energy level of the $\gamma$ pocket lies sufficiently close to the Fermi level, either from below or above. Our finding not only reconciles two opposing viewpoints on the fermiology, but also naturally explains recent experiments on (La,Pr)$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films, including the superconductivity under compressive strain, two conflicting measurements on the Fermi surface, and the dome shape of $T_\mathrm{c}$ as a function of hole doping.</description>

      <title>Frustrated edge currents in bilayers formed of s- and d-wave superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore edge currents in heterostructures formed of a high-$T_c$ cuprate and a conventional $s$-wave superconductors. The resulting $d\pm is$ superconductor spontaneously breaks time reversal symmetry and, remarkably, exhibits large edge currents along certain edge directions in spite of being topologically trivial. In addition we find that the edge currents are frustrated such that they appear to emerge from or flow into sample corners, seemingly violating charge conservation. Careful self-consistent solutions that guarantee charge conservation are required to understand how this frustration is resolved in physical systems. Calculations within the Ginzburg-Landau theory framework and fully self-consistent microscopic lattice models reveal intriguing patterns of current reversals depending on edge orientation, accompanied by spontaneous formation of magnetic flux patterns which can be used to detect these phenomena experimentally. Our study illuminates the interplay between time-reversal symmetry breaking and unconventional superconductivity in high-$T_c$ superconducting heterostructures, and shows that sizable edge currents are possible even in the absence of non-trivial bulk topology.</description>

      <title>Theory of the Anderson transition in three-dimensional chiral symmetry classes: Connection to type-II superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase transitions governed by topological defects constitute a cornerstone of modern physics. Two-dimensional (2D) Anderson transitions in chiral symmetry classes are driven by the proliferation of vortex-antivortex pairs -- a mechanism analogous to the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in the 2D XY model. In this work, we extend this paradigm to three-dimensional (3D) chiral symmetry classes, where vortex loops emerge as the key topological defects governing the Anderson transition. By deriving the dual representation of the 3D nonlinear sigma model for the chiral unitary class, we develop a mean-field theory of its Anderson transition and elucidate the role of 1D weak band topology in the Anderson transition. Strikingly, our dual representation of the 3D NLSM in the chiral symmetry class uncovers its connection to the magnetostatics of 3D type-II superconductors. The metal-to-quasilocalized and quasilocalized-to-insulating transitions in 3D chiral symmetry class share a unified theoretical framework with the normal-to-mixed and mixed-to-superconducting transitions in 3D type-II superconductors under an external magnetic field, respectively.</description>

      <title>New plasmon-like mode in PdTe$_{2}$: Raman scattering and memory function study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PdTe$_2$ is a type II Dirac semimetal that has garnered significant attention due to its intriguing electronic and topological properties. Here, we report temperature dependent Raman scattering study of PdTe$_2$ in the temperature range from 10 K to 300 K. Our study reveals emergence of a new unreported peak below 100 K, centered around 250 cm$^{-1}$. We argue that the new mode is not a phonon mode because the Raman spectra calculated using Density Functional Theory shows only two intense peaks at 85 $ cm^{-1}$ and 128 $cm^{-1}$. To ascertain the origin of this new peak, we constructed a microscopic model of electrons coupling to a single plasmon mode at 250 $cm^{-1}$ and using the memory function formalism, we obtained that the Raman relaxation rate is linear in frequency. We also performed phenomenological analysis of the Raman response from the experimental data and computed frequency dependent Raman relaxation rate, which is also found to exhibit a linear dependence on frequency. With the congruence of our theoretical and phenomenological results we could ascertain that the new mode observed at low temperatures is indeed a plasmon-like mode. Further, phonon frequencies and line widths of the two phonon modes exhibit anomalous behavior above 100 K.</description>

      <title>Phase diagrams and two key factors to superconductivity of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08682v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates has drawn great attention. Many works have been done to study the superconductivity as well as to find more superconducting RP nickelates. However, there is a lack of general understanding regarding the key factors that contribute to the superconductivity of RP nickelates. Here, we systematically study the series of RP nickelates under doping or high-pressure conditions by means of density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory. We find that enhanced quasi-particle weights and local spin fluctuation of the Ni-$e_g$ orbitals are commonly realized by hole doping or high pressure in the known superconducting RP nickelates, suggesting that they are crucial to the superconductivity. We also summarize experimentally synthesized RP nickelates into phase diagrams with local spin moment and local entanglement entropy as parameters, where phases of spin density wave/antiferromagnetism, superconductivity, and Fermi liquid are distinguished. At last, we predict a promising candidate for superconducting RP nickelates, which is constructed in a ``bilayer-trilayer'' stacking sequence.</description>

      <title>Orbital FFLO and layer-selective FFLO phases in trilayer NbSe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finite-momentum superconductivity has become an important research topic in condensed matter physics. In particular, the orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, which is stabi lized in atomically thin films by the orbital effect of an external magnetic field, has been getting attention as a fascinating finite-momentum superconducting state recently. We study the phase diagram of the trilayer Ising superconductor NbSe$_2$ in the in-plane magnetic field, taking into ac count the orbital effect, the paramagnetic effect, and the spin-orbit coupling. The finite-momentum gap structure in the high-field region is shown by a large-scale numerical calculation based on the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation. We find an exotic superconducting phase, a layer-selective FFLO phase, in which finite-momentum Cooper pairs coexist with zero-momentum Cooper pairs, separated from the orbital FFLO phase.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study on ambient pressure superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films : structural analysis, model construction, and robustness of $s\pm$-wave pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically study ambient pressure superconductivity in thin films of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. We construct model Hamiltonians adopting the crystal structure theoretically determined by fixing the in-plane lattice constant to those substrates examined in the experiment. We also construct a model based on the experimentally determined lattice structure. To the models obtained, we apply the fluctuation exchange approximation, which takes into account the full momentum and frequency dependencies of the Green function and the pairing interaction. We find that the electronic structure, including the presence/absence of the so-called $\gamma$-pocket (the Fermi surface originating from the top of the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ bonding band) depends on the crystal structure adopted and/or the presence/absence of $+U$ correction in the band structure calculation. Nonetheless, $s\pm$-wave pairing symmetry remains robust regardless of these details in the band structure. The robustness of the $s\pm$-wave pairing mainly owes to the large sign changing superconducting gap function of the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ bands around $(k_x,k_y)=(0,0)$ and $(k_x,k_y)=(\pi,\pi)$, which originates from the finite energy spin fluctuations. On the other hand, $T_c$ being halved from that of the pressurized bulk can only be understood by adopting the model with small $|t_\perp|$ derived from the experimentally determined crystal structure, at least within the present FLEX approach, although there may remain some other possibilities beyond this approach for the origin of the reduced $T_c$.</description>
