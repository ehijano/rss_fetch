      <title>Novel Methods for Analyzing Cellular Interactions in Deep Learning-Based Image Cytometry: Spatial Interaction Potential and Co-Localization Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study presents a novel approach for quantifying cellular interactions in digital pathology using deep learning-based image cytometry. Traditional methods struggle with the diversity and heterogeneity of cells within tissues. To address this, we introduce the Spatial Interaction Potential (SIP) and the Co-Localization Index (CLI), leveraging deep learning classification probabilities. SIP assesses the potential for cell-to-cell interactions, similar to an electric field, while CLI incorporates distances between cells, accounting for dynamic cell movements. Our approach enhances traditional methods, providing a more sophisticated analysis of cellular interactions. We validate SIP and CLI through simulations and apply them to colorectal cancer specimens, demonstrating strong correlations with actual biological data. This innovative method offers significant improvements in understanding cellular interactions and has potential applications in various fields of digital pathology.</description>

      <title>Rapid and accurate mosquito abundance forecasting with Aedes-AI neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method to convert weather data into probabilistic forecasts of Aedes aegypti abundance. The approach, which relies on the Aedes-AI suite of neural networks, produces weekly point predictions with corresponding uncertainty estimates. Once calibrated on past trap and weather data, the model is designed to use weather forecasts to estimate future trap catches. We demonstrate that when reliable input data are used, the resulting predictions have high skill. This technique may therefore be used to supplement vector surveillance efforts or identify periods of elevated risk for vector-borne disease outbreaks.</description>

      <title>Coalitions of AI-based Methods Predict 15-Year Risks of Breast Cancer Metastasis Using Real-World Clinical Data with AUC up to 0.9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the two cancers responsible for the most deaths in women, with about 42,000 deaths each year in the US. That there are over 300,000 breast cancers newly diagnosed each year suggests that only a fraction of the cancers result in mortality. Thus, most of the women undergo seemingly curative treatment for localized cancers, but a significant later succumb to metastatic disease for which current treatments are only temporizing for the vast majority. The current prognostic metrics are of little actionable value for 4 of the 5 women seemingly cured after local treatment, and many women are exposed to morbid and even mortal adjuvant therapies unnecessarily, with these adjuvant therapies reducing metastatic recurrence by only a third. Thus, there is a need for better prognostics to target aggressive treatment at those who are likely to relapse and spare those who were actually cured. While there is a plethora of molecular and tumor-marker assays in use and under-development to detect recurrence early, these are time consuming, expensive and still often un-validated as to actionable prognostic utility. A different approach would use large data techniques to determine clinical and histopathological parameters that would provide accurate prognostics using existing data. Herein, we report on machine learning, together with grid search and Bayesian Networks to develop algorithms that present a AUC of up to 0.9 in ROC analyses, using only extant data. Such algorithms could be rapidly translated to clinical management as they do not require testing beyond routine tumor evaluations.</description>

      <title>Automatic detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment using high-dimensional acoustic features in spontaneous speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study addresses the TAUKADIAL challenge, focusing on the classification of speech from people with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and neurotypical controls. We conducted three experiments comparing five machine-learning methods: Random Forests, Sparse Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, Sparse Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree, utilizing 1076 acoustic features automatically extracted using openSMILE. In Experiment 1, the entire dataset was used to train a language-agnostic model. Experiment 2 introduced a language detection step, leading to separate model training for each language. Experiment 3 further enhanced the language-agnostic model from Experiment 1, with a specific focus on evaluating the robustness of the models using out-of-sample test data. Across all three experiments, results consistently favored models capable of handling high-dimensional data, such as Random Forest and Sparse Logistic Regression, in classifying speech from MCI and controls.</description>

      <title>Mutant fate in spatially structured populations on graphs: connecting models to experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In nature, most microbial populations have complex spatial structures that can affect their evolution. Evolutionary graph theory predicts that some spatial structures modelled by placing individuals on the nodes of a graph affect the probability that a mutant will fix. Evolution experiments are beginning to explicitly address the impact of graph structures on mutant fixation. However, the assumptions of evolutionary graph theory differ from the conditions of modern evolution experiments, making the comparison between theory and experiment challenging. Here, we aim to bridge this gap by using our new model of spatially structured populations. This model considers connected subpopulations that lie on the nodes of a graph, and allows asymmetric migrations. It can handle large populations, and explicitly models serial passage events with migrations, thus closely mimicking experimental conditions. We analyze recent experiments in light of this model. We suggest useful parameter regimes for future experiments, and we make quantitative predictions for these experiments. In particular, we propose experiments to directly test our recent prediction that the star graph with asymmetric migrations suppresses natural selection and can accelerate mutant fixation or extinction, compared to a well-mixed population.</description>
