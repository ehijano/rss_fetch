      <title>Efficient Estimation of Shortest-Path Distance Distributions to Samples in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large graph datasets become increasingly common across many fields, sampling is often needed to reduce the graphs into manageable sizes. This procedure raises critical questions about representativeness as no sample can capture the properties of the original graph perfectly, and different parts of the graph are not evenly affected by the loss. Recent work has shown that the distances from the non-sampled nodes to the sampled nodes can be a quantitative indicator of bias and fairness in graph machine learning. However, to our knowledge, there is no method for evaluating how a sampling method affects the distribution of shortest-path distances without actually performing the sampling and shortest-path calculation.
  In this paper, we present an accurate and efficient framework for estimating the distribution of shortest-path distances to the sample, applicable to a wide range of sampling methods and graph structures. Our framework is faster than empirical methods and only requires the specification of degree distributions. We also extend our framework to handle graphs with community structures. While this introduces a decrease in accuracy, we demonstrate that our framework remains highly accurate on downstream comparison-based tasks.

      <title>Opinion Dynamics with Multiple Adversaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Opinion dynamics model how the publicly expressed opinions of users in a social network coevolve according to their neighbors as well as their own intrinsic opinion. Motivated by the real-world manipulation of social networks during the 2016 US elections and the 2019 Hong Kong protests, a growing body of work models the effects of a strategic actor who interferes with the network to induce disagreement or polarization. We lift the assumption of a single strategic actor by introducing a model in which any subset of network users can manipulate network outcomes. They do so by acting according to a fictitious intrinsic opinion. Strategic actors can have conflicting goals, and push competing narratives. We characterize the Nash Equilibrium of the resulting meta-game played by the strategic actors. Experiments on real-world social network datasets from Twitter, Reddit, and Political Blogs show that strategic agents can significantly increase polarization and disagreement, as well as increase the "cost" of the equilibrium. To this end, we give worst-case upper bounds on the Price of Misreporting (analogous to the Price of Anarchy). Finally, we give efficient learning algorithms for the platform to (i) detect whether strategic manipulation has occurred, and (ii) learn who the strategic actors are. Our algorithms are accurate on the same real-world datasets, suggesting how platforms can take steps to mitigate the effects of strategic behavior.</description>

      <title>Community Detection in Multimodal Data: A Similarity Network Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Similarity network construction is a fundamental step in many approaches to community detection in biomedical analysis. It is utilised both in the creation of network structures from non-relational data and as a processing step in clustering pipelines. The foundation of any network analysis approach hinges on the quality of the underlying network. With the rising popularity of network learning and use of network-based clustering, the importance of correctly constructing the network is vital. The underlying mechanisms of similarity network construction, particularly the implications of the choice of approach for multi-modal integration, remain poorly explored. By introducing differences in embedded cluster information and noise levels across modalities, we assess the performance of popular similarity integration techniques such as Similarity Network Fusion (SNF) and NEighborhood based Multi-Omics clustering (NEMO). Notably, SNF and NEMO fail to outperform simpler techniques such as mean similarity aggregation when incorporating modalities with inconsistently embedded clusters. We demonstrate how integration methods can be used to incorporate partial modalities - datasets where not all individuals have a full set of measurements in all modalities. SNF shows significant sensitivity to incomplete modalities while NEMO and mean aggregation are more resilient.</description>

      <title>How Does Emotion Affect Information Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the pivotal role of emotions in information dissemination has attracted extensive attention. Research indicates that emotionally charged content significantly outperforms neutral content in dissemination speed and coverage due to its ability to evoke stronger emotional responses. Valence, arousal, and dominance are key factors influencing information retention, comprehension, and sharing. However, systematic analysis of the mechanisms by which emotions affect dissemination and the application of multidimensional emotional design remain limited. This study reviews 166 relevant articles, examining the role of emotions in understanding and sharing information, and proposes a multidimensional design framework based on text, visuals, sound, and interaction design. Incorporating the ``Four-System" model of emotion activation, it develops an emotion regulation framework to optimize the application of emotions in dissemination. This research offers theoretical support and practical guidance for emotion-driven dissemination, laying a foundation for advancing this field.</description>

      <title>Finding Influential Cores via Normalized Ricci Flows in Directed and Undirected Hypergraphs with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many biological and social systems are naturally represented as edge-weighted directed or undirected hypergraphs since they exhibit group interactions involving three or more system units as opposed to pairwise interactions that can be incorporated in graph-theoretic representations. However, finding influential cores in hypergraphs is still not as extensively studied as their graph-theoretic counter-parts. To this end, we develop and implement a hypergraph-curvature guided discrete time diffusion process with suitable topological surgeries and edge-weight re-normalization procedures for both undirected and directed weighted hypergraphs to find influential cores. We successfully apply our framework for directed hypergraphs to seven metabolic hypergraphs and our framework for undirected hypergraphs to two social (co-authorship) hypergraphs to find influential cores, thereby demonstrating the practical feasibility of our approach. In addition, we prove a theorem showing that a certain edge weight re-normalization procedure in a prior research work for Ricci flows for edge-weighted graphs has the undesirable outcome of modifying the edge-weights to negative numbers, thereby rendering the procedure impossible to use. To the best of our knowledge, this seems to be one of the first articles that formulates algorithmic approaches for finding core(s) of (weighted or unweighted) directed hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Uncovering simultaneous breakthroughs with a robust measure of disruptiveness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Progress in science and technology is punctuated by disruptive innovation and breakthroughs. Researchers have characterized these disruptions to explore the factors that spark such innovations and to assess their long-term trends. However, although understanding disruptive breakthroughs and their drivers hinges upon accurately quantifying disruptiveness, the core metric used in previous studies -- the disruption index -- remains insufficiently understood and tested. Here, after demonstrating the critical shortcomings of the disruption index, including its conflicting evaluations for simultaneous discoveries, we propose a new, continuous measure of disruptiveness based on a neural embedding framework that addresses these limitations. Our measure not only better distinguishes disruptive works, such as Nobel Prize-winning papers, from others, but also reveals simultaneous disruptions by allowing us to identify the "twins" that have the most similar future context. By offering a more robust and precise lens for identifying disruptive innovations and simultaneous discoveries, our study provides a foundation for deepening insights into the mechanisms driving scientific breakthroughs while establishing a more equitable basis for evaluating transformative contributions.</description>

      <title>Utilizing Social Media Analytics to Detect Trends in Saudi Arabias Evolving Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Saudi Arabia faced a swift economic growth and societal transformation under Vision 2030. This offers a unique opportunity to track emerging trends in the region, which will ultimately pave the way for new business and investment possibilities. This paper explores how AI and social media analytics can identify and track trends across sectors such as construction, food and beverage, tourism, technology, and entertainment thereby helping the businesses make informed decisions. By leveraging a tailored AI-driven methodology, we analyzed millions of social media posts each month, classifying discussions and calculating scores to track the trends. The approach not only uncovered the emerging trends but also shows diminishing trends. Our methodology is able to predict the emergence and growth of trends by utilizing social media data. This approach has potential for adaptation in other regions. Ultimately, our findings highlight how ongoing, AI-powered trend analysis can enable more effective, data-informed business and development strategies in an increasingly dynamic environment.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Urban Mobility Through Complex Network Analysis and Big Data from Smart Cards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the network characteristics of high-frequency (HF) and low-frequency (LF) travelers in urban public transport systems by analyzing 20 million smart card records from Beijing's transit network. A novel methodology integrates advanced data preprocessing, clustering techniques, and complex network analysis to differentiate HF and LF passenger behaviors and their impacts on network structure, robustness, and efficiency. The primary challenge is accurately segmenting and modeling the behaviors of diverse passenger groups within a large-scale, noisy dataset while maintaining computational efficiency and scalability. HF networks, representing the top 25% of travelers by usage frequency, exhibit high connectivity with an average clustering coefficient of 0.72 and greater node degree centrality. However, they have lower robustness, with efficiency declining by 35% under targeted disruptions and longer average path lengths of 6.2 during peak hours. In contrast, LF networks, which include 75% of travelers, are more dispersed yet resilient, with efficiency declining by only 10% under similar disruptions and stronger intracommunity connectivity. Temporal analysis reveals that HF passengers significantly contribute to peak-hour congestion, with 57.4% of HF trips occurring between 6:00 and 10:00 AM, while LF passengers show a broader temporal distribution, helping to mitigate congestion hotspots. Understanding these travel patterns is crucial for optimizing public transit systems. The findings suggest targeted strategies such as enhancing robustness in HF networks by diversifying key routes and improving accessibility in LF-dominated areas. This research provides a scalable framework for analyzing smart card data and offers actionable insights for optimizing transit networks, improving congestion management, and advancing sustainable urban mobility planning.</description>

      <title>Beyond Interaction Patterns: Assessing Claims of Coordinated Inter-State Information Operations on Twitter/X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms have become key tools for coordinated influence operations, enabling state actors to manipulate public opinion through strategic, collective actions. While previous research has suggested collaboration between states, such research failed to leverage state-of-the-art coordination indicators or control datasets. In this study, we investigate inter-state coordination by analyzing multiple online behavioral traces and using sophisticated coordination detection models. By incorporating a control dataset to differentiate organic user activity from coordinated efforts, our findings reveal no evidence of inter-state coordination. These results challenge earlier claims and underscore the importance of robust methodologies and control datasets in accurately detecting online coordination.</description>

      <title>Conflicts of Interest in Published NLP Research 2000-2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural Language Processing research is increasingly reliant on large scale data and computational power. Many achievements in the past decade resulted from collaborations with the tech industry. But an increasing entanglement of academic research and industry interests leads to conflicts of interest. We assessed published NLP research from 2000-2024 and labeled author affiliations as academic or industry-affiliated to measure conflicts of interest. Overall 27.65% of the papers contained at least one industry-affiliated author. That figure increased substantially with more than 1 in 3 papers having a conflict of interest in 2024. We identify top-tier venues (ACL, EMNLP) as main drivers for that effect. The paper closes with a discussion and a simple, concrete suggestion for the future.</description>

      <title>Separated Contrastive Learning for Matching in Cross-domain Recommendation with Curriculum Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) is a task that aims to improve the recommendation performance in a target domain by leveraging the information from source domains. Contrastive learning methods have been widely adopted among intra-domain (intra-CL) and inter-domain (inter-CL) users/items for their representation learning and knowledge transfer during the matching stage of CDR. However, we observe that directly employing contrastive learning on mixed-up intra-CL and inter-CL tasks ignores the difficulty of learning from inter-domain over learning from intra-domain, and thus could cause severe training instability. Therefore, this instability deteriorates the representation learning process and hurts the quality of generated embeddings. To this end, we propose a novel framework named SCCDR built up on a separated intra-CL and inter-CL paradigm and a stop-gradient operation to handle the drawback. Specifically, SCCDR comprises two specialized curriculum stages: intra-inter separation and inter-domain curriculum scheduling. The former stage explicitly uses two distinct contrastive views for the intra-CL task in the source and target domains, respectively. Meanwhile, the latter stage deliberately tackles the inter-CL tasks with a curriculum scheduling strategy that derives effective curricula by accounting for the difficulty of negative samples anchored by overlapping users. Empirical experiments on various open-source datasets and an offline proprietary industrial dataset extracted from a real-world recommender system, and an online A/B test verify that SCCDR achieves state-of-the-art performance over multiple baselines.</description>

      <title>A Split-Window Transformer for Multi-Model Sequence Spammer Detection using Multi-Model Variational Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new Transformer, called MS$^2$Dformer, that can be used as a generalized backbone for multi-modal sequence spammer detection. Spammer detection is a complex multi-modal task, thus the challenges of applying Transformer are two-fold. Firstly, complex multi-modal noisy information about users can interfere with feature mining. Secondly, the long sequence of users' historical behaviors also puts a huge GPU memory pressure on the attention computation. To solve these problems, we first design a user behavior Tokenization algorithm based on the multi-modal variational autoencoder (MVAE). Subsequently, a hierarchical split-window multi-head attention (SW/W-MHA) mechanism is proposed. The split-window strategy transforms the ultra-long sequences hierarchically into a combination of intra-window short-term and inter-window overall attention. Pre-trained on the public datasets, MS$^2$Dformer's performance far exceeds the previous state of the art. The experiments demonstrate MS$^2$Dformer's ability to act as a backbone.</description>

      <title>ShareDP: Finding k Disjoint Paths for Multiple Vertex Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding k disjoint paths (kDP) is a fundamental problem in graph analysis. For vertices s and t, paths from s to t are said to be disjoint if any two of them share no common vertex except s and t. In practice, disjoint paths are widely applied in network routing and transportation. In these scenarios, multiple kDP queries are often issued simultaneously, necessitating efficient batch processing. This motivates the study of batch kDP query processing (batch-kDP). A straightforward approach to batch-kDP extends batch simple-path enumeration with disjointness checks. But this suffers from factorial computational complexity. An alternative approach leverages single-query algorithms that avoid this by replacing the graph with a converted version. However, handling each query independently misses opportunities for shared computation. To overcome these limitations, we propose ShareDP, an algorithm for batch-kDP that shares the computation and storage across kDPs. ShareDP merges converted graphs into a shared structure, then shares the traversals and operations from different queries within this structure. Extensive experiments on 12 real-world datasets confirm the superiority of ShareDP over comparative approaches.</description>

      <title>Spatial Disease Propagation With Hubs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical contact or proximity is often a necessary condition for the spread of infectious diseases. Common destinations, typically referred to as hubs or points of interest, are arguably the most effective spots for the type of disease spread via airborne transmission. In this work, we model the locations of individuals (agents) and common destinations (hubs) by random spatial point processes in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and focus on disease propagation through agents visiting common hubs. The probability of an agent visiting a hub depends on their distance through a connection function $f$. The system is represented by a random bipartite geometric (RBG) graph. We study the degrees and percolation of the RBG graph for general connection functions. We show that the critical density of hubs for percolation is dictated by the support of the connection function $f$, which reveals the critical role of long-distance travel (or its restrictions) in disease spreading.</description>

Abstract: Rumours in online social media pose significant risks to modern society, motivating the need for better understanding of how they develop. We focus specifically on the interface between emotion and rumours in threaded discourses, building on the surprisingly sparse literature on the topic which has largely focused on emotions within the original rumour posts themselves, and largely overlooked the comparative differences between rumours and non-rumours. In this work, we provide a comprehensive analytical emotion framework, contrasting rumour and non-rumour cases using existing NLP datasets to further understand the emotion dynamics within rumours. Our framework reveals several findings: rumours exhibit more negative sentiment and emotions, including anger, fear and pessimism, while non-rumours evoke more positive emotions; emotions are contagious in online interactions, with rumours facilitate negative emotions and non-rumours foster positive emotions; and based on causal analysis, surprise acts as a bridge between rumours and other emotions, pessimism is driven by sadness and fear, optimism by joy and love.</description>

      <title>To Share or Not to Share: Investigating Weight Sharing in Variational Graph Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the understudied practice of weight sharing (WS) in variational graph autoencoders (VGAE). WS presents both benefits and drawbacks for VGAE model design and node embedding learning, leaving its overall relevance unclear and the question of whether it should be adopted unresolved. We rigorously analyze its implications and, through extensive experiments on a wide range of graphs and VGAE variants, demonstrate that the benefits of WS consistently outweigh its drawbacks. Based on our findings, we recommend WS as an effective approach to optimize, regularize, and simplify VGAE models without significant performance loss.</description>

      <title>The Robustness of Structural Features in Species Interaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Species interaction networks are a powerful tool for describing ecological communities; they typically contain nodes representing species, and edges representing interactions between those species. For the purposes of drawing abstract inferences about groups of similar networks, ecologists often use graph topology metrics to summarize structural features. However, gathering the data that underlies these networks is challenging, which can lead to some interactions being missed. Thus, it is important to understand how much different structural metrics are affected by missing data. To address this question, we analyzed a database of 148 real-world bipartite networks representing four different types of species interactions (pollination, host-parasite, plant-ant, and seed-dispersal). For each network, we measured six different topological properties: number of connected components, variance in node betweenness, variance in node PageRank, largest Eigenvalue, the number of non-zero Eigenvalues, and community detection as determined by four different algorithms. We then tested how these properties change as additional edges -- representing data that may have been missed -- are added to the networks. We found substantial variation in how robust different properties were to the missing data. For example, the Clauset-Newman-Moore and Louvain community detection algorithms showed much more gradual change as edges were added than the label propagation and Girvan-Newman algorithms did, suggesting that the former are more robust. Robustness also varied for some metrics based on interaction type. These results provide a foundation for selecting network properties to use when analyzing messy ecological network data.</description>

      <title>City riots fed by transnational and trans-topic web-of-influence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sudden emergence of large-scale riots in otherwise unconnected cities across the UK in summer 2024 came as a shock for both government officials and citizens. Irrespective of these riots' specific trigger, a key question is how the capacity for such widespread city rioting might be foreseen through some precursor behavior that flags an emerging appetite for such rioting at scale. Here we show evidence that points toward particular online behavior which developed at scale well ahead of the riots, across the multi-platform landscape of hate/extremist communities. Our analysis of detailed multi-platform data reveals a web-of-influence that existed well before the riots, involving online hate and extremism communities locally, nationally, and globally. This web-of-influence fed would-be rioters in each city mainly through video platforms. This web-of-influence has a persistent resilience -- and hence still represents a significant local, national, and international threat in the future -- because of its feedback across regional-national-international scales and across topics such as immigration; and its use of multiple lesser-known platforms that put it beyond any single government or platform's reach. Going forward, our findings mean that if city administrators coordinate with each other across local-national-international divides, they can map this threat as we have done here and initiate deliberation programs that might then soften such pre-existing extremes at scale, perhaps using automated AI-based technology.</description>

      <title>An Axiom System for Feedback Centralities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.03146v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the axiomatic approach to centrality measures has attracted attention in the literature. However, most papers propose a collection of axioms dedicated to one or two considered centrality measures. In result, it is hard to capture the differences and similarities between various measures. In this paper, we propose an axiom system for four classic feedback centralities: Eigenvector centrality, Katz centrality, Seeley index, and PageRank. We prove that each of these four centrality measures can be uniquely characterized with a subset of our axioms. Our system is the first one in the literature that considers all four feedback centralities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11423v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proactive content moderation requires platforms to rapidly and continuously evaluate the credibility of websites. Leveraging the direct and indirect paths users follow to unreliable websites, we develop a website credibility classification and discovery system that integrates both webgraph and large-scale social media contexts. We additionally introduce the concept of dredge words, terms or phrases for which unreliable domains rank highly on search engines, and provide the first exploration of their usage on social media. Our graph neural networks that combine webgraph and social media contexts generate to state-of-the-art results in website credibility classification and significantly improves the top-k identification of unreliable domains. Additionally, we release a novel dataset of dredge words, highlighting their strong connections to both social media and online commerce platforms.</description>

      <title>FastEnsemble: scalable ensemble clustering on large networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many community detection algorithms are inherently stochastic, leading to variations in their output depending on input parameters and random seeds. This variability makes the results of a single run of these algorithms less reliable. Moreover, different clustering algorithms, optimization criteria (e.g., modularity, the Constant Potts model), and resolution values can result in substantially different partitions on the same network. Consensus clustering methods, such as ECG and FastConsensus, have been proposed to reduce the instability of non-deterministic algorithms and improve their accuracy by combining a set of partitions resulting from multiple runs of a clustering algorithm. In this work, we introduce FastEnsemble, a new consensus clustering method. Our results on a wide range of synthetic networks show that FastEnsemble produces more accurate clusterings than two other consensus clustering methods, ECG and FastConsensus, for many model conditions. Furthermore, FastEnsemble is fast enough to be used on networks with more than 3 million nodes, and so improves on the speed and scalability of FastConsensus. Finally, we showcase the utility of consensus clustering methods in mitigating the effect of resolution limit and clustering networks that are only partially covered by communities.</description>

      <title>Market Reaction to News Flows in Supply Chain Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06255v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines how positive and negative news about firms affects their stock prices and, moreover, how it affects stock prices of the firms' suppliers and clients, using a large sample of publicly listed firms around the world and another of Japanese listed firms. The level of positiveness and negativeness of each news article is determined by FinBERT, a natural language processing model fine-tuned specifically for financial information. Supply chains of firms across the world are identified mostly by financial statements, while those of Japanese firms are taken from large-scale firm-level surveys. We find that positive news increases the change rate of stock prices of firms mentioned in the news before its disclosure, most likely because of diffusion of information through unofficial information channels. Positive news also raises stock prices of the firms' suppliers and clients before and after its disclosure, confirming propagation of market values through supply chains. In addition, we generally find a larger post-news effect on stock prices of the mentioned firms and their suppliers and clients than the pre-news effect. The positive difference between the post- and pre-news effects can be considered as the net effect of the disclosure of positive news, controlling for information diffusion through private channels. However, the post-news effect on suppliers and clients in Japan is smaller than the pre-news effect, which is the opposite result to non-domestic firms from around the world.</description>

Abstract: TikTok has gradually become one of the most pervasive social media platforms in our daily lives. While much can be said about the merits of platforms such as TikTok, there is a different kind of attention paid towards the political affect of social media today compared to its impact on other aspects of modern networked reality. I explored how users on TikTok discussed the crisis in Palestine that worsened in 2023. Using network analysis, I situate keywords representing the conflict and categorize them thematically based on a coding schema derived from politically and ideologically differentiable stances. I conclude that activism and propaganda are contending amongst themselves in the thriving space afforded by TikTok today.</description>

      <title>Exact Phase Transitions for Stochastic Block Models and Reconstruction on Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we continue to rigorously establish the predictions in ground breaking work in statistical physics by Decelle, Krzakala, Moore, Zdeborov\'a (2011) regarding the block model, in particular in the case of $q=3$ and $q=4$ communities.
  We prove that for $q=3$ and $q=4$ there is no computational-statistical gap if the average degree is above some constant by showing it is information theoretically impossible to detect below the Kesten-Stigum bound. The proof is based on showing that for the broadcast process on Galton-Watson trees, reconstruction is impossible for $q=3$ and $q=4$ if the average degree is sufficiently large. This improves on the result of Sly (2009), who proved similar results for regular trees for $q=3$. Our analysis of the critical case $q=4$ provides a detailed picture showing that the tightness of the Kesten-Stigum bound in the antiferromagnetic case depends on the average degree of the tree. We also prove that for $q\geq 5$, the Kestin-Stigum bound is not sharp.
  Our results prove conjectures of Decelle, Krzakala, Moore, Zdeborov\'a (2011), Moore (2017), Abbe and Sandon (2018) and Ricci-Tersenghi, Semerjian, and Zdeborov\'a (2019). Our proofs are based on a new general coupling of the tree and graph processes and on a refined analysis of the broadcast process on the tree.</description>

      <title>Improving Expressive Power of Spectral Graph Neural Networks with Eigenvalue Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15603v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, spectral graph neural networks, characterized by polynomial filters, have garnered increasing attention and have achieved remarkable performance in tasks such as node classification. These models typically assume that eigenvalues for the normalized Laplacian matrix are distinct from each other, thus expecting a polynomial filter to have a high fitting ability. However, this paper empirically observes that normalized Laplacian matrices frequently possess repeated eigenvalues. Moreover, we theoretically establish that the number of distinguishable eigenvalues plays a pivotal role in determining the expressive power of spectral graph neural networks. In light of this observation, we propose an eigenvalue correction strategy that can free polynomial filters from the constraints of repeated eigenvalue inputs. Concretely, the proposed eigenvalue correction strategy enhances the uniform distribution of eigenvalues, thus mitigating repeated eigenvalues, and improving the fitting capacity and expressive power of polynomial filters. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. The code is available at: https://github.com/Lukangkang123/EC-GNN</description>

      <title>Weak recovery, hypothesis testing, and mutual information in stochastic block models and planted factor graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stochastic block model is a canonical model of communities in random graphs. It was introduced in the social sciences and statistics as a model of communities, and in theoretical computer science as an average case model for graph partitioning problems under the name of the ``planted partition model.'' Given a sparse stochastic block model, the two standard inference tasks are: (i) Weak recovery: can we estimate the communities with non trivial overlap with the true communities? (ii) Detection/Hypothesis testing: can we distinguish if the sample was drawn from the block model or from a random graph with no community structure with probability tending to $1$ as the graph size tends to infinity?
  In this work, we show that for sparse stochastic block models, the two inference tasks are equivalent except at a critical point. That is, weak recovery is information theoretically possible if and only if detection is possible. We thus find a strong connection between these two notions of inference for the model. We further prove that when detection is impossible, an explicit hypothesis test based on low degree polynomials in the adjacency matrix of the observed graph achieves the optimal statistical power. This low degree test is efficient as opposed to the likelihood ratio test, which is not known to be efficient. Moreover, we prove that the asymptotic mutual information between the observed network and the community structure exhibits a phase transition at the weak recovery threshold.
  Our results are proven in much broader settings including the hypergraph stochastic block models and general planted factor graphs. In these settings we prove that the impossibility of weak recovery implies contiguity and provide a condition which guarantees the equivalence of weak recovery and detection.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Heterogeneous Graph Representation Learning via Large Language Models: A Generalized Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08038v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph representation learning methods are highly effective in handling complex non-Euclidean data by capturing intricate relationships and features within graph structures. However, traditional methods face challenges when dealing with heterogeneous graphs that contain various types of nodes and edges due to the diverse sources and complex nature of the data. Existing Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have shown promising results but require prior knowledge of node and edge types and unified node feature formats, which limits their applicability. Recent advancements in graph representation learning using Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new solutions by integrating LLMs' data processing capabilities, enabling the alignment of various graph representations. Nevertheless, these methods often overlook heterogeneous graph data and require extensive preprocessing. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method that leverages the strengths of both LLM and GNN, allowing for the processing of graph data with any format and type of nodes and edges without the need for type information or special preprocessing. Our method employs LLM to automatically summarize and classify different data formats and types, aligns node features, and uses a specialized GNN for targeted learning, thus obtaining effective graph representations for downstream tasks. Theoretical analysis and experimental validation have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Are We in the AI-Generated Text World Already? Quantifying and Monitoring AIGT on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms are experiencing a growing presence of AI-Generated Texts (AIGTs). However, the misuse of AIGTs could have profound implications for public opinion, such as spreading misinformation and manipulating narratives. Despite its importance, it remains unclear how prevalent AIGTs are on social media. To address this gap, this paper aims to quantify and monitor the AIGTs on online social media platforms. We first collect a dataset (SM-D) with around 2.4M posts from 3 major social media platforms: Medium, Quora, and Reddit. Then, we construct a diverse dataset (AIGTBench) to train and evaluate AIGT detectors. AIGTBench combines popular open-source datasets and our AIGT datasets generated from social media texts by 12 LLMs, serving as a benchmark for evaluating mainstream detectors. With this setup, we identify the best-performing detector (OSM-Det). We then apply OSM-Det to SM-D to track AIGTs across social media platforms from January 2022 to October 2024, using the AI Attribution Rate (AAR) as the metric. Specifically, Medium and Quora exhibit marked increases in AAR, rising from 1.77% to 37.03% and 2.06% to 38.95%, respectively. In contrast, Reddit shows slower growth, with AAR increasing from 1.31% to 2.45% over the same period. Our further analysis indicates that AIGTs on social media differ from human-written texts across several dimensions, including linguistic patterns, topic distributions, engagement levels, and the follower distribution of authors. We envision our analysis and findings on AIGTs in social media can shed light on future research in this domain.</description>

Abstract: This study employs machine learning, historical analysis, and natural language processing (NLP) to examine recurring lethal stampedes at Indias mass religious gatherings, focusing on the 2025 Mahakumbh tragedy in Prayagraj (48+ deaths) and its 1954 predecessor (700+ casualties). Through computational modeling of crowd dynamics and administrative records, it investigates how systemic vulnerabilities contribute to these disasters. Temporal trend analysis identifies persistent choke points, with narrow riverbank access routes linked to 92% of past stampede sites and lethal crowd densities recurring during spiritually significant moments like Mauni Amavasya. NLP analysis of seven decades of inquiry reports reveals cyclical administrative failures, where VIP route prioritization diverted safety resources in both 1954 and 2025, exacerbating fatalities. Statistical modeling demonstrates how ritual urgency overrides risk perception, leading to panic propagation patterns that mirror historical incidents. Findings support the Institutional Amnesia Theory, highlighting how disaster responses remain reactionary rather than preventive. By correlating archival patterns with computational crowd behavior analysis, this study frames stampedes as a collision of infrastructure limitations, socio spiritual urgency, and governance inertia, challenging disaster discourse to address how spiritual economies normalize preventable mortality.</description>
