      <title>DynBenchmark: Customizable Ground Truths to Benchmark Community Detection and Tracking in Temporal Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph models help understand network dynamics and evolution. Creating graphs with controlled topology and embedded partitions is a common strategy for evaluating community detection algorithms. However, existing benchmarks often overlook the need to track the evolution of communities in real-world networks. To address this, a new community-centered model is proposed to generate customizable evolving community structures where communities can grow, shrink, merge, split, appear or disappear. This benchmark also generates the underlying temporal network, where nodes can appear, disappear, or move between communities. The benchmark has been used to test three methods, measuring their performance in tracking nodes' cluster membership and detecting community evolution. Python libraries, drawing utilities, and validation metrics are provided to compare ground truth with algorithm results for detecting dynamic communities.</description>

      <title>Unpacking Discourses on Childbirth and Parenthood in Popular Social Media Platforms Across China, Japan, and South Korea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media use has been shown to be associated with low fertility desires. However, we know little about the discourses surrounding childbirth and parenthood that people consume online. We analyze 219,127 comments on 668 short videos related to reproduction and parenthood from Douyin and Tiktok in China, South Korea, and Japan, a region famous for its extremely low fertility level, to examine the topics and sentiment expressed online. BERTopic model is used to assist thematic analysis, and a large language model QWen is applied to label sentiment. We find that comments focus on childrearing costs in all countries, utility of children, particularly in Japan and South Korea, and individualism, primarily in China. Comments from Douyin exhibit the strongest anti-natalist sentiments, while the Japanese and Korean comments are more neutral. Short video characteristics, such as their stances or account type, significantly influence the responses, alongside regional socioeconomic indicators, including GDP, urbanization, and population sex ratio. This work provides one of the first comprehensive analyses of online discourses on family formation via popular algorithm-fed video sharing platforms in regions experiencing low fertility rates, making a valuable contribution to our understanding of the spread of family values online.</description>

      <title>Visualization of Interpersonal Communication using Indoor Positioning Technology with UWB Tags</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In conjunction with a social gathering held on a university campus, the movement of attendees were tracked within the venue for approximately two hours using a UWB indoor positioning system, in order to visualize their interpersonal communication. Network and community analyses were performed on attendee interaction data, and the evolution of communities over time was further investigated through repeated community analysis at different time points. Furthermore, recognizing the influence of distance thresholds on defining contact, we discussed how varying these thresholds affected the resulting network structure and community analysis outcomes. This study confirmed that the temporal evolution of communities identified through community analysis broadly corresponded with the visually observed groupings of participants using the UWB indoor positioning system.</description>

      <title>Machines in the Crowd? Measuring the Footprint of Machine-Generated Text on Reddit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence is reshaping online communication by enabling large-scale production of Machine-Generated Text (MGT) at low cost. While its presence is rapidly growing across the Web, little is known about how MGT integrates into social media environments. In this paper, we present the first large-scale characterization of MGT on Reddit. Using a state-of-the-art statistical method for detection of MGT, we analyze over two years of activity (2022-2024) across 51 subreddits representative of Reddit's main community types such as information seeking, social support, and discussion. We study the concentration of MGT across communities and over time, and compared MGT to human-authored text in terms of social signals it expresses and engagement it receives. Our very conservative estimate of MGT prevalence indicates that synthetic text is marginally present on Reddit, but it can reach peaks of up to 9% in some communities in some months. MGT is unevenly distributed across communities, more prevalent in subreddits focused on technical knowledge and social support, and often concentrated in the activity of a small fraction of users. MGT also conveys distinct social signals of warmth and status giving typical of language of AI assistants. Despite these stylistic differences, MGT achieves engagement levels comparable than human-authored content and in a few cases even higher, suggesting that AI-generated text is becoming an organic component of online social discourse. This work offers the first perspective on the MGT footprint on Reddit, paving the way for new investigations involving platform governance, detection strategies, and community dynamics.</description>

      <title>Deep Generative Model for Human Mobility Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and modeling human mobility is central to challenges in transport planning, sustainable urban design, and public health. Despite decades of effort, simulating individual mobility remains challenging because of its complex, context-dependent, and exploratory nature. Here, we present MobilityGen, a deep generative model that produces realistic mobility trajectories spanning days to weeks at large spatial scales. By linking behavioral attributes with environmental context, MobilityGen reproduces key patterns such as scaling laws for location visits, activity time allocation, and the coupled evolution of travel mode and destination choices. It reflects spatio-temporal variability and generates diverse, plausible, and novel mobility patterns consistent with the built environment. Beyond standard validation, MobilityGen yields insights not attainable with earlier models, including how access to urban space varies across travel modes and how co-presence dynamics shape social exposure and segregation. Our work establishes a new framework for mobility simulation, paving the way for fine-grained, data-driven studies of human behavior and its societal implications.</description>

      <title>Spectral Graph Clustering under Differential Privacy: Balancing Privacy, Accuracy, and Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of spectral graph clustering under edge differential privacy (DP). Specifically, we develop three mechanisms: (i) graph perturbation via randomized edge flipping combined with adjacency matrix shuffling, which enforces edge privacy while preserving key spectral properties of the graph. Importantly, shuffling considerably amplifies the guarantees: whereas flipping edges with a fixed probability alone provides only a constant epsilon edge DP guarantee as the number of nodes grows, the shuffled mechanism achieves (epsilon, delta) edge DP with parameters that tend to zero as the number of nodes increase; (ii) private graph projection with additive Gaussian noise in a lower-dimensional space to reduce dimensionality and computational complexity; and (iii) a noisy power iteration method that distributes Gaussian noise across iterations to ensure edge DP while maintaining convergence. Our analysis provides rigorous privacy guarantees and a precise characterization of the misclassification error rate. Experiments on synthetic and real-world networks validate our theoretical analysis and illustrate the practical privacy-utility trade-offs.</description>

      <title>MeSH Concept Relevance and Knowledge Evolution: A Data-driven Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18792v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), one of the main knowledge organization systems in the biomedical domain, continuously evolves to reflect the latest scientific discoveries in health and life sciences. Previous research has focused on quantifying information in MeSH primarily through its hierarchical structure. In this work, we propose a data-driven approach based on information theory and network analysis to quantify the relevance of MeSH concepts. Our method leverages article annotations and their citation networks to compute four aspects of relevance -- informativeness, usefulness, disruptiveness, and influence -- over time. Using both the citation network and the MeSH hierarchy, we compute these relevance aspects and apply an aggregation algorithm to propagate scores to parent nodes. We evaluated our approach on MeSH terminology changes and showed that it effectively captures the evolution of concepts. The mean relevance of evolving concepts is higher compared to concepts that remained unchanged ($2.09E-03$ vs. $8.46E-04$). Moreover, we validated the framework by analyzing retracted articles and found that concepts used to annotate retracted articles (mean relevance: 0.17) differ substantially from those annotating non-retracted ones (mean relevance: 0.15). Overall, the proposed framework provides an effective method for ranking concept relevance and can support the maintenance of evolving knowledge organization systems.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Clique Discovery via Energy Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discovering quasi-cliques -- subgraphs whose edge density exceeds a given threshold -- is a fundamental task in graph mining with applications to web spam detection, fraud screening, and e-commerce recommendation. However, existing methods for quasi-clique discovery on large-scale web graphs are often sensitive to random seeds or lack of explicit edge-density guarantees, making the task challenging in practice. This paper presents EDQC, an energy diffusion-based method for quasi-clique discovery. EDQC first employs an adaptive energy diffusion process to generate an energy ranking that highlights structurally cohesive regions. Guided by this energy ranking, the algorithm identifies a high-quality subgraph by minimizing conductance, a standard measure from community detection. This subgraph is then refined to meet the specified density threshold. Extensive experiments on 75 real-world graphs show that EDQC finds larger quasi-cliques on most datasets, with consistently lower variance across runs and competitive runtime. To the best of our knowledge, EDQC is the first method to incorporate energy diffusion into quasi-clique discovery.</description>

      <title>Empirically evaluating commonsense intelligence in large language models with large-scale human judgments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Commonsense intelligence in machines is often assessed by static benchmarks that compare a model's output against human-prescribed correct labels. An important, albeit implicit, assumption of these labels is that they accurately capture what any human would think, effectively treating human common sense as homogeneous. However, recent empirical work has shown that humans vary enormously in what they consider commonsensical; thus what appears self-evident to one benchmark designer may not be so to another. Here, we propose a method for evaluating common sense in artificial intelligence (AI), specifically in large language models (LLMs), that incorporates empirically observed heterogeneity among humans by measuring the correspondence between a model's judgment and that of a human population. We first find that, when treated as independent survey respondents, most LLMs remain below the human median in their individual commonsense competence. Second, when used as simulators of a hypothetical population, LLMs correlate with real humans only modestly in the extent to which they agree on the same set of statements. In both cases, smaller, open-weight models are surprisingly more competitive than larger, proprietary frontier models. Our evaluation framework, which ties commonsense intelligence to its cultural basis, contributes to the growing call for adapting AI models to human collectivities that possess different, often incompatible, social stocks of knowledge.</description>

      <title>Behavioral alignment in social networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The orderly behaviors observed in large-scale groups, such as fish schooling and the organized movement of crowds, are both ubiquitous and essential for the survival and stability of these systems. Understanding how such complex collective behaviors emerge from simple local interactions and behavioral adjustments is a significant scientific challenge. Historically, research has predominantly focused on imitation and social learning, where individuals adopt the strategies of more successful peers to refine their behavior. However, in recent years, an alternative learning approach based on self-exploration and introspective learning has garnered increasing attention. In this paradigm, individuals assess their own circumstances and select strategies that best align with their specific conditions. Two examples are coordination and anti-coordination, where individuals align with and diverge from the local majority, respectively. In this study, we analyze networked systems of coordinating and anti-coordinating individuals, exploring the combined effects of system dynamics, network structure, and behavioral patterns. We address several practical questions, including the number of equilibria, their characteristics, the equilibrium time, and the resilience of the system. We find that the number of equilibrium states can be extremely large, even increasing exponentially with minor alterations to the network structure. Moreover, the network structure has a significant impact on the average equilibrium time. Despite the complexity of these findings, we find that variations can be captured by a single, simple network characteristic (the average path length), which we illustrate in both synthetic and empirical networks.</description>
