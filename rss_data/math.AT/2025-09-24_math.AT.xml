      <title>Splittings of truncated motivic Brown--Peterson cooperations algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct spectrum-level splittings of $BPGL \langle 1 \rangle \wedge BPGL \langle 1 \rangle$ at all primes $p$, where $BPGL \langle 1 \rangle$ is the first truncated motivic Brown--Peterson spectrum. These are motivic lifts of Mahowald and Kane's splitting of $BP \langle 1 \rangle \wedge BP \langle 1 \rangle$. These splittings are given in terms of motivic Adams covers and constructed over the base fields $\mC, \, \mR,$ and $\mF_q$, where $\textup{char}(\mathbb{F}_q) \neq p$. As an application, we compute the $E_1$-page of the $BPGL\langle 1 \rangle$-based Adams spectral sequence as a module over $BPGL\langle 1 \rangle$, both in homotopy and in terms of motivic spectra. We also record analogous splittings for $BPGL \langle 0 \rangle \wedge BPGL \langle 0 \rangle$.</description>

      <title>Persistence modules induced by inner functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As well-known, inner functions play an important role in the study of bounded analytic function theory. In recent years, persistence module theory, as a main tool applied to Topological Data Analysis, has received widespread attention. In this paper, we aim to use persistence module theory to study inner functions. We introduce the persistence modules arised from the level sets of inner functions. Some properties of these persistence modules are shown. In particular, we prove that the persistence modules (potentially not of locally finite type) induced by a class of inner functions have interval module decompositions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the interleaving distance of the persistence modules is continuous with respect to the supremum norm for a class of Blaschke products, which could be used to discuss the path-connectedness of Blaschke products. As an example, we provide an explicit formula for the interleaving distance of the persistence modules induced by the Blaschke products with order two.</description>

      <title>Computing the Topological Degree of Maps Between 2-Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe an effective method for computing the topological degree of continuous functions $R:S^2 \to S^2$, where $S^2$ is the Riemann sphere. Our approach generalizes the degree formula for rational functions of complex polynomials, $\frac{f}{g}$, without common zeros. To apply our method, it is necessary to represent the function $R$ as the ratio of two continuous complex-valued functions $f$ and $g$ without common zeros. By utilizing Hopf fibration, this method reduces the problem to computing the winding number of a loop. This enables us to compute the degree of $\frac{f}{g}$ even when $f$ and $g$ are arbitrary continuous complex functions without common zeros, and the fraction has a limit at infinity (which can be finite or infinite). Specifically, if $f$ and $g$ are complex polynomials in $z$ and $\bar{z}$, and the highest-degree homogeneous component of the polynomial with the greater algebraic degree has a finite or infinite limit as $|z|\to\infty$, then the problem reduces to counting the roots of a complex polynomial inside the unit circle, obtained from this component.</description>

      <title>Subspace {L}usternik-{S}chnirelmann category of quasi-projective quaternionic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $Q_n$ be the quasi-projective subspace of the symplectic group $\mathrm{Sp}(n)$. In this short note, we prove that the subspace Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of $Q_n$ in $\mathrm{Sp}(n)$ is 2. For that, we use a quaternionic logarithm, as Singhof did in the complex case for the determination of the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of the unitary group.
  Our result generalizes the known case $n=2$ (by L. Fern\'andez-Su\'arez, A. G\'omez-Tato and D. Tanr\'e) and has to be compared to the equality $\mathrm{cat}\,Q_{3}=3$, established by N. Iwase and T. Miyauchi.</description>

      <title>Generalized Persistent Laplacians and their Spectral Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laplacian operators are classical objects that are fundamental in both pure and applied mathematics and are becoming increasingly prominent in modern computational and data science fields such as applied and computational topology and application areas such as machine learning and network science. In this paper, we introduce a unifying operator-theoretic framework of generalized Laplacians as invariants that encompasses and extends all existing constructions, from discrete combinatorial settings to de Rham complexes of smooth manifolds. Within this framework, we introduce and study a generalized notion of persistent Laplacians. While the classical persistent Laplacian fails to satisfy the desirable properties of monotonicity and stability -- both crucial for robustness and interpretability -- our framework allows us to isolate and analyze these properties systematically. We demonstrate that their component maps, the up- and down-persistent Laplacians, satisfy these properties individually. Moreover, we prove that the spectra of these separate components fully determine the spectra of the full Laplacians, making them not only preferable but sufficient for analysis. We study these questions comprehensively, in both the finite and infinite dimensional settings. Our work expands and strengthens the theoretical foundation of generalized Laplacian-based methods in pure, applied, and computational mathematics.</description>

      <title>Operads of moduli spaces of points in $\mathbb{C}^d$ revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the operad structure on the homology of moduli spaces of pointed rooted trees of $d$-dimensional projective spaces, introduced by Chen, Gibney and Krashen a couple of decades ago. We describe this operad by generators and relations, show that it is homotopy Koszul, exhibit a Givental-type action on representations of that operad, and prove that this operad represents the homotopy quotient of the operad of chains of $S^1$-framed little $2d$-disks by its natural circle action. Our approach also sheds new light on the $d=1$ case, revealing a new combinatorial way to write the original Givental formulas.</description>

      <title>$K(2)$-local splittings of finite Galois extensions of $MU\langle6\rangle$ and $MString$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16280v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a Milnor-Moore argument we show that, $K(2)$-locally at the prime $2$, the spectra $MU\langle 6\rangle$ and $MString$ split as direct sums of Morava $E$-theories after tensoring with a finite Galois extension of the sphere called $E^{hF_{3/2}}$. In the case of $MString$ we are able to refine this splitting in several ways: we show that the projection maps are determined by spin characteristic classes, that the Ando-Hopkins-Rezk orientation admits a unital section after tensoring with $E^{hF_{3/2}}$, and that the splitting can be improved to one of $E^{hH}\otimes MString$ into a direct sum of shifts of $TMF_0(3)$ where $H$ is an open subgroup of the Morava stabilizer group of index $4$.</description>

      <title>Lifting Galois representations via Kummer flags</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08888v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be either i) the absolute Galois group of a local field $F$, or ii) the topological fundamental group of a closed connected orientable surface of genus $g$. In case i), assume that $\mu_{p^2} \subset F$. We give an elementary and unified proof that every representation $\rho_1: \Gamma \to \mathbf{GL}_d(\mathbb{F}_p)$ lifts to a representation $\rho_2: \Gamma \to \mathbf{GL}_d(\mathbb{Z}/p^2)$. [In case i), it is understood these are continuous.] The actual statement is much stronger: for all $r \geq 1$, under "suitable" assumptions, triangular representations $\rho_r: \Gamma \to \mathbf{B}_d(\mathbb{Z}/p^r)$ lift to $\rho_{r+1}: \Gamma \to \mathbf{B}_d(\mathbb{Z}/p^{r+1})$, in the strongest possible step-by-step sense. Here "suitable" is made precise by the concept of $\textit{Kummer flag}$. An essential aspect of this work, is to identify the common properties of groups i) and ii), that suffice to ensure the existence of such lifts.</description>
