      <title>Manifold structures on highly connected Poincar\'e complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper constructs numerous examples of highly connected Poincar\'{e} complexes, each homotopy equivalent to a topological manifold yet not homotopy equivalent to any smooth manifold. Furthermore, we determine the homotopy type of any closed $2k$-connected framed $(4k+2)$-manifold with Kervaire invariant one for $k=7,15,31$.</description>

      <title>Orientable manifolds with nonzero dual Stiefel-Whitney classes of largest possible grading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that, for all n, there exist compact differentiable orientable n-manifolds with dual Stiefel-Whitney class wbar_{n-ahat(n)} nonzero, and this is best possible, but the proof is nonconstructive. Here ahat(n) equals the number of 1's in the binary expansion of n if n equiv 1 mod 4 and exceeds this by 1 otherwise. We find, for all n nonzero mod 4, examples of real Bott manifolds with this property.</description>

      <title>Path representations in multiparameter persistent homology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiparameter persistence module can capture more topological differences across data instances compared to using a single parameter, where the well-studied matching distance investigates the distance along a straight line in the multiparameter space that gives the biggest difference. We propose to generalize the straight line to a monotone path filtration and offer software implementations.</description>

      <title>Multiscale geometrical and topological learning in the analysis of soft matter collective dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the behavior and evolution of a dynamical many-body system by analyzing patterns in their experimentally captured images is a promising method relevant for a variety of living and non-living self-assembled systems. The arrays of moving liquid crystal skyrmions studied here are a representative example of hierarchically organized materials that exhibit complex spatiotemporal dynamics driven by multiscale processes. Joint geometric and topological data analysis (TDA) offers a powerful framework for investigating such systems by capturing the underlying structure of the data at multiple scales. In the TDA approach, we introduce the $\Psi$-function, a robust numerical topological descriptor related to both the spatiotemporal changes in the size and shape of individual topological solitons and the emergence of regions with their different spatial organization. The geometric method based on the analysis of vector fields generated from images of skyrmion ensembles offers insights into the nonlinear physical mechanisms of the system's response to external stimuli and provides a basis for comparison with theoretical predictions. The methodology presented here is very general and can provide a characterization of system behavior both at the level of individual pattern-forming agents and as a whole, allowing one to relate the results of image data analysis to processes occurring in a physical, chemical, or biological system in the real world.</description>

      <title>Notes on the cohomology of partial Hessenberg varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hessenberg varieties are a family of subvarieties of full flag varieties. This family contains well-known varieties such as Springer fibers, Peterson varieties, and permutohedral varieties. It was introduced by De Mari-Procesi-Shayman in 1992 and has been actively studied in this decade. In particular, unexpected relations to hyperplane arrangements and the Stanley-Stembridge conjecture in graph theory have been discovered. Hessenberg varieties can be defined in partial flag varieties. In this paper, we study their cohomology by relating them to the cohomology of Hessenberg varieties in the full flag varieties.</description>

      <title>Topological $\Delta G$ homology of rings with twisted $G$-action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18187v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a unifying framework for studying variants of topological Hochschild homology such as Real topological Hochschild homology. Associated to a crossed simplicial group $\Delta G$, a category that generalizes Connes' cyclic category, we introduce an invariant of rings with twisted $G$-action, which we call topological $\Delta G$-homology. Here a ring with twisted $G$-action is a common generalization of a ring with involution and a ring with $G$-action.
  Our construction provides homotopical analogues of quaternionic homology, symmetric homology, braid homology, and hyperoctahedral homology defined by Fiedorowicz--Loday. In the quaternionic case our construction, called quaternionic topological Hochschild homology, is equipped with a left Pin(2)-action and we compute it for loop spaces with a twisted $C_4$-action. As an important step along the way, we introduce a new family of crossed simplicial groups called the twisted symmetric crossed simplicial groups and we prove that they corresponds to operads for algebras with twisted $G$-action.</description>

      <title>$e$-invariants of quotients of Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simply connected compact Lie group and $\mathscr{L}$ be the left invarinat framing of $G$. Let $\mathcal{L}^\lambda$ be the framing obtained by twisting $\mathscr{L}$ by a faithful representation $\lambda$. Given a torus subgroup $T''$ of $G$ we have a framing $(\mathcal{L}^\lambda)_{T''}$ of the quotient $G/T''$ induced from $\mathcal{L}^\lambda$. In this note we show that under a certain dimensional condition the $e_\mathbb{C}$-invariant of $G/T''$ with this framing provides a generator of the $J$-homomorphism or twice that. Thereby we also give a unified proof of the results for $SU(2n)$, $Spin(4n+1)$ and $Spin(8n-2)$ $(n\ge 1)$ previously proved.</description>

      <title>Categorified Open Topological Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this short note, we classify linear categorified open topological field theories in dimension two by pivotal Grothendieck-Verdier categories, a type of monoidal category equipped with a weak, not necessarily rigid duality. In combination with recently developed string-net techniques, this leads to a new description of the spaces of conformal blocks of Drinfeld centers $Z(\mathcal{C})$ of pivotal finite tensor categories $\mathcal{C}$ in terms of the modular envelope of the cyclic associative operad. If $\mathcal{C}$ is unimodular, we prove that the space of conformal blocks inherits the structure of a module over the algebra of class functions of $\mathcal{C}$ for every free boundary component. As a further application, we prove that the sewing along a boundary circle for the modular functor for $Z(\mathcal{C})$ can be decomposed into a sewing procedure along an interval and the application of the partial trace. Finally, we construct mapping class group representations from Grothendieck-Verdier categories that are not necessarily rigid and make precise how these generalize existing constructions.</description>

      <title>Complex analogues of the Tverberg--Vre\'cica conjecture and central transversal theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Tverberg--Vre\'cica conjecture claims a broad generalization of Tverberg's classical theorem. One of its consequences, the central transversal theorem, extends both the centerpoint theorem and the ham sandwich theorem. In this manuscript, we establish complex analogues of these results, where the corresponding transversals are complex affine spaces. The proofs of the complex Tverberg--Vre\'cica conjecture and its optimal colorful version rely on the non-vanishing of an equivariant Euler class. Furthermore, we obtain new Borsuk--Ulam-type theorems on complex Stiefel manifolds. These theorems yield complex analogues of recent extensions of the ham sandwich theorem for mass assignments by Axelrod-Freed and Sober\'on, and provide a direct proof of the complex central transversal theorem.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Neural Sheaf Diffusion: A Symmetric Simplicial Set Framework for Higher-Order Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05702v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The absence of intrinsic adjacency relations and orientation systems in hypergraphs creates fundamental challenges for constructing sheaf Laplacians of arbitrary degrees. We resolve these limitations through symmetric simplicial sets derived directly from hypergraphs, called symmetric simplicial lifting, which encode all possible oriented subrelations within each hyperedge as ordered tuples. This construction canonically defines adjacency via facet maps while inherently preserving hyperedge provenance. We establish that the normalized degree zero sheaf Laplacian on our symmetric simplicial lifting reduces exactly to the traditional graph normalized sheaf Laplacian when restricted to graphs, validating its mathematical consistency with prior graph-based sheaf theory. Furthermore, the induced structure preserves all structural information from the original hypergraph, ensuring that every multi-way relational detail is faithfully retained. Leveraging this framework, we introduce Hypergraph Neural Sheaf Diffusion (HNSD), the first principled extension of neural sheaf diffusion to hypergraphs. HNSD operates via normalized degree zero sheaf Laplacian over symmetric simplicial lifting, resolving orientation ambiguity and adjacency sparsity inherent to hypergraph learning. Experimental evaluations demonstrate HNSDs competitive performance across established benchmarks.</description>
