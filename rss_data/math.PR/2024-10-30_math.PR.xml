      <title>The Larkin Mass and Replica Symmetry Breaking in the Elastic Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the second of a series of three papers about the Elastic Manifold model. This classical model proposes a rich picture due to the competition between the inherent disorder and the smoothing effect of elasticity. In this paper, we analyze our variational formula for the free energy obtained in our first companion paper [16]. We show that this variational formula may be simplified to one which is solved by a unique saddle point. We show that this saddle point may be solved for in terms of the corresponding critical point equation. Moreover, its terms may be interpreted in terms of natural statistics of the model: namely the overlap distribution and effective radius of the model at a given site. Using this characterization, obtain a complete characterization of the replica symmetry breaking phase. From this we are able to confirm a number of physical predictions about this boundary, namely those involving the Larkin mass [6, 53, 54], an important critical mass for the system. The zero-temperature Larkin mass has recently been shown to be the topological trivialization threshold, following work of Fyodorov and Le Doussal [37, 38], made rigorous by the first author, Bourgade and McKenna [12, 13].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a dynamic model where the state space is the set of contractible cubical sets in the Euclidian space. The permissible state transitions, that is addition and removal of a cube to/from the set, is \emph{locally decidable}. We prove that in the planar special case the state space is connected. We then define a continuous time Markov chain with a \emph{fugacity} (tendency to grow) parameter. We prove that, on the plane, the Markov chain is irreducible (due to state connectivity), and is also ergodic if the fugacity is smaller than a threshold.</description>

      <title>Generalized random processes related to Hadamard operators and Le~Roy measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The definition of generalized random processes in Gel'fand sense allows to extend well-known stochastic models, such as the fractional Brownian motion, and study the related fractional pde's, as well as stochastic differential equations in distributional sense. By analogy with the construction (in the infinite-dimensional white-noise space) of the latter, we introduce two processes defined by means of Hadamard-type fractional operators. When used to replace the time derivative in the governing p.d.e.'s, the Hadamard-type derivatives are usually associated with ultra-slow diffusions. On the other hand, in our construction, they directly determine the memory properties of the so-called Hadamard fractional Brownian motion (H-fBm) and its long-time behaviour. Still, for any finite time horizon, the H-fBm displays a standard diffusing feature. We then extend the definition of the H-fBm from the white noise space to an infinite dimensional grey-noise space built on the Le Roy measure, so that our model represents an alternative to the generalized grey Brownian motion. In this case, we prove that the one-dimensional distribution of the process satisfies a heat equation with non-constant coefficients and fractional Hadamard time-derivative. Finally, once proved the existence of the distributional derivative of the above defined processes and derived an integral formula for it, we construct an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type process and evaluate its distribution.</description>

      <title>A non-de Finetti theorem for countable Euclidian spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical de Finetti Theorem classifies the $\mathrm{Sym}(\mathbb N)$-invariant probability measures on $[0,1]^{\mathbb N}$. More precisely it states that those invariant measures are combinations of measures of the form $\nu^{\mathbb N}$ where $\nu$ is a measure on $[0,1]$. Recently, Jahel--Tsankov generalized this theorem showing that under conditions on $M$, the $\mathrm{Aut}(M)$-invariant measures on $[0,1]^M$ are mixes of measures of the form $\nu^M$ where $\nu$ is a measure on $[0,1]$. In this note, we give an example of a non-de Finetti non-Archimedian group.</description>

      <title>Elephant random walks with graph based shared memory: First and second order asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a generalization of the so-called elephant random walk by introducing multiple elephants moving along the integer line, $\mathbb{Z}$. When taking a new step, each elephant considers not only its own previous steps but also the past steps of other elephants. The dynamics of "who follows whom" are governed by a directed graph, where each vertex represents an elephant, and the edges indicate that an elephant will consider the past steps of its in-neighbour elephants when deciding its next move. In other words, this model involves a collection of reinforced random walks evolving through graph-based interactions. We briefly investigate the first- and second-order asymptotic behaviour of the joint walks and establish connections with other network-based reinforced stochastic processes studied in the literature. We show that the joint walk can be expressed as a stochastic approximation scheme. In certain regimes, we employ tools from stochastic approximation theory to derive the asymptotic properties of the joint walks. Additionally, in a specific regime, we use better techniques to establish a strong invariance principle and a central limit theorem with improved rates compared to existing results in the stochastic approximation literature. These techniques can also be used to strengthen equivalent results in stochastic approximation theory. As a byproduct, we establish a strong invariance principle for the simple elephant random walk with significantly improved rates.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a Borel set $A$ and a stationary Poisson point process $\eta_t$ in $\mathbb R^d$ of intensity $t&gt;0$, the Poisson-Delaunay approximation $ A_{\eta_t}$ of $A$ is the union of all Delaunay cells generated by $\eta_t$ with center in $A$. It is shown that $\lambda_d(A_{\eta_t})$ is an unbiased estimator for $\lambda_d(A)$, variance bounds and a quantitative central limit theorem are given. The asymptotic behaviour of the symmetric difference $\lambda_d(A\Delta A_{\eta_t})$ is derived as $t \to\infty$.</description>

      <title>Comparison of arm exponents in planar FK-percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By the FKG inequality for FK-percolation, the probability of the alternating two-arm event is smaller than the product of the probabilities of having a primal arm and a dual arm, respectively. In this paper, we improve this inequality by a polynomial factor for critical planar FK-percolation in the continuous phase transition regime ($1 \leq q \leq 4$). In particular, we prove that if the alternating two-arm exponent $\alpha_{01}$ and the one-arm exponents $\alpha_0$ and $\alpha_1$ exist, then they satisfy the strict inequality $\alpha_{01} &gt; \alpha_0 + \alpha_1$. The question was formulated by Christophe Garban and Jeffrey E. Steif (2014) in the context of exceptional times and was brought to our attention by Ritvik Ramanan Radhakrishnan and Vincent Tassion, who obtained the same result for planar Bernoulli percolation through different methods.</description>

Abstract: We study a model of interacting particles represented by a system of N stochastic differential equations. We establish that the mollified empirical distribution of the system converges uniformly with respect to both time and spatial variables to the solution of the two dimensional Navier Stokes equation with transport noise.

      <title>Strict inequalities for arm exponents in planar percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a general method to prove quantitative improvements on correlation inequalities and apply it to arm estimates for Bernoulli bond percolation on the square lattice. Our first result is that the two-arm exponent is strictly larger than twice the one-arm exponent and can be seen as a quantitative improvement on the Harris-FKG inequality. This answers a question of Garban and Steif, which was motivated by the study of exceptional times in dynamical percolation. Our second result is that the monochromatic arm exponents are strictly larger than their polychromatic versions, and can be seen as a quantitative improvement on Reimer's main lemma. This second result is not new and was already proved by Beffara and Nolin using a different argument.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of symplectic resonance based schemes for Schr\"odinger's equation in dimension one, building on the work in [1] wherein resonance based numerical schemes were developed in the context of dispersive PDE driven by time dependent, or space-time dependent, coloured noise. We work primarily with a cubic nonlinearity, advancing the approach introduced in [15] for deriving symplectic schemes in the deterministic setting. As an example of such a scheme we derive the resonance based midpoint rule for the Stochastic NLS and analyse its convergence properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the projected normal distribution, with isotropic variance, on the 2-sphere using intrinsic statistics. We show that in this case, the expectation commutes with the projection and that the covariance of the normal variable has a 1-1 correspondence with the intrinsic covariance of the projected normal distribution. This allows to estimate, after model identification, the parameters of the underlying normal distribution that generates the data.</description>

      <title>Multifold Convolutions, Generating Functions and 1d Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider multifold convolutions of a combinatorial sequence $(a_n)_{n=0}^{\infty}$: namely, for each $k \in \mathbb{N}$ the $k$-fold convolution is $\mathcal{M}^{(k)}_n(\boldsymbol{a}) = \sum_{j_1+\dots+j_k=n} a_{j_1} \cdots a_{j_k}$. Let $C_n$ be the Catalan numbers, and let $B_n$ be the central binomial coefficients. Then for random Dyck paths or simple random walk bridges, the multifold convolutions give moments of returns to the origin, using the stars-and-bars problem. There are well-known explicit formulas for the multifold convolutions of $C_n$ and $B_n$. But even for combinatorial sequences $B_n^2$ and $B_n^3$, one may determine asymptotics of multifold convolutions for large $n$. We also discuss large deviations.</description>

      <title>Enhanced binding for a quantum particle coupled to scalar quantized field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a quantum particle coupled to a scalar quantized field, such as the regularized Nelson model. We show that there are situations where the Hamiltonian of the particle alone does not have a bound state, while the particle--field Hamiltonian has a ground state. This complements results for other models such as the Pauli--Fierz model, where such results have been shown. When the uncoupled quantum particle already has a bound state, we show that this bound state persists when coupling the particle to the field, for any coupling strength. This was known previously only for small enough coupling. Our results use the functional integral representation and rely on a recent method using the Gaussian correlation inequality.</description>

      <title>On tail inference in scale-free inhomogeneous random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Both empirical and theoretical investigations of scale-free network models have found that large degrees in a network exert an outsized impact on its structure. However, the tools used to infer the tail behavior of degree distributions in scale-free networks often lack a strong theoretical foundation. In this paper, we introduce a new framework for analyzing the asymptotic distribution of estimators for degree tail indices in scale-free inhomogeneous random graphs. Our framework leverages the relationship between the large weights and large degrees of Norros-Reittu and Chung-Lu random graphs. In particular, we determine a rate for the number of nodes $k(n) \rightarrow \infty$ such that for all $i = 1, \dots, k(n)$, the node with the $i$-th largest weight will have the $i$-th largest degree with high probability. Such alignment of upper-order statistics is then employed to establish the asymptotic normality of three different tail index estimators based on the upper degrees. These results suggest potential applications of the framework to threshold selection and goodness-of-fit testing in scale-free networks, issues that have long challenged the network science community.</description>

      <title>An invariance principle based concentration result for large-scale stochastic pairwise interaction network systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study stochastic pairwise interaction network systems whereby a finite population of agents, identified with the nodes of a graph, update their states in response to both individual mutations and pairwise interactions with their neighbors. The considered class of systems include the main epidemic models -such as the SIS, SIR, and SIRS models-, certain social dynamics models -such as the voter and anti-voter models-, as well as evolutionary dynamics on graphs. Since these stochastic systems fall into the class of finite-state Markov chains, they always admit stationary distributions. We analyze the asymptotic behavior of these stationary distributions in the limit as the population size grows large while the interaction network maintains certain mixing properties. Our approach relies on the use of Lyapunov-type functions to obtain concentration results on these stationary distributions. Notably, our results are not limited to fully mixed population models, as they do apply to a much broader spectrum of interaction network structures, including, e.g., Erd\"oos-R\'enyi random graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a system of diffusion processes interacting through their empirical distribution. Assuming that the empirical average of a given observable can be observed at any time, we derive regularity and quantitative stability results for the optimal solutions in the associated version of the Gibbs conditioning principle. The proofs rely on the analysis of a McKean-Vlasov control problem with distributional constraints. Some new estimates are derived for Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations and the Hessian of the log-density of diffusion processes, which are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Remarks on nonlinear dispersive PDEs with rough dispersion management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the Cauchy problem for a class of dispersive PDEs where a rough time coefficient is present in front of the dispersion. Under minimal assumptions on the occupation measure of this coefficient, we show that for the large class of semilinear dispersive PDEs whose well-posedness theory relies on linear estimates of Strichartz or local smoothing type, one has the same well-posedness theory with or without the modulation. We also show a regularization by noise type of phenomenon for rough modulations, namely, large data global well-posedness in the focusing mass-critical case for the modulated equation. Under rougher assumptions on the modulation, we show that one can also transfer the well-posedness theory based on multilinear Fourier analysis from the original dispersive PDE to the modulated one. In the case of the NLS equation on $\mathbb{R}^d$ and $\mathbb{T}^d$, this covers all the sub-critical and critical regularities, thus completing and extending the various results currently available in the literature. At last, in the case of the periodic Wick-ordered cubic NLS, we show an even stronger form of regularization by noise, namely well-posedness in the critical Fourier-Lebesgue space for rough modulations.</description>

      <title>Regularization by noise for some strongly non-resonant modulated dispersive PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we pursue our investigations on the Cauchy problem for a class of dispersive PDEs where a rough time coefficient is present in front of the dispersion. We show that if the PDE satisfies a strong non-resonance condition (Theorem 1.6), eventually up to a completely resonant term (Theorem 1.9), then the modulated PDE is well-posed at any regularity index provided that the noise term in front of the dispersion is irregular enough. This extends earlier pioneering work of Chouk-Gubinelli and Chouk-Gubinelli-Li-Li-Oh to a more general context. We quantify the irregularity of the noise required to reach a given regularity index in terms of the regularity of its occupation measure in the sense of Catellier-Gubinelli. As examples, we discuss the cases of dispersive perturbations of the Burger's equation, including the dispersion-generalized Korteweg-de Vries and Benjamin-Ono equations, the intermediate long wave equation, the Wick-ordered modified dispersion-generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation, and the fifth-order Korteweg-de Vries equation. We also treat the completely non-resonant nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation and the Wick-ordered fractional cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, all with periodic boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Relative volume of comparable pairs under semigroup majorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Any semigroup $\mathcal{S}$ of stochastic matrices induces a semigroup majorization relation $\prec^{\mathcal{S}}$ on the set $\Delta_{n-1}$ of probability $n$-vectors. Pick $X,Y$ at random in $\Delta_{n-1}$: what is the probability that $X$ and $Y$ are comparable under $\prec^{\mathcal{S}}$? We review recent asymptotic ($n\to\infty$) results and conjectures in the case of \emph{majorization} relation (when $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of bistochastic matrices), discuss natural generalisations, and prove new exact finite-$n$ results in the case of \emph{UT-majorization} relation, i.e.,\ when $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of upper-triangular stochastic matrices.</description>

      <title>Three-halves variation of geodesics in the directed landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.12994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that geodesics in the directed landscape have $3/2$-variation and that weight functions along the geodesics have cubic variation.
  We show that the geodesic and its landscape environment around an interior point has a small-scale limit. This limit is given in terms of the directed landscape with Brownian-Bessel boundary conditions. The environments around different interior points are asymptotically independent.
  We give tail bounds with optimal exponents for geodesic and weight function increments.
  As an application of our results, we show that geodesics are not H\"older-$2/3$ and that weight functions are not H\"older-$1/3$, although these objects are known to be H\"older with all lower exponents.</description>

Abstract: We consider a system of $d$ non-linear stochastic heat equations driven by an $m$-dimensional space-time white noise on $\mathbb{R}_+\times \mathbb{R}$. In this paper we study the asymptotic behavior of spatial averages over large intervals $[-R,R]$. We establish a rate of convergence to a multivariate normal distribution in the Wasserstein distance and a functional central limit theorem.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, some new upper bounds for Kullback-Leibler divergence(KL-divergence) based on $L^1, L^2$ and $L^\infty$ norms of density functions are discussed. Our findings unveil that the convergence in KL-divergence sense sandwiches between the convergence of density functions in terms of $L^1$ and $L^2$ norms. Furthermore, we endeavor to apply our newly derived upper bounds to the analysis of the rate theorem of the entropic conditional central limit theorem.</description>

      <title>The spectrum of a tensor of random and deterministic matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider operator-valued polynomials in Gaussian Unitary Ensemble random matrices and we show that its $L^p$-norm can be upper bounded, up to an asymptotically small error, by the operator norm of the same polynomial evaluated in free semicircular variables as long as $p=o(N^{2/3})$. As a consequence, if the coefficients are $M$-dimensional matrices with $M=\exp(o(N^{2/3}))$, then the operator norm of this polynomial converges towards the one of its free counterpart. In particular this provides another proof of the Peterson-Thom conjecture thanks to the result of Ben Hayes. We also obtain similar results for polynomials in random and deterministic matrices.
  The approach that we take in this paper is based on an asymptotic expansion obtained by the same author in a previous paper combined with a new result of independent interest on the norm of the composition of the multiplication operator and a permutation operator acting on a tensor of $\mathcal{C}^*$-algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.08717v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a family of nonlinear damped wave equations indexed by a parameter $\epsilon &gt;0$ and forced by a space-time white noise on the two dimensional torus, with polynomial and sine nonlinearities. We show that as $\epsilon \to 0$, the solutions to these equations converge to the solution of the corresponding two dimensional stochastic quantization equation. In the sine nonlinearity case, the convergence is proven over arbitrary large times, while in the polynomial case, we prove that this approximation result holds over arbitrary large times when the parameter $\epsilon$ goes to zero even with a lack of suitable global well-posedness theory for the corresponding wave equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10130v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the study of a particular class of biorthogonal measures, encompassing at the same time several random matrix models and partition functions of polymers. This general framework allows us to characterize the partition functions of the Log Gamma polymer and the mixed polymer in terms of explicit biorthogonal measures, as it was previously done for the homogeneous O'Connell-Yor polymer by Imamura and Sasamoto. In addition, we show that the biorthogonal measures associated to these three polymer models (Log Gamma, O'Connell-Yor, and mixed polymer) converge to random matrix eigenvalue distributions in small temperature limits. We also clarify the connection between different Fredholm determinant representations and explain how our results might be useful for asymptotic analysis and large deviation estimates.</description>

      <title>Zeroth-Order Sampling Methods for Non-Log-Concave Distributions: Alleviating Metastability by Denoising Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17886v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of sampling from non-logconcave distribution, based on queries of its unnormalized density. It first describes a framework, Denoising Diffusion Monte Carlo (DDMC), based on the simulation of a denoising diffusion process with its score function approximated by a generic Monte Carlo estimator. DDMC is an oracle-based meta-algorithm, where its oracle is the assumed access to samples that generate a Monte Carlo score estimator. Then we provide an implementation of this oracle, based on rejection sampling, and this turns DDMC into a true algorithm, termed Zeroth-Order Diffusion Monte Carlo (ZOD-MC). We provide convergence analyses by first constructing a general framework, i.e. a performance guarantee for DDMC, without assuming the target distribution to be log-concave or satisfying any isoperimetric inequality. Then we prove that ZOD-MC admits an inverse polynomial dependence on the desired sampling accuracy, albeit still suffering from the curse of dimensionality. Consequently, for low dimensional distributions, ZOD-MC is a very efficient sampler, with performance exceeding latest samplers, including also-denoising-diffusion-based RDMC and RSDMC. Last, we experimentally demonstrate the insensitivity of ZOD-MC to increasingly higher barriers between modes or discontinuity in non-convex potential.</description>

      <title>Construction of Gross-Neveu model using Polchinski flow equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gross-Neveu model is a quantum field theory model of Dirac fermions in two dimensions with a quartic interaction term. Like Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions, the model is scaling critical (i.e. renormalizable but not super-renormalizable) and asymptotically free (i.e. its short-distance behavior is governed by the free theory). We give a new construction of the massive Euclidean Gross-Neveu model in infinite volume. The distinctive feature of the construction is that it does not involve cluster expansion, discretization of phase-space or a tree expansion ansatz and is based solely on the renormalization group flow equation. We express the Schwinger functions of the Gross-Neveu model in terms of the effective potential and construct the effective potential by solving the flow equation using the Banach fixed point theorem. Moreover, we construct a random field in the probability space of the free field such that its moments coincide with the Schwinger functions of the Gross-Neveu model. This is the first construction of a strong coupling between the free and interacting fields for a scaling-critical QFT. Since we use crucially the fact that fermionic fields can be represented as bounded operators our construction does not extend to models including bosons. However, it is applicable to other asymptotically free purely fermionic theories such as the symplectic fermion model.</description>

      <title>Compositional imprecise probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imprecise probability is concerned with uncertainty about which probability distributions to use. It has applications in robust statistics and machine learning.
  We look at programming language models for imprecise probability. Our desiderata are that we would like our model to support all kinds of composition, categorical and monoidal; in other words, guided by dataflow diagrams. Another equivalent perspective is that we would like a model of synthetic probability in the sense of Markov categories.
  Imprecise probability can be modelled in various ways, with the leading monad-based approach using convex sets of probability distributions. This model is not fully compositional because the monad involved is not commutative, meaning it does not have a proper monoidal structure. In this work, we provide a new fully compositional account. The key idea is to name the non-deterministic choices. To manage the renamings and disjointness of names, we use graded monads. We show that the resulting compositional model is maximal and relate it with the earlier monadic approach, proving that we obtain tighter bounds on the uncertainty.</description>
