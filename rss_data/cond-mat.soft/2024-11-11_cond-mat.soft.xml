      <title>Role of Fluid Forces and Depletion Interactions in Directing Assembly of Aqueous Gold Nanorods on Hydrophobic Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between macroscopic fluid flow and nanoscale forces has resulted in the formation of long-range assemblies through evaporation-induced self-assembly. Anisotropic gold nanorods (AuNR) can form disordered, smectic, or vertically ordered long-range structures, but controlling their assembly remains a challenge and requires a deeper understanding of fundamental interaction mechanisms. In this work, we established a correlation between the $in~situ$ drying profiles, measured using an optical tensiometer, and deposit pattern, imaged $ex~situ$ using electron microscopy. Increasing particle concentration induced a transition from coffee-ring to uniform deposition at the microscale, while nanoscale structures shifted from isotropic/smectic to vertically aligned crystalline AuNRs. The interplay of capillary and Marangoni flow influences assembly at both macro and nanoscales, with the deposition process and nanoparticle ordering being highly sensitive to interparticle and nanoparticle-substrate interactions. By systematically studying key parameters, we aim to develop a comprehensive framework for the rational design and fabrication of nanomaterials with precisely controlled structure and properties.</description>

      <title>Bending Elasticity of the reversible Freely Jointed Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The freely jointed chain model with reversible hinges (rFJC) is the simplest theoretical model that captures reversible transitions of the local bending stiffness along the polymer chain backbone, e.g. helix-coil-type of local conformational changes or changes due to the binding/unbinding of ligands). In this work, we analyze the bending fluctuations and the bending response of a grafted rFJC in the Gibbs (fixed-force) ensemble. We obtain a recursion relation for the partition function of the grafted rFJC under bending force, which allows, in principle, exact-numerical calculation of the behavior of a rFJC of arbitrary size. In contrast to stretching, we show that under sufficiently stiff conditions, the differential bending compliance and the mean fraction of closed hinges are non-monotonic functions of the force. We also obtain the persistence length $L_p$ of the rFJC, the moments $\langle R^2 \rangle$ (mean-square end-to-end distance), and $\langle z^2 \rangle$ (mean-square transverse deflection) for the discrete chain and take the continuum limit. The tangent vector auto-correlation decays exponentially, as in the wormlike chain model (WLC). Remarkably, the expression of $\langle R^2 \rangle$ as a function of the contour length $L$ becomes the same as that in the WLC. In the thermodynamic limit, we have calculated the exact bending response analytically. As expected, for $L\gg L_p$, the boundary conditions do not matter, and the bending becomes equivalent to stretching. In contrast, for $L_p\gg L$, we have shown the non-monotonicity of the bending response (the compliance and mean fraction of closed hinges).</description>

      <title>Learning the rules of peptide self-assembly through data mining with large language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peptides are ubiquitous and important biologically derived molecules, that have been found to self-assemble to form a wide array of structures. Extensive research has explored the impacts of both internal chemical composition and external environmental stimuli on the self-assembly behaviour of these systems. However, there is yet to be a systematic study that gathers this rich literature data and collectively examines these experimental factors to provide a global picture of the fundamental rules that govern protein self-assembly behavior. In this work, we curate a peptide assembly database through a combination of manual processing by human experts and literature mining facilitated by a large language model. As a result, we collect more than 1,000 experimental data entries with information about peptide sequence, experimental conditions and corresponding self-assembly phases. Utilizing the collected data, ML models are trained and evaluated, demonstrating excellent accuracy (&gt;80\%) and efficiency in peptide assembly phase classification. Moreover, we fine-tune our GPT model for peptide literature mining with the developed dataset, which exhibits markedly superior performance in extracting information from academic publications relative to the pre-trained model. We find that this workflow can substantially improve efficiency when exploring potential self-assembling peptide candidates, through guiding experimental work, while also deepening our understanding of the mechanisms governing peptide self-assembly. In doing so, novel structures can be accessed for a range of applications including sensing, catalysis and biomaterials.</description>

      <title>Persistence length and plateau modulus of semiflexible entangled polymers in primitive chain network simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between the plateau modulus (G_0) and the persistence length (L_p) of entangled semiflexible polymers is still uncertain. Some previous theoretical models have predicted that G_0 decreases with increasing L_p, while experiments indicated the opposite. In this study, we extend the primitive chain network (PCN) model to incorporate bending rigidity at the scale of the entanglement length, consistently with the coarse graining of the model. Simulations investigate the effects of rigidity (and of molecular weight) on chain conformation and relaxation modulus. Our results reveal a relationship described as G_0~L_p^(2/3), indicating that G_0 increases with increasing L_p, consistently with experiments. It should be considered, however, that implicit in our simulations is the condition that the entanglement length is kept fixed with changing L_p.</description>

      <title>Manifestations of the possible thermodynamic origin of water's anomalies in non-classical vapor nucleation at negative pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the years, various scenarios -- such as the stability-limit conjecture (SLC), two critical point (TCP), critical point-free (CPF), and singularity-free (SF) -- have been proposed to explain the thermodynamic origin of supercooled waters anomalies. However, direct experimental validation is challenging due to the rapid phase transition from metastable water. In this study, we explored whether the phase transition pathways from metastable water provide insight into the thermodynamic origin of these anomalies. Using a classical density functional theory approach with realistic theoretical water models, we examined how different thermodynamic scenarios influence vapor nucleation kinetics at negative pressures. Our findings show significant variations in nucleation kinetics and mechanism during both isobaric and isochoric cooling. In the TCP scenario, the nucleation barrier increases steadily during isobaric cooling, with a slight decrease near the Widom line at lower temperatures (Ts). In contrast, the SF scenario shows a monotonic increase in the nucleation barrier. For the CPF scenario, we observed a non-classical mechanism, such as wetting-mediated nucleation (where the growing vapor nucleus is wetted by the intermediate low-density liquid phase) and the Ostwald step rule at low temperatures. Isochoric cooling pathways also revealed notable differences in T-dependent nucleation barrier trends between the TCP and CPF scenarios. Overall, this study underscores the importance of analyzing phase transition kinetics and mechanism to understand the precise thermodynamic origin of supercooled waters anomalies.</description>

      <title>Phase Coexistence in Nonreciprocal Quorum-Sensing Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motility and nonreciprocity are two primary mechanisms for self-organization in active matter. In a recent study [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 148301 (2023)], we explored their joint influence in a minimal model of two-species quorum-sensing active particles interacting via mutual motility regulation. Our results notably revealed a highly dynamic phase of chaotic chasing bands that is absent when either nonreciprocity or self-propulsion is missing. Here, we examine further the phase behavior of nonreciprocal quorum-sensing active particles, distinguishing between the regimes of weak and strong nonreciprocity. In the weakly nonreciprocal regime, this system exhibits multi-component motility-induced phase separation. We establish an analytical criterion for the associated phase coexistence, enabling a quantitative prediction of the phase diagram. For strong nonreciprocity, where the dynamics is chase-and-run-like, we numerically determine the phase behavior and show that it strongly depends on the scale of observation. In small systems, our numerical simulations reveal a phenomenology consistent with phenomenological models, comprising traveling phase-separated domains and spiral-like defect patterns. However, we show that these structures are generically unstable in large systems, where they are superseded by bulk phase coexistence between domains that are either homogeneous or populated by mesoscopic chasing bands. Crucially, this implies that collective motion totally vanishes at large scales, while the breakdown of our analytical criterion for this phase coexistence with multi-scale structures prevents us from predicting the corresponding phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Smart navigation through a rotating barrier: Deep reinforcement learning with application to size-based separation of active microagents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ deep reinforcement learning methods to investigate shortest-time navigation strategies for smart active Brownian particles (agents) that self-propel through a rotating, localized potential barrier in an otherwise static and viscous fluid background. The particle motion is prescribed to begin from a specified start point and terminate at a specified destination point. The potential barrier is modeled as a repulsive Gaussian potential with a finite range that rotates with given angular velocities around a fixed center within the plane of motion. We use an advantage actor-critic approach to train the agents and demonstrate that, by leveraging this approach, the rotating potential can be utilized for size-based sorting and separation of the agents. In other words, agents of different (hydrodynamic) radii reach the end-point at sufficiently well-separated times, enabling their separation. The efficiency of particle separation in this context is discussed using specific criteria. We also study the effect of rotational Brownian noise on the quality of the proposed size-based sorting mechanism. Additionally, we demonstrate how the use of noise-induced training can enhance this mechanism in a noisy background within the range of parameters explored in our work. Reinforcement learning in the context of active particles thus offers promising avenues to unravel optimal navigation strategies within complex environments, with potential applications that can be utilized in microfluidic settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary focus of this work is the automating of morphology analysis for colloidal structures, achieved through the development of the ISANM information system. The ISANM system integrates various analysis methods and is designed prioritize usability, catering primarily to users rather than developers. This paper outlines the scope of the subject area, reviews selected methods for morphology analysis, and presents the scripts developed for implementing these methods in Python. The system core is implemented in C#, utilizing the .NET Framework and the MS SQL Server, and is developed within the Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 environment on Windows 10 using the client-server architecture. The system has been deployed on a VDS server using the Ubuntu 20.04 distribution. MS SQL Server is used as the database management system. The system can be accessed at https://isanm.space. An ORCID account is required for authorization. Geometric analysis of colloidal structures is significant in applications such as photonic crystals for optoelectronics and microelectronics, functional coatings in materials science, and biosensors for medical and environmental applications.</description>

      <title>Using optical tweezer electrophoresis to investigate clay nanoplatelet adsorption on Latex microspheres in aqueous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adsorption of charged clay nanoplatelets plays an important role in stabilizing emulsions by forming a barrier around the emulsion droplets and preventing coalescence. In this work, the adsorption of charged clay nanoplatelets on a preformed Latex microsphere in an aqueous medium is investigated at high temporal resolution using optical tweezer-based single-colloid electrophoresis. Above a critical clay concentration, charged clay nanoplatelets in an aqueous medium self-assemble gradually to form gel-like networks that become denser with increasing medium salinity. In a previous publication [R. Biswas et. al., Soft Matter, 2023, 19, 24007-2416], some of us had demonstrated that a Latex microsphere, optically trapped in a clay gel medium, is expected to attach to the network strands of the gel. In the present contribution, we show that for different ionic conditions of the suspending medium, the adsorption of clay nanoplatelets increases the effective surface charge on an optically trapped Latex microsphere while also enhancing the drag experienced by the latter. Besides the ubiquitous contribution of non-electrostatic dispersion forces in driving the adsorption process, we demonstrate the presence of an electrostatically-driven adsorption mechanism when the microsphere was trapped in a clay gel. These observations are qualitatively verified via cryogenic field emission scanning electron microscopy and are useful in achieving colloidal stabilisation, for example, during the preparation of clay-armoured Latex particles in Pickering emulsion polymerisation.</description>

      <title>Long-range Correlations in a Data Sequence Extracted Via Polymeric Compaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09693</link>
      <description>arXiv:1904.09693v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A numerical method is proposed to remove the quenched randomness from a data sequence of numbers. A polymer chain of beads is introduced with both a hard core interaction and an appropriate energy associated with the data sequence. The quenched randomness is hypothesized to collapse the chain to a spherical globule. Long-range informational correlations then show up in deviations from the spherical shape. The resulting coefficients within an expansion in terms of spherical harmonics go beyond the usual concept of algorithmic information or Kolmogorov complexity.</description>

      <title>Viscous tweezers: controlling particle orientation with viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Control of particle motion is generally achieved by applying an external field that acts directly on each particle. Here, we propose a global way to manipulate the motion of a particle by dynamically changing the properties of the fluid in which it is immersed. We exemplify this principle by considering a small particle sinking in an anisotropic fluid whose viscosity depends on the shear axis. In the Stokes regime, the motion of an immersed object is fully determined by the viscosity of the fluid through the mobility matrix, which we explicitly compute for a pushpin-shaped particle. Rather than falling upright under the force of gravity, as in an isotropic fluid, the pushpin tilts to the side, sedimenting at an angle determined by the viscosity anisotropy axis. By changing this axis, we demonstrate control over the pushpin orientation as it sinks, even in the presence of noise, using a closed feedback loop. This strategy to control particle motion, that we dub viscous tweezers, could be experimentally realized in systems ranging from polyatomic fluids under external fields to chiral active fluids of spinning particles by suitably changing their direction of global alignment or anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Effective and efficient modeling of the hydrodynamics for bacterial flagella</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06093v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hydrodynamic interactions among bacterial cell bodies, flagella, and surrounding boundaries are essential for understanding bacterial motility in complex environments. In this study, we demonstrate that each slender flagellum can be modeled as a series of spheres, and that the interactions between these spheres can be accurately characterized using a resistance matrix. This approach allows us to effectively and efficiently evaluate the propulsive effects of the flagella. Notably, our investigation into bacterial motility near a colloidal sphere reveals significant discrepancies between results derived from the twin multipole moment and those obtained through resistive force theory. Consequently, neglecting the hydrodynamic interactions among cell bodies, flagella, and colloidal spheres may lead to substantial inaccuracies. Our model simplifies bacteria into a series of spheres, making it well-suited for examining bacterial motility near spherical boundaries, as well as the nonlinear deformation dynamics of elastic flagella.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a mesoscale field theory unifying the modeling of growth, elasticity, and dislocations in quasicrystals. The theory is based on the amplitudes entering their density-wave representation. We introduce a free energy functional for complex amplitudes and assume non-conserved dissipative dynamics to describe their evolution. Elasticity, including phononic and phasonic deformations, along with defect nucleation and motion, emerges self-consistently by prescribing only the symmetry of quasicrystals. Predictions on the formation of semi-coherent interfaces and dislocation kinematics are given.</description>
