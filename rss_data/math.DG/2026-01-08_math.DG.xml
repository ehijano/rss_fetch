      <title>On biharmonic conformal hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first derive biharmonic equation for conformal hypersurfaces in a generic Riemannian manifold generalizing that for biharmonic hypersurfaces in \cite{Ou1} and that for biharmonic conformal surfaces in \cite{Ou3, Ou2, Ou4}. We then show that if a totally umbilical hypersurface in a space form admits a biharmonic conformal immersion into the ambient space, then the conformal factor has to be an isoparametric function. We also prove that no part of a non-minimal totally umbilical hypersurface in a space form of nonpositive curvature admits a biharmonic conformally immersion into that space form whilst, for the positive curvature space form, we show that the totally umbilical hypersurface $S^4(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})\hookrightarrow S^5$ does admit a biharmonic conformal immersion into $S^5$.</description>

      <title>Stratified Pseudobundles and Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric Quantization is a term used to describe a wide collection of techniques dating back to the 1960s in the work of Kirillov, Kostant, and Souriau, which take symplectic manifolds and produce complex vector spaces. The name comes from the natural interpretation of symplectic manifolds as the phase spaces of classical mechanical systems and complex vector spaces as the natural domains of wave functions in quantum mechanics. In this thesis, I extend the classical framework of Geometric Quantization to handle a class of singular spaces called Symplectic Stratified Spaces, which date back to the work of Sjamaar and Lerman in the 1990s. As part of this work, I develop the theory of stratified pseudobundles to serve as singular replacements for important auxiliary information in Geometric Quantization: prequantum line bundles and polarizations. I then use this formalism to provide [Q,R]=0 results for singular quotients of toric manifolds and cotangent bundles. I also provide an example of singular Geometric Quantization that does not arise from singular reduction.</description>

      <title>Entropy Rigidity for Maximal Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma\subset \mathsf{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ be a lattice and $\rho:\Gamma\to \mathsf{Sp}(2n,\mathbb{R})$ be a maximal representation. We show that $\rho$ satisfies a measurable $(1,1,2)-$hypertransversality condition. With this we define a measurable Gromov product and the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure associated to the unstable Jacobian introduced by Pozzetti, Sambarino and Wienhard. As a main application, we prove a strong entropy rigidity result for $\rho$.</description>

      <title>Comparison and Rigidity Theorems for geodesic curvatures in two dimensional Alexandrov spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study geodesic curvature of the boundary of a two dimensional Alexandrov space of curvature bounded below (CBB). We prove several comparison and globalization theorems for the geodesic curvature, generalizing the known results for curves in space of curvature bounded above (CBA) by Alexander and Bishop (Differ. Geom. Appl. 6, No. 1, 67-86 (1996)). We also prove a rigidity theorem for boundary with corners and geodesic curvature lower bound. This generalizes the known rigidity result by Grove and Peterson (Geom. Topol. 26 (4) 1635 - 1668, (2022)) in 2d.</description>

      <title>The Choreography of Geodesics in SOL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a self-contained geometric description of the geodesic flow in the three-dimensional Lie group $\mathrm{Sol}$, one of Thurston's eight model geometries. The geometry of geodesics is governed by a single invariant $k\in[0,1]$, its modulus. Generic geodesics spiral around an axis, with well-defined amplitude $A(k)$, period $T(k)$, and horizontal drift $H(k)$. We characterize minimal geodesic segments and the cut locus, and obtain an asymptotic estimate showing that distances between points at the same altitude grow logarithmically. This work builds on previous work by Grayson and Coiculescu--Schwartz, but develops an alternative geometric and dynamical viewpoint.</description>

      <title>Local Models for Special K\"ahler Metric Singularities Along the Discriminant Locus of the $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ Hitchin Base</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Freed (arXiv:hep-th/9712042) formulated special K\"ahler structures; in particular, the regular locus of the $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ Hitchin base $\mathcal{B}$ carries such a structure, while the associated metric $\omega_{\mathrm{SK}}$ is singular along the discriminant locus $\mathcal{D}$. Baraglia-Huang (arXiv:1707.04975) computed its Taylor expansion near points of $\mathcal{B}\setminus\mathcal{D}$. Hitchin (arXiv:1712.09928) then defined subsystems attached to those components of $\mathcal{D}$ whose spectral curves have only nodal singularities; these components form smooth strata with induced special K\"ahler structures. We show that near such a stratum the canonical special K\"ahler metric has logarithmic asymptotics in transversal directions, whereas its tangential part converges to a metric on the stratum agreeing with the one from Hitchin's subsystems. Along any complex line through the origin of $\mathcal{B}$ and a point of the stratum, the metric restricts to a cone flat metric with cone angle $\pi$ at the origin only. Finally, the special K\"ahler potential extends continuously to these strata, and is $C^1$ on a portion of them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We verify a conjecture proposed by X. Chen and Y. Shi, which arises from their study of the Green function on spheres in Euclidean space. More precisely, let $M\subset \mathbb{R}^3$ be a closed $C^{2}$ embedded surface and suppose that there exists a point $p\in M$ so that its Green function $G$ is of the form $G(p,q)=-\frac{1}{2\pi} \ln d_{\mathbb{R}^3}(p,q)+c, \forall q\neq p$, then $M$ must be a round sphere.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of high-codimensional area-minimizing currents in hyperbolic space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behavior of high-codimensional area-minimizing locally rectifiable currents in hyperbolic space, addressing a problem posed by F.H. Lin and establishing ``boundary regularity at infinity" results for such currents near their asymptotic boundaries under the standard Euclidean metric. Intrinsic obstructions to high-order regularity arise for odd-dimensional minimal surfaces, revealing a constraint dependent on the geometry of the asymptotic boundary. Our work advances the asymptotic theory of high-codimensional minimal surfaces in hyperbolic space.</description>

      <title>Normalized Milnor Fibrations for Real Analytic Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Milnor's fibration theorem and its generalizations play a central role in the study of singularities of complex and real analytic maps. In the complex analytic case, the Milnor fibration on the sphere is always given by the normalized map $f/|f|$. In contrast, for real analytic maps the existence of such a normalized Milnor fibration generally fails, even when a Milnor--Le fibration exists on a tube.
  For locally surjective real analytic maps $f:(R^n,0)-&gt;(R^k,0)$ with isolated critical value, the existence of a Milnor--Le fibration on a tube is guaranteed under a transversality condition. However, the associated fibration on the sphere need not be given by the normalized map $f/||f||$, unless an additional regularity condition (d-regularity) is imposed.
  In this paper we show that this apparent obstruction is not intrinsic. More precisely, we prove that for any such map satisfying the transversality property, there exists a homeomorphism $h:(R^k,0)-&gt;(R^k,0)$ of the target space such that the composition $h^{-1}f$ becomes d-regular. As a consequence, the normalized map $(h^{-1}f)/||h^{-1}f||$ defines a smooth locally trivial fibration on the sphere, which is equivalent to both the Milnor--Le fibration on the tube and the Milnor fibration on the sphere. Our result reveals a closer topological parallel between real and complex analytic singularities than previously recognized, without changing the topological type of the singularity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we establish gradient estimates for positive solutions to the nonlinear elliptic equation $$\Delta_{V}u^{m}+\mu(x)u+p(x)u^{\alpha}=0 , \quad m&gt;1$$on any smooth metric measure space whose $k$-Bakry-\'{E}mery curvature is bounded from below by $-(k-1)K$ with $K \geq 0$. Additionally, we obtain related Liouville theorems and Harnack inequalities. We partially extend conclusions of Wang, when $V=0$, $\mu=0$ the equation becomes $\Delta u^{m}+p(x)u^{\alpha}=0$. And $V=f$, $\mu=c, p=0 $, the equation becomes $\Delta_{f}u^{m}+cu=0 $.</description>

      <title>Obstructions to global visibility of singularities in asymptotically flat spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider an $(N+1)$-dimensional asymptotically flat spacetime and a future-directed, affinely parametrized outgoing null generator $\gamma$ of an achronal boundary $\partial J^+(S_\varepsilon)$, where $\{S_\varepsilon\}$ is a nested family of smooth compact codimension $2$ surfaces approaching a singular boundary set $S$ in the past. In the twist-free case and under the null energy condition, the Raychaudhuri equation on the $m:=N-1$ dimensional screen bundle reads, $$ \theta'=-\frac1m\theta^2-\|\sigma\|^2-\mathrm{Ric}(k,k), $$ where $k$ is the tangent to $\gamma$. This equation linearizes, via the rescaling $u:=A^{1/m}$ with $A := |\det D|$ the Jacobi-map $m$-volume, to the Sturm-type ODE $$ u''+\frac1m f\,u=0,\qquad f:=\|\sigma\|^2+\mathrm{Ric}(k,k)\ge 0. $$ We develop two purely generator-wise criteria forcing a first zero of $u$: (i) an exact Volterra identity combined with concavity leads to a barrier-weighted integral inequality, and (ii) Sturm comparison and a Pr\"ufer-angle estimate yields failure of disconjugacy whenever $\int_c^d \sqrt{f/m}\,d\lambda&gt;\pi$ on a subinterval. We prove that $u(\lambda_\ast)=0$ is equivalent to the existence of a focal (conjugate) point and implies $\theta= m u'/u\to-\infty$ at $\lambda_\ast$. Using the standard structure of achronal boundaries, this yields a geodesic-wise obstruction: if every generator that could reach $\mathscr I^+$ satisfies one of the above conditions in the regular spacetime region, then $J^+(S_\varepsilon)\cap \mathscr I^+=\emptyset$, and hence $S$ is not globally visible. As an application, we illustrate one of these criteria in the Einstein-massless scalar field collapse model of Christodoulou.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.04093v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that quasi-isometries of horospherical products of hyperbolic spaces are geometrically rigid in the sense that they are uniformly close to product maps, this is a generalisation of the result obtained by Eskin, Fisher and Whyte in [7]. Our work covers the case of solvable Lie groups of the form R ___ (N 1 x N 2), where N 1 and N 2 are nilpotent Lie groups, and where the action on R contracts the metric on N 1 while extending it on N 2. We obtain new quasi-isometric invariants and classi cations for these spaces.</description>

Abstract: We study the complexity of horizontality in the twistor space $\hat{E}$ associated with an oriented vector bundle $E$ of rank $4$ with a positive-definite metric over a torus. If the horizontality has finite complexity of degree $d&gt;2$ for an element of a fiber of $\hat{E}$, then the complexity is expressed in terms of a finite subgroup of $SO(3)$ ([3]). In the present paper, we observe that if the horizontality has infinite complexity derived from one of the cases studied in [3], then the complexity is expressed by a dense subset of $S^2$.</description>

      <title>Contact magnetic geodesic and sub-Riemannian flows on $V_{n,2}$ and integrable cases of a heavy rigid body with a gyrostat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the integrability of magnetic geodesic flows of $SO(n)$--invariant Riemannian metrics on the rank two Stefel variety $V_{n,2}$ with respect to the magnetic field $\eta\, d\alpha$, where $\alpha$ is the standard contact form on $V_{n,2}$ and $\eta$ is a real parameter. Also, we prove the integrability of magnetic sub-Riemannian geodesic flows for $SO(n)$-invariant sub-Riemannian structures on $V_{n,2}$. All statements in the limit $\eta=0$ imply the integrability of the problems without the influence of the magnetic field. We also consider integrable pendulum-type natural mechanical systems with the kinetic energy defined by $SO(n)\times SO(2)$--invariant Riemannian metrics. For $n=3$, using the isomorphism $V_{3,2}\cong SO(3)$, the obtained integrable magnetic models reduce to integrable cases of a motion of a heavy rigid body with a gyrostat around a fixed point: Zhukovskiy--Volterra gyrostat, the Lagrange top with a gyrostat, and the Kowalevski top with a gyrostat. As a by-product we obtain the Lax presentations for the Lagrange gyrostat and the Kowalevski gyrostat in the fixed reference frame (dual Lax representations).</description>

      <title>Kinematical Lie algebras and symplectic symmetric spaces I: Lie algebraic aspects</title>

Abstract: We generalize the notion of kinematical Lie algebra introduced in physics for the classification of the various possible relativity algebras an isotropic spacetime can accommodate.
  We first give an elementary proof of the fact that such a generalized kinematical Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ always carries a canonical structure of symplectic involutive Lie algebra (shortly ``siLa''). In other words, if $G$ is a connected Lie group admitting $\mathfrak{g}$ as Lie algebra, there always exists a Lie subgroup $H$ of $G$ constituted by the elements of $G$ that are fixed under an involutive automorphism of $G$ and such that the homogenenous space $M=G/H$ is a symplectic symmetric space. In particular, the manifold $M$ canonically carries a $G$-invariant linear torsionfree connection $\nabla$ whose geodesic symmetries centered at all points extend as global $\nabla$-affine transformations of $M$. The manifold $M$ is also canonically equipped with a symplectic structure $\omega$ which is invariant under every geodesic symmetry, implying in particular that it is parallel w.r.t the linear connection: $\nabla\omega=0$.
  In a second part, we give a complete description of the fine structure of our generalized siLa's. Our discussion yields a complete classification of such sila's.</description>

Abstract: We discover some configuration results for area-minimizing cones. In particular, given any closed minimal submanifold in some Euclidean sphere, every cone over the minimal product of sufficiently many copies of the submanifold turns out to be area-minimizing.</description>

      <title>Lens rigidity in 2D: The reconstruction of a Riemann surface from its geodesic lengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the question of whether a Riemannian manifold-with-boundary (M,g) in dimension two is uniquely determined from knowledge of the distances between points on its boundary. An affirmative answer is called boundary rigidity for (M,g); it is closely related to lens rigidity. The latter question originates in the problem of reconstructing the speed of sound in an unknown medium from measurements of the travel time of sound waves that are sent in and ultimately return to the boundary. We prove essentially optimal results on these rigidity questions:
  Our first result answers proves rigidity locally, near a convex portion of the boundary. Our second result proves rigidity globally, for manifolds with convex boundary, in the absence of trapping (closed geodesics), thus confirming a conjecture of Uhlmann. Our final result proves the optimal reconstruction for convex boundaries even in the presence of trapping, showing rigidity up to outermost trapped geodesics.
  Our results thus extend the classical work of Pestov and Uhlmann on rigidity of simple 2-manifolds, as well as the many prior results on injectivity of the X-ray transform, which address linearized versions of the rigidity problem. \par Our method is to treat the (non-linear) rigidity problem directly, where we simultaneously re-cast the lens data as generalized Riemannian circles, and obtain rigidity for these ``pseudo-circles'', by studying a system of equations that we show these objects must satisfy. The rigidity we obtain ultimately is proven via {novel} estimates that are reminiscent of energy-type estimates for hyperbolic equations.</description>

      <title>Extensions and Applications of Stein-Weiss Operators to the Study of Traceless Symmetric Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: First-order differential operators arising from the representation-theoretic decomposition of the covariant derivative play a central role in Riemannian geometry. In this paper, we study Stein-Weiss $O(n)$-gradients acting on covariant symmetric trace-free tensors of arbitrary rank $p \ge 2$. By analyzing the decomposition of $T^*M \otimes S_0^p(M)$ into its $O(n)$-irreducible components, we explicitly describe the corresponding generalized gradients and compute Weitzenbock formulas for their adjoint compositions. These results extend Bouguignon four-dimensional formulas for $p = 2$ and generalize previous work of other authors to higher-rank symmetric tensors. The formulas obtained provide a unified framework for understanding second-order Stein-Weiss operators and yield tools applicable to deformation complexes, curvature estimates, and stability problems in geometric analysis. The article continues the authors' earlier investigations of Stein-Weiss operators on natural tensor bundles.</description>

      <title>Hot spots on cones and warped product manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study extrema of solutions to the heat equation (i.e. hot spots) on a class of warped product manifolds of the form $([0,L]\times M,dr^2+f(r)^2h)$ where $(M,h)$ is a closed Riemannian manifold. We prove that, under certain conditions on the warping function $f$, the statement of Rauch's hot spots conjecture holds for the corresponding warped product. We then go on to study the long-time behavior of hot spots on infinite cones over closed Riemannian manifolds. In this case, under appropriate hypotheses on the initial condition, there are four possible long-time behaviors depending only on the spectral gap of the fiber $(M,h)$.</description>

      <title>Foliation surgeries and the concordance groups of foliated spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a general procedure extending surgery to manifolds with foliation or Haefliger structure. We find a single obstruction to foliation surgery along an attaching sphere. When unobstructed, the surgery can be chosen to preserve characteristic numbers.
  Studying these obstructions, we obtain two results. First, on every stably trivial manifold of dimension \( n \le 2q+2 \), a transversely framed codimension-\( q \) Haefliger structure can be surgered to a Haefliger structure on the sphere \( S^{n} \), characteristic numbers unchanged.
  As an application, we modify a construction of Thurston's to give explicit Haefliger structures on \( S^{2q+1} \) whose Godbillon-Vey numbers surject to the real line.
  Second, the foliation connected sum gives, for each dimension \( n \) and codimension \( q \), a group structure on concordance classes of transversely oriented Haefliger structures on \( S^{n} \). These groups may be identified with the homotopy groups of the Haefliger classifying spaces \( B\Gamma^{+}_{q} \).</description>
