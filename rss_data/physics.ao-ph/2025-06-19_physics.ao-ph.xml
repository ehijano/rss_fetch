      <title>MODS: Multi-source Observations Conditional Diffusion Model for Meteorological State Downscaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate acquisition of high-resolution surface meteorological conditions is critical for forecasting and simulating meteorological variables. Directly applying spatial interpolation methods to derive meteorological values at specific locations from low-resolution grid fields often yields results that deviate significantly from the actual conditions. Existing downscaling methods primarily rely on the coupling relationship between geostationary satellites and ERA5 variables as a condition. However, using brightness temperature data from geostationary satellites alone fails to comprehensively capture all the changes in meteorological variables in ERA5 maps. To address this limitation, we can use a wider range of satellite data to make more full use of its inversion effects on various meteorological variables, thus producing more realistic results across different meteorological variables. To further improve the accuracy of downscaling meteorological variables at any location, we propose the Multi-source Observation Down-Scaling Model (MODS). It is a conditional diffusion model that fuses data from multiple geostationary satellites GridSat, polar-orbiting satellites (AMSU-A, HIRS, and MHS), and topographic data (GEBCO), as conditions, and is pre-trained on the ERA5 reanalysis dataset. During training, latent features from diverse conditional inputs are extracted separately and fused into ERA5 maps via a multi-source cross-attention module. By exploiting the inversion relationships between reanalysis data and multi-source atmospheric variables, MODS generates atmospheric states that align more closely with real-world conditions. During sampling, MODS enhances downscaling consistency by incorporating low-resolution ERA5 maps and station-level meteorological data as guidance. Experimental results demonstrate that MODS achieves higher fidelity when downscaling ERA5 maps to a 6.25 km resolution.</description>

      <title>How Convective Mass Flux Responds to Environmental Humidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our goal in this study is to characterize the relationship between lower tropospheric environmental humidity and convective mass flux in the tropics. To do so, we have created gridded convective mass flux datasets from five global storm-resolving models (GSRMs). We have three principal findings. First, in humid environments, mass flux increases with height from the surface through the depth of the lower free troposphere, forming a ``deep-inflow". In dry environments, mass flux decreases with height through the lower free troposphere. Second, mid-tropospheric mass flux increases nonlinearly with increasing lower tropospheric humidity, resembling a widely reported pickup in tropical precipitation. Third, increased lower tropospheric humidity is associated with reduced deep convective updraft buoyancy. To interpret these findings, we employ a simple three-equation parcel model with stochastic entrainment. The parcel model suggests that the response of convective mass flux to lower tropospheric humidity is governed by two mechanisms: (1) survival, in which a greater share of entraining parcels ascend rather than detrain with greater humidity; and (2) dilution, in which the average entrainment rate among surviving parcels increases with environmental humidity. Together, these two mechanisms account for the three mass flux responses to humidity.</description>

      <title>Fast automated adjoints for spectral PDE solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general and automated approach for computing model gradients for PDE solvers built on sparse spectral methods, and implement this capability in the widely used open-source Dedalus framework. We apply reverse-mode automatic differentiation to symbolic graph representations of PDEs, efficiently constructing adjoint solvers that retain the speed and memory efficiency of this important class of modern numerical methods. This approach enables users to compute gradients and perform optimization for a wide range of time-dependent and nonlinear systems without writing additional code. The framework supports a broad class of equations, geometries, and boundary conditions, and runs efficiently in parallel using MPI. We demonstrate the flexibility and capabilities of this system using canonical problems from the literature, showing both strong performance and practical utility for a wide variety of inverse problems. By integrating automatic adjoints into a flexible high-level solver, our approach enables researchers to perform gradient-based optimization and sensitivity analyses in spectral simulations with ease and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Impact of Gravity Waves From Tropospheric and Non-tropospheric Sources on the Middle and Upper Atmosphere and Comparison with ICON/MIGHTI Winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamical and thermal roles of internal gravity waves generated in the troposphere and above using the Coupled Middle Atmosphere Thermosphere-2 General Circulation Model. This model incorporates the whole atmosphere nonlinear gravity wave parameterization and its extension to include non-tropospheric sources. We conducted model experiments for northern summer solstice conditions, first including only tropospheric sources, then including sources localized at 50 and 90 km, and uniformly distributed over all heights. The simulated differences in mean temperature and horizontal winds demonstrate that gravity waves produce the greatest dynamical and thermal changes in the latter case compared to the localized sources. While the gravity wave drag is longitudinally uniform in the lower thermosphere, it is more localized in the upper thermosphere in all the simulations. Waves from uniformly distributed sources increase the longitudinal variability of zonal winds in the thermosphere up to $\sim$150 km. Gravity wave effects exhibit different local time variations in the lower thermosphere (100--140 km) than in the upper thermosphere. In the upper thermosphere, gravity wave effects are stronger during the day than at night. In contrast, nighttime gravity wave effects are stronger than the daytime ones in the lower thermosphere. Finally, a comparison with ICON-MIGHTI observations shows that the model reproduces the basic structure of thermospheric winds, performing better with zonal winds than with meridional winds. Adding non-tropospheric wave sources modifies wind structures in wave-breaking regions, but does not improve the global statistical comparison.</description>

      <title>Blended parameterization in an atmospheric model: Improving severestorm ensemble prediction by considering uncertainties in model physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics parameterizations are often needed for numerical weather prediction (NWP) of precipitation forecast. This is mainly because the resolutions of most computational atmospheric models are not fine enough to explicitly resolve sub-grid scale processes associated with precipitation systems. The various options in each physical parameterization scheme introduce model physics uncertainty, leading to variations in simulated precipitation due to differing representations of physical processes. We aim to quantify and reduce uncertainties in severe storm prediction arising from selecting physics parameterization schemes. In this study, we introduced a method called "blended parameterization" in an atmospheric model. This method parameterizes the selection of physical parameterization schemes using weighting parameters. This approach reduces the model selection problem to the optimization of these weighting parameters. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method was used to estimate the posterior probability distribution of the weighting parameters. The large computational cost of MCMC was resolved by a surrogate model that efficiently mimics the relationship between weighting parameters and likelihood. Subsequently, the weighting parameters were sampled from the posterior distribution, followed by conducting an ensemble simulation to predict rainfall in Vietnam. Our optimized "blended parameterized" ensemble prediction system outperformed a conventional physical ensemble prediction system similar to that operationally used in Vietnam.</description>

      <title>GLONET: Mercator's end-to-end neural Global Ocean forecasting system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate ocean forecasting is crucial in different areas ranging from science to decision making. Recent advancements in data-driven models have shown significant promise, particularly in weather forecasting community, but yet no data-driven approaches have matched the accuracy and the scalability of traditional global ocean forecasting systems that rely on physics-driven numerical models and can be very computationally expensive, depending on their spatial resolution or complexity. Here, we introduce GLONET, a global ocean neural network-based forecasting system, developed by Mercator Ocean International. GLONET is trained on the global Mercator Ocean physical reanalysis GLORYS12 to integrate physics-based principles through neural operators and networks, which dynamically capture local-global interactions within a unified, scalable framework, ensuring high small-scale accuracy and efficient dynamics. GLONET's performance is assessed and benchmarked against two other forecasting systems: the global Mercator Ocean analysis and forecasting 1/12 high-resolution physical system GLO12 and a recent neural-based system also trained from GLORYS12. A series of comprehensive validation metrics is proposed, specifically tailored for neural network-based ocean forecasting systems, which extend beyond traditional point-wise error assessments that can introduce bias towards neural networks optimized primarily to minimize such metrics. The preliminary evaluation of GLONET shows promising results, for temperature, sea surface height, salinity and ocean currents. GLONET's experimental daily forecast are accessible through the European Digital Twin Ocean platform EDITO.</description>
