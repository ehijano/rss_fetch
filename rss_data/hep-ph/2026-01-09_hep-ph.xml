      <title>Spectator Composes a Gravitational Canon: Spectator-field-triggered Phase Transition During Inflation and its Anisotropic Gravitational Wave Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a general framework in which a phase transition is triggered during cosmic inflation by the slow-roll dynamics of a spectator field. The topological defects formed at the transition are inflated outside the horizon, reenter it after inflation, and can subsequently generate characteristic gravitational-wave (GW) signals. Quantum fluctuations of the spectator field modulate the timing of the transition, imprinting large-scale anisotropies in the resulting GW background. As an explicit realization, the spectator field may be identified with the Higgs field in a supersymmetric Standard Model. More generally, our framework applies to a wide class of spectator-modulated phenomena, providing a generic mechanism for producing anisotropic GW signals.</description>

      <title>Threshold resummation of rapidity distributions at fixed partonic rapidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a general expression for the resummation of rapidity distributions for processes with a colorless final state, such as Drell-Yan or Higgs production, in the limit in which the center-of-mass energy goes on threshold, but with fixed rapidity of the Higgs or gauge boson in the partonic center-of-mass frame. The result is obtained by suitably generalizing the renormalization-group based approach to threshold resummation previously pursued by us. The ensuing expression is valid to all logarithmic orders but the resummation coefficients must be determined by comparing to fixed order results. We perform this comparison for the Drell-Yan process using the fixed-order next-to-next-to-leading (NNLO) result, thereby determining resummation coefficients up to next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL) accuracy, for the quark-antiquark coefficient function in the quark nonsinglet channel. We provide a translation to direct QCD of a result for this resummation previously obtained using SCET methods, and we show that it agrees with our own.</description>

      <title>Metastable cosmic strings are broken at the start</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that metastable cosmic strings break at early times, either via finite-temperature effects or by attaching to pre-existing monopoles during network percolation. The resulting segments can be initially super-horizon in size and thus persist for a significant amount of time. If the strings do not re-percolate, the network's eventual destruction is typically due to this early-time breaking rather than late-time quantum tunnelling. Survival of strings to epochs probed by NANOGrav requires $m_M^2/\mu\gtrsim 10^3$, where $m_M$ and $\mu$ are the monopole mass and the string tension respectively, over an order of magnitude larger than previous estimates. We also revisit quantum-tunnelling induced breaking. Results from numerical simulations suggest that this occurs mainly at rare high-tension points on the strings, yielding a rate much larger than is usually assumed. We briefly discuss the related scenario of flux tubes in a dark QCD-like hidden sector with dark-quark masses above the confinement scale.</description>

      <title>Unified analysis of screening masses for vector and axial-vector mesons and their diquark partners in the Contact Interaction model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the screening masses of vector and axial-vector mesons and their corresponding diquark partners within a symmetry-preserving vector-vector contact interaction approach. Our analysis includes mesons and diquarks composed of both light and heavy quarks, providing a unified description of their thermal behavior. The longitudinal and transverse modes of the screening masses are analyzed, and the results are systematically compared with other theoretical approaches. At $T = 0$ MeV, our predictions agree with available experimental data, and a comparison with the expected free theory limit at high temperatures is also presented. Notably, the parity partners of the lightest mesons and diquarks converge at high temperatures, signaling chiral symmetry restoration within this framework. These results provide a consistent and detailed picture of meson and diquark properties at finite temperature and lay the groundwork for extending the capabilities of the model to baryon screening masses in the quark-diquark picture.</description>

      <title>$S^\prime_4$ Quark Flavour Model in the Vicinity of the Fixed Point $\tau = i\infty$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study in the bottom-up framework the possibility to generate the quark mass hierarchies without fine-tuning, the quark mixing and CP-violation (CPV) in a flavour model with $S^\prime_4$ modular symmetry having minimal number of parameters. The model is considered in the vicinity of the fixed point $\tau_\text{T}= i\infty$, $\tau_\text{vev} \sim \tau_\text{T}$, $\tau_\text{vev}$ being the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the modulus $\tau$, which allows to explain the hierarchies of the quark masses. The ten quark observables are described by nine real parameters. The CP-symmetry is broken explicitly since, as is well known, reproducing the observed CPV in the quark sector in the case of spontaneous breaking of CP-symmetry by $\tau_\text{vev}$ is highly problematic in the class of minimal modular quark flavour models (explaining the quark mass hierarchies without fine-tuning) of the type we consider. We perform a statistical analysis of the model and show that it is phenomenologically viable and consistent, in particular, with the ``inclusive'' decay data on the $|V_{ub}|$ and $|V_{cb}|$ elements of the CKM matrix and, in the case of a very high scale of supersymmetry breaking, with the current ``average'' experimental values of $|V_{ub}|$ and $|V_{cb}|$.</description>

      <title>Search for Ultralight Axion Dark Matter with a Levitated Ferromagnetic Torsional Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a search for ultralight axion dark matter coupled to electron spins using a levitated ferromagnetic torsional oscillator (FMTO). This platform directly measures axion-induced torques on a macroscopic spin-polarized body, combining large spin density with strong mechanical isolation to probe magnetic fluctuations below 10 Hz while suppressing gradient-field noise. In a first implementation, the experiment yielded 18000 s of analyzable data at room temperature under high vacuum with optical readout and triple-layer magnetic shielding. A likelihood-based statistical framework, incorporating stochastic fluctuations in the axion-field amplitude, was used to evaluate the data. No excess consistent with an axion-induced pseudo-magnetic field was observed near 2e-14 eV. To account for possible shielding-induced signal attenuation, we quantify its effect and report both the uncorrected (g_aee &lt; 1e-7) and attenuation-corrected (g_aee &lt; 6e-5) 90% CL limits on the axion-electron coupling. Looking ahead, improvements guided by both noise-budget analysis and shielding-attenuation considerations, including optimized levitation geometry, cryogenic operation, and superconducting shielding, are expected to boost sensitivity by multiple orders of magnitude.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent claims questioning the existence of strong CP violation, we present a pedagogical review of CP violation in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Using fundamental properties of the QCD partition function, we analyze the dependence of the chiral quark and CP violating gluon condensates on the theta parameter and the quark masses in the chiral limit. We show explicitly how CP violation arises, clarify the role of the axial U(1) anomaly and the ordering of the infinite-volume limit, and discuss the conditions under which CP symmetry may or may not be realized, including in the large-N framework. Our results reaffirm the presence of strong CP violation for physically relevant parameters and thus the theoretical basis of the strong CP problem and axion physics.</description>

      <title>Dark NSI &amp; neutrino oscillations : probing via $\delta_{CP}$ measurements at DUNE and T2HK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of neutrinos interacting with a scalar dark matter field and the resulting implications for neutrino oscillations in the long-baseline sector. As our Universe is predominantly composed of dark matter, neutrinos propagating over astrophysical and terrestrial baselines inevitably traverse a dark matter background. The coherent forward scattering of neutrinos in such a background induces a medium-dependent correction to the mass-squared term in the effective neutrino Hamiltonian having opposing signs for neutrinos and antineutrinos. We study how the elements of this correction matrix, arising from coherent forward scattering of neutrinos with scalar dark matter background referred to as dark non-standard interactions (dark NSI), modify neutrino oscillation probabilities. Furthermore, we also study the effect of the off-diagonal elements and the associated phases on the measurement of leptonic CP violating phase focusing on the upcoming long-baseline superbeam experiments DUNE and T2HK. We show that dark NSI can lead to substantial enhancement or suppression of CP-violation sensitivity, depending on the true values of the dark NSI phases $\phi_{\alpha \beta}$. We further explored how the synergy of DUNE and T2HK can effectively mitigate the degeneracies due to the dark NSI phases, and can restore or even enhance the CP sensitivity as compared to the standard oscillation scenario.</description>

      <title>Braneworld Baryogenesis and QCD-Era Magnetogenesis: A Predictive Link</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that primordial magnetic fields (PMF) play a decisive role in the braneworld baryogenesis scenario of [Phys. Rev. D $\textbf{110}$, 023520 (2024)], where C/CP violation arises from the coupling of visible and hidden matter-antimatter sectors through a pseudo-scalar field. Although this mechanism generates baryon number efficiently only after the quark-hadron transition, by incorporating a realistic stochastic PMF within a semi-analytical framework, we find that matching the observed baryon-antibaryon asymmetry robustly requires PMF strengths of order $10^{10}$ T right after the transition, in agreement with causal QCD-era magnetogenesis. We further reveal that magnetic fluctuations drive the baryon-density spectrum to white noise on large scales, yielding an isocurvature component compatible with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) bounds. This establishes a predictive link between the braneworld baryogenesis model and realistic early-Universe magnetic fields.</description>

Abstract: We present an NLO QCD sum rules analysis of $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$ light four-quark states, investigated several compact tetraquark and four-quark molecule states, we obtain $1^{-+}$ light four-quark states masses,. Crucially, we have not find four-quark states with mass $\sim 1.4\,\text{GeV}$, which is the interpreted to be $\pi_1(1400)$ exotic state in previous leading-order studies. This result do not support the existence of $\pi_1(1400)$ state, agrees with the current experimental observation.</description>

      <title>ALP and $Z^\prime$ boson at the Electron-Ion collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the sensitivity of the upcoming electron-ion (EIC) collider to purely electrophilic new physics in the GeV mass range. Within an effective field theory framework, we consider two different scenarios: an axion-like particle (ALP) and a new heavy neutral vector gauge boson $Z^\prime $, each couples to electrons only. We analyze electron-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}= 141$ GeV with an integrated luminosity of $100~{\rm fb}^{-1}$, focusing primarily on the tri-electron final state. Additionally, loop-induced ALP-photon couplings driven photon final states are also explored. Incorporating realistic detector effects and systematic uncertainties, we obtain projected exclusion limits on the relevant cross-sections and couplings. We find that the results from EIC can significantly extend the sensitivity to electrophilic axion-like particles and $Z^\prime $ bosons in regions of parameter space that remain weakly constrained by existing experiments.</description>

      <title>Effective Range Expansion with the Left-Hand Cut: Higher Order Improvements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A model-independent parameterization of the low-energy scattering amplitude that incorporates the left-hand cut from one-particle exchange, an extension of the conventional effective-range expansion (ERE), was recently proposed and successfully applied to the low-energy $DD^*$ system [Phys. Rev. Lett. 135, 011903 (2025)]. While the original formulation is based on a nonrelativistic approximation and is thus limited to a [1,1] approximant for self-consistency, we extend the framework by explicitly including the higher-order terms up to $\mathcal{O}(k^6)$. We systematically investigate the reliability and robustness of the generalized ERE by incorporating relativistic kinematic effects. In addition, we develop a relativistic version of the ERE that accounts for lhc contributions. These results affirm the generalized ERE as a robust and systematically improvable framework for near-threshold scattering processes, providing both analytical and numerical reliability for applications in two-body scattering problems with a particle exchange.</description>

      <title>Axion superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light bosonic fields may suffer an instability around a rotating compact object. This process, known as superradiance, leads to the exponential amplification of the field around a black hole or neutron star, while the spin of the central object is correspondingly depleted. The discovery of a highly spinning black hole could therefore be used to constrain the existence of light bosons such as axions in a particular range of masses. These constraints apply for very low non-gravitational couplings between the boson and the Standard Model, offering a powerful search strategy for new physics. However, care must be taken to include the more complex effects of the black hole's astrophysical environment. Conversely, stellar superradiance could allow us to probe additional non-gravitational interactions between a new boson at the stellar matter. In this article, I will discuss the current status and future directions of axion superradiance. This is a contribution to the proceedings of the 3rd General Meeting of the COST Action COSMIC WISPers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution, we summarize our results on the complete NLO predictions for the production of off-shell top quark pairs in the $\ell+j$ channel at the LHC. All NLO QCD and electroweak corrections are consistently included across the full set of LO contributions and partonic subprocesses, while retaining finite-width effects of the top quarks and the electroweak gauge bosons. Resonant and non-resonant contributions as well as interference effects are included in the complete calculation. We pay special attention to infrared singularities associated with photons and jets appearing simultaneously in the final state. Fiducial integrated and differential cross-section results are presented for $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13.6$ TeV.</description>

      <title>Non-Thermal Leptogenesis in the BLSM with Inverse Seesaw Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the viability of non-thermal leptogenesis in the gauged $U(1)_{B-L}$ extension of the Standard Model (BLSM) with an inverse seesaw (ISS) mechanism for neutrino mass generation. In this framework, right-handed neutrinos typically have $\mathcal{O}(1)$ Yukawa couplings, which induce strong washout effects and render conventional thermal leptogenesis ineffective. We demonstrate that a successful baryogenesis scenario can nevertheless be realized through non-thermal leptogenesis, where right-handed neutrinos are produced from the decay of the heavy $B\!-\!L$ Higgs boson $\chi$. We explicitly analyze the interplay between the dilution factor $T_R/M_\chi$ and the washout parameter characteristic of the ISS, highlighting the tension between suppressing washout effects and maintaining sufficient reheating. We show that a viable lepton asymmetry can be generated provided the scalar mass spectrum is appropriately tuned, allowing for a reduced reheating temperature while keeping washout under control. The resulting lepton asymmetry is efficiently converted into the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe via sphaleron processes. Our results establish that the inverse-seesaw $B\!-\!L$ model remains a predictive and robust framework for non-thermal leptogenesis and baryogenesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective field theories arising from string compactifications are subject to constraints originating from the duality transformations of string theory. Interpreting these so-called selection rules in terms of conventional symmetries has remained challenging. We show that particular selection rules in heterotic orbifolds can be explained from a subtle interplay between modular and traditional flavor symmetries within the eclectic flavor framework.</description>

      <title>QFT as a set of ODEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlation functions of local operators in Quantum Field Theory (QFT) on hyperbolic space can be fully characterized by the set of QFT data $\lbrace \Delta_i,C_{ijk},b^{\hat{\mathcal{O}}}_j\rbrace$. These are the scaling dimensions of boundary operators $\Delta_i$, the boundary Operator Product Expansion (OPE) coefficients $C_{ijk}$ and the Boundary Operator Expansion (BOE) coefficients $b^{\hat{\mathcal{O}}}_j$ that characterize how each bulk operator $\hat{\mathcal{O}}$ can be expanded in terms of boundary operators $\mathcal{O}_j$.For simplicity, we focus on two dimensional QFTs and derive a universal set of first order Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) that encode the variation of the QFT data under an infinitesimal change of a bulk relevant coupling. In principle, our ODEs can be used to follow a Renormalization Group (RG) flow starting from a solvable QFT into a strongly coupled phase and to the flat space limit.</description>

      <title>Neutrino decays as a natural explanation of the neutrino mass tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new tension is emerging between the tight cosmological upper bounds on the total neutrino mass ($\sum m_\nu \lesssim 0.06 \, \rm{eV}$) and the lower limits from oscillation experiments, with potentially far-reaching implications for cosmology and particle physics. Neutrinos decaying into massless BSM particles with lifetimes $\tau_\nu \sim 0.01-1\, \rm{Gyr}$ represent a theoretically well-motivated mechanism to reconcile such measurements. Using DESI DR2 and CMB datasets, we show that such decays relax the bound on the total neutrino mass up to $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.23 \, \rm{eV}$ (95%), restoring full agreement with oscillation data. We also present the first late-time cosmological analysis of neutrino decays into lighter neutrinos in a manner consistent with the measured mass splittings. In contrast to the decays into massless BSM particles, we find that this scenario only marginally alleviates - or even tightens - the cosmological neutrino mass bounds, depending on the mass ordering.</description>

      <title>Diluting the Dark Sector: A Common Origin for the PTA Signal and Inelastic SIDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent detection of a nanohertz stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) challenges conventional astrophysics by observed signal amplitude exceeds predictions from standard SMBHB populations without implausible accretion histories. To resolve this amplitude tension, we introduce the Radiative SIDM Dilution framework.We explain the observed spectrum emerges as a hybrid signal by an astrophysical floor, dynamically suppressed by the cored halos of Self-Interacting Dark Matter (SIDM),and a dominant cosmological peak generated during a supercooled phase transition in the dark sector. By performing a free spectral reconstruction and Bayesian model comparison, we demonstrate that a transition defined by a nucleation temperature $T_* \approx 1.24$ MeV and inverse duration $\beta/H_* \approx 150$ not only fills the spectral gap left by stalled binaries but yields statistical evidence($\Delta \text{BIC} \approx 15$) over purely standard astrophysical interpretations. The thermodynamics required to reproduce this SGWB signature also resolves the thermal overproduction of resonant SIDM. The entropy injected by the transition naturally provides the specific dilution factor $D \approx 100$ needed to reset the dark matter relic density to observation. This mechanism also has broader cosmological consequences.The residual dark radiation alleviates the Hubble tension $\Delta N_{\rm eff} \sim 0.3$ while bubble collisions generate magnetohydrodynamic turbulence sufficient to seed primordial magnetic fields $B_0 \sim 10^{-13}$ G. These convergences suggest that the NANOGrav excess is not an anomaly, but the acoustic signature of the entropy injection event that rendered the dark sector cosmologically viable.</description>

      <title>Inflationary Dynamics and Perturbations in Fractal Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study inflationary dynamics within the framework of fractal cosmology, where spacetime exhibits a non-integer effective dimension, sourced through a relaxation of the cosmological principle. Using Friedmann and continuity equations, modified by an effective fractal dimension $D$; we derive generalized slow-roll parameters and examine their evolution for cubic, Starobinsky and Natural inflationary potentials. We then formulate a fractal extension of the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation by introducing an effective momentum term $k_{\text{eff}}$, arising from the fractal decomposition of the spatial Laplacian, that captures the geometric influence of fractal cosmology on scalar perturbations. This leads to corrections in the power spectrum and a scalar spectral index $n_s$ that depends explicitly on both the fractal dimension $D$ and a fractional scale $L$, which controls the strength of the fractal deformation. Comparison with the Planck 2018 data ($n_s=0.9649\pm 0.0042$) constrains the allowed range of $D$ ($2.7\lesssim D\lesssim3$) depending on the cosmological and inflationary model assumed.</description>

      <title>QCD Crossover at Low Temperatures from Lee-Yang Edge Singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide the first lattice-QCD estimate of the crossover line down to $T\simeq108$~MeV. We introduce a new method that combines the Lee-Yang edge in the complex plane of baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$ with universal chiral scaling to determine the $\mu_B$ dependence of the QCD chiral critical and pseudo-critical temperatures. By performing $(2\!+\!1)$-flavor lattice QCD simulations at $T\simeq108$~MeV and purely imaginary $\mu_B$ with a single lattice spacing and two volumes, we compute $\mu_B$-dependent baryon-number susceptibilities and extract the location of the Lee-Yang edge. Together with universal scaling near the QCD chiral transition, it constrains the mapping function between $\{T,\mu_B\}$ and the scaling variable (\textit{i.e.}\ the argument of the universal scaling functions). This mapping function then yields the $\mu_B$ dependence of the critical and pseudo-critical temperatures for $T\gtrsim108$~MeV. While our calculation is performed only at a single value of low temperature without explicit input from small-$\mu_B$ expansion, the resulting $\mu_B$ dependence of the pseudo-critical temperature is consistent with established lattice-QCD determinations at small $\mu_B$ and compatible with chemical freeze-out parameters of heavy-ion collisions down to low temperatures, demonstrating the validity and robustness of the method. Application of this method can be systematically extended to additional temperatures and finer discretizations, opening a pathway to charting the QCD phase diagram in the low-$T$, high-$\mu_B$ regime.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Primoridal Black Hole Abundance with Space-Based Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Overdense regions can collapse into primordial black holes (PBHs) in the early universe, which are a compelling candidate for dark matter. Current constraints leave the asteroid-mass window the only possible one for PBH to account for all the dark matter, which can only be probed indirectly by the scalar-induced gravitational waves (GWs) sourced by the curvature perturbation which forms PBH. In this work, we explore the capabilities of future space-based gravitational wave detectors, including LISA, Taiji, and TianQin, to constrain such induced GWs as well as the PBH abundance. We systematically account for the width of the primordial curvature power spectrum, and find that the asteroid-mass window can be fully probed by all three space-based interferometers. If PBHs constitute the majority of dark matter, the induced GW leaves a strong signal in the mHz band with a signal-to-noise ratio of $10^3\sim10^4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work we have analyzed the transverse momentum spectra of charged particles in high multiplicity $pp$ collisions at LHC energies $\sqrt s $ = 5.02 and 13 TeV using the Color String Percolation Model (CSPM). For heavy ions $Pb-Pb$ at $\sqrt {s_{NN}} $ = 2.76 and 5.02 TeV along with $Xe-Xe$ at $\sqrt {s_{NN}} $= 5.44 TeV have been analyzed. The initial temperature is extracted both in low and high multiplicity events in ${\it pp}$ collisions. For $A-A$ collisions the temperature is obtained as a function of centrality. From the measured energy density $ \varepsilon$ and the temperature T the dimensionless quantity $ \varepsilon/T^{4}$ is obtained. Our results for Pb-Pb and Xe-Xe collisions show a sharp increase in $\varepsilon/T^{4}$ above T $\sim$ 210 MeV and reaching the ideal gas of quarks and gluons value of $ \varepsilon/T^{4} \sim$ 16 at temperature $\sim $ 230 MeV. At this temperature there is a transition from the fluid behavior of QCD matter strongly interacting to a quasi free gas of quarks and gluons.</description>

      <title>Extended Heun Hierarchy in Quantum Seiberg-Witten Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum geometry of the Seiberg-Witten curve for $\mathcal{N}=2$, $\mathrm{SU(2)}^n$ linear quiver gauge theories. By applying the Weyl quantization prescription to the algebraic curve, we derive the corresponding second-order differential equation and demonstrate that it is isomorphic to the Extended Heun Equation with $n+3$ regular singular points. The physical parameters of the gauge theory are linked to the canonical coefficients of the Heun equation via a polynomial representation of the Seiberg-Witten curve. This framework provides the necessary mathematical foundation to apply non-perturbative gauge-theoretic techniques, such as instanton counting, to spectral problems in gravitational physics, most notably for higher-dimensional black holes.</description>

      <title>Towards a unified quantum field theory of dark energy and inflation: unstable de Sitter vacuum and running vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inflation is a necessary cosmic mechanism to cure basic inconsistencies of the standard model of cosmology. These problems are usually `fixed' by postulating the existence of a scalar field (called the ``inflaton''). However, other less ad hoc options are possible. In the running vacuum model (RVM) framework, the vacuum energy density (VED) is a function of the Hubble rate $H$ and its time derivatives: $\rho_{\rm vac}=\rho_{\rm vac}(H, \dot{H},\ddot{H},\dots)$. In this context, the VED is dynamical (there is no rigid cosmological constant $\Lambda$). In the FLRW epoch, $\rho_{\rm vac}$ evolves very slowly with expansion, as befits the observed $\Lambda\simeq$const. behavior. In contrast, in the very early universe the vacuum fluctuations induce higher powers $H^N$ capable of unleashing fast inflation in a short period in which $H\simeq$ const. We call this mechanism `RVM-inflation'. It does not require an inflaton field since inflation is brought about by pure quantum field theory (QFT) effects on the dynamical background. It is different from Starobinsky's inflation, in which $H$ is never constant. In this work, we study a closely related scenario: the decay of the exact de Sitter vacuum into FLRW spacetime in its radiation epoch and the subsequent impact on the current universe, and compare with the RVM. We find that in both cases inflation is driven by $H^4$ powers together with subleading contributions of order $H^2$ that ease a graceful-exit transition into the radiation-dominated epoch, where the FLRW regime starts and ultimately develops a mildly evolving VED in the late universe: $\delta\rho_{\rm vac}\sim {\cal O}(m_{\rm Pl} ^2 H^2)$. The outcome is an unified QFT approach to inflation and dark energy (conceived as dynamical vacuum energy) with potentially measurable phenomenological consequences in the present universe which can help to cure the cosmological tensions.</description>

      <title>Mimicking Phantom Dark Energy with Evolving Dark Matter Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general method to reproduce a given cosmological background through energy exchange between dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM). This can be simply realized with a standard quintessence scalar field that controls the DM mass. In particular a background with phantom crossing can be effectively realized without introducing ghosts or other pathologies. For example one can reproduce exactly the background that gives the best fit to the recent DESI+CMB+DESY5 data, within the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization of DE. Although the background evolution is identical, the perturbations differ, leading to modified growth of structures. If the DM mass varies at late times, early-time observables are not modified and can reproduce the main predictions of the target model, but late-time observables are affected. We discuss in particular the effects on the matter power spectrum, CMB lensing and ISW effect. When reproducing the best fit CPL background model, this scenario generically predicts $\mathcal{O}(10\%)$ deviations in such observables. However, for suitable choices of parameters, effects on the matter power spectrum can be smaller, motivating a detailed study. In general, energy exchange between DE and DM generates a mismatch between the matter power spectrum and the gravitational potential amplitudes compared to the decoupled case, that can lead to deviations observable in future experiments.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel method for incorporating the effects of stellar modeling uncertainties into constraints on the axion-electron coupling constant found using the observed calibration of the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) I band magnitude $M_I$.~We simulate grids of models with varying initial stellar mass, helium abundance, metallicity, and axion-electron coupling $\alpha_{26}= 10^{26} g^2_{ae}/4\pi$ but different (fixed) mixing lengths and mass loss efficiencies.~We then train separate machine learning emulators to predict $M_I$ as a function of the varying parameters for each grid.~Our emulators enable the use of Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations where $\alpha_{26}$ is varied simultaneously with the stellar parameters.~One of our grids yields a bound $\alpha_{26}\leq 0.75$ at the 95\% confidence limit, a factor of $\sim3.7$ weaker than previous bounds;~while the other grid yields $\alpha_{26}\leq1.58$ at the 95\% confidence limit, a factor $\sim7.8$ weaker than previous bounds.~We demonstrate that the different values we find are due to covariances between stellar and axion physics that are not accounted for by single parameter variations.~Our results suggest that the bound on $\alpha_{26}$ derived using empirical calibrations of the TRGB I band magnitude need to be reevaluated using simultaneous parameter variation.~Alternative methods that use the bolometric luminosity instead of $M_I$ are more robust because they are not reliant upon theoretical predictions of the effective temperature.</description>

      <title>Rare and exclusive few-body decays of the Higgs, Z, W bosons, and the top quark</title>

Abstract: We perform an extensive survey of rare and exclusive few-body decays -- defined as those with branching fractions $\mathcal{B} \lesssim 10^{-5}$ into two to four final particles -- of the Higgs, Z, W bosons, and the top quark. Such rare decays can probe physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM), constitute a background for exotic decays into new BSM particles, and provide precise information on quantum chromodynamics factorization with small nonperturbative corrections. We tabulate the theoretical $\mathcal{B}$ values for about 200 rare decay channels of the four heaviest elementary particles, indicating the current experimental limits in their observation. Among those, we have computed for the first time ultrarare Higgs boson decays into photons and/or neutrinos, H and Z radiative decays into leptonium states, radiative H and Z quark-flavour-changing decays, and semiexclusive top-quark decays into a quark plus a meson, while updating predictions for a few other rare H, Z, and top quark partial widths. The feasibility of measuring each of these unobserved decays is estimated for p-p collisions at the high-luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC), and for $e^+e^-$ and p-p collisions at the future circular collider (FCC).</description>

Abstract: The individual fermion generations of the Standard Model fit neatly into a representation of a simple Grand Unified Theory gauge algebra. If Grand Unification is not realized in nature, this would appear to be a coincidence. We attempt to quantify how frequently this coincidence occurs among theories with group structure and fermion content similar to the Standard Model. While many of the completely chiral, anomaly-free fermion representations of the Standard Model gauge algebra that are no larger than the single generation Standard Model are unifiable, we find that unifiability quickly becomes rare when the analysis is extended to include other gauge algebras or larger representations. This purely group-theoretical analysis may be taken as a bottom-up indication for Grand Unification, conceptually similar to a naturalness argument.</description>

      <title>A quantum machine learning classifier to search for new physics</title>

Abstract: Due to the success of the Standard Model~(SM), it is reasonable to anticipate that the signal of new physics~(NP) beyond the SM is small. Consequently, future searches for NP and precision tests of the SM will require high luminosity collider experiments. Moreover, as precision tests advance, rare processes with many final-state particles require consideration which demands the analysis of a vast number of observables. The high luminosity produces a large amount of experimental data spanning a large observable space, posing a significant data-processing challenge. In recent years, quantum machine learning has emerged as a promising approach for processing large amounts of complex data on a quantum computer. In this study, we propose quantum searching neighbor~(QSN) and variational QSN~(VQSN) algorithms to search for NP. The QSN is a classification algorithm. The VQSN introduces variation to the QSN to process classical data. As applications, we apply the (V)QSN in the phenomenological study of the NP at the Large Hadron Collider and muon colliders. Examples are implemented on a real quantum hardware, which confirms reliable performance under noisy conditions. The results indicate that the VQSN demonstrates superior efficiency in the sense of computational complexity to a classical counterpart k-nearest neighbor algorithm, even when dealing with classical data.</description>

Abstract: The $U(1)$ CP-violating phase which arises below chiral symmetry breaking in a non-Abelian gauge theory is ``secretly" the magnetic dual of the flux of a $U(1)$ $4$-form gauge field. Thus the discharge of this $4$-form flux by Schwinger production of charged membranes reduces the total CP-violating phase toward zero. This can safely restore CP symmetry to within the observational limits, $\theta_{\cancel{\tt CP}} \la 10^{-10}$, while also satisfying all limits from cosmology, when the charge and the tension of the gauge field sources are in the $\la keV$ range.</description>

      <title>Probing the Axion-Nucleon Coupling with Supergiant Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A finite axion-nucleon coupling enables the production of axions in stellar environments via the thermal excitation and subsequent de-excitation of the $^{57}$Fe isotope. Given its low-lying excited state at 14.4 keV, $^{57}$Fe can be efficiently excited in the hot cores of supergiant stars, possibly leading to axions emission. The conversion of these axions into photons in the Galactic magnetic field results in a characteristic 14.4 keV line, potentially detectable by hard X-ray telescopes such as NASA's Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR). In this work, we present the first constraints on axion-nucleon couplings derived from \textsc{NuSTAR} observations of Betelgeuse and discuss the potential insights that could be gained from detecting this line in other nearby supergiants. Our results establish significantly more stringent bounds than those obtained from solar observations, setting a limit of $|g_{a\gamma} g_{aN}^{\mathrm{eff}}| &lt; (1.2 - 2.7) \times 10^{-20}$ GeV$^{-1}$ for $m_a \lesssim 10^{-10}$ eV.</description>

      <title>Vector Dark Matter in a $U(1)_X$ extended 2HDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of having a vector boson dark matter in a $U(1)_X$ extended two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) setup. The gauge boson gains mass when a SM singlet complex scalar, which is charged under the dark $U(1)_X$ symmetry, acquires vacuum expectation value (\textit{vev}). This scalar acts as the connection between the SM sector and DM via the Higgs portal. An additional exact charge conjugation symmetry inhibits the mixing of this gauge boson with the photon, thereby confirming the stability of DM. On the other hand, 2HDM with Type I $Z_2$ restriction can offer a non-standard Higgs in the lighter mass range. This freedom allows us to accommodate dark matter mass in the (40-60) GeV regime where the direct detection constraints are strongest. We study the dark matter phenomenology of such a model while taking care of all possible theoretical and experimental constraints.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from a dilaton-induced, first-order QCD phase transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01191v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a `QCD dilaton' field, whose vacuum expectation value sets the strong coupling, can render the Quantum Chromodynamic (QCD) confinement transition first-order. The QCD dilaton is cosmologically attracted to a false vacuum at weak coupling in the early universe. Quantum tunnelling towards the true vacuum triggers prompt chiral symmetry breaking and confinement of QCD, leading to detonating bubbles of the hadronic phase. We find that plasma sound waves produced by this dilaton-induced, first-order QCD phase transition generate a stochastic gravitational wave signal strikingly similar to the recently detected gravitational wave background from Pulsar Timing Arrays. We briefly comment on how this theory can be probed through collider experiments and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Hidden-Heavy Pentaquarks and Where to Find Them</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06991v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a simple explanation for the observed hidden-charm pentaquarks as bound states in Born-Oppenheimer potentials. We identify $P_{c\bar{c}}(4312)^+$, $P_{c\bar{c}}(4440)^+$, and $P_{c\bar{c}}(4457)^+$ as heavy-quark spin states in a quartet of $c \bar{c}$ pentaquarks with $J^P$ quantum numbers $\frac{1}{2}^-$, $\frac{3}{2}^-$, and $\frac{5}{2}^-$. The quantum numbers of $P_{c\bar{c}}(4457)^+$ differ from most previous predictions. We also predict a fourth $c\bar{c}$ pentaquark with quantum numbers $\frac{3}{2}^-$ near the $\Sigma_c^\ast\bar{D}$ threshold. We identify $P_{c\bar{c}s}(4338)^0$ and $P_{c\bar{c}s}(4459)^0$ as heavy-quark spin states in a triplet of $c \bar{c}s$ pentaquarks with quantum numbers $\frac{1}{2}^-$ and either $\frac{1}{2}^-$ or $\frac{3}{2}^-$. We also predict a third $c\bar{c}s$ pentaquark with quantum numbers either $\frac{3}{2}^-$ or $\frac{1}{2}^-$ near the $\Xi_c\bar{D}^\ast$ threshold. We explain why the observed hidden-charm pentaquarks have narrow widths.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Muons decay in vacuum mainly via the leptonic channel to an electron, a muon neutrino and an electron antineutrino. Previous investigations have concluded that muon decay can only be significantly altered in a strong electromagnetic field when the muonic strong-field parameter is of order unity, which is far beyond the reach of lab-based experiments at current and planned facilities. In this letter, an alternative mechanism is presented in which a laser pulse affects the vacuum decay rate of a muon outside the pulse. Quantum interference between the muon decaying with or without interacting with the pulse generates fringes in the electron momentum spectra and can increase the muon lifetime by up to a factor 2. The required parameters to observe this effect are available in experiments today.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we distinguish the isospin for the first time and study the diquark-diquark-antiquark type $udsc\bar{c}$ pentaquark states with zero isospin via the QCD sum rules systematically. We distinguish contributions of the pentaquark states with negative parity from positive parity unambiguously and obtain clean QCD sum rules for the pentaquark states with negative parity. Then we adopt the modified energy scale formula to choose the optimal energy scales of the QCD spectral densities, and obtain the mass spectrum of the $udsc\bar{c}$ pentaquark states with the quantum numbers $I=0$ and $J^{P}={\frac{1}{2}}^-$, ${\frac{3}{2}}^-$, ${\frac{5}{2}}^-$, which could interpret the $P_{cs}(4338)$ and $P_{cs}(4459)$ in the $J/\psi \Lambda$ mass spectrum naturally.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-ray cooling by dark matter in astrophysical jets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Astrophysical jets from powerful active galactic nuclei (AGN) have recently been proposed as promising probes of dark matter (DM) in the sub-GeV mass range. AGN launch relativistic jets that accelerate cosmic rays (CRs) to very high energies, which can then interact with their surroundings and produce multiwavelength (MW) emission spanning from radio frequencies to TeV $\gamma$ rays. If DM consists of light particles, their interactions with CRs could lead to an additional cooling mechanism that modifies the expected MW emission. In this work, we analyse the MW spectrum of Markarian 421, a well-studied AGN, using a multizone leptonic jet model that includes the interactions between CR electrons and DM particles. For the first time, we account for the uncertainties in the astrophysical jet dynamics, which have been previously neglected when constraining the CR-DM interactions. By fitting simultaneously jet parameters and DM-electrons interactions, we use the MW data from \mkn to set constraints on the DM-induced CR cooling. We obtain 5$\sigma$ upper limit $\sigma_\text{DM-e} \lesssim 1 \times 10^{-34}~\text{cm}^2$ for a DM mass of $1~{\rm MeV}$. We demonstrate that this is about a factor of 2--10 stronger than traditional approaches depending on DM mass. This improvement originates from having indeed considered the full multi-wavelength emission from the source, instead if a simplified approach. Properly accounting for degeneracies between jet dynamics and DM interactions is also key to deriving robust constraints on DM interactions.</description>

      <title>Searching for long-lived axion-like particles via displaced vertices at the HL-LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) are well-motivated extensions of the standard model (SM) that appear in numerous new physics scenarios. In this paper, we concentrate on searches for long-lived ALPs predicted by the photophobic scenario at the HL-LHC with the center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV and the integrated luminosity $\mathcal{L}=$ $3$ ab$^{-1}$. We consider the process $pp \to \gamma a$ with the ALP $a$ decaying into a pair of displaced charged leptons and perform a detailed analysis of two types of signals: $\pi^+ \pi^- \gamma E\mkern-10.5 mu/_T $ and $\ell^+ \ell^- \gamma E\mkern-10.5 mu/_T $. For the $\pi^+ \pi^- \gamma E\mkern-10.5 mu/_T $ signal, we find that the prospective sensitivities of the HL-LHC can reach $g_{aWW}\in [8.72 \times 10^{-3}, 6.42 \times 10^{-2}]$ TeV$^{-1}$ for the ALP mass $m_a \in [4, 10]$ GeV. While for the $\ell^+ \ell^- \gamma E\mkern-10.5 mu/_T $ signal, the HL-LHC can probe a broader parameter space, with the sensitivities covering $m_a \in [4, 10]$ GeV and $g_{aWW} \in [4.17 \times 10^{-3}, 2.00 \times 10^{-1}]$ TeV$^{-1}$. These long-lived searches complement some previous prompt decay studies from LEP and LHC experiments, extending the parameter space explored by the LHCb collaboration. Our results show that the HL-LHC has significant potential to probe long-lived ALPs via their displaced vertex signatures.</description>

      <title>Three-body resonances of $\alpha\alpha M$ clusters ($M=\phi$, $J/\psi$, $\eta_c$) in $^{8}_{M}{\mathrm{Be}}$ nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recently obtained HAL QCD potentials for the $N$-$\phi$, $N$-$J/\psi$, and $N$-$\eta_c$ interactions, we investigate the structure of the exotic nuclei $^{8}_{\phi}{\text{Be}}$, $^{8}_{J/\psi}{\text{Be}}$, and $^{8}_{\eta_c}{\text{Be}}$ as $\alpha+\alpha+M$ three-body systems ($M$ denotes the meson). The bound and resonant states are calculated consistently using the Gaussian expansion method, with resonances identified via the complex scaling method. For the $\alpha\phi$ and $\alpha$-charmonium interactions, a folding potential is constructed based on the HAL QCD potentials and fitted to a Woods-Saxon form. We find that the $\phi$ meson exhibits a strong ``glue-like" effect, binding the $0^+_1$, $2^+_1$, and $4^+_1$ resonant states of $^8$Be into stable states and significantly reducing the $\alpha$-$\alpha$ distance. In contrast, the interactions of $J/\psi$ and $\eta_c$ with the nucleus are weaker, forming only shallow bound states with the $0^+_1$ state of $^8$Be and even increasing the $\alpha$-$\alpha$ separation. Notably, our analysis predicts weakly bound $\alpha$-$J/\psi$ states in the $^4S_{3/2}$ and $^2S_{1/2}$ channels, a result not reported in prior studies, which suggests that $^{8}_{J/\psi}{\text{Be}}$ may not be a Borromean nucleus. The sensitivity of the $^{8}_{M}{\mathrm{Be}}(4^+_1)$ state-transitioning from bound to resonant depending on the $\alpha$-particle radius-highlights the subtle dynamics at play. These results provide a systematic theoretical comparison of how different vector mesons modify nuclear clustering, offering critical predictions for future experimental searches of such exotic hadron-nucleus systems.</description>

      <title>An $A_4$-Symmetric Double Seesaw for Neutrino Masses and Mixing in Light of JUNO results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a double seesaw mechanism for generating light neutrino masses within the Standard Model extensions that include both right-handed neutrinos and extra gauge-singlet sterile fermions. The flavour structure of the double seesaw framework is invoked by an $A_4$ discrete symmetry which yields predictive textures for the Dirac neutrino mass matrix $M_D$, the mixing matrix $M_{RS}$ connecting right-handed and sterile neutrinos, and the bare Majorana mass matrix $M_S$ for the sterile neutrinos. The interesting feature of the present framework is that the combination of the double seesaw mechanism and $A_4$ flavour alignments yields a leading-order TBM structure, corrected by a single rotation in the (1-3) sector. We also derive analytic expressions for the heavy sterile eigenvalues and for the resulting light neutrino masses, thereby clarifying the role of the symmetry in shaping the neutrino mass hierarchy. We further incorporate the most recent JUNO measurements, which improve the precision of the solar mixing angle $\sin^2\theta_{12} \simeq 0.31$, along with updated constraints on $\sin^2\theta_{13}$. We show that these results significantly restrict the allowed parameter space of the model. In particular, the observed value of $\sin^2\theta_{12}$ constrains the magnitude of the (1--3) rotation and the phases associated with the $A_4$ flavon couplings, while the value of $\sin^2\theta_{13}$ sharpens these restrictions further. Overall, the interplay between double seesaw dynamics, $A_4$ flavour symmetry, and the recent JUNO constraints yields a highly predictive framework for neutrino masses and mixings, offering a coherent explanation for the generation of light neutrino masses and testable predictions for future experiments.</description>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive phenomenological analysis of the Radion in the Randall-Sundrum model, focusing on its production via light-by-light scattering in ultra-peripheral proton-proton collisions at the LHC. We provide a consistent derivation of the effective couplings to Standard Model fields, clarifying the normalization of the trace anomaly-induced coupling to photons and the role of kinetic mixing with the Higgs boson. We demonstrate that while the pure gravitational coupling is loop-suppressed relative to Axion-Like Particles (ALPs), making the unmixed Radion elusive, the non-minimal mixing with the Higgs sector can induce constructive interference that enhances the signal by orders of magnitude. Using forward proton tagging to select exclusive high-mass events, we reinterpret recent experimental limits on ALPs to derive the first exclusion contours for the Radion in the $(\Lambda_r, \xi)$ plane, showing that mixing scenarios are beginning to be constrained by current LHC data.</description>

      <title>Dynamical systems approach to Cold and Warm Inflation within slow-roll and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically present a new dynamical systems approach to standard inflationary processes and their variants as constant-roll inflation. Using the techniques presented in our work one can in general investigate the attractor nature of the inflationary models in the phase space. We have compactified the phase space coordinates, wherever necessary, and regulated the nonlinear differential equations, constituting the autonomous system of equations defining the dynamical system, at the cost of a new redefined time variable which is a monotonic increasing function of the standard time coordinate. We have shown that in most of the relevant cases the program is executable although the two time coordinates may show different durations of cosmological events. If one wishes one can revert back to the cosmological time via an inverse transformation. The present work establishes a standard norm for studying dynamical as well as stability issues in any new inflationary system.</description>

      <title>Multi-messenger standard-siren cosmology for third-generation gravitational-wave detectors: forecasts considering observations of gamma-ray bursts and kilonovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave (GW) detector era, GW multi-messenger observations for binary neutron star merger events can exert great impacts on exploring the cosmic expansion history. Extending the previous work, we explore the potential of 3G GW standard siren observations in cosmological parameter estimation by considering their associated electromagnetic (EM) counterparts, including $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) coincidence observations by the Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor and GW-triggered target-of-opportunity observations of kilonovae by different optical survey projects. During an assumed 10-year observation, we predict that the number of detectable GW-kilonova events is $\sim 4900$ with redshifts below $\sim 0.4$ under GW network and Large Synoptic Survey Telescope in the $i$ band, which is three times more than that of GW-GRB detections. For the cosmological analysis, we find that with the inclusion of GW-kilonova detections, the constraints on cosmological parameters from GW-EM detections are significantly improved compared to those from GW-GRB detections. In particular, GW-EM detections can tightly constrain the Hubble constant with a precision ranging from $0.076\%$ to $0.034\%$. Moreover, GW multi-messenger observations could effectively break the cosmological parameter degeneracies generated by the mainstream EM observations, CMB+BAO+SN (CBS). The combination of CBS and GW-EM can tightly constrain the equation of state parameters of dark energy $w$ in the $w$CDM model and $w_0$ in the $w_0w_a$CDM model with precisions of $0.72\%$ and $0.99\%$, respectively, meeting the standard of precision cosmology. In conclusion, GW multi-messenger observations could play a crucial role in helping solve the Hubble tension and probing the fundamental nature of dark energy.</description>

      <title>QCD Effective Lagrangian and Condensation of Chromomagnetic Flux Tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11375v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the effective action for covariantly constant gauge fields that are solutions of the sourceless Yang-Mills equation and have the form of magnetic flux tubes. They represent a superposition of infinite many alternating monopole/ani-monopole pairs situated at infinity, with each pair having a structure similar to the Nielsen-Olesen magnetic flux tube. The chromomagnetic flux tubes condensation is stable and indicates that the Yang-Mills vacuum state is highly degenerate.</description>

      <title>SL(2N,C) Yang-Mills Theories: Direct Internal Forces and Emerging Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19210v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a four-dimensional gauge-gravity unification based on the \(SL(2N,\mathbb C)\) gauge theory taken in a universal Yang--Mills type setting. The accompanying tetrads are promoted to dynamical fields whose contracted invertibility condition is interpreted as a nonlinear sigma-model type length constraint. This triggers tetrad condensation and spontaneously breaks $\mathrm{SL}(2N, \mathbb{C})\to \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})\times\mathrm{SU}(N)$, lifting all noncompact directions. A special ghost-free curvature-squared Lagrangian provides a consistent quadratic sector, while an Einstein--Cartan linear curvature term is induced radiatively from fermion loops. Below the breaking scale, only a neutral tetrad associated with graviton and $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ vector fields remain massless, whereas axial-vector and tensor fields of the entire gauge multiplet acquire heavy masses. The matter sector clearly points to a deeper elementarity of \(SL(2N,\mathbb C)\) spinors, which can be identified with preon constituents whose bound states form the observed quarks and leptons. Anomaly matching between preons and composites singles out $N=8$. The chain $\mathrm{SL}(16,\mathbb{C})\to \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})\times\mathrm{SU}(8)$ then naturally yields three composite quark--lepton families, while filtering out extraneous heavy states.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Generic Varying-Tension Cosmic Strings in Expanding Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has recently been realised that strings with time-dependent tensions exhibit interesting dynamics; in particular, when the tension decreases loops of string can grow and possibly percolate. We extend previous analytic studies of strings with time-dependent tensions to numerical studies of non-circular loops. We show that the dynamics of a varying-tension string in expanding universe is mathematically equivalent to the evolution of a fixed-tension string in a universe with a modified scale factor. We use numerical solvers and machine learning techniques to explore the dynamics of non-circular string loops with radii close to the Hubble scale.</description>

      <title>The ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models with extra $SU(2)_{L_2/R_2}$ gauge symmetry from intersecting D6-branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09057v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By introducing an extra stack of D6-branes to standard ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models, we extend the landscape of its complete search. In this construction, the $d$-stack of D6-branes is introduced besides the standard $a,~b,~c$-stacks. More intersections from the extra stacks of D6-branes appear, and thus Higgs/Higgs-like particles arise from more origins. Among these models, we find eight new classes of ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models with gauge symmetries $SU(4)_C\times SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_{R_1}\times SU(2)_{R_2}$ and $SU(4)_C\times SU(2)_{L_1}\times SU(2)_{R}\times SU(2)_{L_2}$, where $d$-stack of D6-branes carries the gauge symmetries $SU(2)_{R_2}$ and $SU(2)_{L_2}$, respectively. The $SU(2)_{L_1/R_1} \times SU(2)_{L_2/R_2}$ can be broken down to the diagonal $SU(2)_{L/R}$ gauge symmetry via bifundamental Higgs fields. In such a way, we for the first time successfully constructed three-family supersymmetric Pati-Salam models from non-rigid D6-branes with extra $d$-stacks of D6-branes as visible sectors. Interestingly, by introducing extra stack of D6-branes to the standard supersymmetric Pati-Salam models, the number of filler brane reduces in general, and eventually the models without any $USp(N)$ gauge symmetry present. This reduces the exotic particles from filler brane intersection yet provides more vector-like particles from ${\cal N}=2$ subsector that are useful in renormalization group equation evolution as an advantage. Moreover, interesting degeneracy behavior with the same gauge coupling ratio exists in certain class of models.</description>
