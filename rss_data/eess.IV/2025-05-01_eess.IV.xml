      <title>Noise Modeling in One Hour: Minimizing Preparation Efforts for Self-supervised Low-Light RAW Image Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noise synthesis is a promising solution for addressing the data shortage problem in data-driven low-light RAW image denoising. However, accurate noise synthesis methods often necessitate labor-intensive calibration and profiling procedures during preparation, preventing them from landing to practice at scale. This work introduces a practically simple noise synthesis pipeline based on detailed analyses of noise properties and extensive justification of widespread techniques. Compared to other approaches, our proposed pipeline eliminates the cumbersome system gain calibration and signal-independent noise profiling steps, reducing the preparation time for noise synthesis from days to hours. Meanwhile, our method exhibits strong denoising performance, showing an up to 0.54dB PSNR improvement over the current state-of-the-art noise synthesis technique.

      <title>SR-NeRV: Improving Embedding Efficiency of Neural Video Representation via Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have garnered significant attention for their ability to model complex signals across a variety of domains. Recently, INR-based approaches have emerged as promising frameworks for neural video compression. While conventional methods primarily focus on embedding video content into compact neural networks for efficient representation, they often struggle to reconstruct high-frequency details under stringent model size constraints, which are critical in practical compression scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose an INR-based video representation method that integrates a general-purpose super-resolution (SR) network. Motivated by the observation that high-frequency components exhibit low temporal redundancy across frames, our method entrusts the reconstruction of fine details to the SR network. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional INR-based baselines in terms of reconstruction quality, while maintaining comparable model sizes.</description>

      <title>Rootlets-based registration to the spinal cord PAM50 template</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spinal cord functional MRI studies require precise localization of spinal levels for reliable voxelwise group analyses. Traditional template-based registration of the spinal cord uses intervertebral discs for alignment. However, substantial anatomical variability across individuals exists between vertebral and spinal levels. This study proposes a novel registration approach that leverages spinal nerve rootlets to improve alignment accuracy and reproducibility across individuals. We developed a registration method leveraging dorsal cervical rootlets segmentation and aligning them non-linearly with the PAM50 spinal cord template. Validation was performed on a multi-subject, multi-site dataset (n=267, 44 sites) and a multi-subject dataset with various neck positions (n=10, 3 sessions). We further validated the method on task-based functional MRI (n=23) to compare group-level activation maps using rootlet-based registration to traditional disc-based methods. Rootlet-based registration showed superior alignment across individuals compared to the traditional disc-based method. Notably, rootlet positions were more stable across neck positions. Group-level analysis of task-based functional MRI using rootlet-based increased Z scores and activation cluster size compared to disc-based registration (number of active voxels from 3292 to 7978). Rootlet-based registration enhances both inter- and intra-subject anatomical alignment and yields better spatial normalization for group-level fMRI analyses. Our findings highlight the potential of rootlet-based registration to improve the precision and reliability of spinal cord neuroimaging group analysis.</description>

      <title>Stereo X-ray tomography on deformed object tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray computed tomography is a powerful tool for volumetric imaging, but requires the collection of a large number of low-noise projection images, which is often too time consuming, limiting its applicability. In our previous work \cite{shang2023stereo}, we proposed a stereo X-ray tomography system to map the 3D position of fiducial markers using only two projections of a static volume. In dynamic imaging settings, where objects undergo deformations during imaging, this static method can be extended by utilizing additional temporal information. We thus extend the method to track the deformation of fiducial markers in 3D space, where we use knowledge of the initial object shape as prior information, improving the prediction of the evolution of its deformed state over time. In particular, knowledge of the initial object's stereo projections is shown to improve the method's robustness to noise when detecting fiducial marker locations in the projections of the deformed objects. Furthermore, after feature detection, by using the features' initial 3D position information in the undeformed object, we can also demonstrate improvements in the 3D mapping of the deformed features. Using a range of deformed 3D objects, this new approach is shown to be able to track fiducial markers in noisy stereo tomography images with subpixel accuracy.</description>

      <title>Efficient and robust 3D blind harmonization for large domain gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blind harmonization has emerged as a promising technique for MR image harmonization to achieve scale-invariant representations, requiring only target domain data (i.e., no source domain data necessary). However, existing methods face limitations such as inter-slice heterogeneity in 3D, moderate image quality, and limited performance for a large domain gap. To address these challenges, we introduce BlindHarmonyDiff, a novel blind 3D harmonization framework that leverages an edge-to-image model tailored specifically to harmonization. Our framework employs a 3D rectified flow trained on target domain images to reconstruct the original image from an edge map, then yielding a harmonized image from the edge of a source domain image. We propose multi-stride patch training for efficient 3D training and a refinement module for robust inference by suppressing hallucination. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BlindHarmonyDiff outperforms prior arts by harmonizing diverse source domain images to the target domain, achieving higher correspondence to the target domain characteristics. Downstream task-based quality assessments such as tissue segmentation and age prediction on diverse MR scanners further confirm the effectiveness of our approach and demonstrate the capability of our robust and generalizable blind harmonization.</description>

      <title>Towards Lightweight Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution with Depthwise Separable Dilated Convolutional Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated highly competitive performance in super-resolution (SR) for natural images by learning mappings from low-resolution (LR) to high-resolution (HR) images. However, hyperspectral super-resolution remains an ill-posed problem due to the high spectral dimensionality of the data and the scarcity of available training samples. Moreover, existing methods often rely on large models with a high number of parameters or require the fusion with panchromatic or RGB images, both of which are often impractical in real-world scenarios. Inspired by the MobileNet architecture, we introduce a lightweight depthwise separable dilated convolutional network (DSDCN) to address the aforementioned challenges. Specifically, our model leverages multiple depthwise separable convolutions, similar to the MobileNet architecture, and further incorporates a dilated convolution fusion block to make the model more flexible for the extraction of both spatial and spectral features. In addition, we propose a custom loss function that combines mean squared error (MSE), an L2 norm regularization-based constraint, and a spectral angle-based loss, ensuring the preservation of both spectral and spatial details. The proposed model achieves very competitive performance on two publicly available hyperspectral datasets, making it well-suited for hyperspectral image super-resolution tasks.

      <title>CORSTITCH - A free, open source software for stitching and georeferencing underwater coral reef videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CorStitch is an open-source software developed to automate the creation of accurate georeferenced reef mosaics from video transects obtained through Automated Rapid Reef Assessment System surveys. We utilized a Fourier-based image correlation algorithm to stitch sequential video frames, aligning them with synchronized GNSS timestamps. The resulting compressed Keyhole Markup Language files, compatible with geographic information systems such as Google Earth, enable detailed spatial analysis. Validation through comparative analysis of mosaics from two temporally distinct surveys of the same reef demonstrated the software's consistent and reliable performance.</description>

      <title>A Methodological and Structural Review of Parkinsons Disease Detection Across Diverse Data Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parkinsons Disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that primarily affects motor functions and can lead to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia in its advanced stages. With approximately 10 million people diagnosed globally 1 to 1.8 per 1,000 individuals, according to reports by the Japan Times and the Parkinson Foundation early and accurate diagnosis of PD is crucial for improving patient outcomes. While numerous studies have utilized machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques for PD recognition, existing surveys are limited in scope, often focusing on single data modalities and failing to capture the potential of multimodal approaches. To address these gaps, this study presents a comprehensive review of PD recognition systems across diverse data modalities, including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), gait-based pose analysis, gait sensory data, handwriting analysis, speech test data, Electroencephalography (EEG), and multimodal fusion techniques. Based on over 347 articles from leading scientific databases, this review examines key aspects such as data collection methods, settings, feature representations, and system performance, with a focus on recognition accuracy and robustness. This survey aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for researchers, providing actionable guidance for the development of next generation PD recognition systems. By leveraging diverse data modalities and cutting-edge machine learning paradigms, this work contributes to advancing the state of PD diagnostics and improving patient care through innovative, multimodal approaches.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven High-Resolution Cell Segmentation and Quantitative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the growth and metabolism of microbes provides critical insights into their evolutionary adaptations to harsh environments, which are essential for microbial research and biotechnology applications. In this study, we developed an AI-driven image analysis system to efficiently segment individual cells and quantitatively analyze key cellular features. This system is comprised of four main modules. First, a denoising algorithm enhances contrast and suppresses noise while preserving fine cellular details. Second, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) enables accurate, zero-shot segmentation of cells without additional training. Third, post-processing is applied to refine segmentation results by removing over-segmented masks. Finally, quantitative analysis algorithms extract essential cellular features, including average intensity, length, width, and volume. The results show that denoising and post-processing significantly improved the segmentation accuracy of SAM in this new domain. Without human annotations, the AI-driven pipeline automatically and efficiently outlines cellular boundaries, indexes them, and calculates key cellular parameters with high accuracy. This framework will enable efficient and automated quantitative analysis of high-resolution fluorescence microscopy images to advance research into microbial adaptations to grow and metabolism that allow extremophiles to thrive in their harsh habitats.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Assisted Outer Volume Removal for Highly-Accelerated Real-Time Dynamic MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time (RT) dynamic MRI plays a vital role in capturing rapid physiological processes, offering unique insights into organ motion and function. Among these applications, RT cine MRI is particularly important for functional assessment of the heart with high temporal resolution. RT imaging enables free-breathing, ungated imaging of cardiac motion, making it a crucial alternative for patients who cannot tolerate conventional breath-hold, ECG-gated acquisitions. However, achieving high acceleration rates in RT cine MRI is challenging due to aliasing artifacts from extra-cardiac tissues, particularly at high undersampling factors. In this study, we propose a novel outer volume removal (OVR) method to address this challenge by eliminating aliasing contributions from non-cardiac regions in a post-processing framework. Our approach estimates the outer volume signal for each timeframe using composite temporal images from time-interleaved undersampling patterns, which inherently contain pseudo-periodic ghosting artifacts. A deep learning (DL) model is trained to identify and remove these artifacts, producing a clean outer volume estimate that is subsequently subtracted from the corresponding k-space data. The final reconstruction is performed with a physics-driven DL (PD-DL) method trained using an OVR-specific loss function to restore high spatio-temporal resolution images. Experimental results show that the proposed method at high accelerations achieves image quality that is visually comparable to clinical baseline images, while outperforming conventional reconstruction techniques, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The proposed approach provides a practical and effective solution for artifact reduction in RT cine MRI without requiring acquisition modifications, offering a pathway to higher acceleration rates while preserving diagnostic quality.</description>

      <title>GuideSR: Rethinking Guidance for One-Step High-Fidelity Diffusion-Based Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose GuideSR, a novel single-step diffusion-based image super-resolution (SR) model specifically designed to enhance image fidelity. Existing diffusion-based SR approaches typically adapt pre-trained generative models to image restoration tasks by adding extra conditioning on a VAE-downsampled representation of the degraded input, which often compromises structural fidelity. GuideSR addresses this limitation by introducing a dual-branch architecture comprising: (1) a Guidance Branch that preserves high-fidelity structures from the original-resolution degraded input, and (2) a Diffusion Branch, which a pre-trained latent diffusion model to enhance perceptual quality. Unlike conventional conditioning mechanisms, our Guidance Branch features a tailored structure for image restoration tasks, combining Full Resolution Blocks (FRBs) with channel attention and an Image Guidance Network (IGN) with guided attention. By embedding detailed structural information directly into the restoration pipeline, GuideSR produces sharper and more visually consistent results. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that GuideSR achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining the low computational cost of single-step approaches, with up to 1.39dB PSNR gain on challenging real-world datasets. Our approach consistently outperforms existing methods across various reference-based metrics including PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, DISTS and FID, further representing a practical advancement for real-world image restoration.</description>

      <title>Field-scale soil moisture estimated from Sentinel-1 SAR data using a knowledge-guided deep learning approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soil moisture (SM) estimation from active microwave data remains challenging due to the complex interactions between radar backscatter and surface characteristics. While the water cloud model (WCM) provides a semi-physical approach for understanding these interactions, its empirical component often limits performance across diverse agricultural landscapes. This research presents preliminary efforts for developing a knowledge-guided deep learning approach, which integrates WCM principles into a long short-term memory (LSTM) model, to estimate field SM using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. Our proposed approach leverages LSTM's capacity to capture spatiotemporal dependencies while maintaining physical consistency through a modified dual-component loss function, including a WCM-based semi-physical component and a boundary condition regularisation. The proposed approach is built upon the soil backscatter coefficients isolated from the total backscatter, together with Landsat-resolution vegetation information and surface characteristics. A four-fold spatial cross-validation was performed against in-situ SM data to assess the model performance. Results showed the proposed approach reduced SM retrieval uncertainties by 0.02 m$^3$/m$^3$ and achieved correlation coefficients (R) of up to 0.64 in areas with varying vegetation cover and surface conditions, demonstrating the potential to address the over-simplification in WCM.</description>

      <title>Optimal Vector Compressed Sensing Using James Stein Shrinkage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The trend in modern science and technology is to take vector measurements rather than scalars, ruthlessly scaling to ever higher dimensional vectors. For about two decades now, traditional scalar Compressed Sensing has been synonymous with a Convex Optimization based procedure called Basis Pursuit. In the vector recovery case, the natural tendency is to return to a straightforward vector extension of Basis Pursuit, also based on Convex Optimization. However, Convex Optimization is provably suboptimal, particularly when $B$ is large. In this paper, we propose SteinSense, a lightweight iterative algorithm, which is provably optimal when $B$ is large. It does not have any tuning parameter, does not need any training data, requires zero knowledge of sparsity, is embarrassingly simple to implement, and all of this makes it easily scalable to high vector dimensions. We conduct a massive volume of both real and synthetic experiments that confirm the efficacy of SteinSense, and also provide theoretical justification based on ideas from Approximate Message Passing. Fascinatingly, we discover that SteinSense is quite robust, delivering the same quality of performance on real data, and even under substantial departures from conditions under which existing theory holds.</description>

      <title>Synthesizing and Identifying Noise Levels in Autonomous Vehicle Camera Radar Datasets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting and tracking objects is a crucial component of any autonomous navigation method. For the past decades, object detection has yielded promising results using neural networks on various datasets. While many methods focus on performance metrics, few projects focus on improving the robustness of these detection and tracking pipelines, notably to sensor failures. In this paper we attempt to address this issue by creating a realistic synthetic data augmentation pipeline for camera-radar Autonomous Vehicle (AV) datasets. Our goal is to accurately simulate sensor failures and data deterioration due to real-world interferences. We also present our results of a baseline lightweight Noise Recognition neural network trained and tested on our augmented dataset, reaching an overall recognition accuracy of 54.4\% on 11 categories across 10086 images and 2145 radar point-clouds.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: To automate contrast phase classification in CT using organ-specific features extracted from a widely used segmentation tool with a lightweight decision tree classifier.
  Materials and Methods: This retrospective study utilized three public CT datasets from separate institutions. The phase prediction model was trained on the WAW-TACE (median age: 66 [60,73]; 185 males) dataset, and externally validated on the VinDr-Multiphase (146 males; 63 females; 56 unk) and C4KC-KiTS (median age: 61 [50.68; 123 males) datasets. Contrast phase classification was performed using organ-specific features extracted by TotalSegmentator, followed by prediction using a gradient-boosted decision tree classifier.
  Results: On the VinDr-Multiphase dataset, the phase prediction model achieved the highest or comparable AUCs across all phases (&gt;0.937), with superior F1-scores in the non-contrast (0.994), arterial (0.937), and delayed (0.718) phases. Statistical testing indicated significant performance differences only in the arterial and delayed phases (p&lt;0.05). On the C4KC-KiTS dataset, the phase prediction model achieved the highest AUCs across all phases (&gt;0.991), with superior F1-scores in arterial/venous (0.968) and delayed (0.935) phases. Statistical testing confirmed significant improvements over all baseline models in these two phases (p&lt;0.05). Performance in the non-contrast class, however, was comparable across all models, with no statistically significant differences observed (p&gt;0.05).
  Conclusion: The lightweight model demonstrated strong performance relative to all baseline models, and exhibited robust generalizability across datasets from different institutions.</description>

      <title>FOOL: Addressing the Downlink Bottleneck in Satellite Computing with Neural Feature Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16677v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nanosatellite constellations equipped with sensors capturing large geographic regions provide unprecedented opportunities for Earth observation. As constellation sizes increase, network contention poses a downlink bottleneck. Orbital Edge Computing (OEC) leverages limited onboard compute resources to reduce transfer costs by processing the raw captures at the source. However, current solutions have limited practicability due to reliance on crude filtering methods or over-prioritizing particular downstream tasks. This work presents FOOL, an OEC-native and task-agnostic feature compression method that preserves prediction performance. FOOL partitions high-resolution satellite imagery to maximize throughput. Further, it embeds context and leverages inter-tile dependencies to lower transfer costs with negligible overhead. While FOOL is a feature compressor, it can recover images with competitive scores on quality measures at lower bitrates. We extensively evaluate transfer cost reduction by including the peculiarity of intermittently available network connections in low earth orbit. Lastly, we test the feasibility of our system for standardized nanosatellite form factors. We demonstrate that FOOL permits downlinking over 100x the data volume without relying on prior information on the downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Seamless Optical Cloud Computing across Edge-Metro Network for Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in recent years has profoundly reshaped modern lifestyles, necessitating a revolutionary architecture to support the growing demands for computational power. Cloud computing has become the driving force behind this transformation. However, it consumes significant power and faces computation security risks due to the reliance on extensive data centers and servers in the cloud. Reducing power consumption while enhancing computational scale remains persistent challenges in cloud computing. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an optical cloud computing system that can be seamlessly deployed across edge-metro network. By modulating inputs and models into light, a wide range of edge nodes can directly access the optical computing center via the edge-metro network. The experimental validations show an energy efficiency of 118.6 mW/TOPs (tera operations per second), reducing energy consumption by two orders of magnitude compared to traditional electronic-based cloud computing solutions. Furthermore, it is experimentally validated that this architecture can perform various complex generative AI models through parallel computing to achieve image generation tasks.</description>

      <title>MFSR-GAN: Multi-Frame Super-Resolution with Handheld Motion Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Smartphone cameras have become ubiquitous imaging tools, yet their small sensors and compact optics often limit spatial resolution and introduce distortions. Combining information from multiple low-resolution (LR) frames to produce a high-resolution (HR) image has been explored to overcome the inherent limitations of smartphone cameras. Despite the promise of multi-frame super-resolution (MFSR), current approaches are hindered by datasets that fail to capture the characteristic noise and motion patterns found in real-world handheld burst images. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a novel synthetic data engine that uses multi-exposure static images to synthesize LR-HR training pairs while preserving sensor-specific noise characteristics and image motion found during handheld burst photography. We also propose MFSR-GAN: a multi-scale RAW-to-RGB network for MFSR. Compared to prior approaches, MFSR-GAN emphasizes a "base frame" throughout its architecture to mitigate artifacts. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data demonstrates that MFSR-GAN trained with our synthetic engine yields sharper, more realistic reconstructions than existing methods for real-world MFSR.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Security of Semantic Communication via Knowledge-Aided Coding and Jamming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As semantic communication (SemCom) emerges as a promising communication paradigm, ensuring the security of semantic information over open wireless channels has become crucial. Traditional encryption methods introduce considerable communication overhead, while existing learning-based secure SemCom schemes often rely on a channel capacity advantage for the legitimate receiver, which is challenging to guarantee in practice. In this paper, we propose a coding-enhanced jamming approach that eliminates the need to transmit a secret key by utilizing shared knowledge between the legitimate receiver and the transmitter. We generate private codebooks with neural network (NN)-based encoders, using them to encode data into a sequence Y1, which is then superposed with a sequence Y2 drawn from the private codebook. By optimizing the power allocation between the two sequences, the legitimate receiver can successfully decode the data, while the eavesdropper' s performance is significantly degraded, potentially to the point of random guessing. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves comparable security to state-of-the-art approaches while significantly improving the reconstruction performance of the legitimate receiver by more than 1 dB across varying channel signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and compression ratios.</description>

      <title>Fast Sign Retrieval via Sub-band Convolution: An Elementary Extension of Binary Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To efficiently compress the sign information of images, we address a sign retrieval problem for the block-wise discrete cosine transformation (DCT): reconstruction of the signs of DCT coefficients from their amplitudes. To this end, we propose a fast sign retrieval method on the basis of binary classification machine learning. We first introduce 3D representations of the amplitudes and signs, where we pack amplitudes/signs belonging to the same frequency band into a 2D slice, referred to as the sub-band block. We then retrieve the signs from the 3D amplitudes via binary classification, where each sign is regarded as a binary label. We implement a binary classification algorithm using convolutional neural networks, which are advantageous for efficiently extracting features in the 3D amplitudes. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves accurate sign retrieval with an overwhelmingly low computation cost.</description>
