      <title>Mechanism Design with Sequential-Move Games: Revelation Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditionally, mechanism design focuses on simultaneous-move games (e.g., Myerson (1981)). In this paper, we study mechanism design with sequential-move games, and provide two results on revelation principles for general solution concepts (e.g., perfect Bayesian equilibrium, obvious dominance, strong-obvious dominance). First, if a solution concept is additive, implementation in sequential-move games is equivalent to implementation in simultaneous-move games. Second, for any solution concept \r{ho} and any social choice function f, we identify a canonical operator {\gamma}^{(\r{ho},f)}, which is defined on primitives. We prove that, if \r{ho} is monotonic, f can be implemented by a sequential-move game if and only if {\gamma}^{(\r{ho},f)} is achievable, which translates a complicated mechanism design problem into checking some conditions defined on primitives. Most of the existing solution concepts are either additive or monotonic.</description>

      <title>Linear Programming Based Near-Optimal Pricing for Laminar Bayesian Online Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05477</link>
      <description>arXiv:1807.05477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bayesian online selection problem aims to design a pricing scheme for a sequence of arriving buyers that maximizes the expected social welfare (or revenue) subject to different structural constraints. Inspired by applications with a hierarchy of service, this paper focuses on the cases where a laminar matroid characterizes the set of served buyers. We give the first Polynomial-Time Approximation Scheme (PTAS) for the problem when the laminar matroid has constant depth. Our approach is based on rounding the solution of a hierarchy of linear programming relaxations that approximate the optimum online solution with any degree of accuracy, plus a concentration argument showing that rounding incurs a small loss. We also study another variation, which we call the production-constrained problem. The allowable set of served buyers is characterized by a collection of production and shipping constraints that form a particular example of a laminar matroid. Using a similar LP-based approach, we design a PTAS for this problem, although in this special case the depth of the underlying laminar matroid is not necessarily a constant. The analysis exploits the negative dependency of the optimum selection rule in the lower levels of the laminar family. Finally, to demonstrate the generality of our technique, we employ the linear programming-based approach employed in the paper to re-derive some of the classic prophet inequalities known in the literature -- as a side result.</description>
