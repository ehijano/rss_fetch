      <title>Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Study of Monoclonal Antibodies Near an Oil-Water Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) represent an important class of biologic therapeutics that can treat a variety of diseases including cancer, autoimmune disorders or respiratory conditions (e.g. COVID-19). However, throughout their development, mAb are exposed to air-water or oil-water interfaces that may trigger mAb partial unfolding that can lead to the formation of proteinaceous aggregates. Using a combination of dynamic surface tensiometry and spatially resolved 1D 1H NMR spectroscopy, this study investigates if adsorption of a model IgG2a-\k{appa} mAb to the oil-water interface affects its structure. Localized NMR spectroscopy was performed using voxels of 375 um, incrementally approaching the oil-water interface. Dynamic interfacial tension progressively decreases at the oil-water interface over time, confirming mAb adsorption to the interface. Localized NMR spectroscopy results indicate that, while the number of mAb-related chemical resonances and chemical shift frequencies remain unaffected, spectral line broadening is observed as voxels incrementally approach the oil-water interface. Moreover, the spin-spin (T2) relaxation of the mAb molecule was measured for a voxel centered at the interface and shown to be affected differentially across the mAb resonances, indicating a rotational restriction for mAb molecules due to presence of the interface. Finally, the apparent diffusion coefficient of the mAb for the voxel centered at the interface is lower than the bulk mAb. These results suggest that this specific mAb interacts with and may be in exchange with bulk mAb phase in the vicinity of the interface. As such, these localized NMR techniques offer the potential to probe and quantify alterations of mAb properties near interfacial layers.</description>

      <title>pH gradient-driven deformation of a crista-like vesicle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inner membrane of mitochondria presents folds, the cristae, which are the production place of ATP. This synthesis is driven by a flow of protons confined to the surface of the membrane, which also shapes the crista to ensure a high synthesis rate. We model a crista as a spherical vesicle submitted to a diffusive proton gradient flowing from the poles to the equator. Using Helfrich model, we introduce a pH-dependent spontaneous curvature for the membrane and determine the shape of the vesicle, when submitted to the pH gradient, in the regime of small deformations. Based on biophysical arguments, we define a functionality score for the vesicle and construct a phase diagram identifying the zones of "well-functioning" cristae, which we compare to experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Enhanced diffusion over a periodic trap by hydrodynamic coupling to an elastic mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many physical systems, degrees of freedom are coupled \emph{via} hydrodynamic forces, even in the absence of Hamiltonian interactions. A particularly important and widespread example concerns the transport of microscopic particles in fluids near deformable boundaries. In such a situation, the influence of elastohydrodynamic couplings on Brownian motion remains to be understood. Unfortunately, the temporal and spatial scales associated with the thermal fluctuations of usual surfaces are often so small that their deformations are difficult to monitor experimentally, together with the much slower and larger particle motion at stake. Here, we propose a minimal model describing the hydrodynamic coupling of a colloidal particle to a fluctuating elastic mode, in presence of an external periodic potential. We demonstrate that the late-time diffusion coefficient of the particle increases with the compliance of the elastic mode. Remarkably,  our results reveal that, and quantify how: i) spontaneous microscopic transport in complex environnements can be affected by soft boundaries -- a situation with numerous practical implications in nanoscale and biological physics; ii) the effects of fast and tiny surface deformations are imprinted over the long-term and large-distance colloidal mobility -- and are hence measurable in practice.</description>

      <title>Self-organized criticality driven by droplet influx and random fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The droplet size distribution typically decays exponentially in solutions formed by liquid-liquid phase separation. Nevertheless, a power-law distribution of nucleoli volumes has been observed in amphibian oocytes, which appears similar to the cluster size distribution in reaction-limited aggregation. In this work, we study the mechanism of power-law distributed droplet sizes and unveil a self-organized criticality driven by droplet influx and random fusion between droplets. Surprisingly, the droplet size dynamics is governed by a similar Smoluchowski equation as the cluster size in aggregation systems. The system reaches a critical state as the area fraction approaches the critical value at which the droplet size has a power-law distribution with a $1.5$ exponent. Furthermore, the system is also spatially scale-free with a divergent correlation length at the critical state, marked by giant droplet-density fluctuations and power-law decay of the pair correlation function.</description>

      <title>Rheologically tuned modes of collective transport in active viscoelastic films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While many living biological media combine both viscous and elastic properties, most theoretical studies employ either purely fluid- or solid-like descriptions. We here use a unified framework for active films on substrates capable of describing a broad range of viscoelastic behavior to explore the interplay between activity and rheology. The core of the study is a comprehensive state diagram showing a rich world of spatiotemporal dynamic states. Our results demonstrate the potential of tunable rheology to realize modes of controlled active transport on the microscale.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory collective motion in viscoelastic and elastic active fluids and solids under circular confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an inspiring recent study, Xu et al. [Nat. Phys. 19, 46 (2023)] observed for a living active biofilm under circular confinement two emergent dynamic modes of collective motion in the film. One corresponds to global rotational motion of oscillating sense of rotation, the other one to uniformly translating motion of rotating migration direction. The authors reproduced these features in a discretized theoretical model for elastic active solids. We here demonstrate that the discovered fundamental phenomena are generic and emerge abundantly for a broad range of viscoelastic fluids and solids. Elastic solids represent only one limiting case.</description>

      <title>Emergent cell migration from cell shape deformations and T1 transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19686v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: T1 transitions, which are localised cell rearrangements, play an important role in the fluidization of epithelial monolayers. Using a multi-phase field model and an active elastic solid model, we show that although each cell undergoes T1 transitions in time as uncorrelated, random events, the spatial distribution of these events is highly correlated and is dependent on cell shape. T1 transitions have a dual effect. Cells losing neighbours tend to relax their shape, while those gaining neighbours tend to elongate. By analysing the statistics of successive T1 transitions undergone by a deformable cell, we find asymmetric spatial distributions related to how cells lose or gain neighbours. These asymmetric spatial patterns of T1 transitions promote directed cell migration, and form the backbone for coherent flow patterns at tissue scales.</description>

      <title>Decoding Gray Matter: large-scale analysis of brain cell morphometry to inform microstructural modeling of diffusion MR signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02100v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The structure of grey matter has long been a key focus in neuroscience, as cell morphology varies by type and can be affected by neurological conditions. Understanding these variations is essential for studying brain function and disease. Diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) is a powerful non-invasive tool for examining cellular microstructure in vivo. However, for dMRI to accurately reflect cellular features, it is crucial to determine which aspects of morphology influence its measurements. Proper interpretation of dMRI data depends on understanding its sensitivity to different cellular characteristics.
  Despite growing interest in cellular morphology, there has been no systematic report on the key features defining different neural cell types. To address this, we analyzed over 3,500 three-dimensional cellular reconstructions across three species and nine cell types, establishing reference values for critical morphological traits. These traits fall into three categories: structural features that define the cell's skeletal framework, shape features that describe spatial organization, and topological features that break down cellular structure to distinguish cell types. Beyond reporting these reference values, we examine their relevance for dMRI, identifying which neural features dMRI can detect and which cell types may be distinguishable.
  This work provides essential benchmarks for grey matter research, offering new guidelines on linking neuroimaging measurements to neurobiology. These reference values will be a valuable resource for neuroscientists and neuroimaging researchers, aiding in the interpretation of imaging data and the refinement of brain tissue models.</description>

      <title>Inhibition of bacterial growth by antibiotics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02944v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Growth in bacterial populations generally depends on the environment (availability and quality of nutrients, presence of a toxic inhibitor, product inhibition..). Here, we build a general model to describe the action of a bacteriostatic antibiotic, assuming that this drug inhibits essential autocatalytic cycles involved in the cell metabolism. The model can describe various types of antibiotics and confirms the existence of two distinct regimes of growth-dependent susceptibility, previously identified only for ribosome targeting antibiotics. Interestingly, below a certain threshold, a coexistence of two values of the growth rate is possible, which has also been observed experimentally.</description>

      <title>Static Three-Dimensional Structures Determine Fast Dynamics Between Distal Loci Pairs in Interphase Chromosomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Live cell imaging experiments have shown that, although eukaryotic chromosomes are compact, the distal dynamics between enhancers and promoters are unexpectedly rapid and cannot be explained by standard polymer models. The discordance between the compact static chromatin organization (structure) and the relaxation times (dynamics) is a conundrum that violates the expected structure-function relationship. To resolve the puzzle, we developed a theory to predict chromatin dynamics by first calculating the accurate three-dimensional (3D) structure using static Hi-C contact maps or fixed-cell imaging data. The calculated 3D coordinates are used to accurately forecast the two-point dynamics reported in recent experiments that simultaneously monitor chromatin dynamics and transcription. Strikingly, the theory not only predicts the observed fast enhancer-promoter dynamics but also reveals a novel scaling relationship between two-point relaxation time and genomic separation that is in near quantitative agreement with recent experiments. The theory also predicts that cohesin depletion speeds up the dynamics between distal loci. Both the rapid dynamics between distal loci pairs in interphase chromosomes and the acceleration of chromatin loci diffusion upon cohesin depletion are explained in terms of structure-based centrality measure used in graph theory. Our framework shows that chromatin dynamics can be predicted based solely on static experimental data, reinforcing the concept that the three-dimensional structure determines their dynamic behavior. The generality of the theory opens new avenues for exploring chromatin dynamics, especially transcriptional dynamics, across different biological contexts.</description>

      <title>Token-driven totally asymmetric simple exclusion process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.13558v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a family of totally asymmetric simple exclusion processes (TASEPs), consisting of particles on a lattice that require binding by a "token" in various physical configurations to advance over the lattice. Using a combination of theory and simulations, we address the following questions: (i) How token binding kinetics affects the current-density relation on the lattice; (ii) How this current-density relation depends on the scarcity of tokens; (iii) How tokens propagate the effects of the locally-imposed disorder (such as a slow site) over the entire lattice; (iv) How a shared pool of tokens couples concurrent TASEPs running on multiple lattices; (v) How our results translate to TASEPs with open boundaries that exchange particles with the reservoir. Since real particle motion (including in biological systems that inspired the standard TASEP model, e.g., protein synthesis or movement of molecular motors) is often catalyzed, regulated, actuated, or otherwise mediated, the token-driven TASEP dynamics analyzed in this paper should allow for a better understanding of real systems and enable a closer match between TASEP theory and experimental observations.</description>

      <title>A Lyapunov theory demonstrating a fundamental limit on the speed of systems consolidation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nervous system reorganizes memories from an early site to a late site, a commonly observed feature of learning and memory systems known as systems consolidation. Previous work has suggested learning rules by which consolidation may occur. Here, we provide conditions under which such rules are guaranteed to lead to stable convergence of learning and consolidation. We use the theory of Lyapunov functions, which enforces stability by requiring learning rules to decrease an energy-like (Lyapunov) function. We present the theory in the context of a simple circuit architecture motivated by classic models of learning in systems consolidation mediated by the cerebellum. Stability is only guaranteed if the learning rate in the late stage is not faster than the learning rate in the early stage. Further, the slower the learning rate at the late stage, the larger the perturbation the system can tolerate with a guarantee of stability. We provide intuition for this result by mapping the consolidation model to a damped driven oscillator system, and showing that the ratio of early- to late-stage learning rates in the consolidation model can be directly identified with the (square of the) oscillator's damping ratio. This work suggests the power of the Lyapunov approach to provide constraints on nervous system function.</description>

      <title>Fluidization and anomalous density fluctuations in 2D Voronoi cell tissues with pulsating activity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02981v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cells not only can be motile by crawling but are also capable of non-motility active motions like periodic contraction or pulsation. In this work, based on a Voronoi cell model, we show how this non-motility activity affects the structure, dynamic and density fluctuations of cellular monolayers. Our model shows that random cell pulsation fluidizes solid epithelial tissues into a hyperuniform fluid state, while pulsation synchronization inhibits the fluidity and causes a reverse solidification. Our results indicate this solidification is a BKT-type transition, characterized by strong density/dynamic heterogeneity arising from the annihilation of topological defects in the pulsating phase space. The magnitude and length scale of density heterogeneity diverge with the pulsating period, resulting in an opposite giant density fluctuation or anti-hyperuniformity. We propose a fluctuating hydrodynamic theory that can unify the two opposite anomalous fluctuation phenomena. Our findings can help to understand recent experimental observations in MDCK monolayer.</description>

      <title>Motility-induced mixing transition in exponentially growing multicellular spheroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Growth drives cellular dynamics in dense aggregates including bacterial colonies, developing tissues, and tumors. We investigate the underlying physical principles emerging from the interplay of growth, steric repulsion, and motility in a minimal agent-based model of exponentially growing, three-dimensional spheroids. Our results reveal a motility-induced mixing transition: Without motility, deterministic radial motion from volume expansion dominates, while growth and division cause tangential, cellular-scale diffusion, largely independent of expansion velocity. Despite this small-scale diffusion, cell lineages remain confined to their local environment. This confinement persists at weak motility and is overcome only above a threshold, leading to tangential superdiffusivity and global cell mixing with a diverging timescale near the transition, reminiscent of glassy dynamics. Using a phenomenological model, we identify two effects governing this transition: Steric interactions that suppress motility-induced velocity below a threshold, and the expanding nature of the system which inhibits complete mixing. Our study highlights the complex interaction of local cell division and motility with global expansion, mediated exclusively by mechanics. The results provide a baseline for identifying additional biological mechanisms in experiments, for example in tissue spheroids. The mixing dynamics might also be relevant for competition or tumor progression by interacting with genetic heterogeneity.</description>
