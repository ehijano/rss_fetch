      <title>Exploring Unknown Social Networks for Discovering Hidden Nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of discovering hidden nodes in unknown social networks, formulating three types of hidden-node discovery problems, namely, Sybil-node discovery, peripheral-node discovery, and influencer discovery. We tackle these problems by employing a graph exploration framework grounded in machine learning. Leveraging the structure of the subgraph gradually obtained from graph exploration, we construct prediction models to identify target hidden nodes in unknown social graphs. Through empirical investigations of real social graphs, we investigate the efficiency of graph exploration strategies in uncovering hidden nodes. Our results show that our graph exploration strategies discover hidden nodes with an efficiency comparable to that when the graph structure is known. Specifically, the query cost of discovering 10% of the hidden nodes is at most only 1.2 times that when the topology is known, and the query-cost multiplier for discovering 90% of the hidden nodes is at most only 1.4. Furthermore, our results suggest that using node embeddings, which are low-dimensional vector representations of nodes, for hidden-node discovery is a double-edged sword: it is effective in certain scenarios but sometimes degrades the efficiency of node discovery. Guided by this observation, we examine the effectiveness of using a bandit algorithm to combine the prediction models that use node embeddings with those that do not, and our analysis shows that the bandit-based graph exploration strategy achieves efficient node discovery across a wide array of settings.</description>

      <title>Multi-Platform Aggregated Dataset of Online Communities (MADOC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Multi-platform Aggregated Dataset of Online Communities (MADOC) is a comprehensive dataset that facilitates computational social science research by providing FAIR-compliant standardized access to cross-platform analysis of online social dynamics. MADOC aggregates and standardizes data from Bluesky, Koo, Reddit, and Voat (2012-2024), containing 18.9 million posts, 236 million comments, and 23.1 million unique users. The dataset enables comparative studies of toxic behavior evolution across platforms through standardized interaction records and sentiment analysis. By providing UUID-anonymized user histories and temporal alignment of banned communities' activity patterns, MADOC supports research on content moderation impacts and platform migration trends. Distributed via Zenodo with persistent identifiers and Python/R toolkits, the dataset adheres to FAIR principles while addressing post-API-era research challenges through ethical aggregation of public social media archives.</description>

      <title>Less is More: Simple yet Effective Heuristic Community Detection with Graph Convolution Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community detection is crucial in data mining. Traditional methods primarily focus on graph structure, often neglecting the significance of attribute features. In contrast, deep learning-based approaches incorporate attribute features and local structural information through contrastive learning, improving detection performance. However, existing algorithms' complex design and joint optimization make them difficult to train and reduce detection efficiency. Additionally, these methods require the number of communities to be predefined, making the results susceptible to artificial interference. To address these challenges, we propose a simple yet effective community detection algorithm that can adaptively detect communities without relying on data augmentation and contrastive optimization. The proposed algorithm first performs community pre-detection to extract global structural information adaptively. It then utilizes GCN to integrate local structures and attribute features. Subsequently, it combines global, local structures and attribute features in the feature space to discover community affiliations. Finally, a modularity maximization method is employed to optimize the communities based on these three types of information, thereby uncovering the community affiliation of each node. We conduct experimental comparisons across various graph datasets, evaluating the proposed algorithm against traditional methods and state-of-the-art community detection algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm achieves greater efficiency and accuracy in terms of both detection speed and effectiveness.

      <title>Paper Quality Assessment based on Individual Wisdom Metrics from Open Peer Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a data-driven framework for enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of scientific peer review through an open, bottom-up process that estimates reviewer quality. Traditional closed peer review systems, while essential for quality control, are often slow, costly, and subject to biases that can impede scientific progress. Here, we introduce a method that evaluates individual reviewer reliability by quantifying agreement with community consensus scores and applying Bayesian weighting to refine paper quality assessments. We analyze open peer review data from two major scientific conferences, and demonstrate that reviewer-specific quality scores significantly improve the reliability of paper quality estimation. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that reviewer quality scores are unrelated to authorship quality. Our model incorporates incentive structures to recognize high-quality reviewers and encourage broader coverage of submitted papers, thereby mitigating the common "rich-get-richer" pitfall of social media. These findings suggest that open peer review, with mechanisms for estimating and incentivizing reviewer quality, offers a scalable and equitable alternative for scientific publishing, with potential to enhance the speed, fairness, and transparency of the peer review process.</description>

      <title>Systematic comparison of gender inequality in scientific rankings across disciplines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The participation of women in academia has increased in the last few decades across many fields (e.g., Computer Science, History, Medicine). However, this increase in the participation of women has not been the same at all career stages. Here, we study how gender participation within different fields is related to gender representation in top-ranking positions in productivity (number of papers), research impact (number of citations), and co-authorship networks (degree of connectivity). We analyzed over 80 million papers published from 1975 to 2020 in 19 academic fields. Our findings reveal that women remain a minority in all 19 fields, with physics, geology, and mathematics having the lowest percentage of papers authored by women at 14% and psychology having the largest percentage at 39%. Women are significantly underrepresented in top-ranking positions (top 10% or higher) across all fields and metrics (productivity, citations, and degree), indicating that it remains challenging for early researchers (especially women) to reach top-ranking positions, as our results reveal the rankings to be rigid over time. Finally, we show that in most fields, women and men with comparable productivity levels and career age tend to attain different levels of citations, where women tend to benefit more from co-authorships, while men tend to benefit more from productivity, especially in pSTEMs. Our findings highlight that while the participation of women has risen in some fields, they remain under-represented in top-ranking positions. Greater gender participation at entry levels often helps representation, but stronger interventions are still needed to achieve long-lasting careers for women and their participation in top-ranking positions.</description>

      <title>Information Design for Adaptive Organizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the optimal design of information sharing in organizations. Organizational performance depends on agents adapting to uncertain external environments while coordinating their actions, where coordination incentives and synergies are modeled as graphs (networks). The equilibrium strategies and the principal's objective function are summarized using Laplacian matrices of these graphs. I formulate a Bayesian persuasion problem to determine the optimal public signal and show that it comprises a set of statistics on local states, necessarily including their average, which serves as the organizational goal. When the principal benefits equally from the coordination of any two agents, the choice of disclosed statistics is based on the Laplacian eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the incentive graph. The algebraic connectivity (the second smallest Laplacian eigenvalue) determines the condition for full revelation, while the Laplacian spectral radius (the largest Laplacian eigenvalue) establishes the condition for minimum transparency, where only the average state is disclosed.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Social Networks: Lessons from Bluesky Starter Packs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microblogging is a crucial mode of online communication. However, launching a new microblogging platform remains challenging, largely due to network effects. This has resulted in entrenched (and undesirable) dominance by established players, such as X/Twitter. To overcome these network effects, Bluesky, an emerging microblogging platform, introduced starter packs -- curated lists of accounts that users can follow with a single click. We ask if starter packs have the potential to tackle the critical problem of social bootstrapping in new online social networks? This paper is the first to address this question: we asses whether starter packs have been indeed helpful in supporting Bluesky growth. Our dataset includes $25.05 \times 10^6$ users and $335.42 \times 10^3$ starter packs with $1.73 \times 10^6$ members, covering the entire lifecycle of Bluesky. We study the usage of these starter packs, their ability to drive network and activity growth, and their potential downsides. We also quantify the benefits of starter packs for members and creators on user visibility and activity while identifying potential challenges. By evaluating starter packs' effectiveness and limitations, we contribute to the broader discourse on platform growth strategies and competitive innovation in the social media landscape.</description>

      <title>Detecting Structural Shifts in Multivariate Hawkes Processes with Fr\'echet Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06769v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new approach for change point detection in multivariate Hawkes processes using Fr\'echet statistic of a network. The method splits the point process into overlapping windows, estimates kernel matrices in each window, and reconstructs the signed Laplacians by treating the kernel matrices as the adjacency matrices of the causal network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on both simulated and cryptocurrency datasets. Our results show that our method is capable of accurately detecting and characterizing changes in the causal structure of multivariate Hawkes processes, and may have potential applications in fields such as finance and neuroscience. The proposed method is an extension of previous work on Fr\'echet statistics in point process settings and represents an important contribution to the field of change point detection in multivariate point processes.</description>

      <title>Kaleidoscopic reorganization of network communities across different scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18665v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of structural heterogeneity is pervasive in real networks, and their community organization is no exception. Still, a vast majority of community detection methods assume neatly hierarchically organized communities of a characteristic scale for a given hierarchical level. In this work, we demonstrate that the reality of scale-dependent community reorganization is convoluted with simultaneous processes of community splitting and merging, challenging the conventional understanding of community-scale adjustment. We provide a mathematical argument concerning the modularity function, the results from real-network analysis, and a simple network model for a comprehensive understanding of the nontrivial community reorganization process. The reorganization is characterized by a local drop in the number of communities as the resolution parameter varies. This study suggests a need for a paradigm shift in the study of network communities, which emphasizes the importance of considering scale-dependent reorganization to better understand the genuine structural organization of networks.</description>
