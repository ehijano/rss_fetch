      <title>Heisenberg's S-matrix program and Feynman's divergence problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present article, we assume that the first approximation of the scattering operator is given and that it has the logarithmic divergence. This first approximation allows us to construct the so called deviation factor. Using the deviation factor, we regularize all terms of the scattering operator's approximations. The infrared and ultraviolet cases as well as concrete examples are considered. Thus, for a wide range of cases, we provide a positive answer to the well-known problem of J. R. Oppenheimer regarding scattering operators in QED: ``Can the procedure be freed of the expansion in $\varepsilon$ and carried out rigorously?"</description>

      <title>Isomorphisms of $\Spin\left( \frac{1}{2}\right) $ to $\SU(1,1)-\mbox{Boson}$: Universal Enveloping and Kangni-type Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study we investigate the nexus between the $\Spin (\frac12)$ and the $\SU(1,1)$-quasi boson Lie structure and reveal related properties as well as some decomposition of spin particles. We show that the $\SU(1,1)$-quasi boson has a left invariant Haar measure and we ascertain its spherical Fourier transformation. We finally show that this spherical Fourier transformation of type delta is a Kangni-type transform when the Planck's constant, $\hbar=1$.</description>

Abstract: We study the behavior of a probability measure near the bottom of its support in terms of time averaged quotients of its Laplace transform. We discuss how our results are connected to both rank-one perturbation theory as well as renewal theory. We further apply our results in order to derive criteria for the existence and non-existence of ground states for a finite dimensional quantum system coupled to a bosonic field.</description>

      <title>Boltzmann-Grad limit for the inelastic Lorentz gas: Part I. Existence, uniqueness, and rigorous derivation via weak convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a rigorous derivation of the inelastic linear Boltzmann equation, in the Boltzmann-Grad limit, from a dissipative, random, Lorentz gas in arbitrary dimensions d $\geq$ 2. Specifically, we consider a microscopic particle system where scatterers are randomly distributed according to a Poisson process, and a tagged light particle undergoes inelastic collisions with the scatterers following a reflection law characterized by a fixed restitution coefficient. We establish the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions to the inelastic linear Boltzmann equation within the class of non-negative Radon measures, assuming that the initial data has a finite exponential moment. We first show that the forward dynamics of the dissipative particle system is globally defined almost surely and then prove the weak$-*$ convergence of the microscopic solution towards the weak solutions of the inelastic linear Boltzmann equation, providing an explicit rate of convergence. Furthermore, under the same initial data assumptions, we prove the existence of strong solutions to the inelastic linear Boltzmann equation, constructed via a series representation of the solutions.</description>

      <title>Automorphisms with growing generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove global existence and uniqueness of Heisenberg dynamics on the quasi-local algebra of an extended quantum lattice system for spatially growing generators. Existing results assume that the local terms of the generator decay fast enough and are bounded uniformly in space and time. We show, in analogy to global existence results for first order ODEs, that global existence and uniqueness still hold true if the local terms grow at most linearly in space. Moreover, we obtain Lieb-Robinson bounds with exponential light cones for the generated dynamics.
  For the proof, we mainly assume Lieb-Robinson bounds with linear light cones for dynamics generated by uniformly bounded local terms. These are known to hold for example if the local terms are exponentially localized.</description>

      <title>A novel linear transport model with distinct scattering mechanisms for direction and speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel linear transport equation that models the evolution of a one-particle distribution subject to free transport and two distinct scattering mechanisms: one affecting the particle's speed and the other its direction. These scattering processes occur at different time scales and with different intensities, leading to a kinetic equation where the total scattering operator is the sum of two separate operators. Each of them depends not only on the kernel characterizing the corresponding scattering mechanism, but also explicitly on the marginal distribution of either the speed or the direction. Therefore, unlike classical settings, the gain terms in our operators are not tied to a fixed equilibrium distribution but evolve in time through the marginals. As a result, typical analytical tools from kinetic theory, such as equilibrium characterization, entropy methods, spectral analysis in Hilbert spaces, and Fredholm theory, are not applicable in a standard fashion. In this work, we rigorously analyze the properties of this new class of scattering operators, including the structure of their non-standard pseudo-inverses and their asymptotic behavior. We also derive macroscopic (hydrodynamic) limits under different regimes of scattering frequencies, revealing new effective equations and highlighting the interplay between speed and directional relaxation.</description>

      <title>Conrol-Translated Finsler-type structure and Anisotropic Ginzbor-Landau models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a geometric and analytical extension of the Finsler--Ginzburg--Landau framework by introducing a distributed control field acting as a translation in the tangent bundle. Within this formulation, the classical Tonelli Lagrangian is deformed into a control--translated Finsler structure, whose Legendre dual induces a uniformly elliptic operator and a convex energy functional preserving the essential variational features of the anisotropic model. This approach provides a rigorous analytical setting for coupling external control fields with the intrinsic Finsler geometry of anisotropic superconductors. The study establishes the convexity, coercivity, and regularity properties of the induced energy functional and proves the existence of controlled minimizers through variational arguments on admissible configurations. In the asymptotic regime as the Ginzburg--Landau parameter tends to zero, a detailed $\Gamma$--convergence analysis yields a renormalized energy $W_u$ governing vortex interactions under control translation, quantifying the modification of the Green kernel and the self-energy due to the field $u(x)$. The results demonstrate that the control translation preserves the underlying Finsler structure while introducing a new geometric degree of freedom for manipulating and stabilizing vortex configurations.</description>

      <title>Curvature Decay and the Spectrum of the Non-Abelian Laplacian on $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I study the spectral behavior of the covariant Laplacian $\Delta_A = d_A^* d_A$ associated with smooth $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ connections on $\mathbb{R}^3$. The main result establishes a sharp threshold for the pointwise decay of curvature governing the essential spectrum of $\Delta_A$. Specifically, if the curvature satisfies the bound $|F_A(x)| \le C(1 + |x|)^{-3-\varepsilon}$ for some $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, then $\Delta_A$ is a relatively compact perturbation of the flat Laplacian and hence $\sigma_{\mathrm{ess}}(\Delta_A) = [0,\infty)$. At the critical decay rate $|F_A(x)| \sim |x|^{-3}$, I construct a smooth connection for which $0 \in \sigma_{\mathrm{ess}}(\Delta_A)$, showing that the threshold is sharp. Moreover, a genuinely non-Abelian example based on the hedgehog ansatz is given to demonstrate that the commutator term $A \wedge A$ contributes at the same order. This work identifies the exact decay rate separating stable preservation of the essential spectrum from the onset of delocalized modes in the non-Abelian setting, providing a counterpart to classical results on magnetic Schr\"odinger operators.</description>

      <title>Momentum Distribution of a Fermi Gas with Coulomb Interaction in the Random Phase Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the momentum distribution of a three-dimensional Fermi gas in the mean-field scaling regime in a trial state that was recently proven to reproduce the Gell-Mann-Brueckner correlation energy for Coulomb potentials. For a class of potentials including the Coulomb potential we show that the momentum distribution is given by a step profile corrected by a random phase approximation contribution as predicted by Daniel and Vosko. Moreover, for potentials with summable Fourier transform we provide optimal error bounds for the deviation from the random phase approximation. This refines a recent analysis by two of the authors to the physically most relevant potentials and to momenta closer to the Fermi surface.</description>

      <title>Exact solutions of the reverse space-time higher-order modified self-steepening nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a reverse space-time higher-order modified self-steepening nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, which distinguishes its standard local counterparts through the reverse space-time symmetry. The integrability of this nonlocal equation is rigorously verified by presenting its associated Lax pair and infinitely many conservation laws. Utilizing the Darboux transformation, we systematically construct a diverse range of localized wave solutions on both zero and nonzero backgrounds. These patterns, such as kinks, exponentially decaying solitons, asymmetric rogue waves and their interaction solutions, exhibit novel dynamical behaviors that are not found in the local counterparts. This work not only enriches the family of solutions for the equation, but also highlights the effectiveness of the Darboux transformation in exploring nonlinear wave dynamics in nonlocal systems.</description>

      <title>The global well-posedness for the Q-tensor model of nematic liquid crystals in the half-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03309v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Q-tensor model of nematic liquid crystals, which couples the Navier-Stokes equations with a parabolic-type equation describing the evolution of the directions of the anisotropic molecules, in the half-space. The aim of this paper is to prove the global well-posedness for the Q-tensor model in the $L_p$-$L_q$ framework. Our proof is based on the Banach fixed point argument. To control the higher-order terms of the solutions, we prove the weighted estimates of the solutions for the linearized problem by the maximal $L_p$-$L_q$ regularity. On the other hand, the estimates for the lower-order terms are obtained by the analytic semigroup theory. Here, the maximal $L_p$-$L_q$ regularity and the generation of an analytic semigroup are provided by the R-solvability for the resolvent problem arising from the Q-tensor model. It seems to be the first result to discuss the unique existence of a global-in-time solution for the Q-tensor model in the half-space.</description>

      <title>Heat Kernels and Resummations: the Spinor Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among the available perturbative approaches in quantum field theory, heat kernel techniques provide a powerful and geometrically transparent framework for computing effective actions in nontrivial backgrounds. In this work, resummation patterns within the heat kernel expansion are examined as a means of systematically extracting nonperturbative information. Building upon previous results for Yukawa interactions and scalar quantum electrodynamics, we extend the analysis to spinor fields, demonstrating that a recently conjectured resummation structure continues to hold. The resulting formulation yields a compact expression that resums invariants constructed from the electromagnetic tensor and its spinorial couplings, while preserving agreement with known proper-time coefficients. Beyond its immediate computational utility, the framework offers a unified perspective on the emergence of nonperturbative effects (such as Schwinger pair creation) in relation to perturbative heat kernel data, and provides a basis for future extensions to curved spacetimes and non-Abelian gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Introduction to the theory of mixing for incompressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In these lecture notes, we provide a pedagogical introduction to the theory of mixing for incompressible flows from a PDE perspective. We discuss both the Lagrangian (ODE) and Eulerian (PDE, continuity equation) viewpoints, and introduce suitable notions of mixing scales that quantify the degree to which a scalar field transported by a velocity field becomes mixed. We then address the problem of establishing universal lower bounds on the time evolution of the mixing scale. This is first done in the smooth setting, using energy estimates and flow-based arguments, and later in the Sobolev setting, relying on quantitative estimates for regular Lagrangian flows. Finally, we present recent results concerning the sharpness of these lower bounds, their implications for the geometry and regularity of regular Lagrangian flows, and connections with more recent developments in the literature.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: G\'erard and Grellier proposed, under the name of the cubic Szeg\H{o} equation, a remarkable classical field theory on a circle with a quartic Hamiltonian. The Lax integrability structure that emerges from their definition is so constraining that it allows for writing down an explicit general solution for prescribed initial data, and at the same time, the dynamics is highly nontrivial and involves turbulent energy transfer to arbitrarily short wavelengths. The quantum version of the same Hamiltonian is even more striking: not only the Hamiltonian itself, but also its associated conserved hierarchies display purely integer spectra, indicating a structure beyond ordinary quantum integrability. Here, we initiate a systematic study of this quantum system by presenting a mixture of analytic results and empirical observations on the structure of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, conservation laws, ladder operators, etc.</description>

      <title>Dimensional reduction for anyons in the average-field approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study abelian anyons at the mean-field/almost-bosonic level, whose dynamics are governed by the Chern-Simons-Schr\"odinger system. We consider the dimensional reduction of this 2D model by introducing an anisotropic trapping potential, and derive an effective 1D model after tracing out the tight confinement direction. The resulting effective dynamics in the loose confinement direction is captured by a quintic defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. We rigorously establish this dimensional reduction process in the sense of ground state energies and time-dependent solutions, under an $H^2$ well-posedness assumption.</description>

      <title>A Rernomalisation Group Map for Short- and Long-ranged Weakly Coupled $|\varphi|^4$ Models in $d \ge 4$ at and Above the Critical Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we construct and analyse a renormalisation group (RG) map for the weakly coupled $n$-component $|\varphi|^4$ model under periodic boundary conditions in dimension $d \ge 4$. Both short-range and long-range interactions with upper critical dimension four are considered. This extends and refines the RG map constructed by Bauerschmidt, Brydges and Slade for the short-range model at $d=4$. This extension opens the door to establishing the exact decay rate of correlation functions of all of the models discussed. Furthermore, incorporating a large-field decay estimate and comparing with the finite-size scaling results of Michta, Park, and Slade, our analysis provides strong evidence for the emergence of a plateau in systems of finite volume with periodic boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>The Converse Madelung Question</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We pose the converse Madelung question: not whether Fisher information can reproduce quantum mechanics, but whether it is necessary. We work with minimal, physically motivated axioms on density and phase: locality, probability conservation, Euclidean invariance with a global phase symmetry, reversibility, and convex regularity. Within the resulting class of first order local Hamiltonian field theories, these axioms single out the canonical Poisson bracket on density and phase under the Dubrovin and Novikov assumptions for local hydrodynamic brackets. Using a pointwise, gauge covariant complex change of variables that maps density and phase to a single complex field, we show that the only convex, rotationally invariant, first derivative local functional of the density whose Euler Lagrange term yields a reversible completion that is exactly projectively linear is the Fisher functional. When its coefficient equals Planck constant squared divided by twice the mass, the dynamics reduce to the linear Schrodinger equation. For many body systems, a single local complex structure across sectors enforces the same relation species by species, fixing a single Planck constant. Galilean covariance appears through the Bargmann central extension, with the usual superselection consequences. Comparison with the Doebner and Goldin family identifies the reversible zero diffusion corner with linear Schrodinger dynamics. We provide operational falsifiers via residual diagnostics for the continuity and Hamilton Jacobi equations and report numerical minima at the Fisher scale that are invariant under Galilean boosts. In this setting, quantum mechanics emerges as a reversible fixed point of Fisher regularised information hydrodynamics. A code archive enables direct numerical checks, including a superposition stress test that preserves exact projective linearity within our axioms.</description>

      <title>Blossoming bijection for bipartite maps: a new approach via orientations and applications to the Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03680v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a new bijective framework for the enumeration of bipartite planar maps with control on the degree distribution of black and white vertices. Our approach builds on the blossoming-tree paradigm, introducing a family of orientations on bipartite maps that extends Eulerian and quasi-Eulerian orientations and connects the bijection of Bousquet-M\'elou and Schaeffer to the general scheme of Albenque and Poulalhon. This enables us to generalize the Bousquet-M\'elou and Schaeffer's bijection to several families of bipartite maps.
  As an application, we also derive a rational and Lagrangian parametrization with positive integer coefficients for the generating series of quartic maps equipped with an Ising model, which is key to the probabilistic study of these maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03688v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Ising model with an external magnetic field on random tetravalent planar maps and investigate its critical behavior. Explicit expressions for spontaneous magnetization and the susceptibility are computed and the critical exponents $\alpha=-1$ (third order phase transition), $\beta=\frac{1}{2}$ (spontaneous magnetization), $\gamma=2$ (susceptibility at zero external magnetic field) and $\delta=5$ (magnetization at critical temperature) are derived. To do so, we study the asymptotic behavior of the partition function of the model in the case of a weak external magnetic field using analytic combinatorics.</description>

Abstract: We introduce and investigate a family of tau-functions of the 2D Toda hierarchy, which is a natural generalization of the hypergeometric family associated with Hurwitz numbers. For this family we prove a skew Schur function expansion formula. For arbitrary rational weight generating functions we construct the multi-matrix models. Two different types of cut-and-join descriptions are derived. Considered examples include generalized fully simple maps, which we identify with the recently introduced skew hypergeometric tau-functions.</description>

      <title>Variational closures for composite homogenised fluid flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10408v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Homogenisation theory has seen recent applications in deriving stochastic transport models for fluid dynamics. In this work, we first derive the stochastic Lagrange-to-Euler map that underpins stochastic transport noise in fluid dynamics as the homogenisation limit of a parameterised flow map decomposing into rapidly fluctuating and slow components. Specifically, we prove convergence of this parameterised flow map to a scale-separated limit under the assumptions of a weak invariance principle for the rapidly fluctuating component and path continuity for the slow component. In this limit, the rapidly fluctuating component converges to a stochastic flow of diffeomorphisms that transforms the full flow dynamics into an SDE-governed stochastic flow through composition, while the slow component requires closure.
  Our second contribution formulates two distinct variational closures for the slow component of the homogenised flow that exploit the composite structure of the stochastic flow. For the first closure, the critical points of a new variational principle satisfy a system of random-coefficient PDEs, which can be transformed into a system of stochastic PDEs via the coadjoint action of the stochastic flow map obtained from homogenising the fluctuating component. We show that these equations coincide with the stochastic Euler-Poincar\'e equations previously derived in Holm, Proc. Royal Soc. (2015). For the second closure, we modify the assumptions on the slow component and the associated variational principle to derive averaged models inspired by previous work on mean flow dynamics such as the Generalised Lagrangian Mean.</description>

      <title>Analysis of quantities determining the critical inverse temperature in the annealed Potts model with Pareto vertex weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider in this work the crucial quantity $t_c$ that determines the critical inverse temperature $\beta_c$ in the $q$-state Potts model on sparse rank-1 random graphs where the vertices are equipped with a Pareto weight density $(\tau-1)\,w^{-\tau}\,{\cal X}_{[1,\infty)}(w)$. It is shown in \cite{ref1} that this $t_c$ is the unique positive zero of a function ${\cal K}$ that is obtained by an appropriate combination of the stationarity condition and the criticality condition for the case the external field $B$ equals 0 and that $q\geq3$ and $\tau\geq4$, see \cite{ref1}, Theorem~1.14 and Theorem ~1.21 and their proofs in \cite{ref1}, Section~7.1 and Section~7.3. From the proof of \cite{ref1}, Theorem~1.14, it is seen that ${\cal K}'$ and ${\cal K}''$ also have a unique positive zero, $t_c'$ and $t_c''$, respectively, and $t_c'=t_b$ and $t_c''=t_{\ast}$, where $t_b$ and $t_{\ast}$ are the unique positive zeros of ${\cal F}_0(t)-t\,{\cal F}_0'(t)$ and ${\cal F}_0''(t)$, respectively. Here, ${\cal F}_0(t)=E\,[W(e^{tW}-1)/(E\,[W]\,(e^{tW}+q-1))]$, and $t_c$, $t_b$ and $t_{\ast}$ play a key role in the graphical analysis of \cite{ref1}, Section~5.1 and Figure~1. Furthermore, $\gamma_c=\exp(\beta_c)-1$ and $t_c$ are related according to $\gamma_c=t_c/{\cal F}_0(t_c)$.
  We analyse $t_c$, $t_c'$ and $t_c''$ for general real $\tau\geq4$ and general real $q&gt;2$ by an appropriate formulation of their defining equations ${\cal K}(t_c)={\cal K}'(t_c')={\cal K}''(t_c'')=0$. Thus we find, along with the inequality $0&lt;t_c''&lt;t_c'&lt;t_c&lt;\infty$, the simple upper bounds $t_c&lt;2\,{\rm ln}(q-1)$, $t_c'&lt;\frac32\,{\rm ln}(q-1)$, $t_c''&lt;{\rm ln}(q-1)$, as well as certain sharpenings of these simple bounds and counterparts about the large-$q$ behaviour of $t_c$, $t_c$ and $t_c''$. We show that these bounds are sharp in the sense that they hold with equality for the limiting homogeneous case $\tau\to\infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a Finsler Ginzburg--Landau framework for the analysis of vortex interactions in anisotropic superconductors. Within this setting, the Finsler structure encodes directional dependence of the condensate energy, yielding a renormalized energy W_F that governs both equilibrium and dynamics of vortices. We derive the Gamma--limit, establish the analytical structure and stability of W_F, and show that vortex motion follows a Finsler gradient flow exhibiting anisotropic dissipation and drift. This approach provides a unified geometric and physical model for anisotropic superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Stabilization of Nitsche's Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The weak imposition of essential boundary conditions is an integral aspect of unfitted finite element methods, where the physical boundary does not in general coincide with the computational domain. In this regard, the symmetric Nitsche's method is a powerful technique that preserves the symmetry and variational consistency of the unmodified weak formulation. The stabilization parameter in Nitsche's method plays a crucial role in the stability of the resultant formulation, whose estimation is computationally intensive and dependent on the particular cut configuration using the conventional eigenvalue-based approach. In this work, we employ as model problem the finite cell method in which the need for the generation of a boundary-conforming mesh is circumvented by embedding the physical domain in a, typically regular, background mesh. We propose a data-driven estimate based on machine learning methods for the estimation of the stabilization parameter in Nitsche's method that offers an efficient constant-complexity alternative to the eigenvalue-based approach independent of the cut configuration. It is shown, using numerical benchmarks, that the proposed method can estimate the stabilization parameter accurately and is by far more computationally efficient. The data-driven estimate can be integrated into existing numerical codes with minimal modifications and thanks to the wide adoption of accelerators such as GPUs by machine learning frameworks, can be used with virtually no extra implementation cost on GPU devices, further increasing the potential for computational gains over the conventional eigenvalue-based estimate. The proposed model is tested on both Intel CPU as well as NVIDIA GPU hardware, showing that while it is already many times more efficient on the CPU compared to the eigenvalue-based estimate, its efficiency margin is even larger on modern GPU devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14414v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we develop the generalised Schur theory offered in the recent paper by the second author in dimension one case, and apply it to obtain a new explicit parametrisation of torsion free rank one sheaves on projective irreducible curves with vanishing cohomology groups.
  This parametrisation is obtained with the help of normal forms - a notion we introduce in this paper. Namely, considering the ring of ordinary differential operators $D_1=K[[x]][\partial ]$ as a subring of a certain complete non-commutative ring $\hat{D}_1^{sym}$, the normal forms of differential operators mentioned here are obtained after conjugation by some invertible operator ("Schur operator"), calculated using one of the operators in a ring. Normal forms of commuting operators are polynomials with constant coefficients in the differentiation, integration and shift operators, which have a restricted finite order in each variable, and can be effectively calculated for any given commuting operators.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Dynamics of Superparamagnetic Colloidal Microrobots with Tailored Statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13960v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Living organisms have developed advanced motion strategies for efficient space exploration, serving as inspiration for the movements of microrobots. These real-life strategies often involve anomalous dynamics displaying random movement patterns that deviate from Brownian motion. Despite their biological inspiration, autonomous stochastic navigation strategies of current microrobots remain much less versatile than those of their living counterparts. Supported by theoretical reasoning, this work demonstrates superparamagnetic colloidal microrobots with fully customizable stochastic dynamics displaying the entire spectrum of anomalous diffusion, from subdiffusion to superdiffusion, across statistically significant spatial and temporal scales (covering at least two decades). By simultaneously tuning microrobots' step-length distribution and, critically, their velocity autocorrelation function with magnetic fields, fundamental anomalous dynamics are reproduced with tailored properties mimicking L\'evy walks and fractional Brownian motion. These findings pave the way for programmable microrobotic systems that replicate optimal stochastic navigation strategies found in nature for applications in medical robotics and environmental remediation.</description>

      <title>Quantization of nonlinear non-Hamiltonian systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06939v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several important dynamical systems are in $\mathbb{R}^2$, defined by the pair of differential equations $(x',y')=(f(x,y),g(x,y))$. A question of fundamental importance is how such systems might behave quantum mechanically. In developing quantum theory, Dirac and others realized that classical Hamiltonian systems can be mapped to their quantum counterparts via canonical quantization. The resulting quantum dynamics is always physical, characterized by completely-positive and trace-preserving evolutions in the Schr\"{o}dinger picture. However, whether non-Hamiltonian systems can be quantized systematically while respecting the same physical requirements has remained a long-standing problem. Here we resolve this question when $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ are arbitrary polynomials. By leveraging open-systems theory, we prove constructively that every polynomial system admits a physical generator of time evolution in the form of a Lindbladian. We call our method cascade quantization, and demonstrate its power by analyzing several paradigmatic examples of nonlinear dynamics such as bifurcations, noise-activated spiking, and Li\'{e}nard systems. In effect, our method can quantize any classical system whose $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ are analytic with arbitrary precision. More importantly, cascade quantization is exact. This means restrictive system properties usually assumed in the literature to facilitate quantization, such as weak nonlinearity, rotational symmetry, or semiclassical dynamics, can all be dispensed with by cascade quantization. We also highlight the advantages of cascade quantization over existing proposals, by weighing it against examples from the variational paradigm using Lagrangians, as well as non-variational approaches.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional dynamics in low-dimensional networks</title>

Abstract: Many networks in nature and applications have an approximate low-rank structure in the sense that their connectivity structure is dominated by a few dimensions. It is natural to expect that dynamics on such networks would also be low-dimensional. Indeed, theoretical results show that low-rank networks produce low-dimensional dynamics whenever the network is isolated from external perturbations or input. However, networks in nature are rarely isolated. Here, we study the dimensionality of dynamics in recurrent networks with low-dimensional structure driven by high-dimensional inputs or perturbations. We find that dynamics in such networks can be high- or low-dimensional and we derive precise conditions on the network structure under which dynamics are high-dimensional. In many low-rank networks, dynamics are suppressed in directions aligned with the network's low-rank structure, a phenomenon we term ``low-rank suppression.'' We show that several low-rank network structures arising in nature satisfy the conditions for generating high-dimensional dynamics and low-rank suppression. Our results clarify important, but counterintuitive relationships between a recurrent network's connectivity structure and the structure of the dynamics it generates.</description>

      <title>Surmise for random matrices' level spacing distributions beyond nearest-neighbors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Correlations between energy levels can help distinguish whether a many-body system is of integrable or chaotic nature. The study of short-range and long-range spectral correlations generally involves quantities which are very different, unless one uses the $k$-th nearest neighbor ($k$NN) level spacing distributions. For nearest-neighbor (NN) spectral spacings, the distribution in random matrices is well captured by the Wigner surmise. This well-known approximation, derived exactly for a 2$\times$2 matrix, is simple and satisfactorily describes the NN spacings of larger matrices. There have been attempts in the literature to generalize Wigner's surmise to further away neighbors. However, as we show, the current proposal in the literature fails to accurately capture numerical data. Using the known variance of the distributions from random matrix theory, we propose a corrected surmise for the $k$NN spectral distributions. This surmise better characterizes spectral correlations while retaining the simplicity of Wigner's surmise. We test the predictions against numerical results and show that the corrected surmise is systematically more accurate at capturing data from random matrices. Using the XXZ spin chain with random on-site disorder, we illustrate how these results can be used as a refined probe of many-body quantum chaos for both short- and long-range spectral correlations.</description>

      <title>All fractional Shapiro steps in the RSJ model with two Josephson harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synchronization between the internal dynamics of the superconducting phase in a Josephson junction (JJ) and an external ac signal is a fundamental physical phenomenon, manifesting as constant-voltage Shapiro steps in the current-voltage characteristic. Mathematically, this phase-locking effect is captured by the Resistively Shunted Junction (RSJ) model, an important example of a nonlinear dynamical system. The standard RSJ model considers an overdamped JJ with a sinusoidal (single-harmonic) current-phase relation (CPR) in the current-driven regime with a monochromatic ac component. While this model predicts only integer Shapiro steps, the inclusion of higher Josephson harmonics is known to generate fractional Shapiro steps. In this paper, we show that only two Josephson harmonics in the CPR are sufficient to produce all possible fractional Shapiro steps within the RSJ framework. Using perturbative methods, we analyze the amplitudes of these fractional steps. Furthermore, by introducing a phase shift between the two Josephson harmonics, we reveal an asymmetry between positive and negative fractional steps - a signature of the Josephson diode effect.</description>

      <title>Darboux's Theorem in $p$-adic symplectic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15443v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime number. We derive an analog of Moser's Path Method for $p$-adic analytic manifolds and use it to prove a $p$-adic analog of Darboux's Theorem. Using it as a stepping stone we give a classification of second-countable $p$-adic analytic symplectic manifolds in terms of $p$-adic volume. This is a symplectic version of a classical result of Serre in $p$-adic analytic geometry from 1965. We also prove a $p$-adic version of Weinstein's generalization of Darboux's Theorem to neighborhoods of compact manifolds. Finally we find explicitly Darboux's coordinates for the physical models by Ablowitz-Ladik and Salerno of the Discrete Nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation.
  Symplectic geometry is deeply connected with classical and quantum mechanics, and a main motivation of this paper is to pursue a $p$-adic version of symplectic geometry following recent developments which incorporate the $p$-adic numbers into mathematical and theoretical physics.</description>

      <title>Flat connections at infinity on knot surgery manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $\rm SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ Chern-Simons theory on a closed 3-manifold is one of the most interesting, yet tractable examples of a QFT. On one hand, its non-perturbative structure is not yet fully understood; on the other, the mathematical structure turns out to be very rich. In this work we explore the new phenomenon of flat connections at infinity on various knot surgery manifolds. Such flat connections can be understood as asymptotic ends in the non-compact moduli space of flat $\rm SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ connections. We focus on the examples of $\pm 1/r$-surgeries on torus, twist and some double twist knot complements in $S^3$. Surprisingly, our findings suggest that flat connections at infinity are abundant even for simple low-crossing knot surgeries. We therefore believe that their presence would shed light on the resurgent nature of the path integral.</description>

      <title>Integrable Spherical Brane Model at Large $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study one of the simplest integrable two-dimensional quantum field theories with a boundary: $N$ free non-compact scalars in the bulk, constrained non-linearly on the boundary to lie on an $(N-1)$-sphere of radius $1/\sqrt{g}$. The $N=1$ case reduces to the single-channel Kondo problem, for $N=2$ the model describes dissipative Coulomb charging in quantum dots, and larger $N$ is analogous to higher-spin impurity or multi-channel scenarios. Adding a boundary magnetic field -- a linear boundary coupling to the scalars -- enriches the model's structure while preserving integrability. Lukyanov and Zamolodchikov (2004) conjectured an expansion for the boundary free energy on the infinite half-cylinder in powers of the magnetic field. Using large-$N$ saddle-point techniques, we confirm their conjecture to next-to-leading order in $1/N$. Renormalization of the subleading solution turns out to be highly instructive, and we connect it to the RG running of $g$ studied by Giombi and Khanchandani (2020).</description>

      <title>Chiral algebra, Wilson lines, and mixed Hodge structure of Coulomb branch</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find an intriguing relation between the chiral algebra and the mixed Hodge structure of the Coulomb branch of four dimensional $\mathcal{N} = 2$ superconformal field theories. We identify the space of irreducible characters of the $\mathcal{N} = 4$ $SU(N)$ chiral algebra $\mathbb{V}[\mathcal{T}_{SU(N)}]$ by analytically computing the Wilson line Schur index, and imposing modular invariance. We further establish a map from the $\mathbb{V}[\mathcal{T}_{SU(N)}]$ characters to the characters of the $\mathcal{T}_{p, N}$ chiral algebra. We extract the pure part of the mixed Hodge polynomial $PH_c$ of the Coulomb branch compactified on a circle, and prove that $PH_c$ encodes the representation theory of $\mathbb{V}[\mathcal{T}_{SU(N)}]$. We expect this to be a new entry of the 4D mirror symmetry framework.</description>

      <title>An efficient spectral Poisson solver for the nirvana-III code: the shearing-box case with vertical vacuum boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stability of a differentially rotating fluid subject to its own gravity is a problem with applications across wide areas of astrophysics--from protoplanetary discs (PPDs) to entire galaxies. The shearing box formalism offers a conceptually simple framework for studying differential rotation in the local approximation. Aimed at self-gravitating, and importantly, vertically stratified PPDs, we develop two novel methods for solving Poisson's equation in the framework of the shearing box with vertical vacuum boundary conditions (BCs). Both approaches naturally make use of multi-dimensional fast Fourier transforms for computational efficiency. While the first one exploits the linearity properties of the Poisson equation, the second, which is slightly more accurate, consists of finding the adequate discrete Green's function (in Fourier space) adapted to the problem at hand. To this end, we have revisited the method proposed by Vico et al. (2016) and have derived an analytical Green's function satisfying the shear-periodic BCs in the plane as well as vacuum BCs, vertically. Our spectral method demonstrates excellent accuracy, even with a modest number of grid points, and exhibits third-order convergence. It has been implemented in the NIRVANA-III code, where it exhibits good scalability up to 4096 CPU cores, consuming less than 6% of the total runtime. This was achieved through the use of P3DFFT, a fast Fourier Transform library that employs pencil decomposition, overcoming the scalability limitations inherent in libraries using slab decomposition. We have introduced two novel spectral Poisson solvers that guarantees high accuracy, performance, and intrinsically support vertical vacuum boundary conditions in the shearing-box framework. Our solvers enable high-resolution local studies involving self-gravity, such as MHD simulations of gravito-turbulence or gravitational fragmentation.</description>

      <title>Large-$N$ limit of $O(N)^3$-invariant general sextic tensor model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a sextic tensor model where the interaction terms are given by all $O(N)^3$-invariant bubbles. The class of invariants studied here is thus a larger one that the class of the $U(N)^3$-invariant sextic tensor model. We implement the large $N$ limit mechanism for this general model and we explicitly identify the dominant graphs in the $1/N$ expansion. This class of dominant graphs contains tadpole graphs, melonic graphs but also new types of tensor graphs. Our analysis adapts the tensorial intermediate field method, previously applied only to the prismatic interaction, to all connected sextic interactions except the wheel interaction, which we treat separately using a cycle analysis.</description>

      <title>Universal decay of (conditional) mutual information in gapped pure- and mixed-state quantum matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For spin and fermionic systems in any spatial dimension, we establish that the superpolynomial decay behavior of mutual information and conditional mutual information is a universal property of gapped pure- and mixed-state phases, i.e., all systems in such a phase possess this property if one system in this phase possesses this property. We further demonstrate that the (conditional) mutual information indeed decays superpolynomially in a large class of phases, including chiral phases. As a byproduct, we sharpen the notion of mixed-state phases.</description>

      <title>Single-Sided Black Holes in Double-Scaled SYK Model and No Man's Island</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a single-sided black hole with an end-of-the-world (EoW) brane behind the horizon in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK). The new Hamiltonian is a deformation of the original DSSYK Hamiltonian with an extra exponential wormhole length operator, which leads to a new chord diagram rule. The boundary algebra is defined as generated by the new Hamiltonian and boundary matter. There is an alternative but equivalent definition with a $q$-coherent state due to a nontrivial isomorphism of the vN algebra of DSSYK. This isomorphism induces a unitary equivalence, which yields a surprising result that the boundary algebra of a single-sided black hole in DSSYK has a non-trivial commutant and is a type II$_1$ vN factor. It follows that the full bulk reconstruction from the boundary is impossible, and there is a ``no man's island" behind the horizon in the semiclassical JT limit. Inspired by the EoW brane, we construct a family of matter-brane states with an arbitrary number of matter chords and behaving like an EoW brane. They exactly solve the full spectrum of DSSYK.
  We take different ways to understand the nontrivial commutant. We show that the commutant is complex on chord number basis and thus non-geometric. In the semiclassical JT limit, the commutant becomes the canonical purification of the boundary algebra and claims the no man's island. In the context of Hawking radiation after Page time, the unitary equivalence is interpreted as encoding the canonical purification into the old Hawking radiation, and the no man's island has the same essence as the island. Including the exponential wormhole length operator independently, the boundary algebra is extended to all bounded operators and reconstructs the no man's island. This can be regarded as a different choice for the definition of boundary algebra. This type I$_\infty$ algebra is closely related to the EoW brane in Kourkoulou-Maldacena.</description>
