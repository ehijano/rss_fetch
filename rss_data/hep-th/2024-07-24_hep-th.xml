      <title>Studying the 3d Ising surface CFTs on the fuzzy sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15914v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boundaries not only are fundamental elements in nearly all realistic physical systems, but also greatly enrich the structure of quantum field theories. In this paper, we demonstrate that conformal field theory (CFT) with a boundary, known as surface CFT in three dimensions, can be studied with the setup of fuzzy sphere. We consider the example of surface criticality of the 3D Ising CFT. We propose two schemes by cutting a boundary in the orbital space or the real space to realise the ordinary and the normal surface CFTs on the fuzzy sphere. We obtain the operator spectra through state-operator correspondence. We observe integer spacing of the conformal multiplets, and thus provide direct evidence of conformal symmetry. We identify the ordinary surface primary $o$, the displacement operator $\mathrm{D}$ and their conformal descendants and extract their scaling dimensions. We also study the one-point and two-point correlation functions and extract the bulk-to-surface OPE coefficients, some of which are reported for the first time. In addition, using the overlap of the bulk CFT state and the polarised state, we calculate the boundary central charges of the 3D Ising surface CFTs non-perturbatively. Other conformal data obtained in this way also agrees with prior methods.</description>

      <title>The Low Energy Limit of BFSS Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the low-energy regime of BFSS quantum mechanics using its holographic dual. We identify three distinct thermodynamic phases (black holes) and analyze their thermodynamic properties extensively, including phase transitions amongst the several phases. While the properties of the canonical ensemble aligns with existing conjectures on BFSS thermodynamics, we uncover intriguing and unexpected behavior in the microcanonical ensemble. Specifically, for sufficiently low energies, we observe the dominance of the localized phase. Surprisingly, we also identify an energy range where the non-uniform phase becomes dominant. The transition between these phases is mediated by a Kol-type topology-changing phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Non-analytic terms of string amplitudes from partial waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a general formalism based on the partial-wave decomposition to compute the iterative $s$-channel discontinuity of four-point amplitudes at any loop order. As an application, we focus on the low-energy expansions of type I and II superstring amplitudes. Besides providing new results for their leading and sub-leading logarithmic contributions beyond genus one, our approach elucidates the general structure of non-analytic threshold terms. In the case of open strings, the use of orthogonal colour projectors allows us to efficiently compute all contributions from different worldsheet topologies at a given loop order.</description>

      <title>Ising BCFT from Fuzzy Hemisphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the recently introduced fuzzy sphere technique for the 3d Ising CFT to the case of boundary CFT (BCFT) using the fuzzy hemisphere. This allows to study conformal boundary conditions, and we investigate the three boundary universality classes of the 3d Ising CFT. These include the ordinary, extraordinary, and special boundary conditions. We identify the qualitative signatures of boundary conformal invariance, and in the cases of ordinary and extraordinary boundary conditions, obtain numerical estimates for the spectrum of low-lying boundary primaries. For the special boundary conditions, we are only able to see their qualitative features, while reliable estimates of the scaling dimensions of boundary primaries are left for the future work.</description>

      <title>Bulk reconstruction in 2D multi-horizon black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of the bulk reconstruction program is to construct boundary representations of fields in asymptotically Anti-de Sitter spacetimes. In this paper, we extend the program by computing the boundary representation of massless fields in an Achucarro-Ortiz black hole spacetime. We obtain analytic expressions for smearing functions in both the exterior and interior of the black hole. We also obtain expressions for Papadodimas-Raju mirror operators.</description>

      <title>Miura operators as R-matrices from M-brane intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that Miura operators are R-matrices of certain infinite-dimensional quantum algebras. We test our proposal by realizing Miura operators of $q$-deformed $W$- and $Y$-algebras in terms of R-matrices of the quantum toroidal algebra of $\mathfrak{gl}(1)$. Physically, the representations of this toroidal algebra arise from the algebra of local operators on M2-branes and M5-branes, in M-theory subject to an $\Omega$-background. We associate an R-matrix to each M2-M5 brane crossing, by studying its description as a gauge-invariant intersection of a topological line defect and a holomorphic surface defect in 5-dimensional non-commutative Chern-Simons theory. The Miura transformation is engineered using multiple M2-M5 intersections, relying crucially on the properties of the underlying R-matrices. We thereby identify each R-matrix with a Miura operator. In a dual Type IIB frame, the components of the Miura transformation are shown to coincide with the half-index of a 3d supersymmetric gauge theory on a Hanany-Witten system of D3-NS5 branes. As a further application, we demonstrate that $qq$-characters can be algebraically constructed from the Miura transformation.</description>

      <title>Reloading Black Hole Thermodynamics with Noether Charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-established that black holes obey laws of thermodynamics, in particular, there is the seminal Iyer-Wald derivation of the first law of thermodynamics for any stationary black hole solution of a generic diffeomorphism invariant theory of gravity. We revisit Iyer-Wald derivation within the framework of covariant phase space with fluctuating boundaries. We extend Iyer-Wald derivation by relaxing the need for the assumptions at a bifurcation surface and asymptotic infinity, as well as addressing the questions regarding the integrability of charges. Along the way, we also shed a clarifying light on the longstanding question of defining covariant charges in general relativity and present a first principles derivation of the Smarr relation within our framework.</description>

      <title>Capacity of entanglement and volume law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate various aspects of capacity of entanglement in certain setups whose entanglement entropy becomes extensive and obeys a volume law. In particular, considering geometric decomposition of the Hilbert space, we study this measure both in the vacuum state of a family of non-local scalar theories and also in the squeezed states of a local scalar theory. We also evaluate field space capacity of entanglement between interacting scalar field theories. We present both analytical and numerical evidences for the volume law scaling of this quantity in different setups and discuss how these results are consistent with the behavior of other entanglement measures including Renyi entropies. Our study reveals some generic properties of the capacity of entanglement and the corresponding reduced density matrix in the specific regimes of the parameter space. Finally, by comparing entanglement entropy and capacity of entanglement, we discuss some implications of our results on the existence of consistent holographic duals for the models in question.</description>

      <title>Exact Expressions For Infinitely Many Weil-Petersson Volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weil-Petersson volumes are the volumes of the moduli spaces of bordered Riemann surfaces and have played an important role in the relationship between two-dimensional quantum gravity and algebraic geometry. In the last couple years progress has been made to understand their role in the context of matrix models, where it is possible to define a generalization of the volumes in terms of an infinite set of coupling constants $t_k$. Using a recent open string matrix model construction we calculate the generalized Weil-Petersson volumes for fixed genus $g = 0,1$ and an arbitrary number of boundaries $n$. Both results are expressed in terms of the perturbative expansion of the solution to the string equation of the matrix model in the closed string sector. The formalism has the added benefit of applying to type 0A superstring matrix models with nonzero Ramond-Ramond flux.</description>

      <title>Soft Limits of Gluon and Graviton Correlators in Anti-de Sitter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive formulae for the soft limit of tree-level gluon and graviton correlators in Anti-de Sitter space, which arise from Feynman diagrams encoding the Weinberg soft theorems in flat space. Other types of diagrams can also contribute to the soft limit at leading order in the soft momentum, but have a different pole structure. We derive these results at four points using explicit formulae recently obtained from the cosmological bootstrap and double copy, and extend them to any multiplicity using bootstrap techniques in Mellin-momentum space.</description>

      <title>Axion species scale and axion weak gravity conjecture-like bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a cutoff scale of quantum gravity, the species scale can be defined by the scale at which the perturbativity of the non-renormalizable gravitational interaction begins to break down. Since it is determined by the number of species in the effective field theory, we can find the close connection to the distance conjecture, which predicts the lowering of the cutoff at the asymptotic limit of the moduli space caused by the descent of a tower of states from UV. Meanwhile, the same kind of the cutoff scale can be obtained from any non-renormalizable interaction, in particular the interaction between the axion and the gauge field through the $\theta F\wedge F$ term. Demanding this `axion species scale' not to exceed the gravitational species scale, we obtain the bound $(8\pi^2/g^2)f \lesssim M_{\rm Pl}$. This is quite similar to the axion weak gravity conjecture bound, but can be applied to any gauge as well as the string interactions which are relevant to towers of states. We also investigate the implications of the (axion) species scale and the axion weak gravity conjecture-like bound by considering the Peccei-Quinn charge reduction of black hole through the interaction between black hole and the string or wormhole.</description>

      <title>Integrable Higher-Spin Deformations of Sigma Models from Auxiliary Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a new infinite family of integrable deformations of the principal chiral model (PCM) parameterized by an interaction function of several variables, which extends the formalism of arXiv:2405.05899, and includes deformations of the PCM by functions of both the stress tensor and higher-spin conserved currents. We show in detail that every model in this class admits a Lax representation for its equations of motion, and that the Poisson bracket of the Lax connection takes the Maillet form, establishing the existence of an infinite set of Poisson-commuting conserved charges. We argue that the non-Abelian T-dual of any model in this family is classically integrable, and that T-duality "commutes" with a general deformation in this class, in a sense which we make precise. Finally, we demonstrate that these higher-spin auxiliary field deformations can be extended to accommodate the addition of a Wess-Zumino term, and we exhibit the Lax connection in this case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the action principle for the holographic $T\bar{T}$-deformation. We develop a scheme in which one can holographically reproduce the action of the Liouville theory deformed by $T\bar{T}$-insertion. This scheme necessitates considering the bending energy of the finite cut-off surface. Following our proposal, one observes a perfect match between the actions of deformed theory on the field theory and gravity sides.</description>

      <title>Soft theorems based on differential operators from gravity to Yang-Mills and BAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note study the soft behavior of Yang-Mills (YM) and bi-adjoint scalar (BAS) amplitudes at tree level, by using transmutation operators proposed by Cheung, Shen and Wen. By acting such transmutation operators to gravity amplitudes in the soft limit, we reproduce universal soft factors of YM amplitudes at the leading and sub-leading orders, and explain that the analogous universal soft behavior does not exist at the sub-sub-leading order. Subsequently, by acting the same operators on YM amplitudes, we obtain the universal soft factor of BAS amplitudes at the leading order. Furthermore, we find that a "weaker" version of universal soft behavior of BAS amplitudes holds at the sub-leading order, if we exclude the special $4$-point case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study scalar-tensor gravitational theories using on-shell amplitude methods. We focus on theories with gravity coupled to a massless scalar via the Gauss-Bonnet and Chern-Simons terms. In this framework, we calculate the waveforms for classical scalar radiation emitted in scattering of macroscopic objects, including spin effects. To this end, we use the Kosower-Maybee-O'Connell formalism, with the 5-particle amplitude for scalar emission in matter scattering calculated at tree level using the unitarity-factorization bootstrap techniques. We also discuss in detail the dependence of that amplitude on the contact terms of the intermediate 4-particle scalar-graviton-matter amplitude. Finally, we discuss the conditions for resolvability of classical scalar radiation.</description>

      <title>Scattering, Absorption and Emission of Highly Excited Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study tree-level scattering processes of arbitrary string states using the DDF formalism and suitable coherent vertex operators. We obtain new exact compact formulae for heavy-heavy-light-light scattering amplitudes in open or closed bosonic string theories, and derive explicit exact expressions for the absorption cross-sections, and corresponding emission rates, of highly excited string states using the optical theorem and time reversal symmetry. We show that these expressions are independent of the microscopic structure of the excited string states without averaging. For the absorption of massless modes in open string theory, in particular, we find a constant, frequency-independent cross-section. In contrast, the corresponding cross-section for the absorption of massless modes by excited closed strings depends linearly on the frequency, implying a non-trivial grey-body factor. In both cases, at energies below the scale set by the mass of the highly excited strings, we find emission rates with a Boltzmann factor at Hagedorn temperature.</description>

      <title>Unitarization of the one-loop graviton-graviton scattering amplitudes and study of the graviball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the graviton-graviton scattering amplitudes calculated perturbatively in quantum gravity to the one-loop order, we develop further a formalism that allows one to calculate infrared-finite partial-wave amplitudes fulfilling perturbative unitarity. As a result of this process a parameter dubbed $\ln a$ emerges that separate between infrared and typical external momenta. The resulting partial-wave amplitudes are next unitarized by employing the Inverse Amplitude Method and the algebraic-$N/D$ method. Then, the graviball resonance, with a similar pole position, is confirmed in the $S$-wave partial-wave amplitude for all unitarization methods, also with respect to the unitarization of only the leading-order amplitude. Based on the requirement for a well-behaved unitarized effective-field theory of gravity, we can exclude values $\ln a\lesssim 0.5$, and obtain hints that larger ones $\ln a\gtrsim 1.7$ are disfavored too. Briefly, we discuss the $D$-wave scattering that is weaker than the $S-$wave scattering, repulsive and non-resonant for $\ln a\approx 1$.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Correlators for Bogoliubov Initial States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider late-time correlators in de Sitter (dS) space for initial states related to the Bunch-Davies vacuum by a Bogoliubov transformation. We propose to study such late-time correlators by reformulating them in the familiar language of Witten diagrams in Euclidean anti-de Sitter space (EAdS), showing that they can be perturbatively re-cast in terms of corresponding dS boundary correlators in the Bunch-Davies vacuum and in turn, Witten diagrams in EAdS. Unlike the standard relationship between late-time correlators in the Bunch-Davies vacuum and EAdS Witten diagrams, this involves points on the upper and lower sheet of the EAdS hyperboloid which account for antipodal singularities of the two-point functions. Such Bogoliubov states include an infinite one parameter family of de Sitter invariant vacua as a special case, where the late-time correlators are constrained by Conformal Ward identities. In momentum space, it is well known that their late-time correlators exhibit singularities in collinear ("folded") momentum configurations. We give a position space interpretation of such solutions to the conformal Ward identities, where in embedding space they can be generated from the solution without collinear singularities by application of the antipodal map. We also discuss the operator product expansion (OPE) limit of late-time correlators in a generic dS invariant vacuum. Many results are derived using the Mellin space representation of late-time correlators, which in this work we extend to accommodate generic dS invariant vacua.</description>

      <title>On Lepton and Baryon Numbers as Local Gauge Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06866v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A simple theory where the total lepton number is a local gauge symmetry is proposed. In this context, the gauge anomalies are cancelled with the minimal number of extra fermionic fields and one predicts that the neutrinos are Majorana fermions. The properties of the neutrino sector are discussed showing that this theory predicts a $3+2$ light neutrino sector. We show that using the same fermionic fields one can gauge the baryon number and define a simple theory where the lepton and baryon numbers can be spontaneously broken at the low scale in agreement with experiments.</description>

      <title>Spacetime with prescribed hidden symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11178v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate spacetime characterized by a hidden symmetry defined by a given Killing tensor. To exhibit this hidden symmetry, the inverse metric must commute with the Killing tensor under the Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket, which translates into a system of partial differential equations (PDEs) for the inverse metric. For some significant examples, we solve these PDEs directly, deriving spacetimes with prescribed hidden symmetries, including those specified by higher-rank Killing tensors. Utilizing the hidden symmetries, we study related problems such as null geodesics, photon region, and separation of variables of wave equations. Through this work, we aim to demonstrate that hidden symmetry is more accessible than previously believed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We elucidate that a distinctive resonant excitation between quasinormal modes (QNMs) of black holes emerges as a universal phenomenon at avoided crossing near exceptional point through high-precision numerical analysis and theory of QNMs based on the framework of non-Hermitian physics. This resonant phenomenon not only allows us to decipher a long-standing mystery concerning the peculiar behaviors of QNMs but also stands as a novel beacon for characterizing black hole spacetime geometry. Our findings pave the way for rigorous examinations of black holes and the exploration of new physics in gravity.</description>

      <title>New boundary criticality in topological phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the boundary criticality enriched by boundary fermions, which ubiquitously emerge in topological phases of matter, with a focus on topological insulators and topological superconductors. By employing dimensional regularization and bosonization techniques, we uncover several unprecedented boundary universality classes. These include the boundary Gross-Neveu-Yukawa critical point and the special Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition, both resulting from the interplay between edge modes and bulk bosons. We present a comprehensive sketch of the phase diagram that accommodates these boundary criticalities and delineate their critical exponents. Additionally, we explore a 1+1D conformal defect decorated with fermions, where a defect BKT transition is highlighted. We conclude with a discussion on potential experimental realizations of these phenomena.</description>

      <title>Lectures on the quantum phase transitions of metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions of metals involve changes in the Fermi surface, and can be divided into three categories. The first two categories involve symmetry breaking, and lead to a distortion or reconstruction of the Fermi surface. The third category involves a change in the volume enclosed by the Fermi surface without any symmetry breaking: one phase is a Fermi liquid (FL) with the conventional Luttinger volume, while the other phase is a `fractionalized Fermi liquid' (FL*), which has a non-Luttinger volume Fermi surface accompanied by a spin liquid with fractionalized excitations. It is a relatively simple matter to obtain a FL*-FL transition in Kondo lattice models. However, the FL*-FL transition can also be present in single-band Hubbard-like models: this is efficiently described by the `ancilla' method, which shows that the transition is a `flipped' Kondo lattice transition. This single-band FL*-FL transition is argued to apply to the metallic states of the hole-doped cuprates. In the clean limit, the critical properties of the quantum transitions in the three categories are distinct, but all lead to perfect metal transport in the quantum-critical regime. Impurity-induced `Harris disorder', with spatial fluctuations in the local position of the quantum critical point, is a relevant perturbation to the clean critical points. In the presence of Harris disorder, all three categories exhibit strange metal behavior, which can be described by a universal two-dimensional Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model.</description>

      <title>Cosmological selection of a small weak scale from large vacuum energy: a minimal approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a minimal cosmological solution to the hierarchy problem. Our model consists of a light pseudoscalar and an extra Higgs doublet in addition to the field content of the Standard Model. We consider a landscape of vacua with varying values of the electroweak vacuum expectation value (VEV). The vacuum energy in our model peaks in a region of the landscape where the electroweak VEV is non-zero and much smaller than the cutoff. During inflation, due to exponential expansion, such regions of the landscape with maximal vacuum energy, dominate the universe in volume, thus explaining the smallness of the electroweak scale with respect to the cutoff. The pseudoscalar potential in our model is that of a completely generic pseudogoldstone boson$-$not requiring the clockwork mechanism$-$and its field value never exceeds its decay constant or the Planck scale. Our mechanism is robust to the variation of other model parameters in the landscape along with the electroweak VEV. It also predicts a precise and falsifiable relationship between the masses and couplings of the different Higgs boson mass-eigenstates. Moreover, the pseudoscalar in our model can account for the observed dark matter relic density.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Enabled Intensity Interferometry in ultrarelativistic ultraperipheral nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important tool in studying the sub-femtoscale spacetime structure of matter in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions is Hanbury-Brown-Twiss (HBT) intensity interferometry of identical particles in the final state of such collisions. We show here that a variant of an entanglement enabled intensity interferometry ($E^2 I^2$) proposed by Cotler and Wilczek provides a powerful alternative to HBT interferometry in extracting fundamental nonperturbative features of QCD at high energies. In particular, we show that the spatial distributions of color singlet (pomeron) configurations in nuclei can be obtained from exclusive resonant decays of $\rho$-mesons into $\pi^\pm$-pairs in ultrarelativistic ultraperipheral nuclear collisions (UPCs) at RHIC and the LHC. The $E^2 I^2$ framework developed here is quite general. It can be employed to extract information on the spin structure of pomeron couplings as well as enhance the discovery potential for rare odderon configurations from exclusive vector meson decays into few-particle final states both in UPCs and at the Electron-Ion Collider.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider evolution of observables which depend on a small but fixed value of longitudinal momentum fraction $x$, to high rapidity, such that $\eta&gt;\ln 1/x$. We show that this evolution is not given by the JIMWLK (or BK) equation. We derive the evolution Hamiltonian - $H_{CSS-JIMWLK}$ which generates this evolution in the cases of dilute and dense projectile wave function. The two limits yield identical results for $H_{CSS-JIMWLK}$. We show that the resulting evolution for the gluon TMD is identical to the (double logarithmic) perturbative Collins-Soper-Sterman evolution equation in the longitudinal resolution parameter at a fixed and very large transverse resolution.</description>

      <title>In Which Sense Can We Say That First-Class Constraints Generate Gauge Transformations?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, I consider a recent controversy about whether first-class constraints generate gauge transformations in the case of electromagnetism. I argue that there is a notion of gauge transformation, the extended notion, which is different from the original gauge transformation of electromagnetism, but at the same time not trivial, which allows the making of that claim. I further argue that one can expect that this claim can be extended to more general theories, and that Dirac's conjecture may be true for some physically reasonable theories and only in this sense of gauge transformation. Finally, I argue that the extended notion of gauge transformation seems unnatural from the point of view of classical theories, but that it nicely fits with the way quantum versions of gauge theories are constructed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the formation of scalar clouds on charged, spherically symmetric and static stars and black holes. We first discuss Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes with electric and magnetic charge and present new results demonstrating the existence of a second branch of solutions. Moreover, we find that the presence of the magnetic charge allows for smaller mass and Noether charge when the clouds are close to their minimal possible mean radius. Replacing standard electrodynamics by Born-Infeld (BI) electrodynamics, the background model possesses globally regular, star-like as well as black hole solutions. We show that the former can be scalarized as well and that the scalar clouds become more compact when decreasing the electric charge of the BI star. Finally, we discuss a magnetic dipole field in the background of the scalarized BI star and show that the strong gravitational field of this star leads to a significant change.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Holographic dark energy theories present a fascinating interface to probe late-time cosmology, as guided by contemporary ideas about quantum gravity. In this work, we present a new holographic dark energy scenario designated Fractional Holographic Dark Energy (FHDE). This model extends the conventional framework of HDEs by incorporating specific features from fractional calculus recently applied, e.g., in cosmological settings. In this manner, we retrieve a novel form of HDE energy density. We then show how FHDE can provide a consistent picture of the evolution of the late-time universe even with the simple choice of the Hubble horizon as the IR (infrared) cutoff. We provide detailed descriptions of the cosmological evolution, showing how the fractional calculus ingredients can alleviate quite a few issues associated with the conventional HDE scenario. Concretely, we compute and plot diagrams using the Hubble horizon cutoff for HDE. The density parameters for DE and dark matter (DM), the deceleration parameter, and the DE EoS parameter indicate how the universe may evolve within our FHDE model, fitting within an appropriate scenario of late-time cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational path-integral of Gauss-Bonnet gravity is investigated and the transition from one spacelike boundary configuration to another is analyzed. Of particular interest is the case of Neumann and Robin boundary conditions which is known to lead to stable Universe in Einstein-Hilbert gravity in four spacetime dimensions. After setting up the variational problem and computing the necessary boundary terms, the transition amplitude can be exactly computed in the mini-superspace approximation. The $\hbar\to0$ limit brings out the dominant pieces in the path-integral which is traced to an initial configuration corresponding to Hartle-Hawking no-boundary Universe. A deeper study involving Picard-Lefschetz methods not only allow us to find the integration contour along which the path-integral becomes convergent but also aids in understanding the crossover from Euclidean to Lorentzian signature. Saddle analysis further highlights the boundary configurations giving dominant contribution to the path-integral which is seen to be those corresponding to Hartle-Hawking no-boundary proposal and agrees with the exact computation. To ensure completeness, a comparison with the results from Wheeler-DeWitt equation is done.</description>

Abstract: The spectrum consistency of the three fermion family $U(1)\times U(1)$ quantum electrodynamics in three space-time dimensions [Phys. Rev. Lett. 124 (2020) 131601] is analyzed. It has been verified that the originally proposed action violates the unitarity consistency condition in the gauge field sector by exhibiting negative norm states in the spectrum. However, the cure came through the fundamental gauge fields properly settled, consequently, the action rewritten in terms of those fundamental fields shows to be free from any spurious degrees of freedom, and the model now becomes safe for further quantization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.09251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the relaxation of holographic superfluids after quenches, when the end state is either tuned to be exactly at the critical point, or very close to it. By solving the bulk equations of motion numerically, we demonstrate that in the former case the system exhibits a power law falloff as well as an emergent discrete scale invariance. The later case is in the regime dominated by critical slowing down, and we show that there is an intermediate time-range before the onset of late time exponential falloff, where the system behaves similarly to the critical point with its power law falloff. We further postulate a phenomenological Gross-Pitaevskii-like equation that is able to make quantitative predictions for the behavior of the holographic superfluid after near-critical quenches. Intriguingly, all parameters of our phenomenological equation which describes the non-linear time evolution may be fixed with information from the static equilibrium solutions and linear response theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.10845v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that the $2+1$d single Majorana fermion theory has an anomaly of the reflection, which is canceled out when 16 copies of the theory are combined. Therefore, it is expected that the reflection symmetric boundary condition is impossible for one Majorana fermion, but possible for 16 Majorana fermions. In this paper, we consider a reflection symmetric boundary condition that varies at a single point, and find that there is a problem with one Majorana fermion. The problem is the absence of a corresponding outgoing wave to a specific incoming wave into the boundary, which leads to the non-conservation of the energy. For 16 Majorana fermions, it is possible to connect every incoming wave to an outgoing wave without breaking the reflection symmetry. In addition, we discuss the connection with the fermion-monopole scattering in $3+1$ dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the numerical conformal bootstrap in general spacetime dimensions through the lens of a distinct category of analytic functionals, previously employed in two-dimensional studies. We extend the application of these functionals to a more comprehensive backdrop, demonstrating their adaptability and efficacy in general spacetime dimensions above two. The bootstrap is implemented using the outer approximation methodology, with computations conducted in double precision. The crux of our study lies in comparing the performance of this category of analytic functionals with conventional derivatives at crossing symmetric points. It is worth highlighting that in our study, we identified some novel kinks in the scalar channel during the maximization of the gap in two-dimensional conformal field theory. Our numerical analysis indicates that these analytic functionals offer a superior performance, thereby revealing a potential alternative paradigm in the application of conformal bootstrap.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Hydrodynamics under Rotation: Prospects &amp; Limitations from a Holographic Perspective</title>

Abstract: The AdS/CFT correspondence, or holography, has provided numerous important insights into the behavior of strongly-coupled many-body systems. Crucially, it has provided a testing ground for the construction of new effective field theories, especially those in the low frequency, long wavelength limit known as hydrodynamics. We review the study of strongly-coupled rotating fluids using holography, and we examine the hydrodynamics emerging from the study of rotating Myers-Perry black holes. We discuss three regimes in which holographic rotating fluids display either (1) hydrodynamic behavior of a boosted fluid, (2) hydrodynamic behavior distinct from a boosted fluid, or (3) no obvious hydrodynamic behavior. We describe techniques to obtain hydrodynamic and non-hydrodynamic modes, and we compute the radius of convergence for the hydrodynamic regimes. The limitations of hydrodynamics under rotation are discussed alongside our findings.</description>

      <title>Affine Symmetries for ABJM Partition Function and its Generalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Partially motivated by the fact that the grand partition function of the ABJM theory or its generalization is expressed by a spectral operator enjoying symmetries of the Weyl group, it was found that the grand partition function satisfies the q-Painleve equation, which is constructed from the affine Weyl group. In this paper we clarify the affine symmetries of the grand partition function. With the affine symmetries, we find that the grand partition function extends naturally outside the fundamental domain of duality cascades and once the Painleve equation holds in the fundamental domain, so does it outside.</description>

      <title>Non-Invertible Anyon Condensation and Level-Rank Dualities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive new dualities of topological quantum field theories in three spacetime dimensions that generalize the familiar level-rank dualities of Chern-Simons gauge theories. The key ingredient in these dualities is non-abelian anyon condensation, which is a gauging operation for topological lines with non-group-like i.e. non-invertible fusion rules. We find that, generically, dualities involve such non-invertible anyon condensation and that this unifies a variety of exceptional phenomena in topological field theories and their associated boundary rational conformal field theories, including conformal embeddings, and Maverick cosets (those where standard algorithms for constructing a coset model fail.) We illustrate our discussion in a variety of isolated examples as well as new infinite series of dualities involving non-abelian anyon condensation including: i) a new description of the parafermion theory as $(SU(N)_{2} \times Spin(N)_{-4})/\mathcal{A}_{N},$ ii) a new presentation of a series of points on the orbifold branch of $c=1$ conformal field theories as $(Spin(2N)_{2} \times Spin(N)_{-2} \times Spin(N)_{-2})/\mathcal{B}_{N}$, and iii) a new dual form of $SU(2)_{N}$ as $(USp(2N)_{1} \times SO(N)_{-4})/\mathcal{C}_{N}$ arising from conformal embeddings, where $\mathcal{A}_{N}, \mathcal{B}_{N},$ and $\mathcal{C}_{N}$ are appropriate collections of gauged non-invertible bosons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a new proposal connecting the geometry at various radial scales in asymptotic AdS spacetime with entanglement structure at corresponding real-space length scales of the boundary theory. With this proposal, the bulk IR geometry encodes the long-scale entanglement structure of the dual quantum system. We consider two distinct types of IR geometries, namely the spherical case and the hyperbolic case, which are intimately related to the physics of differential entropy and brane-world holography separately. We explore the corresponding change in the dual long-scale entanglement structures, utilizing the tools of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, conditional mutual information, and partial entanglement entropy. The results indicate that modifying the IR geometry leads to a redistribution of entanglement at scales longer than a critical length determined by the location of the IR region, with the two modified IR geometries corresponding to two opposite ways of redistribution. Furthermore, we establish the maximum amount of entanglement that can be modified, which is proportional to the area of the IR region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16925v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive framework for analyzing finite $N$ lattice Yang-Mills theory and finite $N$ matrix models. Utilizing this framework, we examine the bootstrap approach to SU(2) Lattice Yang-Mills Theory in 2,3 and 4 dimensions. The SU(2) Makeenko-Migdal loop equations on the lattice are linear and closed exclusively on single-trace Wilson loops. This inherent linearity significantly enhances the efficiency of the bootstrap approach due to the convex nature of the problem, permitting the inclusion of Wilson loops up to length 24. The exact upper and lower margins for the free energy per plaquette, derived from our bootstrap method, demonstrate good agreement with Monte Carlo data, achieving precision within $0.1\%$ for the physically relevant range of couplings in both three and four dimensions. Additionally, our bootstrap data provides estimates of the string tension, in qualitative agreement with existing Monte Carlo computations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study type IIB supergravity solutions that are dual to two-dimensional superconformal defects in $d=4$ SCFTs which preserve $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ supersymmetry. We consider solutions dual to defects in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory that have non-trivial monodromy for $U(1)^3\subset SO(6)$ global symmetry and we also allow for the possibility of conical singularities. In addition, we consider the addition of fermionic and bosonic mass terms that have non trivial dependence on the spatial directions transverse to the defect, while preserving the superconformal symmetry of the defect. We compute various physical quantities including the central charges of the defect expressed as a function of the monodromy, the on-shell action as well as associated supersymmetric Renyi entropies. Analogous computations are carried out for superconformal defects in the $\mathcal{N}=1$, $d=4$ Leigh-Strassler SCFT. We also show that the defects of the two SCFTs are connected by a line of bulk marginal mass deformations and argue that they are also related by bulk RG flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The double-cone geometry is a saddle of the gravitational path integral, which explains the chaotic statistics of the spectrum of black hole microstates. This geometry is the usual AdS-Schwarzschild black hole, but with a periodic identification of the time coordinate; the resulting singularity at the black hole horizon is regulated by making the geometry slightly complex. Here, we consider generalizations of the double-cone geometry which include the Lorentzian cosmology that sits between the event horizon and the black hole singularity. We analyze this in two and three dimensions, where the cosmology has compact spatial sections and big bang/crunch singularities. These singularities are regulated in the same way by slightly complexifying the metric. We show that this is possible while satisfying the Kontsevich-Segal criterion, implying that these geometries can be interpreted as perturbatively stable saddle points in general relativity. This procedure leads to a novel description of the cosmology in terms of standard observables in the dual boundary CFT. In three dimensions, the cosmological solution gives a new contribution to the two-point function of the density of states in the boundary CFT. Unlike the usual double cone, it describes correlations between black hole microstates with different masses, and in a limit describes correlations between the statistics of heavy states and states near the BTZ threshold.</description>

Abstract: We study the emergent dynamics of an anisotropic universe in the context of Group Field Theory condensate cosmology, with a scalar field playing the role of a relational clock. According to different definitions of ``isotropy'', two anisotropic condensate states are considered and the Bianchi-like dynamics of cosmological anisotropic observables, as well as their quantum fluctuations, are analysed. We find that both anisotropic states become isotropic at late time, reproducing an effective Friedmann dynamics, while anisotropies give small but non-negligible contributions at earlier times, closer to the cosmic bounce.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform an exploratory study of a new approach for evaluating Feynman integrals numerically. We apply the recently-proposed framework of physics-informed deep learning to train neural networks to approximate the solution to the differential equations satisfied by the Feynman integrals. This approach relies neither on a canonical form of the differential equations, which is often a bottleneck for the analytical techniques, nor on the availability of a large dataset, and after training yields essentially instantaneous evaluation times. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation within the PyTorch framework, and apply it to a number of one- and two-loop examples, achieving a mean magnitude of relative difference of around 1% at two loops in the physical phase space with network training times on the order of an hour on a laptop GPU.</description>

      <title>A Collinear Perspective on the Regge Limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The high energy (Regge) limit provides a playground for understanding all loop structures of scattering amplitudes, and plays an important role in the description of many phenomenologically relevant cross-sections. While well understood in the planar limit, the structure of non-planar corrections introduces many fascinating complexities, for which a general organizing principle is still lacking. We study the structure of multi-reggeon exchanges in the context of the effective field theory for forward scattering, and derive their factorization into collinear operators (impact factors) and soft operators. We derive the structure of the renormalization group consistency equations in the effective theory, showing how the anomalous dimensions of the soft operators are related to those of the collinear operators, allowing us to derive renormalization group equations in the Regge limit purely from a collinear perspective. The rigidity of the consistency equations provides considerable insight into the all orders organization of Regge amplitudes in the effective theory, as well as its relation to other approaches. Along the way we derive a number of technical results that improve the understanding of the effective theory. We illustrate this collinear perspective by re-deriving all the standard BFKL equations for two-Glauber exchange from purely collinear calculations, and we show that this perspective provides a number of conceptual and computational advantages as compared to the standard view from soft or Glauber physics. We anticipate that this formulation in terms of collinear operators will enable a better understanding of the relation between BFKL and DGLAP in gauge theories, and facilitate the analysis of renormalization group evolution equations describing Reggeization beyond next-to-leading order.</description>

      <title>Quantum Spin Chains and Symmetric Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the question of what quantum spin chains naturally encode in their Hilbert space. It turns out that quantum spin chains are rather rich systems, naturally encoding solutions to various problems in combinatorics, group theory, and algebraic geometry. In the case of the XX Heisenberg spin chain these are given by skew Kostka numbers, skew characters of the symmetric group, and Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. As we show, this is revealed by a fermionic representation of the theory of "quantized" symmetric functions formulated by Fomin and Greene, which provides a powerful framework for constructing operators extracting this data from the Hilbert space of quantum spin chains. Furthermore, these operators are diagonalized by the Bethe basis of the quantum spin chain. Underlying this is the fact that quantum spin chains are examples of "quantum integrable systems." This is somewhat analogous to bosons encoding permanents and fermions encoding determinants. This points towards considering quantum integrable systems, and the combinatorics associated with them, as potentially interesting targets for quantum computers.</description>

Abstract: Mathur and Mehta won the third prize in the 2023 Gravity Research Foundation Essay Competition for proving the universality of black hole (BH) thermodynamics. Specifically, they demonstrated that any Extremely Compact Object (ECO) must have the same BH thermodynamic properties regardless of whether or not the ECO possesses an event horizon. The result is remarkable, but it was obtained under the approximation according to which the BH emission spectrum has an exactly thermal character. In fact, strong arguments based on energy conservation and BH back reaction imply that the spectrum of the Hawking radiation cannot be exactly thermal. In this work the result of Mathur and Mehta will be extended to the case where the radiation spectrum is not exactly thermal using the concept of BH dynamical state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the presence of crystalline symmetry, topologically ordered states can acquire a host of symmetry-protected invariants. These determine the patterns of crystalline symmetry fractionalization of the anyons in addition to fractionally quantized responses to lattice defects. Here we show how ground state expectation values of partial rotations centered at high symmetry points can be used to extract crystalline invariants. Using methods from conformal field theory and G-crossed braided tensor categories, we develop a theory of invariants obtained from partial rotations, which apply to both Abelian and non-Abelian topological orders. We then perform numerical Monte Carlo calculations for projected parton wave functions of fractional Chern insulators, demonstrating remarkable agreement between theory and numerics. For the topological orders we consider, we show that the Hall conductivity, filling fraction, and partial rotation invariants fully characterize the crystalline invariants of the system. Our results also yield invariants of continuum fractional quantum Hall states protected by spatial rotational symmetry.</description>

Abstract: We present the first complete calculation of the Jarlskog invariant, a working measure of the strength of CP violation in the flavor oscillations of three light neutrino species, with the help of a full Euler-like block parametrization of the flavor structure in the canonical seesaw mechanism. We find that this invariant depends on 240 linear combinations of the 6 original phase parameters that are responsible for CP violation in the decays of three heavy Majorana neutrinos in 27 linear combinations as a whole, and thus provides the first model-independent connection between the microscopic and macroscopic matter-antimatter asymmetries.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we consider the $4+n$ dimensional spacetimes among which one is the four dimensional physical Universe and the other is an n-dimensional sphere with constant radius in the framework of Lanczos-Lovelock gravity. We find that the curvature of extra dimensional sphere contributes a huge but negative energy density provided that its radius is sufficiently small, such as the scale of Planck length. Therefore, the huge positive vacuum energy, i.e. the large positive cosmological constant is exactly cancelled out by the curvature of extra sphere. In the mean time the higher order of Lanczos-Lovelock term contributes an observations-allowed small cosmological constant if the number of extra dimensions is sufficiently large, such as $n\approx{69}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dielectric breakdown of physical vacuum (Schwinger effect) is the textbook demonstration of compatibility of Relativity and Quantum theory. Although, the observation of this effect in its original static formulation is practically unachievable, it has been shown that the requirements on field strengths can be significantly reduced for dynamical generalizations of Schwinger effect. Here, we report on observation of an analog dynamical Schwinger effect in gapped Dirac semiconductor lead-halide perovskite MAPbBr$_3$. Specifically, we observe strong photoluminescence of a lead-halide perovskite driven by deep sub-gap irradiation, and use the quasi-adiabatic Landau-Dykhne approach to interpret our data in terms of the dynamical Schwinger effect. Further, the exponential sensitivity of the Schwinger effect to driving fields allows us to measure the local frozen-in fields in a nominally cubic single perovskite crystal at room temperature. Finally, we demonstrate an AC analogue of biasing in our system -- the non-perturbative cooperation between two time-dependent fields simultaneously driving the sample. Our results establish lead-halide perovskites as an excellent platform for simulating effects of strong fields on Dirac fields. In addition, they contribute to the on-going discussion about inversion-breaking in MAPbBr$_3$ single crystal and pave the way for a mid-infrared light detection with lead-halide perovskites.</description>

Abstract: The production of quantum field excitations or particles in cosmological spacetimes is a hallmark prediction of curved quantum field theory. The generation of cosmological perturbations from quantum fluctuations in the early universe constitutes an important application. The problem can be quantum-simulated in terms of structure formation in an interacting Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with time-dependent s-wave scattering length. Here, we explore a mapping between cosmological particle production in general (D+1)-dimensional spacetimes and scattering problems described by the non-relativistic stationary Schr\"odinger equation in one dimension. Through this mapping, intuitive explanations for emergent spatial structures in both the BEC and the cosmological system can be obtained for a large class of analogue cosmological scenarios, ranging from power-law expansions to periodic modulations. The investigated cosmologies and their scattering analogues are tuned to be implemented in a (2+1)-dimensional quantum field simulator.</description>

      <title>Conformal BK equation at QCD Wilson-Fisher point</title>

Abstract: High-energy scattering in pQCD in the Regge limit is described by the evolution of Wilson lines governed by the BK equation. In the leading order, the BK equation is conformally invariant and the eigenfunctions of the linearized BFKL equation are powers. It is a common belief that at $d\neq 4$ the BFKL equation is useless since unlike $d=4$ case it cannot be solved by usual methods. However, we demonstrate that at critical Wilson-Fisher point of QCD the relevant part of NLO BK restores the conformal invariance so the solutions are again powers. As a check of our approach to high-energy amplitudes at the Wilson-Fisher point, we calculate the anomalous dimensions of twist-2 light-ray operators in the Regge limit $j\rightarrow 1$.}</description>
