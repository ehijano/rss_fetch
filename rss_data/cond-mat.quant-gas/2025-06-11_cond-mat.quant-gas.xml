      <title>Droplet-gas phases and their dynamical formation in particle imbalanced mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the ground state phase diagram and nonequilibrium dynamics of genuine two-component particle-imbalanced droplets in both isotropic and anisotropic three-dimensional confinements. A gradual transition from mixed droplet-gas to gas configurations is revealed as the average intercomponent attraction decreases or the transverse confinement becomes tighter. Within the mixed structures, a specific majority fragment binds to the minority droplet, satisfying the density ratio locking condition, while the remaining atoms are in a gas state. Our extended Gross-Pitaevskii numerical results are corroborated by a suitable variational approximation capturing the shape and characteristics of droplet-gas fragments. The tunability of the relatively low gas fraction is showcased through parametric variations of the atom number, the intercomponent imbalance, the trap aspect ratio, or the radius of a box potential. To validate the existence and probe the properties of these exotic phases, we simulate the standard time-of-flight and radio frequency experimental techniques. These allow to dynamically identify the resilience of the droplet fragment and the expansion of the gas fraction. Our results, amenable to current experimental cold atom settings, are expected to guide forthcoming investigations aiming to reveal unseen out-of-equilibrium droplet dynamics.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein Condensates in a Synthetic Magnetic Field with Tunable Orientation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the ground state and dynamics of spinor Bose-Einstein condensates subject to a position-dependent detuning. This detuning induces three related quantities-a synthetic magnetic field, an angular velocity, and an angular momentum-which, due to trap anisotropy, may point in different directions. When the dipole frequencies along the three symmetric axes of the harmonic trap are degenerate, the dipole motion can decompose into two coupled transverse modes in the plane perpendicular to the synthetic magnetic field, and another decoupled longitudinal mode, enabling controllable Foucault-like precession or bi-conical trajectories depending on the excitation protocol. Furthermore, quenching the orientation of the synthetic magnetic field excites multiple coupled quadrupole modes. We develop a hydrodynamic theory whose predictions match well with Gross-Pitaevskii simulations. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the effects of the synthetic magnetic field and the excitations of the collective mode in quantum fluids, providing a foundation for future developments in quantum simulation and high-precision sensing technologies.</description>

      <title>Collective Oscillations of Bose-Einstein Condensates in a Synthetic Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the collective oscillations of spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates in the presence of position-dependent detuning. Specifically, we explore the quadrupole modes of the system using both numerical and analytical approaches based on the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and hydrodynamic theory. Due to spin-orbit coupling and the synthetic magnetic field, {the $xy$ scissors mode couples with a superposition of the three diagonal quadrupole modes ($x^2$, $y^2$, and $z^2$),} resulting in the characteristic beating effect. {The remaining two scissors modes, $xz$ and $yz$, are coupled, giving rise to a Lissajous-like pattern that is highly sensitive to the excitation method and orientation of the synthetic magnetic field.} Furthermore, we find that anisotropic interactions as well as the direction of the synthetic magnetic field, can significantly influence the oscillation amplitude and frequency of the quadrupole modes. These findings highlight the potential of Bose-Einstein condensates under synthetic magnetic fields for quantum sensing applications, such as magnetic field {gradient} measurements, and provide a promising foundation for future experimental research and technological development.</description>

      <title>Dynamic structure factor of a driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic structure factor (DSF) is important for understanding excitations in many-body physics; it reveals information about the spectral and spatial correlations of fluctuations in quantum systems. Collective phenomena like quantum phase transitions of ultracold atoms are addressed by harnessing density fluctuations. Here, we calculate the DSF of a nonequilibrium spinless Bose-Hubbard model (BHM) from the perspective of dissipative phase transition (DPT) in a steady state. Our methodology uses a homogeneous mean-field approximation to make the single-site hierarchy simpler and applies the Lindbladian perturbation method (LPM) to go beyond the single site, limited by the ratio of the inter-site hopping term to the Liouvillian gap as a small parameter. Our results show that the DSF near a DPT point is characteristically different from that away from the transition point, providing a clear density spectral signature of the DPT. In addition to comparing the two numerical frameworks, the mean-field results serve as a benchmark for proof-of-principle robustness of LPM. Despite the numerical difficulty, our methodology provides a computationally accessible route for studying density fluctuations in an open lattice quantum system without requiring large-scale computation.</description>

      <title>Anomalous slow-down of the bound state dynamics in a non-locally coupled quantum circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Additional hopping channels in a tight-binding lattice is known to introduce faster dynamics of a quantum mechanical particle. However, we show that in the case of a repulsively bound state, the dynamics becomes abnormally slow when next-nearest neighbor (NNN) hopping is allowed for the particles. We show that such slowing down occurs for some magic strength of the NNN hopping at which the bound state band exhibits a quasi-flatband feature. We reveal this anomalous dynamical behavior by analyzing the quench dynamics of two nearest neighbor (NN) spin excitations (magnons) on a ferromagnetic chain by allowing both NN and NNN couplings. By implementing digital quantum computing simulations on a NISQ device, we obtain such non-trivial signatures and complement the results with exact numerical calculations. Moreover, through perturbative arguments, we reveal that the slowing down is due to the destructive interference between different paths associated to the bound state dynamics.</description>

      <title>Repeated ancilla reuse for logical computation on a neutral atom quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum processors based on neutral atoms trapped in arrays of optical tweezers have appealing properties, including relatively easy qubit number scaling and the ability to engineer arbitrary gate connectivity with atom movement. However, these platforms are inherently prone to atom loss, and the ability to replace lost atoms during a quantum computation is an important but previously elusive capability. Here, we demonstrate the ability to measure and re-initialize, and if necessary replace, a subset of atoms while maintaining coherence in other atoms. This allows us to perform logical circuits that include single and two-qubit gates as well as repeated midcircuit measurement while compensating for atom loss. We highlight this capability by performing up to 41 rounds of syndrome extraction in a repetition code, and combine midcircuit measurement and atom replacement with real-time conditional branching to demonstrate heralded state preparation of a logically encoded Bell state. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to replenish atoms in a tweezer array from an atomic beam while maintaining coherence of existing atoms -- a key step towards execution of logical computations that last longer than the lifetime of an atom in the system.</description>

      <title>Proper Orthogonal Decomposition of a Superfluid Turbulent Wake</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superfluid turbulent wakes behind a square prism are studied theoretically and numerically by proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). POD is a data science approach that can efficiently extract the principal vibration modes of a physical system, and is widely used in hydrodynamics, including applications in wake structure analysis. It is not straightforward to apply the conventional POD method to superfluid wake systems, as the superfluid velocity field diverges at the center of a vortex whose circulation is quantized. We successfully established a POD method by applying appropriate blurring to the vorticity distribution in a two-dimensional superfluid wake. It is shown that a coherent structure corresponding to two parallel arrays of alternating quantum vortex bundles, called the "quasi-classical" K\'arm\'an vortex street, is latent as a distinctive major mode in the superfluid turbulent wakes that were naively thought to be "irregular". Since our method is also effective for fluid density, it can be applied to the experimental data analysis for ultra-cold atomic gases.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy and Ground-State Transfer of Ultracold Bosonic $^{39}$K$^{133}$Cs Molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the creation of ultracold samples of $^{39}$K$^{133}$Cs molecules in their rovibrational ground state. By investigating potentially suitable excited states using one- and two-photon spectroscopy, we have identified a pathway to the ground state via an exceptionally narrow intermediate state. Using Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP), we create trapped samples of up to 3500 molecules at temperatures of 1 $\mu$K with one-way efficiencies of 71%. The lifetime of these samples is limited by a near-universal two-body loss process, which could shed new light on similar loss mechanisms in other molecular species. Our results are a step towards establishing an alternative platform for the study of bosonic and fermionic quantum matter with strong dipolar interactions.</description>

      <title>Accurate neural quantum states for interacting lattice bosons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, neural quantum states have emerged as a powerful variational approach, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy when representing the ground-state wave function of a great variety of quantum many-body systems, including spin lattices, interacting fermions or continuous-variable systems. However, accurate neural representations of the ground state of interacting bosons on a lattice have remained elusive. We introduce a neural backflow Jastrow Ansatz, in which occupation factors are dressed with translationally equivariant many-body features generated by a deep neural network. We show that this neural quantum state is able to faithfully represent the ground state of the 2D Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian across all values of the interaction strength. We scale our simulations to lattices of dimension up to $20{\times}20$ while achieving the best variational energies reported for this model. This enables us to investigate the scaling of the entanglement entropy across the superfluid-to-Mott quantum phase transition, a quantity hard to extract with non-variational approaches.</description>

      <title>Space-time correlations in monitored kinetically constrained discrete-time quantum dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09872v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art quantum simulators permit local temporal control of interactions and midcircuit readout. These capabilities open the way towards the exploration of intriguing nonequilibrium phenomena. We illustrate this with a kinetically constrained many-body quantum system that has a natural implementation on Rydberg quantum simulators. The evolution proceeds in discrete time and is generated by repeatedly entangling the system with an auxiliary environment that is monitored and reset after each time-step. Despite featuring an uncorrelated infinite-temperature average stationary state, the dynamics displays coexistence of fast and slow space-time regions in stochastic realizations of the system state. The time-record of measurement outcomes on the environment serves as natural probe for such dynamical heterogeneity, which we characterize using tools from large deviation theory. Our work establishes the large deviation framework for discrete-time open quantum many-body systems as a means to characterize complex dynamics and collective phenomena in quantum processors and simulators.</description>

      <title>Finite-Temperature Kinetic Ferromagnetism in the Square Lattice Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the exact phase diagram of the Fermi-Hubbard model remains poorly understood despite decades of progress, nearly 60 years ago, Nagaoka proved that a single dopant in an otherwise half-filled Hubbard system can bring about ferromagnetism through kinetic means. The phenomenon was recently observed with ultracold atoms in triangular optical lattices. Here, we explore the kinetic ferromagnetism within the square lattice Hubbard model and its strong-coupling counterpart, the $t-J$ model, at finite temperatures in the thermodynamic limit via numerical linked-cluster expansions. We find evidence of ferromagnetic Nagaoka polarons at dopings up to $\sim 30\%$ away from half filling for a variety of interaction strengths and at temperatures as low as $0.2$ of the hopping energy. We map out the boundaries of this phase through analyzing various correlation functions.</description>
