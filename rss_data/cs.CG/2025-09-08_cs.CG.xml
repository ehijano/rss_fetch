      <title>Well-Separated Pairs Decomposition Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the notion of WSPD (i.e., well-separated pairs-decomposition), presenting a new construction of WSPD for any finite metric space, and show that it is asymptotically instance-optimal in size. Next, we describe a new WSPD construction for the weighted unit-distance metric in the plane, and show a bound $O( \varepsilon^{-2} n \log n)$ on its size, improving by a factor of $1/\varepsilon^2$ over previous work. The new construction is arguably simpler and more elegant.
  We point out that using WSPD, one can approximate, in near-linear time, the distortion of a bijection between two point sets in low dimensions. As a new application of WSPD, we show how to shortcut a polygonal curve such that its dilation is below a prespecified quantity. In particular, we show a near-linear time algorithm for computing a simple subcurve for a given polygonal curve in the plane so that the new subcurve has no self-intersection.</description>

      <title>Using Reinforcement Learning to Optimize the Global and Local Crossing Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to graph drawing based on reinforcement learning for minimizing the global and the local crossing number, that is, the total number of edge crossings and the maximum number of crossings on any edge, respectively. In our framework, an agent learns how to move a vertex based on a given observation vector in order to optimize its position. The agent receives feedback in the form of local reward signals tied to crossing reduction. To generate an initial layout, we use a stress-based graph-drawing algorithm. We compare our method against force- and stress-based (baseline) algorithms as well as three established algorithms for global crossing minimization on a suite of benchmark graphs. The experiments show mixed results: our current algorithm is mainly competitive for the local crossing number. We see a potential for further development of the approach in the future.</description>

      <title>INF-3DP: Implicit Neural Fields for Collision-Free Multi-Axis 3D Printing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general, scalable computational framework for multi-axis 3D printing based on implicit neural fields (INFs) that unifies all stages of toolpath generation and global collision-free motion planning. In our pipeline, input models are represented as signed distance fields, with fabrication objectives such as support-free printing, surface finish quality, and extrusion control being directly encoded in the optimization of an implicit guidance field. This unified approach enables toolpath optimization across both surface and interior domains, allowing shell and infill paths to be generated via implicit field interpolation. The printing sequence and multi-axis motion are then jointly optimized over a continuous quaternion field. Our continuous formulation constructs the evolving printing object as a time-varying SDF, supporting differentiable global collision handling throughout INF-based motion planning. Compared to explicit-representation-based methods, INF-3DP achieves up to two orders of magnitude speedup and significantly reduces waypoint-to-surface error. We validate our framework on diverse, complex models and demonstrate its efficiency with physical fabrication experiments using a robot-assisted multi-axis system.</description>

      <title>Diagonal Frobenius Number via Gomory's Relaxation and Discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a matrix $A \in Z^{k \times n}$ of rank $k$, the diagonal Frobenius number $F_{\text{diag}}(A)$ is defined as the minimum $t \in Z_{\geq 1}$, such that, for any $b \in \text{span}_{Z}(A)$, the condition \begin{equation*}
  \exists x \in R_{\geq 0}^n,\, x \geq t \cdot 1 \colon \quad b = A x \end{equation*} implies that \begin{equation*}
  \exists z \in Z_{\geq 0}^n \colon\quad b = A z. \end{equation*}
  In this work, we show that \begin{equation*}
  F_{\text{diag}}(A) = \Delta + O(\log k), \end{equation*} where $\Delta$ denotes the maximum absolute value of $k \times k$ sub-determinants of $A$.
  From the computational complexity perspective, we show that the integer vector $z$ can be found by a polynomial-time algorithm for some weaker values of $t$ in the described condition. For example, we can choose $t = O( \Delta \cdot \log k)$ or $t = \Delta + O(\sqrt{k} \cdot \log k)$. Additionally, in the assumption that a $2^k$-time preprocessing is allowed or a base $J$ with $|{\det A_{J}}| = \Delta$ is given, we can choose $t = \Delta + O(\log k)$.
  Finally, we define a more general notion of the diagonal Frobenius number for slacks $F_{\text{slack}}(A)$, which is a generalization of $F_{\text{diag}}(A)$ for canonical-form systems, like $A x \leq b$. All the proofs are mainly done with respect to $F_{\text{slack}}(A)$. The proof technique uses some properties of the Gomory's corner polyhedron relaxation and tools from discrepancy theory.</description>

      <title>No Infinite $(p,q)$-Theorem for Piercing Compact Convex Sets with Lines in $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An infinite $(p,q)$-theorem, or an $(\aleph_0,q)$-theorem, involving two families $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{G}$ of sets, states that if in every infinite subset of $\mathcal{F}$, there are $q$ sets that are intersected by some set in $\mathcal{G}$, then there is a finite set $S_{\mathcal{F}}\subseteq\mathcal{G}$ such that for every $C\in\mathcal{F}$, there is a $B\in S_{\mathcal{F}}$ with $C\cap B\neq\emptyset$. We provide an example demonstrating that there is no $(\aleph_0,q)$-theorem for piercing compact convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with lines by constructing a family $\mathcal{F}$ of compact convex sets such that it does not have a finite line transversal, but for any $t\in\mathbb{N}$, every infinite subset of $\mathcal{F}$ contains $t$ sets that are pierced by a line.</description>

      <title>Online Geometric Hitting Set and Set Cover Beyond Unit Balls in $\mathbb{R}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the geometric hitting set problem in the online setup for the range space $\Sigma=({\cal P},{\cal S})$, where the set $\P\subset\mathbb{R}^2$ is a collection of $n$ points and the set $\cal S$ is a family of geometric objects in $\mathbb{R}^2$. In the online setting, the geometric objects arrive one by one. Upon the arrival of an object, an online algorithm must maintain a valid hitting set by making an irreversible decision, i.e., once a point is added to the hitting set by the algorithm, it can not be deleted in the future. The objective of the geometric hitting set problem is to find a hitting set of the minimum cardinality. Even and Smorodinsky (Discret. Appl. Math., 2014) considered an online model (Model-I) in which the range space $\Sigma$ is known in advance, but the order of arrival of the input objects in $\cal S$ is unknown. They proposed online algorithms having optimal competitive ratios of $\Theta(\log n)$ for intervals, half-planes and unit disks in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Whether such an algorithm exists for unit squares remained open for a long time. This paper considers an online model (Model-II) in which the entire range space $\Sigma$ is not known in advance. We only know the set $\cal P$ but not the set $\cal S$ in advance. Note that any algorithm for Model-II will also work for Model-I, but not vice-versa. In Model-II, we obtain an optimal competitive ratio of $\Theta(\log(n))$ for unit disks and regular $k$-gon with $k\geq 4$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$. All the above-mentioned results also hold for the equivalent geometric set cover problem in Model-II.</description>

      <title>Shortest Paths of Mutually Visible Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a set of $n$ point robots inside a simple polygon $P$, the task is to move the robots from their starting positions to their target positions along their shortest paths, while the mutual visibility of these robots is preserved. Previous work only considered two robots. In this paper, we present an $O(mn)$ time algorithm, where $m$ is the complexity of the polygon, when all the starting positions lie on a line segment $S$, all the target positions lie on a line segment $T$, and $S$ and $T$ do not intersect. We also argue that there is no polynomial-time algorithm, whose running time depends only on $n$ and $m$, that uses a single strategy for the case where $S$ and $T$ intersect.</description>

Abstract: We define bigraded persistent homology modules and bigraded barcodes of a finite pseudo-metric space X using the ordinary and double homology of the moment-angle complex associated with the Vietoris-Rips filtration of X. We prove a stability theorem for the bigraded persistent double homology modules and barcodes.</description>

      <title>Disk and Partial Disk Inspection: Worst- to Average-Case and Pareto Upper Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15391v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider $n$ unit-speed mobile agents initially positioned at the center of a unit disk, tasked with inspecting all points on the disk's perimeter. A perimeter point is considered covered if an agent located outside the disk's interior has unobstructed visibility of it, treating the disk itself as an obstacle. For $n=1$, this problem is known as the shoreline problem with a known distance. Isbell (1957) derived an optimal trajectory that minimizes the worst-case inspection time for this problem, while Gluss (1961) proposed heuristics for its average-case version. The one-agent case was originally introduced as a more tractable variant of Bellman's famous lost-in-the-forest problem.
  Our contributions are threefold. First, as a warm-up, we extend Isbell's findings by deriving worst-case optimal trajectories for partial inspection of a section of the disk, thereby providing an alternative proof of optimality for inspection with $n \geq 2$ agents. Second, we improve Gluss's bounds on the average-case inspection time under a uniform distribution of perimeter points (equivalent to randomized inspection algorithms), and we also strengthen the methodology by combining spatial discretization with Nonlinear Programming (NLP) to build feasible solutions to the continuous problem and compare them with NLP solutions. Third, we establish Pareto-optimal bounds for the multi-objective problem of jointly minimizing the worst-case and average-case inspection times.</description>
