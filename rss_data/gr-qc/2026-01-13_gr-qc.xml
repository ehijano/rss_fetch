      <title>On Causality and Predictivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Certain approaches to quantum gravity, such as the one based on the concept of purely virtual particles (fakeons), sacrifice the cause-effect relation at very small scales to reconcile renormalizability with unitarity. Other developments have also urged caution regarding the idea of causality as a fundamental principle. In this paper, we examine the problem from multiple perspectives, including locality and predictivity, and extend the existing skepticism in several directions. Emphasizing the impact of unruly "disruptors", we point out that the illusory arrow of time associated with causality and predictivity is inherently statistical. This renders the cause-effect relation strained at the microscopic level. We also show that causation is a borderline concept that demands belief in entities which can act on nature without being part of it. Ultimately, not only is renouncing microcausality a reasonable price to pay for a consistent and predictive theory of quantum gravity (as is the one based on the fakeon idea), but the very notion of causality is misleading. Resting as it does on metaphysical assumptions, it should therefore be abandoned in fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Symplectic mechanics of relativistic spinning compact bodies. III. quadratic-in-spin integrability in Type-D Einstein spacetimes: persistence and breakdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a covariant Hamiltonian formulation of the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Tulczyjew-Dixon dynamics at quadratic order in spin under the Tulczyjew-Dixon spin supplementary condition (TD SSC). In four-dimensional, type-D Einstein (vacuum/$\Lambda$-vacuum) spacetimes admitting a non-degenerate Killing-Yano (KY) tensor, we reduce via a Dirac bracket to the 10-dimensional physical phase space and model the quadratic sector with a spin-induced quadrupole characterized by a deformability $\kappa$ ($\kappa=1$ for black-hole--like; $\kappa\neq 1$ for material or exotic compact objects). For $\kappa=1$, we construct five independent first integrals -- an autonomous Hamiltonian, two KY-generated Killing invariants, a linear R\"udiger constant, and a quadratic Carter-R\"udiger constant -- establishing Liouville-Arnold integrability at quadratic order in spin. For $\kappa\neq 1$, the symmetry-generated invariants are not conserved in general and integrability does not persist at this order. The proof proceeds via covariant Poisson-bracket computations using a null bivector decomposition; Kerr is recovered as a special case. These results show that integrability can persist beyond Kerr and beyond the linear-in-spin regime, laying groundwork for symmetry-based, beyond-Kerr modelling of asymmetric-mass, spinning compact binaries.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Dynamics on a Novel $f(Q)$ Gravity Model with Recent DESI DR2 Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the cosmological viability of a modified symmetric teleparallel gravity model within the $f(Q)$ framework. We derive observational constraints on the model parameters by performing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis using a combined dataset consisting of cosmic chronometers, PantheonPlus SH0ES, and DESI BAO DR2. Our analysis yields the best-fit values for the model parameters $m=-0.386 \pm 0.090$ and $n=-1.055 \pm 0.047$, along with the cosmological parameters at present: $H_0 = 73.19 \pm 0.25$, $q_0 = -0.51 \pm 0.6$, and $\omega_{0} = -0.73 \pm 0.3$, at 68\% CL. Furthermore, we examine the physical behavior of the model, focusing on the effective equation of state and deceleration parameter. Our findings indicate that the model experiences a transition from the early deceleration phase to the late-time cosmic acceleration, and the transition occurs at a redshift $z_{tr} = 0.573$. We also analyse the $om(z)$ diagnostic, which reflects a positive slope, supporting the behavior of the equation of state parameter in the quintessence region.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Black Holes and Neutron Stars through Optical Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper employs the backward ray tracing method to study the optical images of neutron stars under the conditions of a spherical light source and a thin accretion disk, considering a polynomial equation of state given by $p = K \rho^{1 + 1/n_c}$. By numerically solving the TOV equations, we obtain the interior solutions of neutron stars for different densities. The results indicate that as the polynomial index $n_c$ increases, the mass, radius, and compactness of the neutron star all increase, which has a significant impact on its optical properties. Under the assumption that the light is truncated at the surface of the neutron star, we find that for a spherical light source, an increase in $n_c$ leads to an enlargement of the Einstein ring radius. For a thin accretion disk, the light intensity always reaches its maximum at the surface of the neutron star. The increase in $n_c$ also causes the outline of the neutron star to grow. When the observer inclination angle $\theta_o$ changes, the neutron star's outline deforms from a circular shape to a D shape, with the left side being significantly brighter than the right side. In addition, this paper also investigates the distribution characteristics of the redshift factor. At lower observer inclination angles, gravitational redshift dominates, while at higher inclination angles, the Doppler effect induces noticeable blueshift. Compared to the Schwarzschild black hole, the optical appearance of the neutron star shows significant differences. The study provides a theoretical basis for distinguishing neutron stars from black holes using high-resolution imaging and for constraining the equation of state.</description>

      <title>Probing a Lorentz-violating parameter from orbital precession of the S2 star around the galactic centre supermassive black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Testing Lorentz symmetry in strong gravitational fields provides a promising probe of extensions to general relativity. The supermassive black hole Sgr~A* and the orbit of the S-stars offer a laboratory for such tests in a regime beyond weak field limit. We analyze the S2 orbital data focusing on the Schwarzschild-like black hole within bumblebee gravity, where deviations from general relativity are encoded in a single Lorentz-violating parameter $\ell$. Using a full 14-dimensional Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis under uniform and Gaussian priors, we obtain $\ell = {-8.01 \times 10^{-5}}^{+2.77 \times 10^{-4}}_{-2.09 \times 10^{-4}} $ and $\ell = {1.00 \times 10^{-5}}^{+2.90 \times 10^{-4}}_{-2.91 \times 10^{-4}} $ at $1\sigma$ confidence level, respectively. These constraints are about three orders of magnitude tighter than those from Event Horizon Telescope imaging of Sgr~A*.</description>

      <title>Kerr-Newman-de Sitter black holes in $f(R)$ gravity with constant curvature: horizon structure and extremality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of $f(R)$ gravity with constant curvature (i.e. constant scalar curvature) admits rotating and charged black hole solutions obtained from the Kerr-Newman-(A)dS metrics of general relativity through appropriate rescalings of the metric parameters. In this paper, we focus on the Kerr-Newman-de Sitter case and present a unified analytic treatment of the horizon structure and its physical properties, allowing for a transparent comparison between general relativity and $ f(R)$ gravity with constant curvature. We solve the quartic equation determining the horizon locations and derive closed analytic expressions for the horizon radii. Focusing on extremal configurations, we obtain analytic formulas for the squared rotation parameter $ a^2 $ and the inverse square of the curvature radius $ l^{-2} $ as functions of the horizon location and the electric charge. For generic values of these parameters, the extremality conditions are non-universal, reducing to the familiar Kerr-Newman bound only in the limit of vanishing background curvature. We identify an ultra-extremal configuration in which $ a^2 $ attains its maximal value at zero charge and decreases monotonically to zero as the charge approaches its limiting value, while $ l^{-2 }$ increases correspondingly. As an illustrative example, we show that black holes with charge $ q=M/2 $ necessarily possess a minimum rotation, which emerges naturally as an intersection point in our analytic description of $ a^2 $ and $ l^{-2 }$, when embedded in a universe characterized by a critical value of $ l^{-2} $ (equivalently, the scalar curvature or the cosmological constant). Finally, we demonstrate that when the mass satisfies $ M^2= (a^2+q^2)(1-a^2/l^2)$, the quartic horizon equation factorizes, leading in the extremal regime to a chiral-like horizon structure that allows only the outer-cosmological horizon merger.</description>

      <title>Limits of vacuum-template subtraction for LISA massive black hole binary sources in realistic environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of gravitational wave (GW) dephasing due to gas accretion on the subtraction of massive black hole (MBH) binary signals over 4 yr of LISA data in the context of the global-fit. Based on state of the art predictions for the population of merging MBHs, we show that imperfect subtraction with vacuum waveform templates leaves a GW residual with an SNR of $3.2^{+5.4}_{-1.9}\times \sqrt{f_{\rm Edd} \langle \dot n \rangle/(20\, {\rm yr}^{-1})}$, where $f_{\rm Edd}$ is the typical Eddington ratio and $\langle \dot n \rangle$ the mean merger rate of LISA MBH binaries. We characterize the dependence of the residual on key population hyper-parameters, provide a simple fitting function and discuss detection and mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>Event Horizon Telescope Observational Constraints on Dymnikova-Type Non-Singular Black Holes in Higher Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black holes are among the most compelling predictions of general relativity (GR) and are now strongly supported by observations from gravitational-wave detectors and the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). While standard black hole solutions suffer from central singularities, regular black holes avoid this issue by introducing a nonsingular core. In this work, we extend the Dymnikova regular black hole to higher dimensions using a smooth matter distribution. The resulting spacetime features a de Sitter-like core and two horizons. We analyze photon motion and show that circular photon orbits remain unstable, giving rise to a well-defined black hole shadow. Our results indicate that the shadow size grows with the black hole scale but decreases slightly as the number of dimensions increases. We also investigate thermodynamic properties, including Hawking temperature and energy emission, and find a strong dependence on dimensionality. Finally, we compare our model with EHT observations to place constraints on the parameters and highlight potential observational signatures of higher-dimensional regular black holes.</description>

      <title>Quantum coherence of continuous variables in the black hole quantum atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the concept of quantum atmosphere has been introduced as a potential origin of Hawking quanta. This study investigates the properties of quantum fields by exploring the quantum coherence of a two-mode Gaussian state near a black hole, where Hawking quanta originate from the quantum atmosphere region. It is demonstrated that both physically accessible and inaccessible quantum coherence for continuous variable quantum states distinctly exhibit hallmark features of the quantum atmosphere. Specifically, the quantum coherence for these states varies continuously with changes in the normalized distance; it undergoes rapid decreases (or increases) just outside the event horizon before gradually stabilizing through subsequent increases (or decreases). This behavior contrasts with the behaviors of quantum coherence where originates solely from the black hole's event horizon. The quantum features of the fields distinctly reflect characteristics attributable to the quantum atmosphere, thereby deepening our understanding of the origins of Hawking radiation. We also find that the continuous variable coherence is highly dependent on both the squeezing parameter and field frequency of the prepared state; therefore, appropriately adjusting these values can enhance our ability to detect features within the quantum atmosphere. It is noteworthy to observe that quantum features of fields do not entirely dissipate in the quantum atmosphere region, indicating that tasks related to quantum information processing can still be executed there.</description>

      <title>Gravitational radiation reaction for compact binary systems at the fourth-and-a-half post-Newtonian order in harmonic coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the gravitational radiation-reaction (RR) force in the harmonic coordinate system at the fourth-and-a-half post-Newtonian (4.5PN) order in the case of compact binary systems. Dimensional regularization is used to treat the ultra-violet divergences which appear at that order. We prove that the RR acceleration implies the known radiation fluxes at infinity associated with energy, angular momentum, linear momentum, and center-of-mass position. As a consistency check, we verify the manifest Lorentz invariance of the RR acceleration in harmonic coordinates. Our result should be useful for comparisons with other approaches such as the gravitational self force (GSF) and the post-Minkowskian (PM) effective field theory.</description>

      <title>Reductions of Thermodynamic Phase Space for Rotating Regular Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The black hole singularity problem was proposed by Hawking and Penrose, and regular black holes serve as an important class of models to address this issue. However, the study of regular black hole thermodynamics has long faced a fundamental difficulty: an inconsistency between the Hawking temperature derived from thermodynamics and the geometrically defined Hawking temperature. To address this issue, we systematically investigated the thermodynamics of rotating regular black holes based on the method of thermodynamic phase space reduction. Our research shows that this approach naturally yields a self-consistent and complete thermodynamic description for rotating regular black holes, thereby establishing a universal thermodynamic framework for this type of black hole and laying the foundation for further research on complex thermodynamic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Boundary-only weak deflection angles from isothermal optical geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a boundary only method for computing weak gravitational deflection angles at finite source and receiver distances within the Gauss-Bonnet theorem formulation of optical geometry. Exploiting the fact that the relevant equatorial optical manifold is two dimensional, we introduce isothermal (conformal) coordinates in which the optical metric is locally conformal to a flat reference metric and the Gaussian curvature reduces to a Laplacian of the conformal factor. Such an identity converts the curvature area term in the Gauss-Bonnet theorem into a pure boundary contribution via Green/Stokes-type relations, yielding a deflection formula that depends only on boundary data and controlled closure terms. The residual normalization freedom of the isothermal radius is isolated as an additive freedom in the conformal factor and is shown to leave physical observables invariant, eliminating the need for orbit dependent calibration prescriptions. We explicitly implement the boundary only formalism in weak deflection, where the leading bending reduces to elementary one-dimensional integrals evaluated on a flat reference ray in the conformal plane, with finite distance dependence entering solely through endpoint data. We validate the construction by reproducing finite distance weak deflection for Schwarzschild, deriving the leading finite distance charge correction for Reissner-Nordstr\"om, and applying the same boundary only framework to the Kottler (Schwarzschild-de Sitter) geometry as a representative non-asymptotically flat test case, recovering the standard finite distance expansion including the explicit $\mathcal{O}(\Lambda)$ and mixed $\mathcal{O}(\Lambda M)$ contributions to the total deflection angle.</description>

      <title>Numerical Study of Polytropes with n=1 and Differential Rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solution space of differentially rotating polytropes with n=1 has been studied numerically. The existence of three different types of configurations: from spheroids to thick tori, hockey puck-like bodies and spheroids surrounded by a torus, separate from or merging with the central body has been proved. It has been shown that the last two types appear only at moderate degrees of rotation differentiality, sigma~2. Rigid-body or weakly differential rotation, as well as strongly differential, have not led to any "exotic" types of configurations. Many calculated configurations have had extremely large values of parameter tau, which has raised the question of their stability with respect to fragmentation.</description>

      <title>Note on the matter coupling in Exotic General Massive 3D Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, within exterior algebra formalism, we revisit and study the matter coupling in Exotic General Massive 3D Gravity (EGMG), previously introduced in \cite{ozkan_1}. Considering that the matter Lagrangian is both metric co-frame and connection dependent in general, we explicitly construct associated source 2-form by algebraically solving auxiliary 1-form fields in terms of gravitational field variables, energy-momentum and hyper-momentum 2-forms. It is seen that that the source 2-form involves terms that are quadratic in energy-momentum and hyper-momentum 2-forms as well as terms that depend on covariant derivatives of them. In addition, we derive the consistency relation in order that matter-coupled EGMG field equation be third-way consistent. In general, the consistency requires a particular relation that should be satisfied by energy-momentum and hyper-momentum 2-forms. We note that our construction and formalism allows to investigate non-minimal matter couplings with gravitational fields. It also enables to construct the higher order curvature extensions of EGMG.</description>

      <title>Strong Einstein-Hilbert Gravity Inflation and ACT Phenomenology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study rescaled effective single scalar field theories, and we confront these with the ACT constraint on the spectral index of the scalar primordial perturbations and the updated BICEP/Planck constraint on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. Rescaled scalar theories of gravity may be the result of an effective $f(R,\phi)$ gravity at strong curvature regimes, which may result on a rescaling of the Einstein-Hilbert term of the form $\sim \alpha R$. It turns out that canonical scalar field theories with stronger gravity compared to standard Einstein-Hilbert gravity can be compatible with the ACT and updated Planck/BICEP constraints, with stronger gravity meaning that the rescaling parameter $\alpha$ takes values smaller than unity.</description>

      <title>Viable f(R) Scenarios Unifying Inflation with Realistic Dynamical Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two $F(R)$ gravity models are tested on the basis of their viability during all stages of cosmological evolution. It is shown that these models can describe both the early-time inflationary epoch and the dark energy epoch. The models are confronted with the latest observational data, including the Pantheon+ catalogue with Type Ia supernovae, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations, the Hubble parameter estimations and data from cosmic microwave background radiation. Investigation of the viability conditions for these models, in particular, the condition $\frac{dF}{dR}&gt;0$ required a deep analysis. Both models appeared to be viable during the early-time era, but for the late-time evolution the viability conditions are not fulfilled in definite domains in the parameter spaces of these models. However the best fitted parameters, determined in confrontation with the mentioned observational data, lie far from the forbidden domains for both models. These $F(R)$ gravity models describe the observations with the large advantage over the $\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter model, not only in $\chi^2$ statistics, but also with Akaike and Bayesian information criteria. This success of the two $F(R)$ gravity scenarios is connected with their capability to mimic dynamical dark energy, similarly to models with variable equation of state, that is necessary for describing the latest Pantheon+ and DESI observational data.</description>

      <title>IndIGO-D: Probing Compact Binary Coalescences in the Decihertz GW Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study IndIGO-D, a decihertz gravitational-wave mission concept, focusing on a specific configuration in which three spacecraft fly in formation to form an L-shaped interferometer in a heliocentric orbit. The two orthogonal arms share a common vertex, providing a space-based analogue of terrestrial Michelson detectors, while operating in an optimised configuration that yields ppm-level arm-length stability. Assuming 1000 km arm length, we analyse the orbital motion and antenna response, and assess sensitivity across the [0.1 - 10] Hz band bridging LISA and next-generation ground-based interferometers. Using fiducial sensitivity curves provided by the IndIGO-D collaboration, we compute horizon distances for different source classes. Intermediate-mass black-hole binaries with masses $10^{2}$ - $10^{3} \, M_\odot$ are detectable to redshifts $z \sim 10^{3}$, complementing the reach of LISA and terrestrial detectors. Binary neutron star systems are observable to a horizon distance of $z \lesssim 0.3$, allowing continuous multi-band coverage with Voyager-class interferometers from the decihertz regime to merger. A Bayesian parameter-estimation study of a GW170817-like binary shows that the sky localization area improves from $\sim 21 \,\mathrm{deg}^2$ at one month to $0.3 \,\mathrm{deg}^2$ at six hours pre-merger! These sky areas are readily tiled by wide-field time-domain telescopes such as the Rubin Observatory, whose $9.6 \,\mathrm{deg}^2$ field of view and r-band depth enable high-cadence, repeated coverage of GW170817-like kilonovae at this distance and beyond. IndIGO-D exploits the rapid evolution of binaries in the decihertz band to bridge the gap between millihertz and terrestrial observations, enabling early warnings on timescales from months to hours and enhancing the prospects for multi-band and multi-messenger discoveries.</description>

      <title>The past stability of Kasner singularities for the $(3+1)$-dimensional Einstein vacuum spacetime under polarized $U(1)$-symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a new proof to a past stability result established in Fournodavlos-Rodnianski-Speck (arXiv:2012.05888), for Kasner solutions of the $(3+1)$-dimensional Einstein vacuum equations under polarized $U(1)$-symmetry. Our method, inspired by Beyer-Oliynyk-Olvera-Santamar{\'\i}a-Zheng (arXiv:1907.04071, arXiv:2502.09210), relies on a newly developed $(2+1)$ orthonormal-frame decomposition and a careful symmetrization argument, after which the Fuchsian techniques can be applied.
  We show that the perturbed solutions are asymptotically pointwise Kasner, geodesically incomplete and crushing at the Big Bang singularity. They are achieved by reducing the $(3+1)$ Einstein vacuum equations to a Fuchsian system coupled with several constraint equations, with the symmetry assumption playing an important role in the reduction. Using Fuchsian theory together with finite speed of constraints propagation, we obtain global existence and precise asymptotics of the solutions up to the singularities.</description>

      <title>Spacetime Quasi-normal Mode Oscillations of Anisotropic Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron star asteroseismology offers a unique opportunity to probe nuclear physics through stellar oscillations. Although the pressure inside of a neutron star is typically assumed to be isotropic, pressure anisotropy can arise from various physical mechanisms, including elasticity, viscosity, and magnetic fields. Previous studies of nonradial stellar quasi-normal mode oscillations with anisotropic pressure have focused primarily on fluid modes. In this paper, we compute, for the first time, spacetime oscillation modes (so-called w-modes) of anisotropic neutron stars. Using a perturbative framework for stellar oscillations with pressure anisotropy, developed previously by some of the authors, together with a phenomenological anisotropy model, we find that both the real and imaginary parts of the w-mode frequencies decrease as the tangential pressure becomes dominant over the radial pressure. Although we do not find any unstable w-modes within the physically viable parameter space, unstable w-modes appear in an unphysical branch of solutions when the tangential pressure strongly dominates the radial one. We also find that the relation between the real part of the w-mode frequency and the stellar compactness is quasi-universal with respect to variations in the equation of state and the degree of pressure anisotropy. In contrast, the relation between the imaginary part of the w-mode frequency and the stellar compactness depends on the degree of anisotropy, but remains equation-of-state universal when the anisotropy is fixed. Finally, we discuss potential mode crossings and the validity of certain approximations that have been shown to work well for w-mode calculations in the isotropic case.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory Freeze from Inertial Holographic Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a generalized holographic dark energy model in which the infrared cutoff depends on the Hubble parameter and its first two time derivatives. The inclusion of the $\ddot H$ term introduces a finite relaxation timescale for the horizon degrees of freedom, which can be interpreted as an effective entropic inertia of the holographic vacuum energy. The resulting background dynamics admit late--time solutions in which the cosmic expansion gradually halts.
  In the underdamped regime, the Hubble parameter undergoes exponentially damped oscillations and asymptotically approaches $H\to0$. The scale factor grows monotonically but by a finite amount, while curvature invariants decay exponentially, leading to an asymptotically Minkowski spacetime without future singularities. We confront the full nonlinear background evolution with cosmic chronometer measurements of the Hubble parameter and find good agreement with current late--time expansion data, with a reduced chi--squared $\chi^2/\nu\simeq0.52$. At observable redshifts, oscillatory features are strongly suppressed and remain consistent with existing constraints.</description>

      <title>Balance flux laws beyond general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Balance flux laws of asymptotic symmetries in general relativity provide fully non-perturbative constraint equations on gravitational strain. They have proven useful for constructing numerical gravitational waveforms and for characterizing gravitational memory. As the precision of current and future detectors continues to improve, such constraints become increasingly important for high-precision tests of gravity, including searches for deviations from general relativity. This motivates a systematic understanding of analogous balance laws in theories beyond general relativity. In this work, we investigate the existence and structure of flux laws at null infinity in diffeomorphism-invariant extensions of general relativity. Our analysis is based on the covariant phase space formalism and the definition of conserved quantities, as presented by Wald and Zoupas. For a particularly relevant class of Horndeski theories, we derive a general expression for the flux and formulate the corresponding balance equation via the associated non-conserved charges. We cross-check our general results by comparing them with previous studies of Brans-Dicke gravity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the employed methods extend straightforwardly to a broader class of diffeomorphism-invariant theories. The null part of the resulting flux laws associated with null memory is compared with and validated against the alternative derivation based on the Isaacson approach to gravitational radiation. Beyond the specific results obtained, this work is intended to serve as a practical guide for computing balance laws in generic diffeomorphism-invariant theories of gravity and paves the way for an in-depth comparison between the Isaacson approach and the covariant phase space formalism.</description>

      <title>Lorentz-violating modifications to particle dynamics, thermodynamics and vacuum energy in bumblebee gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking in bumblebee gravity modifies particle dynamics, thermodynamics, and vacuum energy around a static black hole background. Starting from the optical-mechanical correspondence, we derive a modified dispersion relation that encodes the influence of the Lorentz-violating parameter $\lambda$ on the propagation of massive and massless modes. We analyze the resulting optical properties, including the effective refractive index, group velocity, and energy-dependent time delay, and show how the non-asymptotically flat geometry reshapes signal propagation. From the same dispersion relation, we construct the interparticle potential for massive and massless excitations and evaluate the electron scattering cross section within the Born approximation, identifying characteristic Lorentz-violating corrections. We then develop a statistical-ensemble description based on the deformed energy-momentum relation and obtain analytic expressions for the thermodynamic observables of a massless bosonic gas. The pressure, mean energy, entropy, and heat capacity are examined in three representative regimes -- extremely close to the horizon, near the photon sphere, and in the asymptotic region -- where Lorentz violation systematically increase the magnitude of these quantities and leads to finite asymptotic plateaus. Finally, we analyze the vacuum state in the curved background and compute the regularized Casimir energy at zero and finite temperature.</description>

      <title>Chiroptical effect induced by gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the gravitational analog of the chiroptical effect for the first time, demonstrating that gravitational waves (GWs) can induce a reversal of photon chirality through the exchange of angular momentum, namely the spin-2-gravitation chiroptical effect. By analyzing the interaction between photon spin angular momentum (SAM) and GWs, we derive the selection rules governing this exchange, which are strictly dictated by the spin-1 and spin-2 nature of the electromagnetic and gravitational fields, respectively. We find that the gravitational chiroptical effect reflects the local nature of SAM which prevents the accumulation of gravitational perturbations over spatial phase windings, and offers a theoretically rigorous tool to probe the chiral structure of GWs. This mechanism provides a novel observational pathway to constrain modified gravity theories, measure the asymmetric properties of compact binaries, and explore parity-violating physics in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent neutron stars in a class of massive vector-tensor gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Einstein-bumblebee gravity, as a class of massive non-minimally coupled vector-tensor theories, provides a useful framework for constraining Lorentz symmetry breaking through astrophysical observations, largely due to the existence of exact static and spherically symmetric black hole solutions. These solutions are typically obtained under the assumption that the vector-field potential vanishes everywhere once the vector field acquires a nonzero radial vacuum expectation value. However, imposing this assumption globally obstructs the construction of self-consistent compact-star solutions. In this work, we elucidate the origin of this inconsistency through a detailed analysis of the field equations and construct neutron-star configurations by abandoning the global vanishing-potential assumption. Crucially, we show that even without enforcing this condition everywhere, it is violated only in the strong-field interior region and is dynamically restored in the weak-field regime by asymptotic boundary conditions at spatial infinity. As a result, consistency with existing black-hole solutions and observational constraints is preserved. Our results establish massive vector-tensor gravity as a unified, natural, and self-consistent framework for compact objects, significantly extending its astrophysical viability beyond black holes and Solar System tests.</description>

      <title>A universal lower bound on the photon sphere radius in higher-dimensional black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The photon sphere, a hypersurface of circular null geodesics, plays a fundamental role in characterizing black hole spacetimes, influencing phenomena such as black hole shadows, gravitational lensing, and quasinormal modes. While universal upper bounds on the photon sphere radius have been established for both four-dimensional and higher-dimensional black holes, the question of a corresponding lower bound in higher-dimensional black holes remains less explored. In this work, we derive a universal lower bound for the photon sphere radius in static, spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes of arbitrary dimension $n\ge 4$. Under the assumptions of the weak energy condition, a non-positive trace of the energy-momentum tensor, and a monotonicity condition on the radial pressure function $|r^{n-1}p_r(r)|$, we prove that the photon sphere radius $r_\gamma$ satisfies $r_\gamma\ge (\frac{n-1}{2})^{1/(n-3)}r_H$, where $r_H$ is the radius of the outer event horizon. For $n=4$, this reduces to the known result $r_\gamma\ge \frac{3}{2}r_H$. Our result generalizes Hod's four-dimensional theorem to higher dimensions, and provides a new geometric constraint on the structure of black holes in extended theories of gravity.</description>

      <title>Superspace worldline formalism approach to Quantum Gravity: dimensional reduction and Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the ADM formalism, we demonstrate that the Hamiltonian formulation of Quantum Gravity is exactly in the form of a worldline (WL) formalism in the superspace. We then show that the Keldysh partition function reduces to the partition function of Euclidean 3D gravity. After discussing the meaning of the time parameter, we show that in the gauge fields formalism, our Keldysh partition function reduces to a generating functional of a 2D Conformal Field Theory (CFT). This functional exhibits a minimal time-lapse proportional to the square root of the cosmological constant. From the viewpoint of the Chern-Simons/Liouville correspondence, we calculate the exchange of virtual gravitons between two massive probes from the cosmological boundary.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Collapse and Singularity Formation in Brans-Dicke Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate gravitational collapse driven solely by a self-interacting Brans--Dicke (BD) scalar field in the absence of ordinary matter. In this framework, the spacetime dynamics are governed solely by the scalar field $\Phi$, endowed with a self-interaction potential $V(\Phi)$ and non-minimally coupled to the Ricci scalar through the Brans--Dicke action. We numerically solve for the evolution of $\Phi(t)$ and the corresponding potential $V(\Phi)$ in order to track the collapse dynamics leading to singularity formation. Our analysis demonstrates that, for the energy densities $\rho \approx 1/a$ and $\rho \approx -\ln a$, the collapse inevitably leads to the formation of a central curvature singularity while consistently satisfying the weak energy condition. We further examine the causal structure of the resulting singularity and find that future-directed null geodesics originating from the singularity can propagate to future null infinity, making the singularity globally visible. The strength of the singularity is also examined by extending Tipler's strong curvature condition to the Brans--Dicke field equations. Overall, our findings indicate that gravitational collapse in scalar--tensor gravity can give rise to scenarios that challenge the Cosmic Censorship Conjecture, while underscoring the potential observational relevance of singularities formed through BD scalar-field-driven collapse.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model the inspiral and merger dynamics of two co-planar rings in Newtonian mechanics with GR motivated corrections and illustrate their similarity with those of black hole binary systems on the orbital plane. Our simulation reveals a banana-shape deformation of the ``black holes'' involved, and a typhoon-like spiral structure in the merger product. Using an eXact One-Body approach, we compute the full gravitational waveform of this process and qualitatively reproduce results consistent with those of numerical relativity. Our simulation offers a transparent link between the feature of gravitational waveforms and the internal structure of black holes, thus a complementary interpretation of physics behind numerical relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The so-called $I$-Love-$Q$ relations link some normalized versions of the moment of inertia, the Love number, and the quadrupole moment of a star. These relations, in principle, enable the inference of two of the quantities given the third. However, their use has been limited because the normalized versions of the multipole moments rely on the static mass derived from the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation, which is not directly observable. In this work, using perturbation theory, we find that the $I$-Love-$Q$ relations can also be formulated in terms of an alternative set of normalized quantities that do not depend on the static mass, but on the actual (observable) mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the motion of charged particles evolving around a magnetized Kiselev black hole, in the weak magnetic field approximation. The effective potential allows us to study the bound motion and the stable circular orbits. We analyze the impact of combined quintessence and magnetic fields on the epicyclic frequencies. Finally, we examine the periapsis shift and gravitational Larmor precession pointing out differences from the Ernst or Kiselev spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Systematic Biases in Gravitational-Wave Parameter Estimation from Neglecting Orbital Eccentricity in Space-Based Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of gravitational-wave signals is essential for reliable inference of compact-binary source parameters, particularly for future space-based detectors operating in the milli- and deci-Hertz bands. In this work, we systematically investigate the parameter-estimation biases induced by neglecting orbital eccentricity when analyzing eccentric compact-binary coalescences with quasi-circular waveform templates. Focusing on the deci-Hertz detector B-DECIGO and the milli-Hertz detector LISA, we model eccentric inspiral signals using a frequency-domain waveform that incorporates eccentricity-induced higher harmonics and the time-dependent response of spaceborne detectors. We quantify systematic biases in the chirp mass, symmetric mass ratio, and luminosity distance using both Bayesian inference and the Fisher-Cutler-Vallisneri (FCV) formalism, and assess their significance relative to statistical uncertainties. By constructing mock gravitational-wave catalogs spanning stellar-mass and massive black-hole binaries, we identify critical initial eccentricities at which systematic errors become comparable to statistical errors. We find that for B-DECIGO, even very small eccentricities, $e_0\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ at 0.1 Hz, can lead to significant biases, whereas for LISA such effects typically arise at larger eccentricities, $e_0\sim 10^{-2}-10^{-1}$ at $10^{-4}$ Hz, due to the smaller number of in-band cycles. Comparisons between FCV predictions and full Bayesian analyses demonstrate good agreement within the regime where waveform mismatches remain small, especially when extrinsic parameters are pre-aligned to minimize mismatches. Our results highlight the necessity of incorporating eccentricity in waveform models for future space-based gravitational-wave observations.</description>

      <title>Constraining Inflation Models with Spinning Voids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a powerful new diagnostics by which the running of scalar spectral index of primordial density fluctuations can be tightly and independently constrained. This new diagnostics utilizes coherent rotation of void galaxies, which can be observed as redshift asymmetry in opposite sides dichotomized by the projected spin axes of hosting voids. Comparing the numerical results from the AbacusSummit of cosmological simulations, we derive a non-parametric model for the redshift asymmetry distribution of void galaxies, which turns out to be almost universally valid for a very broad range of cosmologies including dynamic dark energy models with time-dependent equation of states as well as the $\Lambda$CDM models with various initial conditions. We discover that the universality of this model breaks down only if the running of scalar spectral index deviates from zero, detecting a consistent trend that a more positive (negative) running yields a lower (higher) redshift asymmetry of voids than the model predictions. Given that non-standard inflations usually predict non-zero runnings of the spectral index and that the redshift asymmetry distribution of voids is a readily observable quantity, we conclude that this new diagnostics will pave another path toward understanding the true mechanism of inflation.</description>

Abstract: The current standard model of cosmology assumes that the majority of matter in the Universe is made of dark matter, and that the latter is fundamentally different from ordinary matter. Dark matter can in principle explain the rotation of galaxies, the gravitational lensing from galaxy clusters or the appearance of the cosmic microwave background, the oldest light in the Universe. But does dark matter really exist? Here, we review the history of this concept and its implications for the formation and evolution of galaxies. We also consider the questions that remain, the limitations of the model, and present alternative theories, in particular modifications to the gravitional law that would -- perhaps -- make it possible to do without it.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Corrected Evaporation and Absorption Cross-Section of Near-Extremal Rotating Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the Hawking evaporation history of low-temperature rotating black holes by taking into consideration the strong quantum fluctuations known to be present in the near-horizon, near-$\mathrm{AdS_2}$ throat region governed by an effective action that includes Schwarzian and two gauge modes. Imposing compatibility of this quantum framework with the semiclassical results creates a novel link between the particle angular momentum and the black hole electric charge before and after emission, leading to a nontrivial interplay between the superradiance effect and other channels. We evaluate single scalar (neutral and charged) emission of Kerr-Newman and single and di-particle emission of photons, gravitons and spinors in the Kerr spacetime. We uncover that quantum corrections may affect late time evaporation rates, which further slows down the whole evaporation process because of the near-balance between the $s$-wave channel and the superradiance channel. Specifically, we find energy decay of the form $E(t)\sim t^{-8/21}$ for scalar emission of a small, slowly rotating and charged black hole which differs from the analogous spherically symmetric quantum correction of $E(t)\sim t^{-2/5}$ already suppressed with respect to the semiclassical rate of $E(t)\sim t^{-1}$. We also discuss the quantum cross section for rotating black holes and point out various new features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a unified framework of geometrodynamics based on the Finsler geometry to reveal the relationship between spacetime and dynamics.The Lagrangian of electron in electromagnetic field as the Finsler function gives the Finslerian metric, which modifies spacetime metric in the Finsler-Randers space. The geodesic equation gives the effective mass, forces, and effective (or geometric) fields. Using the Chern connection, we construct the generalized Einstein-Maxwell equations. In the local natural basis, we give generalized Maxwell equations and wave equations. We find that the geometric field couples with electromagnetic field and gives effective charges and currents. We analyze several typical cases, such as flat spacetime, vacuum and Berwald structure. We find that the electromagnetic field vanishes, but there still exists the magnetic potential in the Berwald space. These results provide some hints to understand some puzzles, such as axion and dark energy. These formulations stimulate some clues to explore deeper geometric structures behind physical phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum structure of spacetime at fundamental scales via a novel, Lorentz-invariant noncommutative coordinate framework. Building on insights from noncommutative geometry, spectral theory, and algebraic quantum field theory, we systematically construct a quantum spacetime algebra whose geometric and causal properties are derived from first principles. Using the Weyl algebra formalism and the Gelfand--Naimark--Segal (GNS) construction, we rigorously define operator-valued coordinates that respect Lorentz symmetry and encode quantum gravitational effects through nontrivial commutation relations. We show how the emergent quantum spacetime exhibits minimal length effects, which deliver both classical Minkowski distances and quantum corrections proportional to the Planck length squared. Furthermore, we establish that noncommutativity respects a fuzzy form of causality, where the quantum causal structure gives back the light cone in the classical limit, vanishing for spacelike separations and encoding a time orientation for timelike intervals.</description>

      <title>Strong Evidence for Dark Sector Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent DESI baryon acoustic oscillation data reveal deviations from $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, conventionally attributed to dynamical dark energy (DE). We demonstrate that these deviations are equally, if not better, explained by interactions between dark matter and dark energy (IDE), without requiring a time-varying DE equation of state. Using a unified framework, we analyze two IDE models -- coupled quintessence and coupled fluid -- against the latest CMB (Planck, ACT, SPT), DESI BAO, and SN (including DES-Dovekie recalibrated) data. Both IDE scenarios show robust evidence for non-vanishing interactions at the 3-5$\sigma$ level, with marginalized constraints significantly deviating from the $\Lambda$CDM limit. This preference persists even under DES-Dovekie SN recalibration, which weakens dynamical DE evidence. Crucially, for the same number of free parameters, IDE models provide fits to low- and high-redshift data that match or exceed the performance of the CPL dynamical DE parametrization. Our results establish IDE as a physically motivated alternative to dynamical DE, highlighting the necessity of future cosmological perturbation measurements (e.g., weak lensing, galaxy clustering) to distinguish between these paradigms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In scenarios where the Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaks after inflation, small-scale axion inhomogeneities may gravitationally collapse into bound structures. The evolution of these systems is typically modeled through cosmological perturbation theory applied to the Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations. In the non-relativistic regime, this framework reduces to the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson or Schr\"odinger-Poisson equations, depending on whether axion self-interactions are taken into account. In this work, a non-minimal gravitational coupling term $\xi R \phi^4$ is included into the axion's relativistic action as a way to introduce a gravitationally mediated pairwise interaction. By performing a perturbative expansion and subsequently taking the non-relativistic limit, an alternative set of equations that govern the early stages of structure formation is obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a stationary quantum system consisting of two non-interacting yet entangled subsystems, $\Xi$ and $\Gamma$. We identify a quantum theory characterizing $\Xi$ such that, in the quantum-to-classical crossover of the composite system, $\Gamma$ behaves as a test particle within the gravitational field of a Schwarzschild Black Hole (SBH) near its event horizon. We then show that this same quantum theory naturally provides a representation of $\Xi$ in terms of bosonic modes, whose features match those of the Hawking radiation; this facilitates the establishment of precise relations between the phenomenological parameters of the SBH and the microscopic details of the quantum model for $\Xi$. Finally, we recognize that the conditions used to characterize $\Gamma$ and $\Xi$ coincide with those required by the Page and Wootters mechanism for identifying an evolving system and an associated clock. This leads us to discuss how the quantum model for $\Xi$ endows the SBH with all the characteristics of a "perfect" clock.</description>

      <title>Modified Gravity and the Origin of the Excess Radio Galaxy Number-Count Dipole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent analyses of wide-area radio-galaxy surveys have reported a statistically significant excess in the cosmic number-count dipole, with an amplitude exceeding the purely kinematic expectation of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model by a factor of $\sim 3$--$4$, quoted at a significance level of up to $5.4\sigma$. While residual observational systematics and local-structure effects cannot be definitively excluded, this result motivates the exploration of alternative physical interpretations beyond the minimal $\Lambda$CDM framework. We investigate whether Scalar--Tensor--Vector Gravity (STVG-MOG) can provide a consistent explanation for an enhanced large-scale anisotropic dipole without violating existing constraints from early-universe cosmology, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) dipole, galaxy dynamics, weak lensing, or the observed late-time matter power spectrum. The radio number-count dipole probes ultra-large-scale, anisotropic structure and coherent gravitational response, rather than virialized dynamics or linear growth alone. In STVG-MOG, a scale- and time-dependent effective gravitational coupling preserves standard cosmological evolution at early times and on small to intermediate scales, while amplifying gravitational response on gigaparsec scales. This scale-selective enhancement can increase the large-scale structure contribution to the radio dipole without overproducing power on smaller scales. If the observed dipole excess reflects a physical cosmological signal rather than residual systematics, STVG-MOG offers a viable and testable alternative interpretation. It is demonstrated that the radio dipole anomaly provides a novel probe of gravitational physics on the largest observable scales.</description>

      <title>Tachyonic gravitational dark matter production after inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel gravitational mechanism for the non-thermal production of dark matter driven by curvature-induced tachyonic instabilities after inflation. Departing from the commonly studied non-minimal couplings to gravity, our framework considers a real spectator scalar field coupled quadratically to spacetime curvature invariants. We show that the rapid reorganization of spacetime curvature at the end of inflation can dynamically render the dark matter field tachyonic, triggering a short-lived phase of spontaneous symmetry breaking and explosive particle production. As a concrete and theoretically controlled example, we focus on the Gauss-Bonnet topological invariant. By combining analytical estimates with fully non-linear $3+1$ classical lattice simulations, we track the out-of-equilibrium evolution of the system and compute the resulting dark matter abundance. We find that this purely gravitational mechanism can robustly reproduce the observed dark matter relic density over a wide range of masses and inflationary scales, providing also a simple fitting function that enables a lattice-independent application of our results.</description>

      <title>Learning the relations between neutron star and nuclear matter properties with symbolic regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equation of state (EOS) of dense matter in neutron stars (NSs) remains uncertain, particularly at supra-nuclear densities where complex nuclear interactions and the potential presence of exotic matter, like hyperons, come into play. The complex relationships existing between nuclear matter and neutron star properties are investigated. The focus is on their nonlinearities and interdependencies. In our analysis, we apply a machine learning algorithm known as symbolic regression, paired with principal component analysis, to datasets generated from Bayesian inference over relativistic mean-field models. A systematic Principal Component Analysis has allowed to break down the percentage contribution of each element or feature in the relationships obtained. This study examines two main models (datasets): the NL model, which includes nucleonic degrees of freedom; and the NL-hyp model, which includes hyperons in addition to nucleons. Our analysis confirms a robust correlation between the tidal deformability of a 1.4 \(M_\odot\) neutron star and $\beta$-equilibrium pressure at twice the nuclear saturation density. This correlation remains once hyperons are included. The contribution of the different nuclear matter properties at saturation to the radius and tidal deformability was calculated. It was shown that the isovector properties have the largest impact, with a contribution of about 90\%. We also studied the relationship between the proton fraction at different densities and various symmetry energy parameters defined at saturation density. For the hyperon data set, we took into account the effects of the negatively charged hyperon $\Xi$ in order to recover the relationships. Our study reveals the individual impact of various symmetry energy parameters on proton fractions at different densities.</description>

Abstract: Self-similar quasicrystals (like the famous Penrose and Ammann-Beenker tilings) are exceptional geometric structures in which long-range order, quasiperiodicity, non-crystallographic orientational symmetry, and discrete scale invariance are tightly interwoven in a beautiful way. In this paper, we show how such structures may be generalized from Euclidean space to Minkowski spacetime. We construct the first examples of such Lorentzian quasicrystals (the spacetime analogues of the Penrose or Ammann-Beenker tilings), and point out key novel features of these structures (compared to their Euclidean cousins). We end with some (speculative) ideas about how such spacetime quasicrystals might relate to reality. This includes an intriguing scenario in which our infinite $(3+1)$D universe is embedded (like one of our spacetime quasicrystal examples) in a particularly symmetric $(9+1)$D torus $T^{9,1}$ (which was previously found to yield the most symmetric toroidal compactification of the superstring). We suggest how this picture might help explain the mysterious seesaw relationship $M_{\rm Pl}M_{\rm vac}\approx M_{\rm EW}^{2}$ between the Planck, vacuum energy, and electroweak scales ($M_{\rm Pl}$, $M_{\rm vac}$, $M_{\rm EW}$).</description>

      <title>Popcorn in the sky: Identifying primordial black holes in the gravitational-wave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are possible sources of a gravitational-wave background (GWB), detectable with the next observing runs of LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA. In case of a detection, it will be crucial to distinguish the possible sources of this GWB. One under-explored possibility is to exploit the duty cycle that quantifies the number of sources present in the time domain signal, which can be very different depending on the nature and population of the sources. We compute the duty cycle for a realistic population of PBH binaries, isolating the shot-noise, popcorn and continuous contributions to the GWB. We identify the dependence of the duty cycle on the signal frequency, duration and amplitude as a crucial metric for distinguishing PBHs from other sources in the GWB and constraining PBH models. Our work motivates the development of specific analysis tools to extract these observables, in order to unlock new cosmological insights with upcoming GW data.</description>

      <title>Slowly rotating charges from Weyl double copy for Kerr black hole with Chern-Simons correction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Weyl double copy builds the relation between gauge theory and gravity theory, especially the correspondence between gauge solutions and gravity solutions. In this paper, we obtain the slowly rotating charge solutions from Weyl double copy for the Kerr black hole with small Chern-Simons correction. Based on the Weyl double copy relation, for the Petrov type D solution, we find the additional correction to the electromagnetic field strength tensor of rotating charge. For the Petrov type I solution, we find that the additional electromagnetic field strength tensors have the exogenous properties, while the total sources vanish at the leading order.</description>

      <title>Dynamical systems approach to Cold and Warm Inflation within slow-roll and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10454v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically present a new dynamical systems approach to standard inflationary processes and their variants as constant-roll inflation. Using the techniques presented in our work one can in general investigate the attractor nature of the inflationary models in the phase space. We have compactified the phase space coordinates, wherever necessary, and regulated the nonlinear differential equations, constituting the autonomous system of equations defining the dynamical system, at the cost of a new redefined time variable which is a monotonic increasing function of the standard time coordinate. We have shown that in most of the relevant cases the program is executable although the two time coordinates may show different durations of cosmological events. If one wishes one can revert back to the cosmological time via an inverse transformation. The present work establishes a standard norm for studying dynamical as well as stability issues in any new inflationary system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12243v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a numerical investigation of primordial black hole (PBH) formation from super-horizon curvature perturbations and the subsequent generation and propagation of sound waves, which can serve as a new source of stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs) presented in a companion letter. Using the Misner-Sharp formalism with an excision technique, our simulations extend to significantly later times than previous work and indicate that the near-critical perturbations produce a distinct compression wave featuring both overdense and underdense shells, while significantly supercritical perturbations yield only an underdense shell. We also show that a softer equation of state suppresses the formation of compression waves. Furthermore, the comoving thickness of sound shells remains nearly constant during propagation and scales with the Hubble radius at horizon re-entry, thereby serving as a key link between the gravitational-wave peak frequency and PBH mass in the companion letter. These results offer new insights into the dynamics of PBH formation and suggest potential observational signatures of PBHs in the gravitational wave (GW) spectrum from associated sound waves.</description>

      <title>Enhancing gravitational-wave detection: a machine learning pipeline combination approach with robust uncertainty quantification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17587v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave data from advanced-era interferometric detectors consists of background Gaussian noise, frequent transient artefacts, and rare astrophysical signals. Multiple search algorithms exist to detect the signals from compact binary coalescences, but their varying performance complicates interpretation. We present a machine learning-driven approach that combines results from individual pipelines and utilises conformal prediction to provide robust, calibrated uncertainty quantification. Using simulations, we demonstrate improved detection efficiency and apply our model to GWTC-3, enhancing confidence in multi-pipeline detections, such as the sub-threshold binary neutron star candidate GW200311_103121.</description>

      <title>Charged wormholes in (anti-)de Sitter spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a family of charged, traversable wormhole solutions in the presence of a cosmological constant. In de Sitter spacetime, two types of wormhole throats can exist--referred to as typical and cosmological throat--located at small and large radial values, respectively. In anti-de Sitter spacetime, the throat geometry allows for positive, zero, or negative curvature, enabling the possibility of an infinite throat area. We analyze the flare-out condition, a key requirement for the existence of traversable wormholes, which imposes constraints on the equation of state parameters governing the supporting matter. These solutions are shown to be of Petrov type D. Furthermore, we examine radial geodesics of null and timelike particles. In the de Sitter case, particles traverse the wormhole, passing from one throat to the other. In contrast, in the anti-de Sitter case, particles exhibit recurrent oscillatory motion between two asymptotic regions, cyclically disappearing and reappearing across the throats.</description>

      <title>DSR-relativistic spacetime picture and the phenomenology of Planck-scale-modified time dilation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The most active area of research in quantum-gravity phenomenology investigates the possibility of Planck-scale-modified dispersion relations, focusing mainly on two alternative scenarios: the "LIV" scenario, characterized by a specific mechanism of breakdown of relativistic symmetries, and the "DSR" scenario, which preserves overall relativistic invariance but with deformed laws of relativistic transformation. Two recent studies of modified dispersion relations, one relying on Finsler geometry and one based on heuristic reasoning, raised the possibility of potentially observable effects for time dilation and argued that this might apply also to the LIV and DSR scenarios. We observe that the description of Lorentz transformations in the LIV scenario is such that time dilation cannot be modified. The DSR scenario allows for modifications of time dilation, and establishing their magnitude required us to obtain novel results on the effects of finite DSR boosts in the spacetime sector, with results showing in particular that the modification of time dilation is too small for experimental testing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stability of thin shell wormholes and black holes to linearized spherically symmetric perturbations about a static equilibrium is analyzed. Thin shell formalism is explored and junctions formed from combinations of Schwarzschild, Schwarzschild - de Sitter, and Schwarzschild - anti-de Sitter, as well as Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetimes are considered. The regions of stability for these different combinations are thoroughly described and plotted as a function of mass ratios of the Schwarzschild masses and radii of the wormhole throats. A taxonomy of the qualitative features of the various configurations and parameter spaces is developed, illustrating the stability regions when present. The considered wormholes are all found to be unstable in the causal region.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic quasinormal modes, echoes, and black hole spectral instability: a brief review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11663v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a short review of the analytical aspects of recent progress in the study of black hole spectral instability and its potential observational consequences. This topic, inspired by earlier foundational works, has attracted considerable attention in the recent literature. It has been demonstrated that both the low-lying modes and high overtones of black hole quasinormal spectra can be substantially influenced by small deformations in the effective potential of the wave equation that describes black hole perturbations. The temporal evolution of gravitational wave signals is primarily governed by the first few low-lying quasinormal modes. In contrast, the asymptotic behavior of high overtones is closely associated with the phenomenon of black hole echoes. We review relevant studies on spectral instability in both regimes, highlighting their potential to produce substantial observational signatures in gravitational wave data. Additionally, recent proposals of Regge poles and reflectionless modes as alternative stable observables for probing black hole spacetimes are summarized.</description>

      <title>There and back again: Outspiraling motion in non-Kerr compact objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Keplerian dynamics, a test body orbiting a point particle in circular motion has a monotonically increasing frequency, with decreasing radius. If a dissipative channel is introduced, such as gravitational wave (GW) emission, under the quadrupole approximation, the corresponding GW strain has an ever-increasing frequency with time. A similar statement holds for equatorial motion of a test particle on the Kerr manifold, except such inspiral is cut off at the ISCO, wherein stable circular orbits cease to exist and a plunge is expected. We analyze circular timelike orbits in generic spinning spacetimes and study the conditions in which exotic motion can occur, due to the presence of non-Kerr features. In particular, we derive conditions under which an inspiral towards a compact object is naturally followed by an outspiral motion, and give concrete examples as well as the corresponding GW phenomenology. This analysis serves both as a theoretical exploration of non-Kerrness as well as an example of a concrete smoking gun of exotic spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Stable black holes in lower dimensional $f(\mathbb{Q})$ non-metric gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16679v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate exact charged and uncharged black hole solutions in a (2+1)-dimensional spacetime within the framework of quadratic form of $f(\mathbb{Q})$ symmetric teleparallel gravity, where $\mathbb{Q}$ is the non-metricity scalar. By adopting spherical symmetry and considering both vanishing and non-vanishing electromagnetic fields, we derive new classes of black hole solutions and analyze their geometric and physical properties. The study demonstrates that the inclusion of quadratic corrections in the gravitational Lagrangian significantly modifies the structure of solutions, producing deviations from the standard BTZ geometry. Invariants such as curvature and non-metricity scalars are calculated to classify the singularity structure and spacetime behavior. Thermodynamic quantities, including Hawking temperature, entropy, and heat capacity, are computed, showing consistency with the first law of black hole thermodynamics. Furthermore, we examine the geodesic motion of test particles and derive the effective potential to explore the stability of photon orbits. A notable outcome is the identification of weaker black hole singularities in comparison to General Relativity, attributed to the non-metricity corrections. The possibility of multi-horizon configurations is also explored. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the gravitational, thermodynamic, and dynamical features of lower-dimensional black holes in $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity and highlights their distinct characteristics with respect to General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Kerr black hole: Tsallis-Cirto composition law and entropy quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00748v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The processes of splitting and merging of black holes obey the composition law generated by the Tsallis-Cirto $\delta=2$ statistics. The same composition law expresses the full entropy of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole via the entropies of its outer and inner horizons. He we apply this composition law to the entropy of the Kerr black hole. As distinct from Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole, where the full entropy depends only on mass $M$ and does not depend on its charge $Q$, the entropy of Kerr black hole is the sum of contributions from its mass $M$ and angular momentum $J$, i.e. $S(M,J)=S(M,0) + 4\pi \sqrt{J(J+1)}$. Here $S(M,0)$ is the entropy of the Schwarzschild black hole. This demonstrates that when the Kerr black hole with $J\gg 1$ absorbs or emits a massless particle with spin $s_z=\pm 1/2$, its entropy changes by $|\Delta S| = 2\pi$. We also considered the quantization of entropy suggested by the toy model, in which the black hole thermodynamics is represented by the ensemble of the Planck-scale black holes -- Planckons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we use the weak cosmic censorship conjecture(WCC) to constrain black hole solutions in modified gravity theories. While Wald showed that extremal Kerr-Newman black holes in general relativity cannot be overcharged by test charged particles, this protection may fail in theories beyond general relativity. We have considered generic rotating black hole solutions beyond the Kerr-Newman family and examined particle absorption processes that could lead to overcharging and the emergence of naked singularities. Identifying regions of parameter space where WCC is violated allows us to place direct, physically motivated bounds on deviations from general relativity.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty in predicting the stochastic gravitational wave background from compact binary coalescences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stochastic gravitational-wave background from compact binary coalescences is expected to be the first detectable stochastic signal via cross-correlation searches with terrestrial detectors. It encodes the cumulative merger history of stellar-mass binaries across cosmic time, offering a unique probe of the high-redshift Universe. However, predicting the background spectrum is challenging due to numerous modeling choices, each with distinct uncertainties. In this work, we present a comprehensive forecast of the astrophysical gravitational-wave background from binary black holes, binary neutron stars, and neutron star-black hole systems. We systematically assess the impact of uncertainties in population properties, waveform features, and the modeling of the merger rate evolution. By combining all uncertainties, we derive credible bands for the background spectrum, spanning approximately an order of magnitude in the fractional energy density. These results provide thorough predictions to facilitate the interpretation of current upper limits and future detections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational wave echos from the coalescence of black hole binaries are often viewed as signals beyond general relativity or standard model. In this work, we show that these echos are inevitable in the black holes coalescence described by standard general relativity. This is because it is the physical black holes formed through gravitational collapse serve as the true description of astronomical black holes. For physical black holes, only their asymptotic structure before the horizon forms are detectible to the outside probes. Here, by investigating the scattering of a gravitational wave burst on a physical black hole and pay special attention to the echos in the waveform, we uncover distinct features of the echos both in the time and frequency domains.</description>

      <title>Relativistic framework for high-precision GNSS processing in GCRS/BCRS with extension to cislunar space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an implementation-oriented relativistic modeling framework for high-precision GNSS processing consistent with the IAU-adopted Barycentric and Geocentric Celestial Reference Systems (BCRS/GCRS) and their associated time scales (TCB/TDB and TCG/TT). We derive explicit ${\cal O}(c^{-2})$ transformations for position, velocity, and acceleration between TT-compatible GCRS quantities and TDB-compatible BCRS quantities, and provide screened operational forms with conservative remainder bounds that quantify truncation errors in sub-centimeter orbit modeling and retain the term order required by $10^{-16}$-class fractional-frequency transfer. We implement a BCRS-native processing option in JPL's GipsyX and validate it via a 24~h round-trip GCRS$\rightarrow$BCRS propagation-and-transform closure test at the few-mm level, demonstrating internal consistency of the dynamical model and the state transformations. To support emerging Earth-Moon applications, we define a Lunicentric Celestial Reference System (LCRS), its coordinate time (TCL), and a scaled lunar-surface time (TL), and specify a minimal near-rectilinear halo orbit (NRHO)-like regression test that exercises the BCRS$\leftrightarrow$LCRS transformation chain together with the 1PN barycentric light-time model. End-to-end cislunar navigation performance additionally depends on signal availability and estimation strategy; the present work provides the relativistic reference-frame and time-transfer infrastructure needed to model observables at the centimeter and tens-of-picoseconds level.</description>

      <title>The Infrared Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08050v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a mesoscopic framework in which the cosmological exterior is treated as an open quantum subsystem coupled to horizon degrees of freedom. Although local conservation laws satisfy $\nabla_\mu\langle J^\mu\rangle=0$, transport of baryon number across horizons removes conserved charges from the observer--accessible sector, producing effective depletion in exterior densities. Global unitarity therefore requires compensating source terms in the reduced exterior continuity equations. We show that relativistic causality forces this compensation to occur through long--wavelength geometric excitations: only infrared modes can restore entropy and charge while remaining outside the causal wedge of the infalling matter. An infrared return channel thus emerges as a generic feature of horizon--coupled semiclassical gravity.
  The second ingredient is a Carnot--Carath\'eodory (CC) tangent geometry, whose mesoscopic scale $\sigma$ governs both infrared mode excitation and the kinematics of photon and matter propagation. In this setting, photon trajectories follow recurrent horizontal geodesics, producing an effective cosmic cavity whose stationary state is a Planck spectrum characterized by $\sigma$. The same scale modifies large--radius circular motion in a manner consistent with flattened galactic rotation curves. Horizon thermodynamics and mesoscopic balance laws then link $\sigma$ to the cosmic expansion rate, yielding $H\sim\sigma$ and a unified infrared structure underlying photon equilibrium, baryon balance, and large--scale kinematics.</description>

      <title>Advantages and disadvantages of maximally entangled states in dilaton black hole background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate quantum entanglement and coherence for four classes of Bell-like fermionic states in the vicinity of the event horizon of a Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GHS) dilaton black hole. Contrary to the common expectation that maximally entangled states always provide superior quantum resources, our results show that their entanglement can be lower than that of suitably chosen non-maximally entangled states in this curved spacetime background. This reveals that non-maximally entangled states may offer operational advantages for entanglement-based tasks under gravitational effects. In contrast, quantum coherence exhibits monotonic behavior: larger initial coherence leads to systematically enhanced robustness against the dilaton induced degradation. These results indicate that the optimal choice of initial quantum states depends sensitively on the specific quantum resource, either quantum entanglement or quantum coherence, required for quantum information processing near a dilaton black hole.</description>

      <title>A Circular Disformal Kerr Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kerr solution is the cornerstone of General Relativity (GR) for modelling astrophysical rotating black holes and for testing GR through gravitational-wave observations and black hole imaging. Understanding how the Kerr geometry is modified in alternative theories of gravity is therefore a crucial step toward constraining possible deviations from GR. Despite their importance, exact analytical solutions describing rotating black holes in modified gravity are rare, limiting our ability to explore novel phenomenology and to design robust observational tests of new physics. In this work, we present a new exact rotating black hole solution within a specific scalar-tensor theory belonging to the Horndeski class. The solution is obtained via a disformal transformation acting on a Kerr stealth black hole. Crucially, unlike previous constructions, the disformal transformation of our chosen seed configuration preserves circularity, ensuring that many of the geometrical and physical properties that make the Kerr spacetime so compelling are retained. We refer to the resulting geometry as the Circular Disformal Kerr solution. Remarkably, key features such as the structure of Killing horizons, the ergosphere, and the absence of causality violations closely mirror those of the Kerr metric. The spacetime is algebraically general, corresponding to Petrov type I. This new exact solution therefore provides a rare example of a rotating black hole beyond GR that closely mimics the Kerr geometry, offering a valuable theoretical laboratory to investigate the phenomenology of Kerr-like black holes in modified gravity.</description>

      <title>Theory-independent randomness generation from spatial symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.14811v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a fundamental relation between the structures of physical space and of quantum theory: the set of quantum correlations in a rotational prepare-and-measure scenario can be derived from covariance alone, without assuming quantum physics. To show this, we consider a semi-device-independent randomness generation scheme where one of two spatial rotations is performed on an otherwise uncharacterized preparation device, and one of two possible measurement outcomes is subsequently obtained. An upper bound on a theory-independent notion of spin is assumed for the transmitted physical system. It turns out that this determines the set of quantum correlations and the amount of certifiable randomness in this setup exactly. Interestingly, this yields the basis of a theory-independent protocol for the secure generation of random numbers. Our results support the conjecture that the symmetries of space and time determine at least part of the probabilistic structure of quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Corrections to the Black hole entropy from a Bose Einstein condensate: a semi-classical phenomenological approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we obtain logarithmic corrections to the black hole entropy. Motivated by our recent proposal concerning the nature of the degrees of freedom leading to the black hole entropy in terms of a Bose Einstein (BEC) condensate of gravitons, we study how to introduce logarithmic corrections. In fact we show that, after modifying the internal energy by means of simple by physically sound arguments dictated by ordinary quantum mechanics and possible non-commutative effects at Planckian scales, a logarithmic term does appear in the Bekenstein Hawking entropy law. We also obtain that the entropy $S_{BH}$ of a ball of Planckian areal radius is $2\pi K_B$, i.e. $S_{BH}(R=L_P)=2\pi K_B$. Our approach show that the possibility that the interior of a black hole is composed with a BEC of gravitons is a viable physically motivated possibility.</description>

      <title>The Mechanism behind the Information Encoding for Islands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08703v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement islands are subregions in a gravitational universe whose information is fully encoded in a disconnected non-gravitational system away from it. In the context of the black hole information paradox, entanglement islands state that the information about the black hole interior is encoded in the early-time Hawking radiation. Nevertheless, it was unclear how this seemingly nonlocal information encoding emerges from a manifestly local theory. In this paper, we provide an answer to this question by uncovering the mechanism behind this information encoding scheme. As we will see, the early understanding that graviton is massive in island models plays an essential role in this mechanism. As an example, we will discuss how this mechanism works in detail in the Karch-Randall braneworld. This study also suggests the potential importance of this mechanism to the ER=EPR conjecture.</description>

Abstract: We present the Dirac Hamiltonian formalism for a pair of $1$-form fields with a topological-like potential coupled to first-order gravity in three-dimensional spacetime. By considering the complete phase space, we derive the full structure of the physical constraints, including both primary and secondary ones; analyze their consistency conditions; classify them into first- and second-class; and compute their Poisson-bracket algebra. Our analysis confirms the absence of local degrees of freedom, consistent with the topological nature of the model's action. Furthermore, we construct the canonical generator for gauge transformations and demonstrate that, through appropriate gauge parameter mappings, these transformations recover the full diffeomorphism and Poincar\'e symmetries of the Lagrangian formulation. Finally, we explicitly compute the Dirac brackets, establishing the symplectic structure of the reduced phase space.</description>

      <title>Confronting Mukhanov Parametrization of Inflationary Equation-of-State with ACT-DR6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a simple yet effective semi-analytical approach to confront Mukhanov Parametrization of inflationary equation-of-state, $1+\omega =\frac{\beta}{({N}+1)^\alpha}$, with the latest ACT-DR6 data employing Hamilton-Jacobi formulation. We find that equation-of-state formalism comes up with excellent fit to the latest data. In the process we are also able to put stringent constraint on the two model parameters. In order to get the bounds of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ we have also made use of the recent finding $r&lt;0.032$. We have further utilized results from the joint analysis of ACT-DR6, Planck-2018 and DESI-Y1 data to find the observationally viable region for $\alpha$ and $\beta$. We have also employed the predictions on primordial gravity waves from forthcoming CMB missions in the likes of CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD along with results from the combination of ACT-DR6, Planck-2018 and DESI-Y1 data to further restrict the model parameters. We find that detection of gravity waves would help us narrow the viable parameter space for Mukhanov parametrization. But in the absence of detection of primordial gravity waves signal by those CMB missions parameter space is reduced significantly for $\beta$, while the range for $\alpha$ is slightly increased. In addition we observe that, $\alpha$ is primarily dependent on the observationally viable range for scalar spectral index while other model parameter $\beta$ is resting heavily on the restriction upon the amplitude of primordial gravity waves. We find that equation-of-state formalism has a wide range of parameter values consistent with recent observational data set along with futuristic CMB missions in the likes of CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Normal Modes and Nonlinear Electrodynamics in Black Hole Phase Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00404v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the connection between thermodynamic phase transitions and quasi-normal modes (QNMs) in charged black holes with a positive curvature constant, within the framework of $F(R)$-Euler-Heisenberg gravity. Nonlinear electromagnetic fields lead to rich thermodynamic phase structures and significantly affect the QNMs of massless scalar fields. By analyzing the QNMs spectrum, we find that the transition point marking the disappearance of the divergence in the QNMs slope parameter $K$ aligns with the change of the thermodynamic phase structure described by the heat capacity, within the bounds of computational uncertainty. This precise matching holds under variations of the curvature parameter and charge. Furthermore, we show that larger angular quantum number $l$ diminishes this correspondence, while higher overtone number $n$ restores it beyond a threshold. These findings demonstrate that thermodynamic phase transitions of black holes carry embedded dynamical information, uncovering a fundamental link between black hole thermodynamic and dynamical properties.</description>

      <title>Unitary equivalence in Generalized Uncertainty Principle theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the issue of unitary equivalence within Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) theories in the one-dimensional case. For a deformed Heisenberg algebra, its representation in terms of Hilbert space and conjugate operators is not uniquely determined, raising the question of whether different realizations of the same algebra are equivalent and describe the same physics. After proposing a definition of a quantum GUP theory, we establish conditions for unitary equivalence. Using this framework, we rigorously prove that two commonly used representations are unitarily equivalent, specifying the conditions under which this equivalence holds. We demonstrate this equivalence explicitly by providing a unitary map and showing how both GUP formulations yield the same physical results in two examples: the quantum harmonic oscillator and a free-falling particle. Finally, we discuss a case in which equivalence fails, suggesting that a generalization of the Stone-von Neumann theorem may not be possible within the GUP framework under our definition of unitary equivalence.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{Jipole}$: A Differentiable $\texttt{ipole}$-based Code for Radiative Transfer in Curved Spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent imaging of supermassive black holes by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has relied on exhaustive parameter-space searches, matching observations to large, precomputed libraries of theoretical models. As observational data become increasingly precise, the limitations of this computationally expensive approach grow more acute, creating a pressing need for more efficient methods. In this work, we present $\texttt{Jipole}$, an automatically differentiable (AD), $\texttt{ipole}$-based code for radiative transfer in curved spacetimes, designed to compute image gradients with respect to underlying model parameters. These gradients quantify how parameter changes-such as the black hole's spin or the observer's inclination-affect the image, enabling more efficient parameter estimation and reducing the number of required images. We validate $\texttt{Jipole}$ against $\texttt{ipole}$ in two analytical tests and then compare pixel-wise intensity derivatives from AD with those from finite-difference methods. We then demonstrate the utility of these gradients by performing parameter recovery for an analytical model using a conjugate gradient optimizer in three increasingly complex cases for the injected image: ideal, blurred, and blurred with added noise. In most cases, high-accuracy fits are obtained in only a few optimization steps, failing only in cases with extremely low signal-to-noise ratios and large blurring size kernels. These results highlight the potential of AD-based methods to accelerate robust, high-fidelity model-data comparisons in current and future black hole imaging efforts.</description>

      <title>SymBoltz.jl: a symbolic-numeric, approximation-free and differentiable linear Einstein-Boltzmann solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SymBoltz is a new Julia package that solves the linear Einstein-Boltzmann equations. It features a symbolic-numeric interface for specifying equations, is free of approximation switching schemes and is compatible with automatic differentiation. Cosmological models are built from replaceable physical components in a way that scales well in model space, or alternatively written as one compact system of equations. The modeler should simply write down their equations, and SymBoltz solves them and eliminates friction in the modeling process. Symbolic knowledge enables powerful automation of tasks, such as separating computational stages like the background and perturbations, generating the analytical Jacobian matrix and its sparsity pattern, and interpolating arbitrary variables from the solution. Implicit solvers integrate the full stiff equations at all times without approximations, which greatly simplifies the code. Performance remains as good as in existing approximation-based codes due to high-order implicit methods that take long time steps, fast generated code, optimal handling of the Jacobian and efficient sparse matrix methods. Automatic differentiation gives exact derivatives of any output with respect to any input, which is important for gradient-based Markov chain Monte Carlo methods in large parameter spaces, training of emulators, Fisher forecasting and sensitivity analysis. The main features form a synergy that reinforces the design of the code. Results agree with established codes to 0.1% with standard precision. More work is needed to implement additional features and for fast reverse-mode automatic differentiation of scalar loss functions. SymBoltz is available at https://github.com/hersle/SymBoltz.jl with single-command installation and extensive documentation, and welcomes all contributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the short-interval expansion of the subsystem fidelity in two-dimensional conformal field theories (2D CFTs) using the operator product expansion (OPE) of twist operators. We obtain universal contributions from general quasiprimary operators valid for arbitrary 2D CFTs, along with specific results in free massless boson and fermion theories. The analytical predictions demonstrate excellent agreement with established analytical results in field theories and numerical calculations in integrable models. Furthermore, we extend the method to holographic CFTs, where subsystem fidelity serves to analyze the distinguishability of black hole microstates through the AdS/CFT correspondence. This work establishes a unified framework for quantifying quantum state distinguishability across various 2D CFTs, bridging quantum information techniques with applications in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Energy Reflection and Transmission of Interfaces in $T\bar{T}$-deformed CFT</title>

Abstract: Conformal interfaces gluing a pair of two-dimensional conformal field theories enjoy a large degree of universality in terms of the coefficients of reflection and transmission of energy, that describe the scattering of conformal matter at the interface. In this article, we study these coefficients beyond conformality, by gluing a pair of $T\bar T$-deformed 2D CFTs across an interface, which requires the condition $c_L \mu_L = c_R \mu_R $ to be obeyed. We show that, at least when the interface admits a holographic description, the $T\bar T$ deformation of the CFTs can be extended to the interface. We propose a generalization of the linear matching condition in the universal sector of the undeformed ICFT to a non-linear one, which is captured by a universal antisymmetric \emph{transmission function} of the incoming fluxes. We employ the flow equations of the $T\bar T$-deformed CFTs to compute this function in two special classes of states, namely the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) and scattering state. We show that the results can also be reproduced using holographic techniques in the bulk dual of these states.</description>

      <title>Wet Hair: Global Symmetries in Entanglement Islands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central conjecture in quantum gravity is the non-existence of global symmetries. As a fully unitary theory, there is no information loss in a UV complete quantum gravity theory. We see both these concepts reflected in the AdS/CFT correspondence, which tells us that dynamical processes in AdS are fully captured by a manifestly unitary CFT with no information loss. Furthermore, global symmetries of the CFT are dual to gauge symmetries in the AdS, which implies no global symmetry in the AdS. In this work, we provide concrete evidence for the connection between the non-existence of global symmetries and the absence of information loss in quantum gravity. We study the $\textit{island setups}$ in which a gravitational AdS is coupled with a nongravitational bath on its boundary. In such theories, the information in the AdS can be lost to the bath. We provide concrete examples with global symmetries in the island setup, from both the bottom-up and the top-down perspectives. We argue that these global symmetries are consistent due to $\textit{entanglement islands}$, in which holography is realized in a novel fashion. The global symmetries we construct are all mixed with spontaneously broken gauge symmetries. We will show that this fact has two implications: $\textbf{1)}$ The black hole hair is detectable in the bath (``wet hair"); $\textbf{2)}$ a resolution of a puzzle proposed by Harlow and Shaghoulian.</description>

      <title>On the gravitational partition function under volume constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Euclidean action serves as a bridge between gravitational thermodynamics and the partition function. In this work, we further examine the gravitational partition function under a fixed volume constraint, extending the fixed volume on-shell geometry in the massless case. Moving beyond this massless configuration, we construct solutions with nonzero mass functions, leading to a new class of volume-constrained Euclidean geometries (VCEGs). The VCEG contains both a boundary and a horizon, and its Euclidean action is determined solely by the contribution from the horizon. However, further investigation suggests that this boundary appears to be artificially constructed and can be extended, giving rise to the extended VCEGs. These geometries feature two horizons, each with a conical singularity, and their action is given by one-quarter of the sum of the areas of the two horizons. In general, the conical singularities on both horizons cannot be simultaneously removed, except at a critical mass $m = m^*$, which defines the critical extended VCEG. Configurations with conical singularities are interpreted as constrained gravitational instantons. An analysis of their contributions to the partition function and topology reveals a close analogy between the extended VCEGs and the Euclidean Schwarzschild-de Sitter static patch, suggesting that the volume constraint effectively plays a role akin to that of a cosmological constant in semiclassical quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Novel Phenomena in Noncommutative Field Theory: Emergent Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Noncommutative field theory (NCFT) is an extension of quantum field theory (QFT) that redefines spacetime, replacing commuting coordinates with a noncommutative structure. This shift fundamentally alters the way fields, interactions, and symmetries are understood. NCFT uniquely integrates with supersymmetry, making it a natural framework for unifying quantum mechanics and gravity. It also provides a consistent mechanism for spontaneous supersymmetry breaking. Unlike conventional QFT, which quantizes fields on a fixed spacetime, NCFT begins by quantizing spacetime itself. This perspective reveals novel phenomena, such as ultraviolet-infrared mixing and a natural transition from discrete to continuous geometries. It offers insights into quantum gravity at the Planck scale. Mathematically, NCFT bridges quantum mechanics and geometry through operator algebras, enabling the exploration of new theories unattainable in traditional frameworks. This dual role cements NCFT as a cornerstone of modern theoretical physics.
  The presentation is comprehensive and pedagogical in nature, and may contain textual overlap with earlier preprints by the author; its aim is to provide a unified and hopefully more fundamental treatment connecting results and viewpoints not previously treated together.</description>

      <title>Multiband Gravitational Wave Detection Prospects for M31 UCXB-1 System in Low and Middle Frequency Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of M31 UCXB-1, the first extragalactic ultracompact X-ray binary (UCXB) with an orbital period of $T_{\rm orb} \sim 465$ s, presents a unique laboratory for studying close binary evolution and an unprecedented target for continuous gravitational wave (GW) searches. Its identification as a strong candidate black hole-white dwarf (BH-WD) system, combined with its exceptionally short period and high X-ray luminosity, suggests it may be one of the most vital low-frequency GW sources in M31. In this \textit{Letter}, we investigate the detectability of its GW signal for future space-borne detectors in multiband GW detection. We find that while its signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) for low-frequency detectors remains marginal for high-confidence detection, middle-frequency detectors such as DECIGO and BBO are far more promising, potentially achieving S/N $\varrho&gt;8$ within reasonable observational duration. With a primary mass of only $m_1 &gt; 5.4M_\odot$ (or $6.6M_\odot$), the network of all low and middle frequency detector (or BBO alone) is capable of detecting GW from this system with a $\varrho &gt; 8$, during 10-year observation. Furthermore, orbital eccentricity can enhance the GW strain at higher harmonics, further improving its detectability, especially for middle-frequency detectors. This study establishes M31 UCXB-1 as a key prototype of short-period UCXBs, cementing its role as a cornerstone for multiband, multi-messenger astrophysics and a vital bridge between X-ray astronomy and the future GW era.</description>

      <title>Particle production and Higgs reheating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reheating is essential for transforming the cold, vacuum dominated Universe at the end of inflation into the hot thermal bath required by the Standard Model. In many well motivated inflationary models, however, the inflaton has no direct couplings to other fields, raising the question of how the Universe becomes repopulated with particles. We address this question within the framework of geometric reheating, where energy transfer occurs purely through gravitational effects. Focusing on a Higgs inflationary scenario with a non-minimal curvature coupling $\xi \phi^2 R$, we derive the post-inflationary dynamics and compute particle production using the Bogoliubov formalism. We show that the rapid, oscillatory evolution of the curvature scalar after inflaton acts as a time dependent gravitational pump, creating scalar spectator particles even in the absence of explicit interactions. This curvature driven production mechanism provides a natural and efficient route to reheating, demonstrating that gravity alone can initiate the standard thermal history and bridge inflation with radiation domination in minimal, coupling free models of the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Cavity Multimodes as an Array for High-Frequency Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microwave cavities operated in the presence of a background magnetic field provide a promising avenue for detecting high-frequency gravitational waves (HFGWs). We demonstrate for the first time that the distinct antenna patterns of multiple electromagnetic modes within a single cavity enable localization and reconstruction of key properties of an incoming HFGW signal, including its polarization ratio and frequency drift rate. Using a 9-cell cavity commonly employed in particle accelerators as a representative example, we analyze the time-domain response of 18 nearly degenerate modes, which can be sequentially excited by a frequency-drifting signal. The sensitivity is further enhanced by the number of available modes, in close analogy to the scaling achieved by a network of independent detectors, enabling sensitivity to astrophysically plausible binary sources.</description>

      <title>Local Scale Invariance in Quantum Theory: A Non-Hermitian Pilot-Wave Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Weyl's abandoned idea of local scale invariance has a natural realization at the quantum level in pilot-wave (deBroglie-Bohm) theory. We obtain the Weyl covariant derivative by complexifying the electromagnetic gauge coupling parameter. The resultant non-hermiticity has a natural interpretation in terms of local scale invariance in pilot-wave theory. The conserved current density is modified from $|\psi|^2$ to the local scale invariant, trajectory-dependent ratio $|\psi|^2/ \mathbf{1}^2[\mathcal{C}]$, where $\mathbf 1[\mathcal C]$ is a scale factor that depends on the pilot-wave trajectory $\mathcal C$ in configuration space. Our approach is general, and we implement it for the Schr\"odinger, Pauli, and Dirac equations coupled to an external electromagnetic field. We also implement it in quantum field theory for the case of a quantized axion field interacting with a quantized electromagnetic field. We discuss the equilibrium probability density and show that the corresponding trajectories are unique.</description>

      <title>Optical Entropy and Generalized Thermodynamics of Solitonic Event Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05156v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The realization of Hawking radiation in optical analogs has historically focused on kinematic observables, such as the effective temperature determined by the horizon's surface gravity. A complete thermodynamic description, however, necessitates a rigorous definition of entropy and irreversibility, which has remained elusive in Hamiltonian optical systems. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing an operational entropy for solitonic event horizons, derived from the spectral partitioning of the optical field into coherent solitonic and incoherent radiative subsystems. We demonstrate that the emission of resonant radiation, mediated by the breaking of soliton integrability due to higher-order dispersion, serves as a fundamental mechanism for entropy production. Numerical simulations of the generalized nonlinear Schrodinger equation confirm that this process satisfies a generalized second law, where the change in total entropy is non-negative. These results establish optical event horizons as consistent nonequilibrium thermodynamic systems, offering a new pathway to explore the information-theoretic aspects of analog gravity in laboratory settings.</description>

      <title>Hidden pattern of self-invariant cosmic expansion: Empirical evidence from Hubble diagram of supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present empirical evidence extracted from the Pantheon Catalog of SNeIa demonstrating that the speed of light varies as the universe expands. Moreover, the speed of light must vary in a specific quantifiable manner. Departing from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, we reformulate the kinematics of late-time acceleration by employing Dolgov's power-law cosmology $a=\left(t/t_{0}\right)^{\mu}$ [Phys. Rev. D 55, 5881 (1997)] and Barrow's varying speed of light $c=c_{0}\,a^{-\zeta}$ [Phys. Rev. D 59, 043515 (1999)]. In this cosmology, light traveling through an expanding universe undergoes an additional refraction caused by the varying c along its path, resulting in a modified Lemaitre redshift formula $1+z=a^{-(1+\zeta)}$. Despite its parsimony, the model achieves a high-quality fit to the Pantheon Catalog of SNeIa and exhibits a strong degeneracy along the locus $(1+\zeta)\,\mu=1$. This empirical relation indicates a self-invariant cosmic evolution: at all instants during the late-time epoch, the speed of light is exactly proportional to the rate of cosmic expansion, viz. $c=\mu^{-1}c_{0}\,t_{0}\,\frac{da}{dt}$, a characteristic that is absent in the $\Lambda$CDM model. This synchronous behavior between $c$ and $da/dt$ has profound cosmological implications that we will discuss, regarding (i) the nature of late-time acceleration; (ii) the horizon problem; (iii) Kolb's coasting universe model [Astrophys. J. 344, 543 (1989)]; (iv) a generalization of the cosmological principle to the time domain; and (v) the emergence of a novel conformally flat metric applicable to cosmology. This newfound kinematic $c\propto da/dt$ relation, if further corroborated, will represent a stringent requirement that any viable dynamical model of cosmology must satisfy -- a requirement that the $\Lambda$CDM model does not fulfill.</description>
