      <title>Narratives to Numbers: Large Language Models and Economic Policy Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates large language models as estimable classifiers and clarifies how modeling choices shape downstream measurement error. Revisiting the Economic Policy Uncertainty index, we show that contemporary classifiers substantially outperform dictionary rules, better track human audit assessments, and extend naturally to noisy historical and multilingual news. We use these tools to construct a new nineteenth-century U.S. index from more than 360 million newspaper articles and exploratory cross-country indices with a single multilingual model. Taken together, our results show that LLMs can systematically improve text-derived measures and should be integrated as explicit measurement tools in empirical economics.</description>

      <title>Unlocking The Future of Food Security Through Access to Finance for Sustainable Agribusiness Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Access to finance is vital for improving food security, particularly in developing nations where agricultural production is crucial. Despite several financial interventions targeted at increasing agricultural production, smallholder farmers continue to lack access to reasonable, timely, and sufficient financing, limiting their ability to invest in improved technology and inputs, lowering productivity and food supply. This study examines the relationship between access to finance and food security among smallholder farmers in Ogun State, employing institutional theory as a theoretical framework. The study takes a quantitative method, with a survey for the research design and a population of 37,200 agricultural smallholder farmers. A sample size of 380 was chosen using probability sampling and simple random techniques. The data were analysed via Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM). The findings demonstrate a favourable relationship between access to finance and food security, with an R2-value of 0.615 indicating a robust link. These findings underline the need of improving financial institutions and implementing enabling policies to enable farmers have access to the financial resources they need to achieve food security outcomes.</description>

      <title>Barriers to AI Adoption: Image Concerns at Work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concerns about how workers are perceived can deter effective collaboration with artificial intelligence (AI). In a field experiment on a large online labor market, I hired 450 U.S.-based remote workers to complete an image-categorization job assisted by AI recommendations. Workers were incentivized by the prospect of a contract extension based on an HR evaluator's feedback. I find that workers adopt AI recommendations at lower rates when their reliance on AI is visible to the evaluator, resulting in a measurable decline in task performance. The effects are present despite a conservative design in which workers know that the evaluator is explicitly instructed to assess expected accuracy on the same AI-assisted task. This reduction in AI reliance persists even when the evaluator is reassured about workers' strong performance history on the platform, underscoring how difficult these concerns are to alleviate. Leveraging the platform's public feedback feature, I introduce a novel incentive-compatible elicitation method showing that workers fear heavy reliance on AI signals a lack of confidence in their own judgment, a trait they view as essential when collaborating with AI.</description>

      <title>Clarifying Trinko as Precedent in EHR and AI Memory Duty to Deal Cases: A New Institutional Economics Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18664v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By clarifying the bases for the Verizon Communications Inc. v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP, 2004 opinion, we hope to reduce two distinct errors. The false positive error is citing Trinko as precedent when it is not. This error is so prevalent it has earned the nickname of Trinko Creep. The false negative error is not citing Trinko when it should be. We argue that this error will be growing in the future as Trinko should be precedent in cases involving regulated access rights to sensitive consumer data in electronic health records and Agentic AI Long Term Memory.</description>

      <title>Trust and Uncertainty in Strategic Interaction: Behavioural and Physiological Evidence from the Centipede Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mutual trust is a key determinant of decision-making in economic interactions, yet actual behavior often diverges from equilibrium predictions. This study investigates how emotional arousal, indexed by skin conductance responses,SCR, relates to trust behavior in a modified centipede game. To examine the impact of uncertainty, the game incorporated both fixed and random termination conditions. SCRs were recorded alongside self-reported measures of mutual and general trust and individual risk-taking propensity. Phasic SCRs were significantly higher under random termination, particularly following the opponent take actions, indicating increased emotional arousal under uncertainty. Mutual trust scores correlated positively with risk propensity but not with general trust. Behaviorally, higher mutual trust was associated with extended cooperative play, but only in the fixed-turn condition. These findings suggest that physiological arousal reflects emotional engagement in trust-related decisions and that uncertainty amplifies both arousal and strategic caution. Mutual trust appears context-dependent, shaped by emotional and physiological states that influence deviations from equilibrium behavior.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Measurement of Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit Esteban and Ray's (1994) seminal model of polarization. Their main result (unnecessarily) relies on the assumption that individuals are infinitely divisible, which imposes strong restrictions on admissible polarization indices. We show that relaxing this assumption yields a broader family of indices consistent with the original axioms. The resulting indices avoid counter-intuitive rankings that arise when using results on the original paper and provide greater flexibility for empirical applications.</description>

      <title>Bayesian probabilistic exploration of Bitcoin informational quanta and interactions under the GITT-VT paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores Bitcoin's value formation through the Granular Interaction Thinking Theory-Value Theory (GITT-VT). Rather than stemming from material utility or cash flows, Bitcoin's value arises from informational attributes and interactions of multiple factors, including cryptographic order, decentralization-enabled autonomy, trust embedded in the consensus mechanism, and socio-narrative coherence that reduce entropy within decentralized value-exchange processes. To empirically assess this perspective, a Bayesian linear model was estimated using daily data from 2022 to 2025, operationalizing four informational value dimensions: Store-of-Value (SOV), Autonomy (AUT), Social-Signal Value (SSV), and Hedonic-Sentiment Value (HSV). Results indicate that only SSV exerts a highly credible positive effect on next-day returns, highlighting the dominant role of high-entropy social information in short-term pricing dynamics. In contrast, SOV and AUT show moderately reliable positive associations, reflecting their roles as low-entropy structural anchors of long-term value. HSV displays no credible predictive effect. The study advances interdisciplinary value theory and demonstrates Bitcoin as a dual-layer entropy-regulating socio-technological ecosystem. The findings offer implications for digital asset valuation, investment education, and future research on entropy dynamics across non-cash-flow digital assets.</description>

      <title>A calibrated model of debt recycling with interest costs and tax shields: viability under different fiscal regimes and jurisdictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Debt recycling is a leveraged equity management strategy in which homeowners use accumulated home equity to finance investments, applying the resulting returns to accelerate mortgage repayment. We propose a novel framework to model equity and mortgage dynamics in presence of mortgage interest rates, borrowing costs on equity-backed credit lines, and tax shields arising from interest deductibility. The model is calibrated on three jurisdictions -- Australia, Germany, and Switzerland -- representing diverse interest rate environments and fiscal regimes. Results demonstrate that introducing positive interest rates without tax shields contracts success regions and lengthens repayment times, while tax shields partially reverse these effects by reducing effective borrowing costs and adding equity boosts from mortgage interest deductibility. Country-specific outcomes vary systematically, and rental properties consistently outperform owner-occupied housing due to mortgage interest deductibility provisions.</description>

      <title>The long-term impact of (un)conditional cash transfers on labour market outcomes in Ecuador</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17216v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the widespread implementation of conditional cash transfers in low- and middle-income countries, evidence on their long-term effects remains limited. This paper evaluates the impact of Ecuador's Human Development Grant on the formal labour market outcomes of children from eligible households. The programme, one of the first of its kind, was characterised by weak enforcement of its eligibility criteria. Using a regression discontinuity design, we find that the grant increased the probability of working in the formal sector by almost 13\% around 15 years after exposure, thereby helping to curb the intergenerational transmission of poverty. This positive effect is most likely to operate through human capital accumulation.</description>

      <title>Simulating Macroeconomic Expectations using LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17648v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for simulating macroeconomic expectations using LLM Agents. By constructing LLM Agents equipped with various functional modules, we replicate three representative survey experiments involving several expectations across different types of economic agents. Our results show that although the expectations simulated by LLM Agents are more homogeneous than those of humans, they consistently outperform LLMs relying simply on prompt engineering, and possess human-like mental mechanisms. Evaluation reveals that these capabilities stem from the contributions of their components, offering guidelines for their architectural design. Our approach complements traditional methods and provides new insights into AI behavioral science in macroeconomic research</description>

      <title>The Value of Personalized Recommendations: Evidence from Netflix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07280v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Personalized recommendation systems shape much of user choice online, yet their targeted nature makes separating out the value of recommendation and the underlying goods challenging. We build a discrete choice model that embeds recommendation-induced utility, low-rank heterogeneity, and flexible state dependence and apply the model to viewership data at Netflix. We exploit idiosyncratic variation introduced by the recommendation algorithm to identify and separately value these components as well as to recover model-free diversion ratios that we can use to validate our structural model. We use the model to evaluate counterfactuals that quantify the incremental engagement generated by personalized recommendations. First, we show that replacing the current recommender system with a matrix factorization or popularity-based algorithm would lead to 4% and 12% reduction in engagement, respectively, and decreased consumption diversity. Second, most of the consumption increase from recommendations comes from effective targeting, not mechanical exposure, with the largest gains for mid-popularity goods (as opposed to broadly appealing or very niche goods).</description>
