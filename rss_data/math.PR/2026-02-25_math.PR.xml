      <title>Multiple Poisson-Dirichlet diffusions on generalized Kingman simplices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a new class of infinite-dimensional diffusions taking values in a generalized Kingman simplex. Our model describes the temporal evolution of the relative frequencies of infinitely-many types which are "labeled" by an arbitrary finite number of marks or colors, but "unlabeled" within each mark. We start with a finite-dimensional construction which extends to Wright-Fisher diffusions a self-similarity property known for Dirichlet distributions, and corresponds to a multiple skew-product representation of the Wright-Fisher diffusion relative to the marks in the population. After ranking decreasingly the frequencies within each mark, we identify the limit in distribution of the resulting diffusion when the number of types for each mark goes to infinity, and describe its infinitesimal operator. The limiting process reduces to a diffusion in the Thoma simplex in the special case of only two marks, whereas the infinitely-many-neutral-alleles model is recovered when all frequencies have the same mark. The stationary measure of the limit diffusion is shown to be the recently introduced multiple Poisson-Dirichlet distribution, which extends Kingman's Poisson-Dirichlet distribution and is the de Finetti representing measure for a family of random partitions whose elements are marked.</description>

      <title>Independence of the indicator functions of record values for Multivariate independent data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a sequence of random vectors on \(\mathbb{R}^d, \ d\geq 1\). We consider the record values based on the simultaneous strict inequality of the coordinates. The indicator record variable (irv) of the j-th observation is the function that assigns the value 1 (one) if that observation is a record value and the null value otherwise. Here, we give a detailed and a thorough proof that the indicator functions are independent, whenever the data are themselves independent, not necessarily &lt;i&gt;iid&lt;/i&gt;, in \(\mathbb{R}^d, \ d\geq 1\). We compare that proof with available proofs in dimension one. Indeed, in seminal works on records, in particular in Ahsanullah(2024), Nevzorov(2001), Resnick (1987), Ahsanullah and Nevzorov (2015), etc., the independence of record indicator functions is usually validated based on logical reasoning, and so, is not rigorously proved. This allows us to undertake a detailed and thorough proof for independent data, not necessity &lt;i&gt;iid&lt;/i&gt;, in \(\mathbb{R}^d, \ d\geq 1\). The proof includes leads for not even independent data.</description>

      <title>High local maxima of stationary smooth Gaussian fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the point process (in $\mathbb{R}^d$) of local maxima of smooth Gaussian fields, with sufficient decay of correlation at infinity, above a level $u$. We show that this point process, rescaled appropriately, converges weakly to a Poisson point process in the limit $u \to \infty$. Our proof relies on the classical observation that simple point processes are characterised by avoidance probabilities (i.e. $\mathbb{P}(\eta(B)=0)$ for a point process $\eta$ and Borel set $B$). Then we approximate avoidance probability with the excursion probability, where the latter is well studied. Second main result is a quantified version of the Poisson convergence of high local maxima of the Bargmann-Fock field in $\mathbb{R}^2$. We prove that, for Bargmann-Fock field in two dimensions, the total variation distance between a Poisson random variable and the number of local maxima of the field above a threshold $u$ in an $R \times R$ box in $\mathbb{R}^2$ decays like $\exp(- \beta u^2)$, for some fixed $\beta &gt;0$. As an immediate consequence, when the level $u$ is a function of $R$ such that $u(R) \to \infty$ and $u(R)/ \sqrt{\log R} \to 0$ as $R \to \infty$, we have a quantitative central limit theorem for the number of high local maxima. The proof is based on the Chen-Stein method for quantitative Poisson approximation. We produce a close coupling of a stationary smooth field and its Palm version, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Numerical ranges of non-normal random matrices: elliptic Ginibre and non-Hermitian Wishart ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The numerical range of a non-normal matrix plays a central role as a descriptor of non-normal effects beyond spectral information. We study a class of fundamental non-Hermitian random matrix ensembles that interpolate between the Hermitian and non-Hermitian regimes. Our analysis focuses on the elliptic Ginibre ensemble and its chiral counterpart, as well as on non-Hermitian Wishart matrices. For each of these models, we explicitly characterise the geometry of the numerical range in the large-system limit. In particular, we show that for the elliptic Ginibre ensemble and its chiral version, the limiting numerical range is an ellipse, whereas for the non-Hermitian Wishart ensemble it is described by a non-elliptic envelope.</description>

      <title>Multi-time Loewner energy: rate function for large deviation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classification of probability measures that satisfy both conformal invariance and domain Markov property is equivalent to characterizing solutions to the Belavin--Polyakov--Zamolodchikov (BPZ) equations, as established by Dub\'edat~[Dub07]. In this context, the partition functions for half-watermelon SLE and for multi-radial SLE serve as fundamental solutions to the BPZ equations. In this article, we investigate the large deviation principle for both half-watermelon SLE and multi-radial SLE. The associated rate function is given by the multi-time Loewner energy, introduced in~[CHPW26]. As applications, we provide an alternative proof of the large deviation principle for Dyson Brownian motion, as well as a new derivation of the boundary perturbation property of the multi-time Loewner energy.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior of some stochastic models in population dynamics: a Hamilton-Jacobi approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of individual-based models describing the evolution of a population structured by a real trait, subject to selection and mutation. We consider two different sets of assumptions: first, the case of critical or subcritical branching population processes in a regime combining a discretization of the trait space, small mutations, large time and large initial population size, where we are able to characterize using a Hamilton-Jacobi approach, the survival set of the population, and the asymptotic of the logarithmic scaling of subpopulation sizes. Second, we generalize by a direct method the convergence to the classical Hamilton-Jacobi equation obtained in the super-critical branching regime considered in \cite{CMMT} to a more general trait space and under weaker assumptions. Moreover, we establish that the stochastic and the deterministic dynamics are asymptotically equivalent in large population.</description>

      <title>Seeing Through Hyperbolic Space: Visibility for $\lambda$-Geodesic Hyperplanes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study visibility from a fixed point in the presence of a Poisson process of $\lambda$--geodesic hyperplanes in a $d$-dimensional hyperbolic space. The family of $\lambda$--geodesic hyperplanes interpolates between totally geodesic hyperplanes and horospheres. Our main result establishes a universality principle for this model: we prove that the fundamental visibility properties are invariant with respect to the parameter $\lambda\in[0,1]$. Namely, there is a critical intensity $\gamma_{\mathrm{crit}}&gt;0$ such that the visible region is unbounded with positive probability for $\gamma &lt; \gamma_{\mathrm{crit}}$ and almost surely bounded for $\gamma &gt; \gamma_{\mathrm{crit}}$. For $d=2$ we establish almost sure boundedness also at criticality. The value for $\gamma_{\mathrm{crit}}$ is explicit and does not depend on $\lambda$. In the bounded phase, we show that the mean visible volume is identical with the known formula for $\lambda=0$. The key integral-geometric step is an explicit computation showing that the measure of $\lambda$-geodesic hyperplanes hitting a geodesic segment is a linear function of the length of the segment, independent of~$\lambda$.</description>

      <title>Extreme eigenvalues and eigenvectors for finite rank additive deformations of non-hermitian sparse random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a $n\times n$ sparse non-Hermitian random matrix $X_n$ defined as the Hadamard product between a random matrix with centered independent and identically distributed entries and a sparse Bernoulli matrix with success probability $K_n/n$ where $K_n\le n$ (and possibly $K_n\ll n$) and $K_n\to \infty$ as $n\to \infty$. Let $E_n$ be a deterministic $n\times n$ finite-rank matrix. We prove that the outlier eigenvalues of $Y_n= X_n +E_n$ asymptotically match those of $E_n$. In the special case of a rank-one deformation, assuming further that the sparsity parameter satisfies $K_n \gg \log^9(n)$ and that the entries of the random matrix are sub-Gaussian, we describe the limiting behavior of the projection of the right eigenvector associated with the leading eigenvalue onto the right eigenvector of the rank-one deformation. In particular, we prove that the projection behaves as in the Hermitian case. To that end, we rely on the recent universality results of Brailovskaya and van Handel (2024) relating the singular value spectra of deformations of $X_n$ to Gaussian analogues of these matrices. Our analysis builds upon a recent framework introduced by Bordenave et.al. (2022), and amounts to showing the asymptotic equivalence between the reverse characteristic polynomial of the random matrix and a random analytic function on the unit disc with explicit dependence on the finite-rank deformation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a broad class of families of branching random walks on a set $X$. The processes in each family are parametrized by a positive parameter $\lambda$ and they are monotonically increasing in $\lambda$ with respect to the germ order, a notion that extends classical stochastic domination. We define a general notion of critical parameter $\lambda(A)$ associated with a subset $A \subseteq X$ and investigate how modifications of reproduction laws affect these critical parameters.</description>

      <title>The Careless Coupon Collector's Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of the Careless Coupon Collector's Problem (CCCP), a novel variation of the classical coupon collector, that we envision as a model for information systems such as web crawlers, dynamic caches, and fault-resilient networks. In CCCP, a collector attempts to gather $n$ distinct coupon types by obtaining one coupon type uniformly at random in each discrete round, however the collector is \textit{careless}: at the end of each round, each collected coupon type is independently lost with probability $p$. We analyze the number of rounds required to complete the collection as a function of $n$ and $p$. In particular, we show that it transitions from $\Theta(n \ln n)$ when $p = o\big(\frac{\ln n}{n^2}\big)$ up to $\Theta\big((\frac{np}{1-p})^n\big)$ when $p=\omega\big(\frac{1}{n}\big)$ in multiple distinct phases. Interestingly, when $p=\frac{c}{n}$, the process remains in a metastable phase, where the fraction of collected coupon types is concentrated around $\frac{1}{1+c}$ with probability $1-o(1)$, for a time window of length $e^{\Theta(n)}$. Finally, we give an algorithm that computes the expected completion time of CCCP in $O(n^2)$ time.</description>

      <title>Maximum entropy based testing in network models: ERGMs and constrained optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic network models play a central role across a wide range of scientific disciplines, and questions of statistical inference arise naturally in this context. In this paper we investigate goodness-of-fit and two-sample testing procedures for statistical networks based on the principle of maximum entropy (MaxEnt). Our approach formulates a constrained entropy-maximization problem on the space of networks, subject to prescribed structural constraints. The resulting test statistics are defined through the Lagrange multipliers associated with the constrained optimization problem, which, to our knowledge, is novel in the statistical networks literature.
  We establish consistency in the classical regime where the number of vertices is fixed. We then consider asymptotic regimes in which the graph size grows with the sample size, developing tests for both dense and sparse settings. In the dense case, we analyze exponential random graph models (ERGM) (including the Erd\"os-R\`enyi models), while in the sparse regime our theory applies to Erd{\"o}s-R{\`e}nyi graphs.
  Our analysis leverages recent advances in nonlinear large deviation theory for random graphs. We further show that the proposed Lagrange-multiplier framework connects naturally to classical score tests for constrained maximum likelihood estimation. The results provide a unified entropy-based framework for network model assessment across diverse growth regimes.</description>

      <title>Efficient Online Learning in Interacting Particle Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new method for online parameter estimation in stochastic interacting particle systems, based on continuous observation of a small number of particles from the system. Our method recursively updates the model parameters using a stochastic approximation of the gradient of the asymptotic log likelihood, which is computed using the continuous stream of observations. Under suitable assumptions, we rigorously establish convergence of our method to the stationary points of the asymptotic log-likelihood of the interacting particle system. We consider asymptotics both in the limit as the time horizon $t\rightarrow\infty$, for a fixed and finite number of particles, and in the joint limit as the number of particles $N\rightarrow\infty$ and the time horizon $t\rightarrow\infty$. Under additional assumptions on the asymptotic log-likelihood, we also establish an $\mathrm{L}^2$ convergence rate and a central limit theorem. Finally, we present several numerical examples of practical interest, including a model for systemic risk, a model of interacting FitzHugh--Nagumo neurons, and a Cucker--Smale flocking model. Our numerical results corroborate our theoretical results, and also suggest that our estimator is effective even in cases where the assumptions required for our theoretical analysis do not hold.</description>

      <title>The coalescent structure of multitype continuous-time Bienaym\'e-Galton-Watson trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04588v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the genealogy of a sample of $k&gt;1$ particles, taken under various sampling schemes, from the population alive at fixed times, in a continuous-time multitype Bienaym\'e-Galton-Watson (MBGW) tree with finite second moments. For critical MBGW trees under uniform sampling without replacement, we show that the sample genealogy converges in the large time limit to a universal limiting structure with the same tree topology as Kingman's coalescent but enriched by a nontrivial process coding the types along each lineage. Remarkably, the limiting genealogy is robust to the sampling scheme: it remains unchanged when fixing type configurations (that is, if we sample uniformly at random without replacement given a fixed vector of types to sample), or sampling with type-dependent weights (that is, multinomial sampling over types). Tracking types along the genealogy reveals that, in the limit, types evolve independently of the tree structure but retain a distribution determined by the offspring law, and the Perron-Frobenius eigenvalues. For uniform sampling without replacement, we use $k$ distinguished \emph{spine} particles and a suitable change of measure under which, when sampling at fixed times: (a) the spines form a uniform sample without replacement that depend on the types, and (b) there is $k$-size biasing and discounting according to the population size. This work substantially extends the spine techniques developed by Harris, Johnston, and Roberts 2020 and Harris, Johnston, and Pardo 2024, for the single-type case. In particular, we provide a detailed analysis of how type information affects functionals of the spines. We show that the multitype case introduces complex interactions between types, resulting in a richer dependency structure where functionals must capture type-specific behaviours and inter-type correlations.</description>

      <title>Permuton limits for some permutations avoiding a single pattern</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19541v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Permutons are probability measures on the unit square with uniform marginals that provide a natural way to describe limits of permutations. We are interested in the permuton limits for permutations sampled uniformly from certain pattern-avoiding classes that are in bijection with the class of permutations avoiding the increasing pattern of length $d+1$. In particular, we will look at a family of permutations whose permuton limit collapses to the unique permuton supported on the line $x + y = 1$ in the unit square, informally known as the anti-diagonal. We prove some general properties about permutons to aid our efforts, which may be useful for proving permuton limits that converge to the anti-diagonal for a broader range of permutation classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the simple random walk on the infinite cluster of a general class of percolation models on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d\geq 3$, including Bernoulli percolation as well as models with strong, algebraically decaying correlations. For almost every realization of the percolation configuration, we obtain uniform controls on the absorption probability of a random walk by certain "porous interfaces" surrounding the discrete blow-up of a compact set $A$. These controls substantially generalize previous results obtained in arXiv:1706.07229 for Brownian motion in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and in arXiv:2012.05230 for random walks on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ equipped with uniformly elliptic edge weights to a manifestly non-elliptic framework.</description>

      <title>Representation and Integration by Parts Formulas for Affine Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Affine processes play an important role in mathematical finance and other applied areas due to their tractable structure. In the present article, we derive probabilistic representations and integration by parts (IBP) formulas for expectations involving affine processes. These formulas are expressed in terms of expectations of affine processes with modified parameters and are derived using Fourier analytic techniques and characteristic functions. Notably, our method does not require pathwise differentiability, allowing us to handle models with square-root diffusion coefficients for a large set of parameters. The methodology can be applied to the classic Cox--Ingersoll--Ross (CIR) model, a model for interest rates in mathematical finance, where the initial value derivative corresponds to one of the ``Greeks'' used in option pricing in mathematical finance. Furthermore, we illustrate the theory with an application to a population evolution model arising as a scaling limit of discrete branching processes. Our approach offers a unified and robust framework for sensitivity analysis in models where classical Malliavin calculus techniques are difficult to apply.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the point process of the eigenvalues of real or complex non-Hermitian matrices $X$ with independent, identically distributed entries is hyperuniform: the variance of the number of eigenvalues in a subdomain $\Omega$ of the spectrum is much smaller than the volume of $\Omega$. Our main technical novelty is a very precise computation of the covariance between the resolvents of the Hermitization of $X-z_1, X-z_2$, for two distinct complex parameters $z_1,z_2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an analogue of the large deviation principle for mixed measures associated with a class of $\log$-concave probability measures whose densities depend on the gauge function of a convex body. For convex bodies in $\mathbb{R}^n$, we prove a geometric large-deviation-type asymptotic for first-order mixed measures, where the decay under dilation is governed by a natural inradius associated with the measure. In the planar case, we derive an explicit integral representation for second-order mixed measures and obtain a corresponding asymptotic. As an application, we prove a comparison theorem showing that asymptotic dominance under dilation forces inclusion between convex bodies.</description>

      <title>Simulating stochastic population dynamics: The Linear Noise Approximation can capture non-linear phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15166v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Population dynamics in fields such as molecular biology, epidemiology, and ecology exhibit highly stochastic and non-linear behavior. In gene regulatory systems in particular, oscillations and multistability are especially common. Despite this, none of the currently available stochastic models for population dynamics are both accurate and computationally efficient for long-term predictions. A prominent model in this field, the Linear Noise Approximation (LNA), is computationally efficient for tasks such as simulation, sensitivity analysis, and parameter estimation; however, it is only accurate for linear systems and short-time predictions. Other models may achieve greater accuracy across a broader range of systems, but they sacrifice computational efficiency and analytical tractability. This paper demonstrates that, with specific modifications, the LNA can accurately capture non-linear dynamics in population processes. We introduce a new framework based on centre manifold theory, a classical concept from non-linear dynamical systems. This approach enables the identification of simple, system-specific modifications to the LNA, tailored to classes of qualitatively similar non-linear dynamical systems. With these modifications, the LNA can achieve accurate long-term simulations without compromising computational efficiency. We apply our methodology to classes of oscillatory and bi-stable systems, and present multiple examples from molecular population dynamics that demonstrate accurate long-term simulations alongside significant improvements in computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear PDEs with modulated dispersion IV: normal form approach and unconditional uniqueness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the modulated Korteweg-de~Vries equation (KdV) on the circle with a time non-homogeneous modulation acting on the linear dispersion term. By adapting the normal form approach to the modulated setting, we prove sharp unconditional uniqueness of solutions to the modulated KdV in $L^2(\mathbb T)$ if a modulation is sufficiently irregular. For example, this result implies that if the modulation is given by a sample path of a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst index $0 &lt; H &lt; \frac 25$, the modulated KdV on the circle is unconditionally well-posed in $L^2(\mathbb T)$. Our normal form approach provides the construction of solutions to the modulated KdV (and the associated nonlinear Young integral) {\it without} assuming any positive regularity in time. As an interesting byproduct of our normal form approach, we extend the construction of the nonlinear Young integral to a much larger class of functions, and obtain an improved Euler approximation scheme as compared to the classical sewing lemma approach.
  We also establish analogous sharp unconditional uniqueness results for the modulated Benjamin-Ono equation and the modulated derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) with a quadratic nonlinearity. In the appendix, we prove sharp unconditional uniqueness of the cubic modulated NLS on the circle in $H^{\frac 16}(\mathbb T)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10538v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a systematic solution method for optimal stopping problems of spectrally negative L\'evy processes. Our approach relies essentially on the potential theory, in particular the Riesz decomposition and the maximum principle. Using these mathematical results, we not only derive necessary and sufficient conditions of optimality for a broad class of reward functions, but also develop a method to tackle general problems in a direct and constructive way (without pre-specifying the solution form). To reinforce the latter point, we provide a step-by-step solution procedure applicable to complex solution structures, including continuation regions with multiple connected components.</description>

      <title>Boosted second moment method in random regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining the asymptotic independence ratio of random regular graphs is a key challenge in the area of sparse random graphs. Due to the interpolation method, we have very good upper bounds at our disposal, which are actually known to be sharp for sufficiently large degrees. However, we are still in need of good explicit lower bounds for specific degrees.
  The classical approach by Frieze and {\L}uczak achieves a lower bound by first applying the second moment method to sparse Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi graphs, and then cleverly transitioning from that model to regular graphs. They obtain an asymptotic formula (as the degree tends to infinity) but no explicit lower bounds are derived for specific degrees.
  In contrast, in this paper, we apply the second moment method directly to random regular graphs. This approach has a number of advantages. First, we can numerically compute good explicit lower bounds for any given degree $d$. Moreover, we can even boost this lower bound by arguing that the obtained independent set has a certain spatial Markov property. One can then exploit this property by making local modifications to the independent set, resulting in substantial improvements, and beating the previous best bounds for any $d \geq 10$. Finally, this method gives finer asymptotics as $d \to \infty$ than the original Frieze--{\L}uczak approach.
  Moreover, these results can be useful even beyond the scope of the independence ratio due to the fact that independent sets with the Markov property may be used to construct other objects in random regular graphs. To demonstrate this, we consider the problem of decomposing random regular graphs into stars.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic $O (N)$ linear sigma model and its mean-field limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study large $N$ limits of the hyperbolic $O(N)$ linear sigma model ($\text{HLSM}_N$) on the two-dimensional torus $\mathbb T^2$, namely, a system of $N$ interacting stochastic damped nonlinear wave equations (SdNLW) with coupled cubic nonlinearities. After establishing (pathwise) global well-posedness of $\text{HLSM}_N$ and the limiting equation, called the mean-field SdNLW, we first establish global-in-time convergence of $\text{HLSM}_N$ to the mean-field SdNLW with general initial data (under a suitable assumption). In particular, for the local-in-time convergence, we obtain an optimal convergence rate of order $N^{- \frac 12}$ under an additional integrability assumption on initial data. We then show that the invariant Gibbs dynamics for $\text{HLSM}_N$ converges to that for the mean-field SdNLW with a convergence rate of order $N^{- \frac 12}$ on any large time intervals.</description>

      <title>Long-Term Average Impulse and Singular Control of a Growth Model with Two Revenue Sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes and explicitly solves a class of long-term average impulse control problems and a related class of singular control problems. The underlying process is a general one-dimensional diffusion with appropriate boundary behavior. The model is motivated by applications such as the optimal long-term management of renewable resources and financial portfolio management. A large class of admissible policies is identified over which the agent seeks to maximize her long-term average reward, consisting of a running reward and income from either discrete impulses or singular actions. The long-term expected total reward and its relation to overtaking optimality is also considered. Sensitivity analysis with regard to the parameters of the impulse control model are performed. Key connections between the impulse and singular control problems are displayed.</description>

      <title>Large fluctuations of sums of a random multiplicative function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $f$ be a Rademacher or Steinhaus random multiplicative function. For various arithmetically interesting subsets $\mathcal A\subseteq [1, N]\cap\mathbb N$ such that the distribution of $\sum_{n\in \mathcal A} f(n)$ is approximately Gaussian, we develop a general framework to understand the large fluctuations of the sum. This extends the general central limit theorem framework of Soundararajan and Xu.
  In the case when $\mathcal A = (N-H, N]$ is a short interval with admissible $H=H(N)$, we show that almost surely \begin{equation*}
  \limsup_{N\to\infty} \frac{\big\lvert\sum_{N-H&lt;n\leq N} f(n)\big\rvert}{\sqrt{H\log \frac{N}H{}}}&gt;0. \end{equation*} When $\mathcal A$ is the set of values of an admissible polynomial $P\in\mathbb Z[x]$, we extend work of Klurman, Shkredov, and Xu, as well as Chinis and the author, showing that almost surely \begin{equation*}
  \limsup_{N\to\infty} \frac{\big\lvert\sum_{n\leq N} f(P(n))\big\rvert}{\sqrt{N \log\log N}}&gt;0, \end{equation*} even when $P$ is a product of linear factors over $\mathbb Q$. In this case, we also establish the corresponding almost sure upper bound, matching the law of iterated logarithm.
  An important ingredient in our work is bounding the Kantorovich--Wasserstein distance by means of a quantitative martingale central limit theorem.</description>
