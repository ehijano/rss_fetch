      <title>Dynamics of quasi-one-dimensional quantum droplets in Bose-Bose mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of quasi-one-dimensional quantum droplets of Bose-Einstein condensates are investigated analytically and numerically, taking into account the contribution of quantum fluctuations. Through the development of a variational approach employing the super-Gaussian function, we identify stationary parameters for the quantum droplets. The frequency of breathing mode oscillations in these quantum droplets is estimated. Moreover, the study reveals that periodic modulation in time of the atomic scattering length induces resonance oscillations in quantum droplet parameters or the emission of linear waves, contingent on the amplitude of the external modulation. A similar analysis is conducted for the Lee-Huang-Yang fluid, confined in a parabolic potential. Theoretical predictions are corroborated through direct numerical simulations of the governing extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Additionally, we study the collision dynamics of quasi-one-dimensional quantum droplets.</description>

      <title>Quantum Triticality of Bosonic Atomic-Molecular Mixtures with Feshbach Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a functional integral formulation for a homogeneous bosonic atomic-molecular mixture with Feshbach coupling in three-spatial dimensions. Taking phase stability into account, we establish a rich ground-state phase diagram, which features three regions: molecular superfluid (MSF), atomic-molecular superfluid (AMSF), and phase separation (PS). The system can accommodate up to two tricritical points where the three regions meet, with one tricritical point being intrinsic and the other being conditional. Strikingly, we show that the sound velocity vanishes as the AMSF phase touches on the border of phase separation lines. We find that quantum fluctuations correction to the ground-state energy and quantum depletion of the condensates vary nonmonotonically with Feshbach coupling strength as well as molecular percentage. Correlation functions such as pairing amplitudes, density structure factor and spin density structure factor show characteristic behaviors when the system crosses phase transitions. Our work paves the way for future advancement toward understanding salient physics of atom-molecular mixtures.</description>

      <title>Phase-space localization at the lowest Landau level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider bosons with weak contact interactions in a harmonic trap and focus on states at the lowest Landau level. Motivated by the known nontrivial phase-space topography of the energy functional of the corresponding Gross-Pitaevskii equation, we explore Husimi densities of quantum energy eigenstates in the classical phase space of the Schroedinger field. With interactions turned off, the energy levels are highly degenerate and the Husimi densities do not manifest any particular localization properties. With interactions turned on, the degeneracy is lifted, and a selection of energy levels emerges whose Husimi densities are localized around low-dimensional surfaces in the phase space.</description>

      <title>Quantum phases of hardcore bosons with repulsive dipolar density-density interactions on two-dimensional lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the ground-state quantum phase diagram of hardcore Bosons interacting with repulsive dipolar potentials. The bosons dynamics is described by the extended-Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian on a two-dimensional lattice. The ground state results from the interplay between the lattice geometry and the long-range interactions, which we account for by means of a classical spin mean-field approach limited by the size of the considered unit cells. This extended classical spin mean-field theory accounts for the long-range density-density interaction without truncation. We consider three different lattice geometries: square, honeycomb, and triangular. In the limit of zero hopping the ground state is always a devil's staircase of solid (gapped) phases. Such crystalline phases with broken translational symmetry are robust with respect to finite hopping amplitudes. At intermediate hopping amplitudes, these gapped phases melt, giving rise to various lattice supersolid phases, which can have exotic features with multiple sublattice densities. At sufficiently large hoppings the ground state is a superfluid. The stability of phases predicted by our approach is gauged by comparison to the known quantum phase diagrams of the Bose-Hubbard model with nearest-neighbour interactions as well as quantum Monte Carlo simulations for the dipolar case on the square and triangular lattice. Our results are of immediate relevance for experimental realisations of self-organised crystalline ordering patterns in analogue quantum simulators, e.g., with ultracold dipolar atoms in an optical lattice.</description>

      <title>Thermal masses and trapped-ion quantum spin models: a self-consistent approach to Yukawa-type interactions in the $\lambda\!\phi^4$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06113v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum simulation of magnetism in trapped-ion systems makes use of the crystal vibrations to mediate pairwise interactions between spins, which are encoded in the internal electronic states of the ions, and measured in experiments that probe the real-time dynamics. These interactions can be accounted for by a long-wavelength relativistic theory, where the phonons are described by a coarse-grained Klein-Gordon field $\phi(x)$ locally coupled to the spins that acts as a carrier, leading to an analogue of pion-mediated Yukawa interactions. In the vicinity of a structural transition of the ion crystal, one must go beyond the Klein-Gordon fields, and include additional $\lambda\phi^4$ terms responsible for phonon-phonon scattering. This leads to quantum effects that can be expressed by Feynman loop integrals that modify the range of the Yukawa-type spin interactions; an effect that could be used to probe the underlying fixed point of this quantum field theory (QFT). Unfortunately, the rigidity of the trapped-ion crystal makes it challenging to observe genuine quantum effects, such as the flow of the critical point with the quartic coupling $\lambda$. We hereby show that thermal effects, which can be controlled by laser cooling, can unveil this flow through the appearance of thermal masses in interacting QFTs. We perform self-consistent calculations that resum certain Feynman diagrams and, additionally, go beyond mean-field theory to predict how measurements on the trapped-ion spin system can probe key properties of the $\lambda\phi^4$ QFT.</description>

      <title>In situ subwavelength microscopy of ultracold atoms using dressed excited states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we implement a new method for imaging ultracold atoms with subwavelength resolution capabilities and determine its regime of validity. It uses the laser driven interaction between excited states to engineer hyperfine ground state population transfer in a three-level system on scales much smaller than the optical resolution. Subwavelength imaging of a quantum gas is atypical in the sense that the measurement itself perturbs the dynamics of the system. To avoid induced dynamics affecting the measurement, one usually measures "rapidly" the wavefunction in a so-called strong imaging regime. We experimentally illustrate this regime using a thermal gas ensemble, and demonstrate subwavelength resolution in quantitative agreement with a fully analytical model. Additionally, we show that, counter-intuitively, the opposite weak imaging regime can also be exploited to reach subwavelength resolution. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that this regime is a robust solution to select and spatially resolve a 30 nm wide wavefunction, which was created and singled out from a tightly confined 1D optical lattice. Using a general dissipation-included formalism, we derive validity criteria for both regimes. The formalism is applicable to other subwavelength methods.</description>

      <title>Quantum superpositions of current states in Rydberg-atom networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03202v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of many-body quantum systems using Rydberg-atom platforms has become of extreme interest in the last years. The possibility to realize spin Hamiltonians and the accurate control at the single atom level paved the way for the study of quantum phases of matter and dynamics. Here, we propose a quantum optimal control protocol to engineer current states: quantum states characterized by Rydberg excitations propagating in a given spatially closed tweezer networks. Indeed, current states with different winding numbers can be generated on demand. Besides those ones with single winding number, superposition of quantum current states characterized by more winding numbers can be obtained. The single current states are eigenstates of the current operator that therefore can define an observable that remains persistent at any time. In particular, the features of the excitations dynamics reflects the nature of current states, a fact that in principle can be used to characterize the nature of the flow experimentally without the need of accessing high order correlators.</description>
