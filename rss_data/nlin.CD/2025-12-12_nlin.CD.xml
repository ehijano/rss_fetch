      <title>An improved approach for estimating the dimension of inertial manifolds in chaotic distributed dynamical systems via analysis of angles between tangent subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While a previously proposed method for estimating inertial manifold dimension, based on explicitly computing angles between pairs of covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs), employs efficient algorithms, it remains computationally demanding due to its substantial resource requirements. In this work, we introduce an improved method to determine this dimension by analyzing the angles between tangent subspaces spanned by the CLVs. This approach builds upon a fast numerical technique for assessing chaotic dynamics hyperbolicity. Crucially, the proposed method requires significantly less computational effort and minimizes memory usage by eliminating the need for explicit CLV computation. We test our method on two canonical systems: the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation and a diffusively coupled chain of Lorenz oscillators. For the former, the results confirm the accuracy of the new approach by matching prior dimension estimates. For the latter, the analysis demonstrates the absence of a low-dimensional inertial manifold, highlighting a complex regime that merits further investigation. The presented method offers a practical and efficient tool for characterizing high-dimensional attractors in extended dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Chaotic discretization theorems for forced linear and nonlinear coupled oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the holding of chaos in the sense of Li-Yorke for a family of four-dimensional discrete dynamical systems that are naturally associated to ODEs systems describing coupled oscillators subject to an external nonconservative force, also giving an example of a discrete map that is Li-Yorke chaotic but not topologically transitive. Analytical results are generalized to a modular definition of the problem and to a system of nonlinear oscillators described by polynomial potentials in one coordinate. We perform numerical simulations looking for a strange attractor of the system; furthermore, we present the bifurcation diagram and perform a bifurcation analysis of the system.</description>

      <title>Chaotic dynamics of a continuous and discrete generalized Ziegler pendulum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present analytical and numerical results on integrability and transition to chaotic motion for a generalized Ziegler pendulum, a double pendulum subject to an angular elastic potential and a follower force. Several variants of the original dynamical system, including the presence of gravity and friction, are considered, in order to analyze whether the integrable cases are preserved or not in presence of further external forces, both potential and non-potential. Particular attention is devoted to the presence of dissipative forces, that are analyzed in two different formulations. Furthermore, a study of the discrete version is performed. The analysis of periodic points, that is presented up to period 3, suggests that the discrete map associated to the dynamical system has not dense sets of periodic points, so that the map would not be chaotic in the sense of Devaney for a choice of the parameters that corresponds to a general case of chaotic motion for the original system.</description>

      <title>Synchronization in Networks of Heterogeneous Kuramoto-Sakaguchi Oscillators with Higher-order Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How do the combined effects of phase frustration, noise, and higher-order interactions govern synchronization in globally coupled heterogeneous Kuramoto oscillators? To address this question, we investigate a globally coupled network of Kuramoto-Sakaguchi oscillators that includes both pairwise (1-simplex) and higher-order (2-simplex) interactions, together with additive stochastic forcing. Systematic numerical simulations across a broad range of coupling strengths, phase-lag values, and noise intensities reveal that synchronization emerges through a nontrivial interplay among these parameters. In general, weak frustration combined with mutually reinforcing coupling promotes synchronization, whereas strong frustration favors coherence under repulsive coupling. Forward and backward parameter sweeps reveal the coexistence of synchronized and desynchronized states. The presence and width of this bistable region depend sensitively on phase frustration, noise intensity, and higher-order coupling strength, with higher-order interactions significantly widening the bistable interval. To explain these behaviors, we employ the Ott-Antonsen reduction to derive a low-dimensional amplitude equation that predicts the forward critical point in the thermodynamic limit, the backward saddle-node point, and the width of the bistable region. Higher order interactions widen this region by shifting the saddle-node point without affecting the forward critical point. Further analysis of Kramer's escape rate explains how noise destabilizes coexistence states and diminishes bistability. Overall, our results provide a unified theoretical and numerical framework for frustrated, noisy, higher-order oscillator networks, revealing that synchronization is strongly influenced by the combined action of phase frustration, stochasticity, and both pairwise and higher-order interactions.</description>

      <title>Melnikov Method for a Class of Generalized Ziegler Pendulums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Melnikov method is applied to a class of generalized Ziegler pendulums. We find an analytical form for the separatrix of the system in terms of Jacobian elliptic integrals, holding for a large class of initial conditions and parameters. By working in Duffing approximation, we apply the Melnikov method to the original Ziegler system, showing that the first non-vanishing Melnikov integral appears in the second order. An explicit expression for the Melnikov integral is derived in the presence of a time-periodic external force and for a suitable choice of the parameters, as well as in the presence of a dissipative term acting on the lower rod of the pendulum. These results allow us to define fundamental relationships between the Melnikov integral and a proper control parameter that distinguishes between regular and chaotic orbits for the original dynamical system. Finally, in the appendix, we present proof of a conjecture concerning the non-validity of Devaney's chaoticity definition for a discrete map associated with the system.</description>

      <title>Deep Thermalization and Measurements of Quantum Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum resource theories (QRTs) provide a unified framework for characterizing useful quantum phenomena subject to physical constraints, but are notoriously hard to assess in experimental systems. In this letter, we introduce a unified protocol for quantifying the resource-generating power (RGP) of arbitrary quantum evolutions applicable to multiple QRTs. It is based on deep thermalization (DT), which has recently gained attention for its role in the emergence of quantum state designs from partial projective measurements. Central to our approach is the use of projected ensembles, recently employed to probe DT, together with new twirling identities that allow us to directly infer the RGP of the underlying dynamics. These identities further reveal how resources build up and thermalize in generic quantum circuits. Finally, we show that quantum resources themselves undergo deep thermalization at the subsystem level, offering a complementary and another experimentally accessible route to infer the RGP. Our work connects deep thermalization to resource quantification, offering a new perspective on the essential role of various resources in generating state designs.</description>

      <title>Twisted homoclinic orbits in Lorenz and Chen systems: rigorous proofs from universal normal form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The properties common to the Lorenz and Chen attractors, as well as their fundamental differences, have been studied for many years in a vast number of works and remain a topic far from a rigorous and complete description. In this paper we take a step towards solving this problem by carrying out a rigorous study of the so-called universal normal form to which we have reduced the systems of both of these families. For this normal form, we prove the existence of infinite set of homoclinic orbits with different topological structure defined by the number of rotations around axis of symmetry. We show that these rotational topological features are inherited by the attractors of Chen-type systems and give rise to their twisted nature - the generic difference from attractors of Lorenz type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform an analytical four loop calculation of exponent $z$ in model A of critical dynamics in $d=4-2\varepsilon$ dimensions. This is the first time such a large order of perturbation theory has been calculated analytically for models of critical dynamics. To do this, we apply the modern method of parametrical integration with hyperlogaritms. We discuss in detail peculiarities of application of this method to critical dynamics, e.g. the problem of linear-irreducible diagrams already present in four loop (contrary to statics where the first linear-irreducible diagram appears in six loop).</description>

      <title>The dynamics of thermalisation in the Galerkin-truncated, three-dimensional Euler equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inviscid, partial differential equations of hydrodynamics when projected via a Galerkin-truncation on a finite-dimensional subspace spanning wavenumbers $-{\bf K}_{\rm G} \le {\bf k} \le {\bf K}_{\rm G}$, and hence retaining a finite number of modes $N_{\rm G}$, lead to absolute equilibrium states. We review how the Galerkin-truncated, three-dimensional, incompressible Euler equation thermalises and its connection to questions in turbulence. We also discuss an emergent pseudo-dissipation range in the energy spectrum and the time-scales associated with thermalisation.</description>

      <title>Identifying efficient routes to laminarization: an optimization approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear and chaotic nature of turbulent flows poses a major challenge for designing effective control strategies to maintain or induce low-drag laminar states. Traditional linear methods often fail to capture the complex dynamics governing transitions between laminar and turbulent regimes. In this work, we introduce the concept of the minimal seed for relaminarization-the closest point to a reference state in the turbulent region of the state space that triggers a direct transition to laminar flow without a chaotic transient. We formulate the identification of this optimal perturbation as a fully nonlinear optimization problem and develop a numerical framework based on a multi-step penalty method to compute it. Applying this framework to a nine-mode model of a sinusoidal shear flow, we compute the minimal seeds for both transition to turbulence and relaminarization. While both of these minimal seeds lie infinitesimally close to the laminar-turbulent boundary-the edge of chaos-they are generally unrelated and lie in distant and qualitatively distinct regions of state space, thereby providing different insights into the flow's underlying structure. We find that the optimal perturbation for triggering transition is primarily in the direction of the mode representing streamwise vortices (rolls), whereas the optimal perturbation for relaminarization is distributed across multiple modes without strong contributions in the roll or streak directions. By analyzing trajectories originating from these minimal seeds, we find that both transition and laminarization behavior are controlled by the stable and unstable manifolds of a periodic orbit on the edge of chaos. The laminarizing trajectory obtained from the minimal seed for relaminarization provides an efficient pathway out of turbulence and can inform the design and evaluation of flow control strategies aimed at inducing laminarization.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Turing Instability and Emergent Spectral Scaling in Chiral Active Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21012v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spontaneous emergence of coherent structures from chaotic backgrounds is a hallmark of active biological swarms. We investigate this self-organization by simulating an ensemble of polar chiral active agents that couple locally via a Kuramoto interaction. We demonstrate that the system's transition from chaos to active turbulence is characterized by quantized loop phase currents and coherent clustering, and that this transition is strictly governed by a kinetic Turing instability. By deriving the continuum kinetic theory for the model, we identify that the competition between local phase-locking and active agent motility selects a critical structural wavenumber. The instability drives the system into a state of developed turbulence that exhibits stable, robust power-laws in spectral density, suggestive of universality and consistent with observations from a broad range of turbulent phenomena. Our results bridge the gap between discrete chimera states and continuous fluid turbulence, suggesting that the statistical laws of active matter can arise from fundamental kinetic instability criteria.</description>
