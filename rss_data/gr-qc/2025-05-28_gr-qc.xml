      <title>Maximum mass of singularity-free anisotropic compact stars in Rastall theory of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current model explores spherically symmetric anisotropic compact stars within the Rastall theory of gravity. By employing the Krori and Barua metric ansatz (K.D. Krori and J. Barua, J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 8 (1975) 508), we derive a set of tractable, singularity-free relativistic solutions to the Einstein field equations. Using a best-fit equation for the numerical solution of the TOV equation, we determine the maximum mass and corresponding radius in this model. Our findings reveal that an increase in the Rastall parameter $(\xi)$ leads to a higher maximum mass, indicating a stiffer nature of the equation of state. For $\xi$ values ranging from 0.01 to 0.09, we calculate the maximum mass to be between $2.24M_{\odot}$ and $2.36M_{\odot}$, with corresponding radii from 9.48 to 10.15 km. Furthermore, our model's predictions for the radii of recently observed pulsars are consistent with observational data. The model satisfies essential criteria for causality, energy conditions, and stability, confirming its viability and physical acceptability as a stellar structure.</description>

      <title>Revisiting GW150914 with a non-planar, eccentric waveform model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first direct detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO collaboration, GW150914, marked the start of a new exciting era in astronomy, enabling the study of the Universe through a new messenger. Since then, the field has grown rapidly, with the development of increasingly more sophisticated techniques to detect, analyze and interpret the signals. In this paper we revisit GW150914, presenting updated estimates of its source parameters using a waveform model developed within the EOB formalism, able to describe gravitational-wave emission from generic non-circular, non-planar binaries. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the signal and its properties, considering and contrasting various scenarios for the source: from the simplest, aligned-spin quasi-circular binary black hole merger, to more complex scenarios, including precession, eccentricity or both. Unsurprisingly, we find that the signal is consistent with a quasi-circular ($e &lt; 0.08$ at $15$ Hz), slowly spinning $(\chi_{\rm eff} = -0.03^{+0.12}_{-0.13})$ binary black hole merger, a-posteriori validating a considerable body of works. This is the first analysis performed with an inspiral-merger-ringdown model containing both eccentricity and precession.</description>

      <title>Probing gravitational waves using GNSS constellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves opened up a new window to look into the Universe by probing phenomena invisible through electromagnetic observations. As gravitational waves interact very weakly with matter, their detection is challenging and expensive. So far, they have been observed in the nHz frequency and audible ranges. Future detectors are expected to cover the mHz frequency, leaving the $\mu$Hz regime largely unexplored. With on-board atomic clocks and orbits determined to the cm, Global Navigation Satellite System constellations (GNSS), like GPS or Galileo, offer free access to more than 30 years of clock and orbit data for tests of general relativity. We develop a framework for calculating the deviation in the evolution of GNSS orbits induced by gravitational wave signals. We show that when a gravitational wave interacts in resonance with a satellite's orbit, effects amplify, which can be used to bridge the gap in the $\mu$Hz regime. Finally, we demonstrate that the orbital deviations induced by gravitational waves are coherent across the entire constellation, enabling a satellite network to disentangle GW effects from satellite systematics.</description>

      <title>Comment on "On the bound states of the Schwarzschild black hole" by S. H. V\"olkel: A Reassessment of the Bound-State Analogy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This comment critically examines the recent proposal by S.~H.~V\"olkel [Phys. Rev. Lett., arXiv:2505.17186], which asserts that the quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum of Schwarzschild black holes can be reconstructed from bound states of an inverted Regge--Wheeler potential. We demonstrate that this claim rests on a mathematically invalid spectral mapping and a misapplication of boundary conditions that define QNMs. Through a detailed figure-by-figure analysis, we expose deep inconsistencies in the numerical results and their physical interpretations. The inversion method, inspired by Mashhoon, is shown to fail in capturing the non-Hermitian, complex nature of black hole resonances. We contrast this with the rigorously established asymptotic structure of QNMs derived by Hod and others, concluding that the bound-state framework offers no reliable insight into black hole spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Matter Accumulations and Accretion Tori around Wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study circular orbits and accretion structures around symmetric wormholes. As exemplary solutions we choose three different wormhole spacetimes, namely rotating traversable wormholes from the Teo class, the rotating Simpson-Visser metric with the parameter spectrum corresponding to wormholes and a static wormhole from beyond Horndeski theories. We show the existence of a spectrum of circular orbits at the wormhole throat for each of these wormhole solutions and analyze the boundaries of this spectrum across the respective wormhole parameter range. For each of the solutions we identified that vast regions of the parameter space correspond to stable orbits. The presence of this orbit spectrum can be linked through accretion disk models to matter accumulations which may form at the throat. We present here examples of such disk solutions by implementing the Polish Doughnut model. In some cases, these matter accumulations are encapsulating the throat and could imply central bright regions of the wormhole spacetime. Furthermore, the combined analysis of the equatorial Keplerian orbits and the throat orbits, leads to a set of different disk configurations, where matter accumulations at the throat may be present with outer tori around them, in some cases also as a connected structure. Our results may hint to possible instabilities of wormholes, especially if they have an ergoregion. Moreover, wormholes with such disks, may appear more star-like when it comes to their observational signature, due to the centralized and more spherical emission profile associated with the possible matter accumulations at the throat.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition and Critical Phenomena of Charged Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phase transition and critical phenomenon of charged black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-scalar (EMs) theory. Through comprehensive analysis of thermodynamic behaviors manifested in P-V diagrams, G(T,P) surfaces, and C_P curves, we establish that these black holes exhibit van der Waals-type phase transition behavior. The derived critical exponents governing the phase transition show precise correspondence with both van der Waals gas-liquid systems, reinforcing the connection between black hole thermodynamics and mean field theory statistics. The findings reveal a crucial dependence of phase transition properties on the scalar charge parameter. A critical threshold emerges where phase transitions become prohibited when scalar charge exceeds a specific magnitude. However, the transition persists asymptotically as scalar charge approaches zero. The analysis further demonstrates nonlinear relationships between scalar charge and critical parameters: while small scalar charges induce increasing critical volume with charge magnitude, larger values produce an inverse trend. Critical temperature displays complementary behavior, maintaining monotonic variation under certain conditions while exhibiting inverse correlation with critical volume in others. Significantly, the transition points governing critical volume and temperature trends occur at distinct scalar charge values for different black holes, indicating a non-trivial parameter dependence. These results highlight the scalar charge's dual role as both an enabler and suppressor of phase transitions in EMs black holes, providing new insights into the interplay between geometric configurations and thermodynamic properties in modified gravity theories.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical effect of condensation of a classical spinor field at the event horizon is under consideration. The corresponding solution is sought for the set of the Einstein-Dirac equations. It is shown that in this case there arises a black hole with a $\delta$-like classical spinor field concentrated at the event horizon.</description>

      <title>Black Bounces in $f(Q)$ Gravity with Magnetic Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the source of the black bounce is discussed in the context of $f(Q)$ theory. A body of research has been dedicated to the study of symmetric black bounce solutions that are generated by a combination of a scalar field with a non-zero potential and a magnetic charge within the framework of non-linear electrodynamics. As exact solutions are not obtained, the metric functions of Simpson-Visser and Bardeen type of black bounce are studied in the field equations. black bounce solutions are obtained by violating at least one energy condition for the Simpson-Visser and Bardeen type for an ordinary scalar field in $f(Q)$ gravity, which is only achieved by a phantom scalar field in general relativity.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic polytrope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study self-gravitating objects that obey a polytropic equation of state in hyperbolic symmetry. Specifically, we describe in detail the steps to derive the Lane-Emden equation from the structure equations of the system. To integrate the equations numerically, we propose the Cosenza-Herrera-Esculpi-Witten anisotropy and study the cases $\gamma \ne 1$ and $\gamma = 1$ in the parameter space of the models. We find that the matter sector exhibits the usual and expected behavior for certain values in this parameter space: energy density (in absolute value) and radial pressure are decreasing functions and vanish at the surface, while the mass function is increasing toward the surface. We find that the anisotropy of the system is positive and decreasing, consistent with the behavior of the radial pressure, which reaches a local minimum at the surface (i.e., the pressure gradient is zero at the surface). We also study the compactness of the dense objects as a function of the polytropic index and obtain that it has an upper bound given by the maximum value it reaches for a certain $n$. Some extensions of the work and future proposals are discussed.</description>

      <title>The old problem of the cosmological constant solved?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate an approach to quantum gravity, called the ring paradigm. Gravity is mediated superluminally, and the graviton is described as a phonon on the grid of matter in the Universe. This theory has very interesting applications to cosmology and would ultimately solve the old problem of the cosmological constant. It further gives new impulses to the scalar field theories because the gravitational ring decays to some phantom field. As is obvious, we radically break the Lorentz invariance, which means that some generalization of the Haag-Lopuszanski-Sohnius theorem in quantum field theory is possible.</description>

      <title>Applying TDI to Hardware-Simulated Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many years of development have gone into producing instruments that meet the required noise performance of the LISA interferometric detection system. Concurrently, software simulations have been used to extensively develop the data analysis libraries to be used in the LISA pipeline, not least among which are the Time Delay Interferometry (TDI) algorithms. To bridge the gap between these two, we are developing a hardware-in-the-loop testbed to apply realistic, time-varying delays to signals traveling between phasemeters. We have shown that the testbed adds a sufficiently low amount of noise across the entire relevant LISA spectrum. We have also injected a realistic gravitational wave signal, generated via the LISA Data Challenge codebase, and successfully extracted it using TDI to remove the obscuring frequency noise of the carrier signal. Future efforts will expand the testbed to create a representative simulation of the entire LISA constellation, with an eye towards its use as a tool to aid in the development of the LISA data analysis pipelines.</description>

      <title>Local well-posedness of the initial value problem in Einstein-Cartan theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the initial value problem in Einstein-Cartan theory which includes torsion and, therefore, a non-symmetric connection on the spacetime manifold. Generalizing the path of a classical theorem by Choquet-Bruhat and York for the Einstein equations, we use a $n+1$ splitting of the manifold and compute the evolution and constraint equations for the Einstein-Cartan system. In the process, we derive the Gauss-Codazzi-Ricci equations including torsion. We prove that the constraint equations are preserved during evolution. Imposing a generalized harmonic gauge, it is shown that the evolution equations can be cast as a quasilinear system in a Cauchy regular form with a characteristic determinant having a non-trivial multiplicity of characteristics. Using the Leray-Ohya theory for non-strictly hyperbolic systems we then establish the local geometric well-posedness of the Cauchy problem, for sufficiently regular initial data. For vanishing torsion we recover the classical results for the Einstein equations.</description>

      <title>On the Asymptotic Nature of Cosmological Effective Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Much of our intuition about Effective Field Theories (EFTs) stems from their formulation in flat spacetime, yet EFTs have become indispensable tools in cosmology, where time-dependent backgrounds are the norm. In this work, we demonstrate that in spacetimes undergoing significant expansion-such as accelerated FLRW and de Sitter backgrounds-the contributions of operators with mass dimension $\Delta$ to physical observables grow factorially with $\Delta$ at fixed couplings. This behavior stands in stark contrast to expectations from flat spacetime. As a result, the cosmological EFT expansion is generally asymptotic rather than convergent, even at tree level.
  To illustrate this phenomenon, we analyze simple toy models involving a massless or conformally coupled scalar field interacting with a heavy scalar with zero or infinite sound speed. We demonstrate that meaningful EFT predictions can still be extracted via appropriate resummation techniques, performed in both Fourier and Mellin-momentum space. In the infinite sound speed limit, where the heavy field is effectively non-dynamical, the resummed EFT reproduces the exact result of the full theory. In other cases, the EFT captures only the local part of the dynamics, omitting nonlocal terms, which are exponentially suppressed in the large-mass limit for the Bunch-Davies state.</description>

      <title>Addressing $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions within $f(Q)$ cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the viability of $f(Q)$ gravity as an alternative framework to address the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions in cosmology. Focusing on three representative $f(Q)$ models, we perform a comprehensive Bayesian analysis using a combination of cosmological observations, including cosmic chronometers, Type Ia supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, baryon acoustic oscillations, and redshift-space distortions. Our results demonstrate that most of these models can yield higher values of $H_0$ than those predicted by $\Lambda$CDM, offering a partial alleviation of the tension. In addition, one model satisfies the condition $G_{\mathrm{eff}} &lt; G$ and predicts $S_8$ values consistent with weak lensing observations, making it a promising candidate for addressing the $S_8$ tension. However, these improvements are accompanied by mild internal inconsistencies between different subsets of data, which limit the overall statistical preference relative to $\Lambda$CDM. Despite this, $f(Q)$ gravity remains a promising and flexible framework for late-time cosmology, and our results motivate further exploration of extended or hybrid models that may reconcile all observational constraints.</description>

      <title>The ESPRESSO Redshift Drift Experiment I -- High-resolution spectra of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest of QSO J052915.80-435152.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The measurement of the temporal evolution in the redshift of distant objects, the redshift drift, is a probe of universal expansion and cosmology. We perform the first steps towards a measurement of such effect using the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest in the spectra of bright quasars as a tracer of cosmological expansion. Our goal is to determine to which precision a velocity shift measurement can be carried out with the signal-to-noise (S/N) level currently available and whether this precision aligns with previous theoretical expectations. A precise assessment of the achievable measurement precision is fundamental for estimating the time required to carry out the whole project. We acquire 12 hours of ESPRESSO observations distributed over 0.875 years of the brightest quasar known, J052915.80-435152.0 (z=3.962), to obtain high-resolution spectra of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest, with median S/N of ~86 per 1 km/s pixel at the continuum. We divide the observations into two epochs and analyse them using both a pixel-by-pixel method and a model-based approach. This comparison allows us to estimate the velocity shift between the epochs, as well as the velocity precision that can be achieved at this S/N. The model-based method is calibrated using high-resolution simulations of the intergalactic medium, and it provides greater accuracy compared to the pixel-by-pixel approach. We measure a velocity drift of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest consistent with zero: $\Delta v = -1.25\pm 4.45 {\rm ms^{-1}}$, equivalent to a cosmological drift of $\dot{v}=-1.43\pm 5.09 {\rm ms^{-1}yr^{-1}}$ or $\dot{z}= (-2.19\pm7.77) \times 10^{-8}{\rm yr^{-1}}$. The measurement uncertainties are on par with the expected precision. We estimate that reaching a 99% detection of the cosmic drift requires a monitoring campaign of 5400 hours of integration time over 54 years with an ELT and an ANDES-like high-resolution spectrograph.</description>

      <title>Fragmentation in Collapsar Disks: Migration, Growth, and Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a parameter survey of fragmentation in collapsar disks, using a revised version of the Chen &amp; Beloborodov (2007) model that determines the structure of steady state hyperaccretion disks in a general relativistic and neutrino cooled framework. We map out the range of disk conditions leading to gravitational instability alongside an exploration of the dimensionless cooling time $\beta$, which together determine whether fragmentation is likely to occur. We estimate the initial mass and density of fragments, finding that they occupy a unique region in the space of self-gravitating compact objects, with masses $M_{\rm f} \sim 10^{-3} M_\odot -10^{-1} M_\odot$ and densities $\rho_{\rm f}\sim 10^8-10^{11}~{\rm g~cm}^{-3}$. We then calculate their migration and mass growth (via Bondi-Hoyle accretion) as they inspiral through the collapsar disk. During a fragment's migration to the central black hole, it can grow its mass up to a range $M_{\rm f}\sim 10^{-1} M_\odot - 1 M_\odot$. In most cases, the final fragment mass is larger than the minimum cold stable neutron star mass but much smaller than any observed neutron star. The fragment briefly achieves peak accretion rates comparable to (or even larger than) that of the central engine. We propose that these bound fragments may give rise to observable astrophysical phenomena, and we approximately model two of these: (i) gamma ray burst variability produced by a secondary, fragment-launched jet; (ii) the generation of non-vacuum gravitational waveforms accompanied by electromagnetic counterparts.</description>

      <title>Prospect of Constraining the EoS of Neutron Stars Using Post-Merger Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Post-merger gravitational-wave emission from a binary neutron star merger carries crucial information about the equation of state (EoS) of matter at high temperatures. Current gravitational wave detectors have limited sensitivities at post-merger frequencies in the range [1.5, 4] kHz. Therefore, valuable inferences can only be made after combining information from multiple (BNS) events. Criswell et al. [Phys. Rev. D 107, 043021 (2023)] carries out an injection study to infer the radius posterior for a $1.6 M_{\odot}$ NS by combining the information from injected BNS events via the hierarchical Bayesian inference (HBI) formulation. This formulation utilizes empirical relations that connect the peak frequency of the post-merger remnant with the chirp mass of the system, and the EoS proxy parameter $R_{1.6}$. In this work, we extend the HBI formulation to other EoS proxy parameters (i.e., the radius of (NS), $R_{1.X}$, with masses 1.2, 1.4, and 1.8 $M_{\odot}$) and combine the four $R_{1.X}$ posteriors through the piecewise polytropic EoS model to obtain measurable constraints on the EoS of the NS. We show that the NS radii can be constrained to within $\sim$1 km ( $\sim$0.55 km) assuming uniform (astrophysical) prior on $R_{1.X}$ for injections in the A+ noise. We also study systematic biases in the analysis coming from the limitations of empirical relations.</description>

      <title>Events and their Localisation are Relative to a Lab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notions of events and their localisation fundamentally differ between quantum theory and general relativity, reconciling them becomes even more important and challenging in the context of quantum gravity where a classical spacetime background can no longer be assumed. We therefore propose an operational approach drawing from quantum information, to define events and their localisation relative to a Lab, which in particular includes a choice of physical degree of freedom (the reference) providing a generalised notion of "location". We define a property of the reference, relative measurability, that is sensitive to correlations between the Lab's reference and objects of study. Applying this proposal to analyse the quantum switch (QS), a process widely associated with indefinite causal order, we uncover differences between classical and quantum spacetime realisations of QS, rooted in the relative measurability of the associated references and possibilities for agents' interventions. Our analysis also clarifies a longstanding debate on the interpretation of QS experiments, demonstrating how different conclusions stem from distinct assumptions on the Labs. This provides a foundation for a more unified view of events, localisation, and causality across quantum and relativistic domains.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave signatures of primordial black hole accretion during early matter domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a scenario in which primordial black holes (PBHs) form in a post-inflationary radiation-dominated (RD) phase and then experience significant accretion during a phase of early matter dominated (EMD). We show that PBH masses could grow by up to two orders of magnitude. Restricting to the linear perturbation regime, we compute the gravitational wave (GW) spectrum that features two peaks. The high-frequency peak is associated with the PBH formation in the RD phase, while the low-frequency peak is due to the sudden transition from EMD to the later, standard RD phase. We identify a PBH mass range where one or both peaks can be observed by a combination of different GW detectors. Finally, we show the signal-to-noise ratio of the total GW spectrum for PBHs in the asteroid mass window, where they could comprise the totality of dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal set theory is an approach to quantum gravity in which spacetime is fundamentally discrete while retaining local Lorentz invariance. The Benincasa--Dowker action is the causal set equivalent to the Einstein--Hilbert action underpinning Einstein's general theory of relativity. We present a $\tilde{O}(n^{2})$ running-time quantum algorithm to compute the Benincasa--Dowker action in arbitrary spacetime dimensions for causal sets with $n$ elements which is asymptotically optimal and offers a polynomial speed up compared to all known classical or quantum algorithms. To do this, we prepare a uniform superposition over an $O(n^{2})$-size arbitrary subset of computational basis states encoding the classical description of a causal set of interest. We then construct $\tilde{O}(n)$-depth oracle circuits testing for different discrete volumes between pairs of causal set elements. Repeatedly performing a two-stage variant of quantum counting using these oracles yields the desired algorithm.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Hubble parameter with the 21 cm brightness temperature signal in a universe with inhomogeneities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the 21\,cm brightness temperature as a probe of the Hubble tension in the framework of an inhomogeneous cosmological model. Employing Buchert's averaging formalism to study the effect of inhomogeneities on the background evolution, we consider scaling laws for the backreaction and curvature consistent with structure formation simulations. We calibrate the effective matter density using MCMC analysis using Union 2.1 Supernova Ia data. Our results show that a higher Hubble constant ($\sim73$\,km/s/Mpc) leads to a shallower absorption feature in the brightness temperature versus redshift curve. On the other hand, a lower value ($\sim67$\,km/s/Mpc) produces a remarkable dip in the brightness temperature $T_{21}$. Such a substantial difference is absent in the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Our findings indicate that inhomogeneities could significantly affect the 21\,cm signal, and may shed further light on the different measurements of the Hubble constant.</description>

      <title>Model-independent cosmological inference after the DESI DR2 data with improved inverse distance ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurements from the DESI survey have suggested hints of dynamical dark energy, challenging the standard $\Lambda $CDM model. In this work, we adopt an improved inverse distance ladder approach based on the latest cosmological data to provide a model-independent perspective, employing a global parametrization based on cosmic age (PAge). Our analysis incorporates DESI DR2 BAO measurements, cosmic chronometer (CC) data, and type Ia supernovae (SNe) observations from either the DESY5 or PantheonPlus datasets. For the DESY5+DESI DR2+CC datasets, we obtain $H_0 = 67.91 \pm 2.33~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$. This value is consistent with the Planck 2018 result, while shows $2.0 \sigma$ tension with the SH0ES measurement. Furthermore, by mapping specific cosmological models into PAge approximation parameter space $(p_{\mathrm{age}}, \eta)$, our model-independent analysis reveals a notable deviation from the $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ model, as indicated by the DESY5 and DESI DR2 datasets. Finally, DESY5+DESI DR2+CC datasets provide nearly decisive evidence favoring the PAge model over the standard $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ model. These findings highlight the need for further investigation into the expansion history to better understand the deviations from the $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ model.</description>

      <title>Complete Catalog of Laser Locking Configurations for LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will enable direct observations of low-frequency gravitational waves, offering unprecedented insight into astrophysical and cosmological phenomena. LISA's heterodyne interferometric measurement system requires phase-locking five of its six onboard lasers with tunable frequency offsets to ensure that all beatnotes remain within the metrology system's operational range, despite Doppler-induced frequency shifts. The selection of these offset frequencies -- collectively forming a frequency plan -- is a complex optimization problem constrained by the spacecraft's orbital dynamics and instrument limitations. While previous work established an algorithmic solution for deriving time-dependent frequency plans, this study takes a complementary approach by systematically analyzing and cataloging all possible laser locking configurations. We present an automated method to explore, validate, and classify viable locking schemes, identifying 36 unique non-frequency-swapping configurations and 72 additional frequency-swapping configurations for an arbitrary choice of primary laser. This exhaustive classification provides a foundation for frequency planning across the full range of operational scenarios.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints on small-scale primordial non-Gaussianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In contrast to the large-scale primordial power spectrum $\mathcal{P}_{\zeta}(k)$ and primordial non-Gaussianity $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$, which are strictly constrained, the small-scale $\mathcal{P}_{\zeta}(k)$ and $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ remain less restricted. Considering local-type primordial non-Gaussianity, we study the PBH and SIGW caused by large-amplitude small-scale primordial power spectrum. By analyzing current observational data from PTA, CMB, BAO, and abundance of PBH, and combining them with the SNR analysis of LISA, we rigorously constrain the parameter space of $\mathcal{P}_{\zeta}(k)$ and $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$. Furthermore, we examine the effects of different shapes of the primordial power spectrum on these constraints and comprehensively calculate the Bayes factors for various models. Our results indicate that SIGW generated by a monochromatic primordial power spectrum are more likely to dominate current PTA observations, with the corresponding constraint on the primordial non-Gaussian parameter being $-10.0&lt;f_{\mathrm{NL}}&lt;1.2$.</description>

      <title>New modeling for hybrid stars with an elastic quark core</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heavy neutron stars may contain solid quark cores as motivated by, e.g. the crystalline color superconducting phase, forming elastic hybrid stars (HSs). Many previous studies assumed an elastic core to be unsheared for the background, static and spherically symmetric configuration, and introduced shear deformation only at a perturbative level. This study relaxes this assumption and explores the influence of non-linear elasticity on the static, spherically symmetric structure of elastic HSs within a fully relativistic elasticity framework. Such a framework effectively introduces anisotropic pressure within the quark matter core due to elasticity. The quark core is modeled using a quasi-Hookean equation of state (EOS) with shear contributions, while the nuclear matter envelope is treated as a perfect fluid. We find that including elasticity increases the maximum mass of HSs by several percent. This enhancement allows some soft EOSs to satisfy current observational constraints. However, since the effects of elasticity are primarily concentrated in the high-mass regime, the current observational constraints are insufficient to distinguish whether an elastic anisotropic quark core exists within these stars. Additionally, we show that the compactness of stable stars can exceed the critical value of 1/3 due to the inclusion of elasticity, making them potential candidates for black hole mimickers. Furthermore, we found that common phenomenological models fail to describe the anisotropy of the elastic core and propose a new parametrized anisotropy model that can accurately capture physically-motivated profiles with an error of 10% across a wide parameter space. This work not only bridges the gap between elastic EOSs and parametrized anisotropic models but also provides a foundation for applications such as studying nonradial perturbations, tidal deformability, and pulsation modes for elastic HSs.</description>

      <title>A Bright Future? Prospects for Cosmological Tests of GR with Multimessenger Gravitational Wave Events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Further bright sirens - gravitational wave events with electromagnetic counterparts - are keenly awaited, but proving elusive. The exceptional event GW170817 had a profound impact on the landscape of viable cosmological extensions of General Relativity (GR); can we expect this kind of shift to be repeated in the next decade? In this work we will assess the potential constraints from bright sirens in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O5 era and third generation detector era. We set up the statistical formalism for our constraints, and generate and analyse simulated data in the context of general scalar-tensor theories. We highlight the important role that gamma-ray burst detection has in breaking key parameter degeneracies. We find that the next ten bright sirens alone will not competitively constrain cosmological gravity, but that one year of third generation observations could confidently detect mild departures from GR, e.g. the Horndeski parameter $\alpha_{\rm M}\neq 0$ is detected at greater than $3\sigma$. This justifies investment in a broad range of methods for gravitational wave cosmology (dark sirens, bright sirens and cross-correlation with large-scale structure) to ensure tests of cosmological gravity advance in both the short-term and the long-term.</description>

      <title>Does acceleration always degrade quantum entanglement for tetrapartite Unruh-DeWitt detectors?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous studies have shown that the Unruh effect completely destroys quantum entanglement and coherence of bipartite states, as modeled by entangled Unruh-DeWitt detectors. But does the Unruh effect have a different impact on quantum entanglement of multipartite states within this framework? In this paper, we investigate the influence of the Unruh effect on $1-3$ entanglement in the context of entangled tetrapartite Unruh-DeWitt detectors. We find that quantum entanglement of tetrapartite $W$ state first decreases to a minimum value and then increases to a fixed value with the growth of the acceleration. This indicates that the Unruh effect can, under certain conditions, enhance quantum entanglement. In other words, the Unruh effect plays a dual role in the behavior of quantum entanglement-both diminishing and enhancing it. This discovery challenges and overturns the traditional view that the Unruh effect is solely detrimental to quantum entanglement and coherence in entangled Unruh-DeWitt detectors, offering a fresh and profound perspective on its impact.</description>

Abstract: We present a new method for embedding a causal set into Minkowski spacetime. The method is similar to a previously presented method, but is simpler and provides better embedding results. The method uses spacetime volumes to define causal set analogs of time coordinates for all elements, and spatial distances for pairs of causally related elements. The spatial distances for causally related pairs are then used to derive spatial distances for spacelike separated pairs by applying the triangle inequality. The result is a matrix of spatial distances for all pairs of elements in the causal set. This distance matrix can be decomposed to give coordinates in Minkowski spacetime. Results are presented showing good quality embeddings into Minkowski spacetime for dimensions d=2,3,4.</description>

      <title>The implications of stochastic gas torques for asymmetric binaries in the LISA band</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from asymmetric mass-ratio black-hole binaries carry unique information about their astrophysical environment. For instance, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) could potentially measure the amplitude and slope of gas torques in binaries embedded in the accretion disks of Active Galactic Nuclei, helping differentiate competing accretion disk models. However, this relies on simplified analytic models, which do not account for the stochastic variability of torques seen in hydrodynamic simulations. In this work, we use hydrodynamic simulations to create gravitational waveforms for extreme and intermediate mass-ratio inspirals in the LISA band. We then analyze these simulated waveforms using simpler templates that assume analytic torques, without stochastic time variability. By performing realistic Bayesian parameter estimation, we find no bias at 90% confidence in the binary parameters; however, estimates of accretion disk parameters, such as torque amplitude and slope, may be biased. Typically, the posterior distribution is centered around the average value of the torques, but when stochastic variability is large, the posterior can indicate no torques, even though they are present in the simulation. Our results suggest that while simplified analytic torque models work well for estimating binary parameters, caution is needed when using them to infer properties of the accretion disk. This work moves towards a more realistic assessment of one of the LISA science objectives, i.e., probing the properties of the astrophysical environments of black holes.</description>

      <title>Entanglement between accelerated probes in a de Sitter spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20874v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate an investigation into features of vacuum entanglement as probed by accelerated quantum probes in curved spacetime. Focussing specifically on de Sitter (dS) spacetime with curvature $\Lambda$, we obtain several exact results corresponding to different kinematical set-up of the probes. The interaction with the quantum field creates a non-local correlation between initially uncorrelated probes accelerating in different directions. It is well known that a single quantum probe in dS spacetime with uniform acceleration $a$ responds exactly as a quantum probe in Minkowski spacetime with "effective" acceleration $q \equiv\sqrt{a^2+\Lambda}$. However, no such mapping generically exists for the entanglement between probes. Our results suggest that entanglement exhibits independent variations with changes in acceleration and curvature depending on different configurations of detector motion.</description>

      <title>Spherical black hole perturbations in EFT of scalar-tensor gravity with timelike scalar profile</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study linear even-parity perturbations of static and spherically symmetric black holes with a timelike scalar profile by use of the effective field theory (EFT) approach. For illustrative purposes, we consider a simple subclass of the EFT that accommodates ghost condensate, namely the k-essence model along with the so-called scordatura term, and focus on the spherical (monopole) perturbations about an approximately stealth Schwarzschild solution. The scordatura effect is introduced to avoid the strong coupling problem that typically happens in the scalar sector around stealth solutions with a timelike scalar profile. We argue that the scalar perturbation is decoupled from the metric perturbations at the leading order in the scordatura effect under a particular gauge choice. We stress that this is an important step in understanding the dynamics of even-parity perturbations, paving the way towards deriving a set of master equations -- the generalized Zerilli and the scalar-field equations -- for generic multipoles.</description>

      <title>Tidal response of regular black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the tidal deformability of regular black holes (RBHs). Employing different phenomenological models, we analyze their response to both test fields and gravitational perturbations, interpreting the latter within the framework of Einstein's field equations in the presence of an appropriate exotic matter distribution. Numerical and analytical methods reveal that RBHs exhibit non-trivial tidal responses, influenced by their regularization parameters and exotic matter distributions. The results obtained for test fields and gravitational perturbations are in qualitative agreement. This hints at the possibility that similar conclusions could hold if these spacetimes were interpreted as solutions of a modified gravitational action. Our findings suggest that RBHs possess distinct, though subtle, tidal signatures, which may serve as observational probes of their internal structure in gravitational wave detections.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of spinning particles in Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole exterior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the orbits of a spinning particle in the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole exterior through the spin-curvature coupling to leading order in its spin. The dynamics is governed by the Mathisson-Papapetrou equations in the pole-dipole approximation. The equations of motion can be derived and show in particular that in the polar coordinate, the orbits can be restricted to the plane for an aligned spin with the orbital motion, but there is an induced motion out of the plane for a misaligned spin. The radial potential can be defined from the equation of motion along the radial direction, where the roots are studied to construct the parameter space diagram for different types of orbits. We then consider the so-called innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) due to the triple root to see the effects of the particle spin and the black hole charge. These non-geodesic equations can be solved analytically in terms of the Mino time with the solutions involving Jacobi elliptic functions. One of the bound motions considered is an oscillating orbit between two turning points in the radial direction. The usefulness of the solutions is to obtain the periods of the oscillation along the radial direction as well as the induced motion in the polar coordinate for a misaligned spin in both the Mino time and the coordinate time. Another interesting motions include the inspiral orbit from near ISCO and the homoclinic orbit with the solutions expressed as elementary functions, giving the radial 4-velocity of the inspiral orbit and the Lyapunov exponent associated with the homoclinic orbit. The implications for gravitational wave emission from extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) and black hole accretion are discussed.</description>

Abstract: We explore on the one hand, whether the well-known theorem of equipartition of energy also applies to physical systems in which gravity plays a non-negligible role, as is the case of cosmological horizons and, on the other hand, if the holographic principle holds for these systems. Furthermore, we find a direct connection between the partition function of the gravitating system and the metric of the gravitational field.</description>

      <title>The Sky as a Killing Horizon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetries are ubiquitous in modern physics. They not only allow for a more simplified description of physical systems but also, from a more fundamental perspective, can be seen as determining a theory itself. In the present paper, we propose a new definition of asymptotic symmetries that unifies and generalizes the usual notions of symmetry considered in asymptotically flat spacetimes and expanding universes with cosmological horizons. This is done by considering BMS-like symmetries for "asymptotic (conformal) Killing horizons", or A(C)KHs, here defined as null hypersurfaces that are tangent to a vector field satisfying the (conformal) Killing equation in a limiting sense. The construction is theory-agnostic and extremely general, for it makes no use of the Einstein equations and can be applied to a wide range of scenarios with different dimensions or hypersurface cross sections. While we reproduce the results by Dappiaggi, Moretti, and Pinamonti in the case of asymptotic Killing horizons, the conformal generalization does not yield only the BMS group, but a larger group. The enlargement is due to the presence of "superdilations". We speculate on many implications and possible continuations of this work, including the exploration of gravitational memory effects beyond general relativity, understanding antipodal matching conditions at spatial infinity in terms of bifurcate horizons, and the absence of superrotations in de Sitter spacetime and Killing horizons.</description>

      <title>Approximating neutron-star radii using gravitational-wave only measurements with symbolic regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves emitted by binary neutron-star inspirals carry information on components' masses and tidal deformabilities, but not radii, which are measured by electromagnetic observations of neutron stars. To improve the multi-messenger astronomy studies of neutron stars, an expression for neutron-star radii as a function of gravitational-wave only data would be advantageous, as it would allow to compare information from two different channels. In order to do so, a symbolic regression method, pySR, is trained on TOV solutions to piecewise polytropic EOS input to discover an approximate symbolic expression for the neutron-star radius as a function of gravitational-wave measurements only. The approximation is tested on piecewise polytropic EOS NS data, as well as on NS sequences based on selected realistic (non-polytropic) dense-matter theory EOSs, achieving consistent agreement between the ground truth values and the symbolic approximation for a broad range of NS parameters covering current astrophysical observations, with average radii differences of few hundred meters. Additionally, the approximation is applied to the GW170817 gravitational-wave mass and tidal deformability posteriors, and compared to reported inferred radius distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider corrections to the Schwarzschild black hole metric arising from exotic long-range forces within quantum field theory frameworks. Specifically, we analyze two models: the Feinberg-Sucher potential for massless neutrinos and Ferrer-Nowakowski potentials for boson-mediated interactions at finite temperatures, yielding metric corrections with $r^{-5}$ and $r^{-3}$ dependencies. Using analytic expansions around the Schwarzschild photon sphere, we find that attractive potential corrections enhance gravitational lensing, enlarging the photon sphere and shadow radius, while repulsive potential corrections induce gravitational screening, reducing these observables. Our results clearly illustrate how different quantum-derived corrections can produce measurable deviations from standard Schwarzschild predictions, providing robust theoretical benchmarks for future astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Measuring the cosmic dipole with golden dark sirens in the era of next-generation ground-based gravitational wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tensions between cosmological parameter measurements from the early-universe and the late-universe datasets offer an exciting opportunity to explore new physics, if not accounted for unknown systematics. Apart from the well-known Hubble tension, a tension up to $4.9 \sigma$ in the cosmic dipole has also been reported. While the cosmic dipole is mainly induced by the observer's kinetic motion, an intrinsic dipole arising from the anisotropy of the universe could also play an import role. Such an intrinsic anisotropy can be a dark energy mimicker that causes the observed accelerating expansion of the universe. As a new and powerful tool, gravitational waves can serve as an independent probe to the cosmic dipole. A useful type of events to achieve this is the "golden dark sirens", which are near-by well-localized compact binary coalescences whose host galaxies can be identified directly due to precise localization. By forecasting golden dark sirens obtained from 10-year observations using different possible detector networks in the future, we find that the standard LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detectors are not able to detect a meaningful amount of golden dark sirens, and hence next-generation ground-based detectors are essential to obtain a strong constraint on the cosmic dipole. In particular, we find that a three-detector network consisting of more than one next-generation detectors can yield a constraint on the cosmic dipole at an order of $10^{-3}$ when jointly measured with $H_0$. Moreover, a constraint on the cosmic dipole at an order of $10^{-4}$ can be achieved when fixing $H_0$.</description>

Abstract: We construct static, spherically symmetric, charged traversable wormhole solutions to the Einstein--Maxwell equations, supported by bidirectional (ingoing and outgoing) null dust with negative energy, and discuss a scenario for their dynamical formation from a black hole. Our solution contains a traversable throat, where the areal radius takes a minimum, although the spacetime is not asymptotically flat. In our formation scenario, the spacetime evolves sequentially from a black hole to Vaidya regions and finally to a wormhole, with each transition mediated by an impulsive null shell. We find that the radius of the wormhole throat is determined by the mass and charge of the initial black hole as well as those of the injected shell.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of dark matter on the structural properties of neutron stars. In particular we investigate how the presence of a dark matter component influences the mass-radius relation, the value of the maximum mass of a neutron star and other stellar properties. To model ordinary matter we use a state-of-the-art equation of state of $\beta$-stable nuclear matter obtained using the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock quantum many-body approach starting from two-body and three-body nuclear interactions derived from chiral effective field theory. The dark matter component of the star is modeled as a non-self-annihilating system of spin $1/2$ fermions at zero temperature and its equation of state as an ideal relativistic Fermi gas. The equilibrium configurations of these dark matter admixed neutron stars (DANS) are calculated by solving a generalization of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations to the case where the system consists of two perfect fluids interacting solely through gravity. We find that, depending on the dark matter particle mass $m_\chi$, one can have somehow opposite effects on the stellar properties. In the case $m_\chi = 1\, \mathrm{GeV}$, the stellar gravitational maximum mass $M_{max}$ decreases, whereas in the case $m_\chi = 0.1\, \mathrm{GeV}$, $M_{max}$ increases with respect to the maximum mass of ordinary neutron stars. We also show that the presence of dark matter has indirect sizable effect on the proton fraction in the ordinary matter fluid and, in the case $m_\chi = 1\, \mathrm{GeV}$, results in a decrease of the threshold gravitational mass $M_{tot}^{durca}$ for having direct URCA processes and fast stellar cooling. Finally we study the stability of dark matter admixed neutron stars with respect to radial perturbations.</description>

      <title>Holographic complexity and residual entropy of a rotating BTZ black hole within Horndeski gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10004v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work explores the holographic complexity and residual entropy of a rotating BTZ black hole within the framework of Horndeski gravity. The investigation is motivated by the need to understand the emission of information from black holes, as encoded by quantum complexity, which persists even at zero temperature. Traditionally, black holes are considered to cease emitting information upon reaching zero temperature, yet our findings suggest a minimum level of information or minimal entropy. This challenges the classical notion of black hole death. Recent studies in the context of Horndeski gravity and the AdS/BCFT correspondence have identified a non-zero minimal entropy at zero temperature. Our work shows that complexity and entropy provide crucial insights into the information emission from black holes, extending beyond their classical death. These findings significantly affect our understanding of black hole thermodynamics and quantum information theory.</description>

Abstract: Stellar-mass black-hole binaries are the most numerous gravitational-wave sources observed to date. Their properties make them suitable for observation both by ground- and space-based detectors. Starting from synthetic catalogues constructed based on observational constraints from ground-based detectors, we explore the detection rates and the characteristic parameters of the stellar-mass black-hole binaries observable by LISA during their inspiral, using signal-to-noise ratio thresholds as a detection criterion. We find that only a handful of these sources will be detectable with signal-to-noise ratio larger than 8: about 5 sources on average in 4 years of mission duration, among which only one or two are multiband ones (i.e. merging in less than 15 years). We find that detectable sources have chirp mass $10 M_\odot&lt;M_c&lt;100 M_\odot$, residual time-to-coalescence $4yr&lt;t_c&lt;100yr$, and redshift $z&lt;0.1$, much closer than those observed up to now by ground-based detectors. We also explore correlations between the number of LISA detectable sources and the parameters of the population, suggesting that a joint measurement with the stochastic signal might be informative of the population characteristics. By performing parameter estimation on a subset of sources from the catalogues, we conclude that, even if LISA measurements will not be directly informative on the population due to the low number of resolvable sources, it will characterise a few, low-redshift candidates with great precision. Furthermore, we construct for the first time the LISA waterfall plot for low chirp-mass systems, as a function of their time to coalescence and inclination. We demonstrate that LISA will also be able to discriminate and characterize, through very precise parameter estimation, a population of binaries with higher masses, $M_c\sim O(10^3)M_\odot$, at the boundary of ground-based detectors sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Crossed products and quantum reference frames: on the observer-dependence of gravitational entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A significant step towards a rigorous understanding of perturbative gravitational entropy was recently achieved by a series of works showing that a proper accounting of gauge invariance and observer degrees of freedom converts the Type III algebra of QFT observables in a gravitational subregion to a Type II crossed product, whose entropy reduces to the generalized entropy formula in a semiclassical limit. The observers thus used are also known as quantum reference frames (QRFs); as noted in our companion work [arXiv:2405.00114], using different QRFs result in different algebras, and hence different entropies -- so gravitational entropy is observer-dependent. Here, we provide an in-depth analysis of this phenomenon, with full derivations of many new results. Using the perspective-neutral QRF formalism, we extend previous constructions to allow for arbitrarily many observers, each carrying a clock with possibly degenerate energy spectra. We consider a semiclassical regime characterized by clocks whose energy fluctuations dominate over the fluctuations of the energy of the QFT. Unlike previous works, we allow the clocks and fields to be arbitrarily entangled. At leading order the von Neumann entropy still reduces to the generalized entropy, but linear corrections are typically non-vanishing and quantify the degree of entanglement between the clocks and fields. We also describe an `antisemiclassical' regime as the opposite of the semiclassical one, with suppressed fluctuations of the clock energy; in this regime, we show how the clock may simply be `partially traced' out when evaluating the entropy. Four explicit examples of observer-dependent entropy are then given, involving a gravitational interferometer, degenerate clock superselection, a semiclassical approximation applying to some clocks but not others, and differences between monotonic and periodic clocks.</description>

      <title>The exact Wheeler-DeWitt equation for the scale-factor minisuperspace model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the classical minisuperspace model describing a closed, homogeneous and isotropic Universe, with a positive cosmological constant. Upon canonical quantization, the infinite number of possible operator orderings in the quantum Hamiltonian leads to distinct Wheeler-DeWitt equations for the wavefunction $\psi$ of the Universe. Similarly, ambiguity arises in the path-integral formulation of $\psi$, due to the infinite choices of path-integral measures for the single degree of freedom of the model. For each choice of path-integral measure, we determine the correct operator ordering of the quantum Hamiltonian and derive the exact form of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, including all corrections in $\hbar$. Additionally, we impose Hermiticity of the Hamiltonian to deduce the Hilbert-space measure $\mu$, which appears in the definition of the Hermitian inner product. Remarkably, all quantum predictions can be expressed through the combination $\Psi=\sqrt{\mu}\, \psi$, which satisfies a universal Wheeler-DeWitt equation, independent of the initial path-integral prescription. This result demonstrates that all seemingly distinct quantum theories arising from different quantization schemes of the same classical model are fundamentally equivalent.</description>

      <title>The holographic space-time model of inflation and its predictions for the CMB primordial spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1998 Carlip and Solodukhin independently conjectured the equality between fluctuations in the modular Hamiltonian of black holes and its expectation value. Banks and Zurek's 2021 work generalized this observation to any causal diamonds. We use this observation to calculate the precise normalization of primordial scalar and tensor power spectra in the Holographic Space-time (HST) model of inflation. In previous work Banks and Fischler outlined the general calculation of inflationary power spectra in this model, which we review here. Its conceptual basis is radically different from field theoretic inflation and it has no Transplanckian problems, but its predictions for power spectra will be shown to fit extant data equally well, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio agrees with experimental observations.</description>

      <title>The dark side of the universe may be more harmonic than we thought</title>

Abstract: The standard paradigm of cosmology assumes two distinct dark components, namely the dark energy driving the late-universe acceleration and the dark matter that is responsible for the structure formation. However, the necessity of splitting the dark-side world into two sectors has not been experimentally or theoretically proven. It is shown in Wang et al. 2024 that cosmology with one unified dark fluid can also explain the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and late-universe data, with the fitting quality not much worse than the standard Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. The present work aims to provide a clearer physical interpretation of the Wang et al. 2024 results. We show that the unified dark fluid model can produce primary CMB temperature and polarization power spectra that are very close to the $\Lambda$CDM prediction (relative difference $\lesssim 10^{-4}$). The model can also mimic the $\Lambda$CDM background expansion history and linear growth factor on sub-horizon scales with percent-level accuracy. With better physical understanding of the model, we make precision tests and find a minor error in the Boltzmann code used in Wang et al. 2024. We correct the error and update the model comparison between $\Lambda$CDM and the unified dark fluid model.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy at Late Time $\Lambda$CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical properties of dark energy through a detailed analysis of its equation of state parameter $w(z)$ as a function of redshift. We derive a general expression for $w(z)$ from the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) equations, establishing a direct relationship between the dark energy equation of state and the observable Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and its derivative. Using the relation $w(z) = -1 + \frac{2(1+z)}{3H(z)} \frac{dH}{dz}$, we develop an approximation method valid for $z \lesssim 1$ that accounts for the changing balance between matter and dark energy contributions to cosmic expansion. We compare our theoretical framework with recent observational data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR2, analysing how well the commonly used Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization $w(z) = -1 + w_a \frac{z}{1+z}$ captures the evolution of dark energy. Our results indicate that the dark energy equation of state exhibits a monotonic evolution with redshift, transitioning from deceleration to acceleration around $z \approx 0.7$. Notably, our predicted $w_{\mathrm{DE}}$ remains greater than $-1$ across all redshifts, avoiding phantom energy scenarios that would violate the null energy condition. This work demonstrates how precise measurements of the cosmic expansion history can constrain the nature of dark energy and provides a framework for testing dynamical dark energy models against current and future cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Positive Mass in Scalar-Torsion Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the holographic renormalization of scalar-torsion gravity in a four-dimensional bulk spacetime with non-minimal derivative coupling. The asymptotic behavior of the static equations leads to an anti-de Sitter geometry for negative cosmological constants, allowing for a holographic interpretation via the AdS/CFT correspondence. The existence of unique solutions throughout the bulk is addressed. We study the effect of the non-minimal coupling parameter on the conformal dimension and the expectation value of the dual scalar operator, showing that the effective bulk mass can be tuned through the non-minimal coupling. Our results provide a formalism for finding non-tachyonic bulk scalar fields which vanish at the boundary.</description>
