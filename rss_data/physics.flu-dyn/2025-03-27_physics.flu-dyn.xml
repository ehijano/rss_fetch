      <title>Drops on architected elastic substrates: A repertoire of regimes at the turn of a knob</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drops on a vibrating substrate can experience a variety of motion regimes, including directional motion and climbing. The key ingredient to elicit these regimes is simultaneously activating the in-plane and out-of-plane degrees of freedom of the substrate with the proper phase difference. This is typically achieved by using a rigid substrate and two independent actuators. However, this framework is unable to establish different motion conditions in different regions of the substrate, achieving spatial variability and selectivity, since this would violate the rigid-body assumption and require a proliferation of actuation channels. Challenging this paradigm, we leverage the inherent elasticity of the substrate to provide the modal and spatial diversity required to establish the desired regimes. To this end, we design deformable substrates exhibiting a rich landscape of deformation modes, and we exploit their multi-modal response to switch between drop motion regimes and select desired spatial patterns, using the excitation frequency as our tuning parameter.</description>

      <title>Energy transfer and budget analysis for transient process with operator-driven reduced-order model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the possibility of energy transfer and budget analysis for transient flow using eigenmodes of the operator from the Navier-Stokes equation. We derive the energy transfer equation, which provides the energy budget for the eigenmodes, through the Galerkin projection of the equation using the bi-orthogonality of the eigenmodes and the adjoint mode. Energy budget and transfer analysis between modes were conducted for two-dimensional flow around a cylinder with eigenmodes growing or decaying from a steady flow. Using the linearized energy transfer equation and eigenmodes from global stability analysis, we identify the energy budget and spatial distribution that determine mode growth rates. Moreover, energy budget and transfer analysis are realized by considering the time evolution of the eigenmodes, even during the nonlinear development of the eigenmodes. By introducing time-varying dynamic mode decomposition with a phase-control strategy for multiple time-series datasets from numerical simulations of the phase-controlled initial flow, time-varying eigenmodes are extracted in the transient two-dimensional cylinder flow. With the extracted time-dependent modes and the derived energy transfer equations, the time evolution of the energy budget and spatial distribution of energy transfer can be computed until the eigenmodes developed from the steady field reach the post-transient periodic flow. From the time variation of the energy budget and the transfer distribution, the transient process of the cylinder flow can be characterized by the ratio of the magnitude of viscous diffusion for the eigenmode and energy transfer from the base flow.</description>

      <title>Phase-resolved Modeling Of Surf Zone Wave Transformation Over Idealized Rough Bottoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rough rocky seabeds dominate world's coastlines, making accurate modeling of wave transformation in such environments essential for understanding coastal processes and hazards. Wave breaking and friction are critical drivers of wave dissipation over rough seabeds, especially in the surf zone. Phase-resolved wave models, often relying on classical bed shear stress or canopy drag approaches, can fail to capture these processes due to limitations in their physical assumptions, especially for large roughness elements typical of rocky seabeds. The present study adapts the Bulk Canopy Drag (BCD) parameterization, inherited from vegetation and porous media studies, into the 3D non-hydrostatic phase-resolved SYMPHONIE model to simulate wave dissipation over rough seabeds. The model was tested against laboratory experiments (LEGOLAS), using controlled irregular wave forcing propagating over a rough ramp. Results reveal that turbulent drag dominates the outer surf zone, while inertial drag plays a key role in the inner surf zone. A combined optimization of these influences achieved strong agreement with experimental measurements under one irregular wave forcing and a specific bottom configuration. These findings underscore the importance of accurately incorporating both turbulent and inertial contributions into wave dissipation models for the rocky surf zone. The proposed BCD approach provides a promising framework for improving phase-resolved modeling of wave dynamics, with potential applications for more complex field conditions. Future work will aim to extend the approach to diverse roughness configurations and refine empirical coefficients for broader scalability and in situ applicability.</description>

      <title>Phase-resolved modelling of wave transformation in the surf zone over idealised rough bottoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to understand and predict coastal flooding processes in rocky environments, it is necessary to take into account bottom roughness, which plays a key role in wave transformation processes and in general coastal dynamics. The present work aims to implement a parameterisation of roughness-induced dissipation in 3D non-hydrostatic phase-resolved wave models, based on the Symphonie code (MARSALEIX et al., 2019). The modified model is compared with laboratory experiments carried out on a surf zone with a linear slope (DEALBERA et al., 2024). Different irregular waves were tested on various configurations of bottom roughness (represented by block configurations of different sizes and distributions). Wave generation and dissipation induced by breaking were first parametrised with respect to laboratory data on smooth bottoms. The different roughness cases were then studied on the basis of two distinct strategies for parameterising bottom friction, namely the bottom stress approach and the canopy drag approach. The performance of these two approaches is assessed by comparing the model results with measurements of the cross-shore significant wave height profile for different bottom configurations. On the basis of this work, recommendations on the choice of dissipation parameterisations will be made.</description>

      <title>Rotationally-affected Internally Heated Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study convection in a volumetrically heated fluid which is cooled from both plates and is under rotation through the use of direct numerical simulations. The onset of convection matches similar systems and predictions from asymptotic analysis. At low rotation rates, the fluid becomes more organised, enhancing heat transport and increasing boundary layer asymmetry, whereas high rotation rates suppresses convection. Velocity and temperature statistics reveal that the top unstably stratified boundary layer exhibits behaviour consistent with other rotating convective systems, while the bottom boundary shows a unique interaction between unstable stratification and Ekman boundary layers. Additional flow statistics such as energy dissipation are analysed to rationalise the flow behaviour.</description>

      <title>Load-dependent resistive-force theory for helical filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The passive rotation of rigid helical filaments is the propulsion strategy used by flagellated bacteria and some artificial microswimmers to navigate at low Reynolds numbers. In a classical 1976 paper, Lighthill calculated the `optimal' resistance coefficients in a local (logarithmically accurate) resistive-force theory that best approximates predictions from the nonlocal (algebraically accurate) slender-body theory for force-free swimming of a rotating helix without an attached load (e.g., no cell body). These coefficients have since been widely applied, often beyond the conditions for which they were originally derived. Here, we revisit the problem for the case where a load is attached to the rotating filament, such as the cell body of a bacterium or the head of an artificial swimmer. We show that the optimal resistance coefficients depend in fact on the size of the load, and we quantify the increasing inaccuracy of Lighthill's coefficients as the load grows. Finally, we provide a physical explanation for the origin of this unexpected load-dependence.</description>

      <title>Immersed boundary - lattice Boltzmann method for wetting problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a mesoscale computational model to describe the interaction of a droplet with a solid. The model is based on the hybrid combination of the immersed boundary and the lattice Boltzmann computational schemes: the former is used to model the non-ideal sharp interface of the droplet coupled with the inner and outer fluids, simulated with the lattice Boltzmann scheme. We further introduce an interaction force to model the wetting interactions of the droplet with the solid: this interaction force is designed with the key computational advantage of providing a regularization of the interface profile close to the contact line, avoiding abrupt curvature changes that could otherwise cause numerical instabilities. The proposed model substantially improves earlier immersed boundary - lattice Boltzmann models for wetting in that it allows a description of an ample variety of wetting interactions, ranging from hydrophobic to hydrophilic cases, without the need for any pre-calibration study on model parameters to be used. Model validations against theoretical results for droplet shape at equilibrium and scaling laws for droplet spreading dynamics are addressed.</description>

      <title>Reproducibility of Large Eddy Simulations for mixing in stirred tank reactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CFD simulations are widely used to quantify mixing performance of stirred tanks, for various applications in chemical engineering and biotechnology. Due to advances in GPU computing, more and more often these simulations make use of Large Eddy Simulations (LES), which explicitly simulate the dynamics of large-scale turbulence. Although these simulations are fully deterministic and hence theoretically reproducible, small numerical variations induced by round-off errors combined with differences in distribution and order of operations in parallel computing lead to separation of trajectories, i.e. different flowfield evolutions and different mixing times between repeat simulations, even on the same architecture. We investigate the impact of repeat simulations on the mixing time distribution observed in a $30 \liter$ stirred vessel with two commercial CFD packages, and compare to experimental variability. While the distribution between simulations and experiments is in very good agreement, we do conclude confidence intervals should be reported for CFD simulations of mixing.</description>

      <title>An exact solution of the lubrication equations for the Oldroyd-B model in a hyperbolic channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An exact similarity solution of the lubrication equations for the steady flow of a viscoelastic Oldroyd-B fluid in a contracting and symmetric hyperbolic channel is derived. The solution is valid for small values of the Deborah number, De (the ratio of the polymer's longest relaxation time to a characteristic residence time of the fluid in the channel), all values of the polymer viscosity ratio, {\eta} (the ratio of polymer viscosity to the total viscosity of the fluid), as well as to typical values of the contraction ratio, {\Lambda} (the ratio of the channel height at the inlet to the channel height at the outlet). The solution, the significance of which for the hyperbolic geometry is analogous to the classic Poiseuille solution in a straight channel, precisely satisfies the exact analytical solution of the Oldroyd-B model along the walls, but does not satisfy any initial conditions for the polymer extra-stresses at the inlet of the hyperbolic section of the channel. The exact solution is given in terms of the streamfunction which is used in the momentum balance to derive a non-linear ordinary differential equation with an unknown function which corresponds to a modified fluid velocity. The final equation is solved numerically using a fully spectral method with a Galerkin-type approach to calculate the unknown function and the pressure gradient. The exact solution for the polymer extra-stresses allows for deriving a variety of expressions for the average pressure-drop in the channel. The most accurate expression is that resulting from the mechanical energy of the flow. Its range of validity is determined in terms of De, {\Lambda} and {\eta}, and confirmed by numerical pseudospectral simulations of the lubrication equations. In all cases, a decrease in the pressure drop compared to the Newtonian value with increasing De and/or {\eta} is predicted.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Iron Dust Bunsen Flames using Numerical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents numerical simulations of an iron dust Bunsen flame. The results are validated against experimental results. The burning velocity is extracted from the 3D simulation results, as in the experiments. The agreement of the burning velocity between the model and experiment is the best to date for iron dust flames. A comparison is performed between 3D and 1D simulations to improve our understanding of how the 3D Bunsen flame deviates from an ideal 1D flame. This comparison reveals that the co-flow mixes with the post-flame zone, increasing the oxygen concentration in the reaction layer, which increases the burning velocity. Moreover, the analysis also reveals that stretch and curvature affect the burning velocity. These results are valuable for the future development of experimental setups aimed at measuring the burning velocity.</description>

      <title>CyberDiver: an untethered robotic impactor for water-entry experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the CyberDiver, an untethered robotic impactor capable of actively modulating the fluid physics during high-speed water entry. First, we utilize the CyberDiver to extend our understanding of the water entry of passively flexible systems, designing a high-bandwidth controller that enables the CyberDiver to operate as a cyber-physical system that permits an arbitrary programmable structural coupling to be experimentally tested. Onboard sensors record the body acceleration during impact and reveal that the introduction of damping or a nonlinear force-versus-displacement structural law can significantly reduce impact loading as compared to a linear elastic case, with implications for damage mitigation in aerospace and naval applications. Next, by operating the CyberDiver in a displacement control mode, we demonstrate that the splash size can be dramatically altered depending on the parameters of an active maneuver, laying a groundwork for better understanding the techniques of human competitive divers.</description>

      <title>Faraday wave singularities trigger microbubble jetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wall-attached bubbles can produce repeated jets under gentle ultrasound stimulation through the Faraday instability. We identify three distinct jetting regimes defined by the jetting frequency and the bubble surface topology. We demonstrate that these jets form via flow-focusing singularities following two distinct collapse modes of the bubble interface: conical, producing a jet towards the substrate, or parabolic, generating a pair of oppositely directed jets. Scaling laws governing these collapse events are derived, revealing a universal self-similar structure governed by inertia and capillarity. Furthermore, we establish the dependence of the interface acceleration for jetting on driving frequency and characterise the jet speed as a function of Faraday waves height and bubble size. These findings may inform the design of low-power biofilm removal ultrasound systems and contribute to improved safety in targeted drug delivery.</description>

      <title>Global Well-Posedness for the 3D Navier-Stokes Equations under Logarithmically Improved Criteria: Connections to Turbulence Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel class of initial data for which the three-dimensional incompressible Navier--Stokes equations yield unique global-in-time solutions. Building on a logarithmically improved regularity criterion, we impose a logarithmically subcritical condition on the initial data. Specifically, if \[ u_0 \in L^2(\mathbb{R}^3) \quad \text{and} \quad \|(-\Delta)^{s/2}u_0\|_{L^q(\mathbb{R}^3)} \le \frac{C_0}{\Bigl(1+\log\bigl(e+\|u_0\|_{\dot{H}^s}\bigr)\Bigr)^{\delta}}, \] for some $s \in (1/2,1)$ under appropriate scaling, then the corresponding solution exists globally and is unique. The proof employs refined commutator estimates for the fractional Laplacian together with new energy methods that exploit this logarithmic improvement to prevent singularity formation.
  Furthermore, we establish links between these improved criteria and turbulence theory. We derive precise relationships connecting the regularity conditions with turbulent intermittency, showing that the logarithmic enhancements correspond to anomalous scaling exponents in the turbulent energy spectrum. Additionally, we characterize the local structure of potential singularities and provide tight bounds on the energy flux in turbulent cascades. This approach bridges the gap between subcritical and critical regularity for the Navier--Stokes equations and offers a robust mathematical foundation for key phenomena observed in turbulence.</description>

      <title>The importance of Berry phase in solar acoustic modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An analytic expression for the frequencies of standing waves in stars, applicable to any radial order n, is derived from ray-tracing equations by the mean of Wigner-Weyl calculus. A correction to previous formulas currently employed in asteroseismology is identified as the Berry phase, which accounts for the vectorial nature of wave propagation in stars. Accounting for this quantity significantly improves upon previous laws for low n modes of the Sun, and we show that the Berry phase is indeed present in the available observational data of solar modes. This phase is due to inhomogeneities of the medium.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Magnetically and Electrically Powered Metallo-Dielectric Janus Microrobots: Enhanced Motion Control and Operation Beyond Planar Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces the integration of hybrid magnetic and electric actuation mechanisms to achieve advanced motion capabilities for Janus particle (JP) microrobots. We demonstrate enhanced in-plane motion control through versatile control strategies and present the concepts of interplanar transitions and 2.5-dimensional (2.5D) trajectories, enabled by magnetic levitation and electrostatic trapping. These innovations expand the mobility of JPs into 3D space, allowing dynamic operation beyond the limitations of traditional surface-bound motion. Key functionalities include obstacle crossing, transitions to elevated surfaces, and discrete surface patterning enabling highly localized interventions. Using this set of tools, we also showcase the controlled out-of-plane transport of both synthetic and biological cargo. Together, these advancements lay the groundwork for novel microrobot-related applications in microfluidic systems and biomedical research.</description>

      <title>Viscous Gubser flow with conserved charges to benchmark fluid simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present semi-analytical solutions for the evolution of both the temperature and chemical potentials for viscous Gubser flow with conserved charges. Such a solution can be especially useful in testing numerical codes intended to simulate relativistic fluids with large chemical potentials. The freeze-out hypersurface profiles for constant energy density are calculated, along with the corresponding normal vectors and presented as a new unit test for numerical codes. We also compare the influence of the equation of state on the semi-analytical solutions. We benchmark the newly developed Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code CCAKE that includes both shear viscosity and three conserved charges. The numerical solutions are in excellent agreement with the semi-analytical solution and also are able to accurately reproduce the hypersurface at freeze-out.</description>

      <title>Determination of non-local characteristics of density transport in 2D simulations of the SOL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By use of Lagrangian tracers propagated on 2D simulations of Scrape-Off Layer (SOL) turbulence, we are able to determine the non-local fractional-advection, fractional-diffusion equation (FADE) coefficients for a number of equilibrium cases. Solutions of the resultant FADEs shows good agreement with the simulated mean density profiles. We detail how the FADE is derived: the stochastic flux equation is introduced, and it is shown how it is used to find general forms of Fick's first and second laws, dependent on the the jump function. We show for spatially homogeneous jump functions which belong to the Levy-alpha Stable distribution that transport may be approximated by a non-local FADE with four parameters. This work demonstrates the sound basis for FADEs to act as reduced models of transport in systems dominated by coherent structures; so justifies the development of a first-principles approach to calculating FADE parameters.</description>

      <title>Effective and asymptotic scaling in a one-dimensional billiard problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of power laws that govern the large-time dynamics of a one-dimensional billiard of $N$ point particles is analysed. In the initial state, the resting particles are placed in the positive half-line $x\geq 0$ at equal distances. Their masses alternate between two distinct values. The dynamics is initialized by giving the leftmost particle a positive velocity. Due to elastic inter-particle collisions the whole system gradually comes into motion, filling both right and left half-lines. As shown by S. Chakraborti, A. Dhar, P. Krapivsky, SciPost Phys. 13 (2022) 074, an inherent feature of such a billiard is the emergence of two different modes: the shock wave that propagates in $x\geq 0$ and the splash region in $x&lt;0$. Moreover, the behaviour of the relevant observables is characterized by universal asymptotic power-law dependencies. In view of the finite size of the system and of finite observation times, these dependencies only start to acquire a universal character. To analyse them, we set up molecular dynamics simulations using the concept of effective scaling exponents, familiar in the theory of continuous phase transitions. We present results for the effective exponents that govern the large-time behaviour of the shock-wave front, the number of collisions, the energies and momentum of different modes and analyse their tendency to approach corresponding universal values.</description>

      <title>Fast relaxation of a viscous vortex in an external flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of a concentrated vortex advected by a smooth, divergence-free velocity field in two space dimensions. In the idealized situation where the initial vorticity is a Dirac mass, we compute an approximation of the solution which accurately describes, in the regime of high Reynolds numbers, the motion of the vortex center and the deformation of the streamlines under the shear stress of the external flow. For ill-prepared initial data, corresponding to a sharply peaked Gaussian vortex, we prove relaxation to the previous solution on a time scale that is much shorter than the diffusive time, due to enhanced dissipation inside the vortex core.</description>

      <title>Flow of a two-dimensional liquid foam: Impact of surfactant type and boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we experimentally investigate the rheological and flow behavior of two-dimensional (2D) monodisperse aqueous foams, sheared between parallel plates using a custom-made rheo-optical apparatus with smooth and roughened walls. The foams were prepared using two commercially available detergents, Foam 1 and Foam2, while maintaining similar bubble sizes and liquid fractions. The linear viscoelastic results reveal that the Foam 1 consistently exhibits higher elastic and loss moduli than the Foam 2, regardless of boundary conditions, with roughened walls further enhancing these moduli in both foams. Additionally, the Foam 1 shows a lower viscoelastic relaxation frequency compared to the Foam 2, indicating a less mobile interface for the Foam 1. In the non-linear regime, significant differences were observed. Under smooth boundary conditions, Foam 2 exhibits yield stress behavior, whereas Foam 1 does not, despite having higher viscous stresses. The viscous stress in the Foam 1 scales with the capillary number, while for the Foam 2, the scaling depends on the boundary conditions differently for smooth walls and for roughened walls. These variations in rheological behavior are attributed to differences in surfactant chemistry, leading to different interface mobilities, with the Foam1 having a less mobile interface compared to the Foam 2.</description>

      <title>Simulation and modelling of convective mixing of carbon dioxide in geological formations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06090v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform large-scale numerical simulations of convection in 3D porous media at Rayleigh-Darcy numbers up to $Ra=8\times10^4$. To investigate the convective mixing of carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) in geological formations, we consider a semi-infinite domain, where the CO$_2$ concentration is constant at the top and no flux is prescribed at bottom. Convection begins with a diffusion-dominated phase, transitions to convection-driven solute finger growth, and ends with a shutdown stage as fingers reach the bottom boundary and the concentration in the system increases. For $Ra \ge 5\times10^3$, we observe a constant-flux regime with dissolution flux stabilizing at 0.019, approximately 13\% higher than in 2D estimates. Finally, we provide a simple and yet accurate physical model describing the mass of solute entering the system throughout the whole mixing process. These findings extend solutal convection insights to 3D and high-$Ra$, improving the reliability of tools predicting the long-term CO$_2$ dynamics in the subsurface.</description>

      <title>Settling dynamics of non-Brownian suspension of spherical and cubic particles in Stokes flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present study investigates the gravity-driven settling dynamics of non-Brownian suspensions of spherical and cubic particles within a triply periodic domain. The effect of solid volume fraction on the evolving microstructure of a suspension is numerically examined by employing the Rigid MultiBlob method under Stokes flow conditions. Our simulations accurately reproduce macroscopic trends observed in experiments and show strong agreement with established semi-empirical correlations over a wide range of volume fractions. It is observed that the hydrodynamic interactions between particles and the surrounding fluid dominate the settling mechanism at low to moderate solid volume fractions, whereas, frequent collisions between particles in a highly packed space tend to suppress velocity fluctuations at denser regime. The transport properties for dilute suspensions are found to be primarily shaped by an anisotropic microstructure, though this anisotropy decreases as many-body interactions significantly grow at higher volume fractions. Notably, cubic particles exhibit lower anisotropy in velocity fluctuations compared to spheres, due to more effective momentum and energy transfer from the gravity-driven direction to transverse directions. Moreover, cubic particles also display higher velocity fluctuations and particle rebounding after collisions, which may create a transient tendency for cubes to move against gravity more readily than spheres. The distinctive behaviors of cubic and spherical particles can notably influence the efficiency of size segregation in bidisperse mixtures. Interestingly, local velocity fluctuation intensity increases for both particle types in mixed suspensions, affecting the local sedimentation velocity field. Overall, spherical particles are found to settle faster than cubes at low to moderate volume fractions.</description>

      <title>Helicity effect on turbulent passive and active scalar diffusivities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulent flows are known to produce enhanced effective magnetic and passive scalar diffusivities, which can fairly accurately be determined with numerical methods. It is now known that, if the flow is also helical, the effective magnetic diffusivity is reduced relative to the nonhelical value. Neither the usual second-order correlation approximation nor the various $\tau$ approaches have been able to capture this. Here we show that the helicity effect on the turbulent passive scalar diffusivity works in the opposite sense and leads to an enhancement. This effect has not previously been seen. We have also demonstrated that the correlation time of the turbulent velocity field increases by the kinetic helicity. This is a key point in the theoretical interpretation of the obtained numerical results. Simulations in which helicity is being produced self-consistently by stratified rotating turbulence, resulted in a turbulent passive scalar diffusivity that was found to be decreasing with increasing rotation rate.</description>

      <title>Theory of the kinetic helicity effect on turbulent diffusion of magnetic and scalar fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kinetic helicity is a fundamental characteristics of astrophysical turbulent flows. It is not only responsible for the generation of large-scale magnetic fields in the Sun, stars, and spiral galaxies, but it also affects turbulent diffusion resulting in the dissipation of large-scale magnetic fields. Using the path integral approach for random helical velocity fields with a finite correlation time and large Reynolds numbers, we show that turbulent magnetic diffusion is reduced by the kinetic helicity, while the turbulent diffusivity of a passive scalar is enhanced by the helicity. The latter can explain the results of recent numerical simulations for forced helical turbulence. One of the crucial reasons for the difference between the kinetic helicity effect on magnetic and scalar fields is related to the helicity dependence of the correlation time of a turbulent velocity field.</description>
