      <title>Sequential HW-Aware Precoding: Over-the-air cancellation of HWI in Downlink Cell-Free Massive MIMO with Serial Fronthaul</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the critical challenge of mitigating hardware impairments (HWIs) in downlink cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) networks while ensuring computational scalability. We propose a novel sequential hardware-aware (HW-aware) precoding technique that leverages the serial fronthaul topology to perform over-the-air HWI cancellation. This approach involves sequentially exchanging approximated user-perceived distortion information among successive access points (APs) for over-the-air HWI mitigation. Each AP independently computes its spatial multiplexing weights and transmits signals that counteract the distortions introduced by the preceding AP. We develop a problem formulation and present a closed-form solution for this method. For performance evaluation, we study two reference methods taken either from centralized massive MIMO literature (Tone Reservation [TR]) or tailored for CF-mMIMO networks (PAPR-aware precoding), both focusing on reducing the PAPR of OFDM signals in the downlink. Results indicate that the sequential HW-aware approach achieves a substantial increase in spectral efficiency (SE) in high-distortion scenarios, with an average SE increase factor of 1.8 under severe distortions. Additionally, the proposed method, which is executed locally, demonstrates better scalability, achieving a reduction of up to 40\% and 72\% in the total number of complex multiplications compared to the PAPR-aware and TR approaches, respectively. Finally, the sequential HW-aware precoder offers high performance even when applied to cost-effective APs with few antennas, presenting a promising and practical solution for HWI compensation in CF-mMIMO systems with serial fronthaul.</description>

      <title>Joint Superimposed Pilot-aided Channel Estimation and Data Detection for FTN Signaling over Doubly-Selective Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling and superimposed pilot (SP) techniques are effective solutions for significantly enhancing the spectral efficiency (SE) in next-generation wireless communication systems. This paper proposes an innovative SP-aided channel estimation method for FTN signaling enhancing the SE over doubly-selective (i.e., time- and frequency-selective) channels. To avoid complex channel tracking, we utilize a basis expansion model (BEM) to characterize doubly-selective channel variations. We propose a frame structure that superimposes a known periodic pilot sequence onto the information sequence, avoiding SE loss by eliminating the additional overhead of multiplexed pilot (MP). Additionally, we find the optimal FTN signaling SP sequence that minimizes the mean square error (MSE) of the channel estimation. Expanding on our proposed SP-aided channel estimation method, we propose two detection methods: (1) an SP-aided separate channel estimation and data detection (SCEDD) method performing a single channel estimation followed by iterative data detection via a turbo equalizer, serving as a baseline for evaluating the SP-aided channel estimation method, and (2) an SP-aided joint channel estimation and data detection (JCEDD) method, which extends the SCEDD by updating the channel estimate in each turbo equalization iteration, becoming our primary focus for its superior performance. At equivalent SE and a higher fading rate on the order of $10^{-3}$, our simulations show that SP-aided SCEDD method outperforms MP-aided techniques in both MSE and BER, while the SP-aided JCEDD method delivers remarkable performance, where reference approaches fail to track rapid channel variations.</description>

      <title>Wideband Cognitive Radio for Joint Communication and Sensing: Optimization of Subcarrier Allocation and beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As data traffic grows, wireless systems shift to higher frequency bands (6 GHz and above), where radar systems also operate. This coexistence demands effective interference management and efficient wideband utilization. Cognitive Radio (CR) offers a solution but remains limited to single-node or narrowband systems. This paper introduces a generalized wideband CR-enabled communication and sensing system with multiple users and targets. We propose a communication and sensing sub-carrier allocations framework, followed by transmit beamforming for the primary communication BS and sensing signal design for the secondary radar BS. The goal is to maximize the communication sum rate while ensuring sensing requirements, minimizing interference, and adhering to power constraints. To solve the resulting non-convex problem, we develop a manifold optimization algorithm for communication-only sub-carriers and an alternating optimization approach using the generalized Rayleigh quotient and semidefinite relaxation for communication-sensing sub-carriers. Compared to a non-cooperative benchmark, the proposed system achieves a \qty{10}{\percent} gain in communication sum rate and a \qty{32}{\percent} gain in sensing sum rate with \num{12} BS antennas.</description>

      <title>DGAR: A Unified Domain Generalization Framework for RF-Enabled Human Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio-frequency (RF)-based human activity recognition (HAR) is a non-intrusive and privacy-preserving technology with applications in smart homes, healthcare, and security systems. However, real-world deployments face challenges from domain shifts caused by user behavior, physical attributes, and environmental conditions, leading to performance degradation. To address this, we propose DGAR, a domain-generalized activity recognition framework that learns domain-invariant and domain-specific representations without requiring target domain data. DGAR leverages correlation alignment to reduce inter-domain discrepancies and integrates a squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block to enhance the extraction of salient spatial and temporal features from RF data. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets, including HUST-HAR, Lab-LFM, and Office-LFM, validate DGAR's effectiveness, achieving F1-score improvements ranging from 2.09% to 5.81% over state-of-the-art methods. These results demonstrate DGAR's ability to address domain shift challenges, paving the way for robust, real-world HAR applications in diverse and dynamic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Causal Inference based Transfer Learning with LLMs: An Efficient Framework for Industrial RUL Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) for complex industrial machinery is critical for the reliability and maintenance of mechatronic systems, but it is challenged by high-dimensional, noisy sensor data. We propose the Causal-Informed Data Pruning Framework (CIDPF), which pioneers the use of causal inference to identify sensor signals with robust causal relationships to RUL through PCMCI-based stability analysis, while a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) screens for anomalies. By training on only 10% of the pruned data, CIDPF fine-tunes pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) using parameter-efficient strategies, reducing training time by 90% compared to traditional approaches. Experiments on the N-CMAPSS dataset demonstrate that CIDPF achieves a 26% lower RMSE than existing methods and a 25% improvement over full-data baselines, showcasing superior accuracy and computational efficiency in industrial mechatronic systems. The framework's adaptability to multi-condition scenarios further underscores its practicality for industrial deployment.</description>

      <title>Flexible WMMSE Beamforming for MU-MIMO Movable Antenna Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movable antennas offer new potential for wireless communication by introducing degrees of freedom in antenna positioning, which has recently been explored for improving sum rates. In this paper, we aim to fully leverage the capabilities of movable antennas (MAs) by assuming that both the transmitter and receiver can optimize their antenna positions in multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) communications. Recognizing that WMMSE beamforming is a highly effective method for maximizing the MU-MIMO sum rate, we modify it to integrate antenna position optimization for MA systems, which we refer to as flexible WMMSE (F-WMMSE) beamforming. Importantly, we reformulate the subproblems within WMMSE to develop regularized sparse optimization frameworks to achieve joint beamforming (antenna coefficient optimization) and element movement (antenna position optimization). We then propose a regularized least squares-based simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (RLS-SOMP) algorithm to address the resulting sparse optimization problem. To enhance practical applications, the low-complexity implementation of the proposed framework is developed based on the pre-calculations and matrix inverse lemma. The overall F-WMMSE algorithm converges similarly to WMMSE, and our findings indicate that F-WMMSE achieves a significant sum rate improvement compared to traditional WMMSE, exceeding 20% under appropriate simulation conditions</description>

      <title>RIS-based Physical Layer Security for Integrated Sensing and Communication: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is a crucial component of future wireless networks, enabling seamless integration of Communication and Sensing (C\&amp;S) functionalities. However, ensuring security in ISAC systems remains a significant challenge, as both C\&amp;S data are susceptible to adversarial threats. Physical Layer Security (PLS) has emerged as a key framework for mitigating these risks at the transmission level. Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) further enhance PLS by dynamically shaping the radio environment to improve both secrecy along with C\&amp;S performance. This survey begins with an overview of RIS, PLS, and ISAC fundamentals, establishing a foundation for understanding their integration. The state-of-the-art RIS-assisted PLS approaches in ISAC systems are then categorized into passive RIS and Active RIS (ARIS) paradigms. Passive RIS-based techniques focus on optimizing system throughput, covert communication, and Secrecy Rates (SRs), alongside improving sensing Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Weighted Sum Rate (WSR) under various constraints. ARIS-based strategies extend these capabilities by actively optimizing beamforming to enhance secrecy and covert rates while ensuring robust sensing under communication and security constraints. By reviewing both passive and ARIS-based security frameworks, this survey highlights the transformative role of RIS in strengthening ISAC security. Furthermore, it explores key optimization methodologies, technical challenges, and future research directions for integrating RIS with PLS to ensure secure and efficient ISAC in next-generation 6G wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Investigation into the role of the Bessel function order in the Fourier-Bessel series and the Hankel Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on estimating the number of terms of a Fourier-Bessel series of order $p'$ required to get within a certain error of a Bessel function of a fixed order $p$ where $p \neq p'$. Our approach consists of two steps: one, constructing an invariant over $n$ of the $n^{\text{th}}$ order Hankel transform; and two, observing the effect of expanding a suitably scaled Bessel function of a fixed order $p$ in its Fourier-Bessel series of order $p'$. We demonstrate a new error metric to simplify the error computations. Further, we generate an empirical model using numerical simulations and examine its capabilities in predicting the number of terms required.</description>

      <title>A Novel Design Method for Seeking Sparse Linear Arrays With Low Redundancy and Enhanced DOF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse arrays with $N$-sensors can provide up to $O(N^2)$ degrees of freedom (DOF) by second-order cumulants. However, these sparse arrays like minimum-/low-redundancy arrays (MRAs/LRAs), nested arrays and coprime arrays can only provide limited DOF and array aperture with the same number of physical sensors. However, further increasing DOF would increase costs in practical applications. The paper aims to design a sparse linear array (SLA) with higher DOF and lower redundancy via exploring different cases of third-order cumulants. Based on the framework third-order exhaustive co-array (TO-ECA), a general third-order array (GTOA) with any generator is proposed in the paper. Further, three novel arrays are designed based on GTOA with different generators, namely third-order sum and difference array (generator) (TO-SDA(CNA)), (TO-SDA(SCNA)) and (TO-SDA(TNA-II)) which can provide closed-form expressions for the sensor locations and enhance DOF in order to resolve more signal sources in the estimation of direction of arrival (DOA). The three TO-SDAs are all consisted of two sub-arrays, where the first is the generator and another is a ULA with big inter-spacing between sensors. For the three TO-SDAs, the maximum DOF under the given number of total physical sensors can be derived and the TO-ECA of the three TO-SDAs are hole-free. Additionally, the redundancy of the three TO-SDAs is defined, and the lower band of the redundancy for the three TO-SDAs is derived. Furthermore, the proposed TO-SDA(TNA-II) not only achieves higher DOF than those of existing TONA and even SE-FL-NA but also reduces mutual coupling effects. Meanwhile it realizes higher resolution and decreases redundancy. Numerical simulations are conducted to verify the superiority of TO-SDA(TNA-II) on DOA estimation performance and enhanced DOF over other existing DCAs.</description>

      <title>Single-Satellite-Based Geolocation of Broadcast GNSS Spoofers from Low Earth Orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an analysis and experimental demonstration of single-satellite single-pass geolocation of a terrestrial broadcast Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) spoofer from Low Earth Orbit (LEO). The proliferation of LEO-based GNSS receivers offers the prospect of unprecedented spectrum awareness, enabling persistent GNSS interference detection and geolocation. Accurate LEO-based single-receiver emitter geolocation is possible when a range-rate time history can be extracted for the emitter. This paper presents a technique crafted specifically for indiscriminate broadcast-type GNSS spoofing signals. Furthermore, it explores how unmodeled oscillator instability and worst-case spoofer-introduced signal variations degrade the geolocation estimate. The proposed geolocation technique is validated by a controlled experiment, in partnership with Spire Global, in which a LEO-based receiver captures broadcast GNSS spoofing signals transmitted from a known ground station on a non-GNSS frequency band.</description>

      <title>Achievable Sum Secrecy Rate of STAR-RIS-Enabled MU-MIMO ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various emerging applications in sixth-generation (6G) wireless demand a seamless integration of communication and sensing services, driving the development of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. Using a common waveform for both functions introduces additional security challenges, as information-bearing signals are vulnerable to eavesdropping. While a variety of secure beamforming designs are proposed in the literature for metasurface-enabled ISAC systems with single-antenna users and eavesdroppers, optimal designs for multi-antenna scenarios remain unexplored. This paper addresses this gap by studying a simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS)-enabled multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) ISAC system and proposing an optimal beamforming design to maximize the sum secrecy rate while ensuring sensing quality for multiple targets. An alternating-optimization based iterative solution is developed to tackle the non-convex optimization problem. The presented analysis confirms that the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm grows linearly with the number of metasurface elements. Our numerical results show the benefit of using STAR-RIS to increase the sum secrecy rate of the MU-MIMO ISAC system compared to its corresponding conventional RIS (cRIS)-enabled and w/o RIS systems.</description>

      <title>Green Integration of Sensing, Communication, and Power Transfer via STAR-RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upcoming sixth-generation (6G) wireless standard is anticipated to support a variety of applications that will require a seamless integration of sensing and communication services in a single network infrastructure. At the same time, 6G is also expected to support millions of low-powered Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. Previous studies have demonstrated that the power requirements of these IoT devices can be met through wireless power transfer facilitated by intelligent metasurfaces. Therefore, in this paper, we try to formulate and answer a fundamental question: How much transmit power is required for an integrated sensing, communication, and power transfer (ISCPT) system? More specifically, we consider the problem of optimal active, passive, and receive beamforming design for a simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS)-enabled ISCPT system with multiple sensing targets, multiple information receivers, and multiple energy receivers, to minimize the required transmit power from the base station, while guaranteeing predefined sensing, communication, and energy harvesting requirements. To tackle the challenging non-convex optimization problem, we use an alternating optimization (AO)-based approach, where the receive beamforming is obtained in closed form while the active and passive beamforming are obtained using a second-order cone program (SOCP) approach. Our numerical results show the benefit of using STAR-RIS to reduce the transmit power requirement for the ISCPT system compared to its corresponding conventional RIS (cRIS)-enabled and non-RIS ISCPT systems.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Based Channel Estimation, Prediction, and Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reciprocity-based beamforming-most commonly employed in time-division duplexing-uses noisy, estimated (i.e., measured) channel state information (CSI) acquired on the uplink. While computationally efficient, reciprocity-based beamforming suffers severe losses under (i) low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and (ii) user mobility because it ignores the underlying physics of the radio channel beyond its reciprocity. Based on a physics-driven geometry-based channel model, we propose a method that jointly infers the mobile user's position and environment map on the uplink. It then leverages the estimated user position and environment map to predict CSI on the downlink. We demonstrate significant efficiency gains under both (i) low SNR and (ii) user mobility on measured data. While the user position may allow efficient beamforming in strong line-of-sight (LoS) channels, inferring an environment map allows bypassing obstructed LoS conditions using non-LoS beamforming via multipath components. We further propose "channel fusion," a probabilistic (Bayesian) combination of estimated and predicted CSI, which increases the beamforming robustness, particularly when either source of CSI is unreliable. Notably, this approach shares similarities with the minimum mean square error (MMSE) channel estimator, with geometry-based prior parameters inferred from the data.</description>

      <title>Opportunistic Subarray Grouping for RIS-Aided Massive Random Access in Cellular Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS), reflective elements (REs) are typically configured as a single array, but as RE numbers increase, this approach incurs high overhead for optimal configuration. Subarray grouping provides an effective tradeoff between performance and overhead. This paper studies RIS-aided massive random access (RA) at the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer in cellular networks to enhance throughput. We introduce an opportunistic scheduling scheme that integrates multi-round access requests, subarray grouping for efficient RIS link acquisition, and multi-user data transmission. To optimize access request timing, RIS estimation overhead and throughput, we propose a multi-user RA strategy using sequential decision optimization to maximize average system throughput. A low-complexity algorithm is also developed for practical implementation. Both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed strategy significantly outperforms the extremes of full-array grouping and element-wise grouping.</description>

      <title>Rejuvenating IRS: AoI-based Low Overhead Reconfiguration Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent reflective surface (IRS) technologies help mitigate undesirable effects in wireless links by steering the communication signal between transmitters and receivers. IRS elements are configured to adjust the phase of the reflected signal for a user's location and enhance the perceived signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this way, an IRS improves the communication link but inevitably introduces more communication overhead. This occurs especially in mobile scenarios, where the user's position must be frequently estimated to re-adjust the IRS elements periodically. Such an operation requires balancing the amount of training versus the data time slots to optimize the communication performance in the link. Aiming to study this balance with the age of information (AoI) framework, we address the question of how often an IRS needs to be updated with the lowest possible overhead and the maximum of freshness of information. We derive the corresponding analytical solution for a mobile scenario, where the transmitter is static and the mobile user (MU) follows a random waypoint mobility model. We provide a closed-form expression for the average peak age of information (PAoI), as a metric to evaluate the impact of the IRS update frequency. As for the performance evaluation, we consider a realistic scenario following the IEEE 802.11ad standard, targeting the mmWave band. Our results reveal that the minimum achievable average PAoI is in the microsecond range and the optimal IRS update period is in the seconds range, causing 9% overhead in the link when the MU moves at a velocity of 1 m/s.</description>

      <title>Multiple-Particle Autofocusing Algorithm Using Axial Resolution and Morphological Analyses Based on Digital Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an autofocusing algorithm to obtain, relatively accurately, the 3D position of each particle, particularly its axial location, and particle number of a dense transparent particle solution via its hologram. First, morphological analyses and constrained intensity are used on raw reconstructed images to obtain information on candidate focused particles. Second, axial resolution is used to obtain the real focused particles. Based on the mean intensity and equivalent diameter of each candidate focused particle, all focused particles are eventually secured. Our proposed method can rapidly provide relatively accurate ground-truth axial positions to solve the autofocusing problem that occurs with dense particles.</description>

      <title>FS-SS: Few-Shot Learning for Fast and Accurate Spike Sorting of High-channel Count Probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a need for fast adaptation in spike sorting algorithms to implement brain-machine interface (BMIs) in different applications. Learning and adapting the functionality of the sorting process in real-time can significantly improve the performance. However, deep neural networks (DNNs) depend on large amounts of data for training models and their performance sustainability decreases when data is limited. Inspired by meta-learning, this paper proposes a few-shot spike sorting framework (FS-SS) with variable network model size that requires minimal learning training and supervision. The framework is not only compatible with few-shot adaptations, but also it uses attention mechanism and dilated convolutional neural networks. This allows scaling the network parameters to learn the important features of spike signals and to quickly generalize the learning ability to new spike waveforms in recording channels after few observations. The FS-SS was evaluated by using freely accessible datasets, also compared with the other state-of-the-art algorithms. The average classification accuracy of the proposed method is 99.28%, which shows extreme robustness to background noise and similarity of the spike waveforms. When the number of training samples is reduced by 90%, the parameter scale is reduced by 68.2%, while the accuracy only decreased by 0.55%. The paper also visualizes the model's attention distribution under spike sorting tasks of different difficulty levels. The attention distribution results show that the proposed model has clear interpretability and high robustness.</description>

      <title>GenMetaLoc: Learning to Learn Environment-Aware Fingerprint Generation for Sample Efficient Wireless Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing fingerprinting-based localization methods often require extensive data collection and struggle to generalize to new environments. In contrast to previous environment-unknown MetaLoc, we propose GenMetaLoc in this paper, which first introduces meta-learning to enable the generation of dense fingerprint databases from an environment-aware perspective. In the model aspect, the learning-to-learn mechanism accelerates the fingerprint generation process by facilitating rapid adaptation to new environments with minimal data. Additionally, we incorporate 3D point cloud data from the first Fresnel zone between the transmitter and receiver, which describes the obstacles distribution in the environment and serves as a condition to guide the diffusion model in generating more accurate fingerprints. In the data processing aspect, unlike most studies that focus solely on channel state information (CSI) amplitude or phase, we present a comprehensive processing that addresses both, correcting errors from WiFi hardware limitations such as amplitude discrepancies and frequency offsets. For the data collection platform, we develop an uplink wireless localization system that leverages the sensing capabilities of existing commercial WiFi devices and mobile phones, thus reducing the need for additional deployment costs. Experimental results on real datasets show that our framework outperforms baseline methods.</description>

      <title>A Two-Stage Rotation-Based Super-Resolution Signature Estimation for Spatial Wideband Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial and temporal delays in a wireless multi-antenna system, paired with an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform, can be utilized to estimate the Angle of Arrival (AoA) and Time of Arrival (ToA) of scatterers in the radio channel through spectral estimation techniques. However, in millimeter-wave (mmWave) and TeraHertz (THz) systems, the spatial delays across the aperture of massive array elements are comparable to the inverse of the signal bandwidth. As a result, these delays cannot be approximated solely by phase terms, necessitating consideration of the Spatial Wideband Effect (SWE). The SWE in the mmWave/THz system causes migration of the actual AoA-ToA coarse bins. Moreover, a finite grid measurement of complex sinusoidal signals of continuous frequencies results in spectral leakage whenever there is a grid mismatch. In this work, given the Discrete Fourier Transform's computational efficiency and broad practical applicability, we propose utilizing the inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) for the initial 2-D spectrum estimation of the channel response. Further, in this paper, we propose a two-stage efficient rotation-based algorithm for fine-tuned signature estimation of spatial wideband systems with uniform linear arrays. Specifically, we utilize the rotation-based method to identify the correct coarse bin in the first stage followed by 2D-rotation based fine-tuning around the corrected coarse bin in the second stage. The proposed technique in this work can be used for handling beam squint effect in different applications like near-filed communications, wideband Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) radar, channel estimation in Extremely Large (XL)-MIMO for 6G and beyond systems etc. The effectiveness of our proposed algorithm over the existing narrowband super-resolution estimation algorithms is established numerically through computer simulations.</description>

      <title>Novel Constructions of 2-D Golay Complementary Array Sets of Flexible Sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-dimensional (1-D) Golay complementary sets(GCSs) possess numerous well-known properties and have achieved extensive use in communication engineering. The concept of 1-D GCSs can be extended to two-dimensional (2-D) Golay complementary array sets(GCASs). The letter proposes two constructions of 2-D GCASs based on two-dimensional extended generalized Boolean functions, where the set sizes and matrix parameters are flexible. The set size of GCASs with an array size of b^m b^n in the letter can reach N^m+n+1, which has not been cited in the existing literature. Both structures are assembled directly and are not restricted by the parameters of other existing sequences, thus expanding the theoretical and applicative boundaries of Golay complementary array sets.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna Enabled ISAC: Tackling Slow Antenna Movement, Dynamic RCS, and Imperfect CSI via Two-timescale Optimizati</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate resource allocation for a movable antenna (MA) enabled integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system scanning a sector for sensing and simultaneously serving multiple communication users using multiple variable-length snapshots. To tackle the critical challenges of slow antenna movement speed, dynamic radar cross section (RCS) variation, imperfect channel state information (CSI), and finite precision antenna positioning encountered in practice, we propose a novel two-timescale (TTS) optimization framework. In particular, we jointly optimize the discrete MA positions, the communication and sensing beamforming vectors, and the snapshot durations for minimization of the average transmit power at the base station (BS) while guaranteeing a minimum sensing and communication quality of service (QoS) and accounting for imperfect CSI. To overcome the slow antenna movement speed, the MA positions are adjusted only once per scanning period whereas the beamforming vectors and snapshot durations are adapted in every snapshot. Furthermore, to manage the impact of varying RCSs, a novel chance constraint for the sensing QoS is introduced. To solve the resulting challenging highly non-convex mixed integer non-linear program (MINLP), an efficient iterative algorithm exploiting alternative optimization (AO) is developed and shown to yield a high-quality suboptimal solution. Our simulation results reveal that the proposed MA enabled ISAC system cannot only significantly reduce the BS transmit power compared to systems relying on fixed-position antennas and antenna selection but also exhibits a remarkable robustness to RCS fluctuations and imperfect CSI. Furthermore, the proposed TTS framework achieves a similar performance as a system adjusting the MA positions in every snapshot, while the TTS approach significantly reduces the time used for MA adjustment.</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted Localization: A Novel Conditional Sample Mean Approach without CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been recognized as a promising solution for enhancing localization accuracy. Traditional RIS-based localization methods typically rely on prior channel knowledge, beam scanning, and pilot-based assistance. These approaches often result in substantial energy and computational overhead, and require real-time coordination between the base station (BS) and the RIS. In this work, we propose a novel multiple RISs aided localization approach to address these challenges. The proposed method first estimates the angle-of-directions (AoDs) between the RISs and the user using the conditional sample mean approach, and then uses the estimated multiple AoD pairs to determine the user's position. This approach only requires measuring the received signal strength at the BS for a set of randomly generated phase shifts across all RISs, thereby eliminating the need for real-time RIS phase shift design or user-to-BS pilot transmissions. Numerical results show that the proposed localization approach improves localization accuracy while significantly reducing energy and signaling overhead compared to conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Maximum Likelihood Estimation Based Complex-Valued Robust Chinese Remainder Theorem and Its Fast Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a multi-channel self-reset analog-to-digital converter (ADC) system with complex-valued moduli has been proposed. This system enables the recovery of high dynamic range complex-valued bandlimited signals at low sampling rates via the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT). In this paper, we investigate complex-valued CRT (C-CRT) with erroneous remainders, where the errors follow wrapped complex Gaussian distributions. Based on the existing real-valued CRT utilizing maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), we propose a fast MLE-based C-CRT (MLE C-CRT). The proposed algorithm requires only $2L$ searches to obtain the optimal estimate of the common remainder, where $L$ is the number of moduli. Once the common remainder is estimated, the complex number can be determined using the C-CRT. Furthermore, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the fast MLE C-CRT to achieve robust estimation. Finally, we apply the proposed algorithm to ADCs. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a message passing algorithm for tracking of clutter signals in MIMO radar. The method exploits basis expansion to linearise the signal model, to enable mean field approach for tracking the posterior distribution of the clutter as it evolves across time, as well as the mean and precision of the clutter map. The method shows good estimation accuracy in simulations for a scenario that adhere to the statistical model used for derivation as well as one that does not. The complexity of the method is linear in both the amount of parameters chosen and the amount of data under consideration.</description>

      <title>On the Optimality of Single-label and Multi-label Neural Network Decoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the design of two neural network (NN) architectures recently proposed as decoders for forward error correction: the so-called single-label NN (SLNN) and multi-label NN (MLNN) decoders. These decoders have been reported to achieve near-optimal codeword- and bit-wise performance, respectively. Results in the literature show near-optimality for a variety of short codes. In this paper, we analytically prove that certain SLNN and MLNN architectures can, in fact, always realize optimal decoding, regardless of the code. These optimal architectures and their binary weights are shown to be defined by the codebook, i.e., no training or network optimization is required. Our proposed architectures are in fact not NNs, but a different way of implementing the maximum likelihood decoding rule. Optimal performance is numerically demonstrated for Hamming $(7,4)$, Polar $(16,8)$, and BCH $(31,21)$ codes. The results show that our optimal architectures are less complex than the SLNN and MLNN architectures proposed in the literature, which in fact only achieve near-optimal performance. Extension to longer codes is still hindered by the curse of dimensionality. Therefore, even though SLNN and MLNN can perform maximum likelihood decoding, such architectures cannot be used for medium and long codes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we examine the effect of misalignment angle on cluster-based power delay profile (PDP) modeling for a 60 GHz millimeter-wave uplink. The analysis uses real-world data, where fixed uplink scenarios are realized by placing the transmitter at ground level and the receiver at the building level. Both outdoor-to-indoor (O2I) and outdoor-to-outdoor (O2O) scenarios are studied. Using the misalignment angle and the scenario as inputs, we propose a statistical PDP simulation algorithm based on the Saleh-Valenzuela model. Different goodness-of-fit metrics reveal that our proposed algorithm is robust to both O2I and O2O scenarios and can approximate the PDPs fairly well, even in case of misalignment.</description>

Abstract: Fifth generation (5G) new radio is now offering sidelink capability, which allows direct vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. Millimeter wave (mmWave) enables low-latency mission-critical V2V communications, such as forward crash warning, between two vehicles crossing on a road without dividers. In this article, we present a measurement-based path loss (PL) model for V2V links operating at 59.6 GHz mmWave when two vehicles approach from opposite sides and cross each other. Our model outperforms other existing PL models and can reliably model both approaching and departing vehicle scenarios.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive measurement campaign aimed at evaluating indoor-to-indoor radio channels in dynamic scenarios, with a particular focus on applications such as autonomous ground vehicles (AGV). These scenarios are characterized by the height of the antennas, addressing the unique challenges of near-ground communication. Our study involves long-term measurements (20 minutes of continuous recording per measurement) of the channel impulse response (CIR) in the 60 GHz and 80 GHz frequency bands, each with a bandwidth of 2.048 GHz. We investigate the variations in channel characteristics, focusing on parameters such as root mean square (RMS) delay spread and the Rician factor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear time-varying (LTV) systems model radar scenes where each reflector/target applies a delay, Doppler shift and complex amplitude scaling to a transmitted waveform. The receiver processes the received signal using the transmitted signal as a reference. The self-ambiguity function of the transmitted signal captures the cross-correlation of delay and Doppler shifts of the transmitted waveform. It acts as a blur that limits resolution, at the receiver, of the delay and Doppler shifts of targets in close proximity. This paper considers resolution of multiple targets and compares performance of traditional chirp waveforms with the Zak-OTFS waveform. The self-ambiguity function of a chirp is a line in the delay-Doppler domain, whereas the self-ambiguity function of the Zak-OTFS waveform is a lattice. The advantage of lattices over lines is better localization, and we show lattices provide superior noise-free estimation of the range and velocity of multiple targets. When the delay spread of the radar scene is less than the delay period of the Zak-OTFS modulation, and the Doppler spread is less than the Doppler period, we describe how to localize targets by calculating cross-ambiguities in the delay-Doppler domain. We show that the signal processing complexity of our approach is superior to the traditional approach of computing cross-ambiguities in the continuous time / frequency domain.</description>

      <title>Anatomically Guided Motion Correction for Placental IVIM Parameter Estimation with Accelerated Sampling Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) is a diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) method that may be applied to the placenta to help diagnose abnormal pregnancies. IVIM requires prolonged scan times, followed by a model-based estimation procedure. Maternal or fetal motion during the scan affects the accuracy of this estimation. In this work, we proposed to address this challenging motion correction and data fitting problem by using additional anatomical information that is routinely collected at the beginning of the examination. Super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) was applied to these anatomical data, to provide a patient-specific, 3D isotropic, anatomic reference. Our first contribution is a novel framework with a two-step motion correction that uses both IVIM and the SRR anatomic data, accounting for both intra- and inter-scan, non-rigid motion. Our second contribution is an automation and acceleration of the IVIM data fitting, using a state-of-the-art Bayesian-type algorithm, modified with a preconditioned Crank-Nicholson (pCN) sampling strategy. The accuracy of the IVIM parameter fitting was improved by the proposed motion correction strategy, as assessed by the mean absolute fitting error in the region of interest, which was 4.14 before and 3.02 after correction (arbitrary units of signal intensity). The novel sampling strategy accelerated parameter estimation by 39% in average, with the same accuracy as that of the conventional Bayesian approach. In conclusion, the proposed method may be applied to obtain fast and reliable IVIM parameter estimates in challenging scenarios such as prenatal MRI.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Model for Estimating Vessel Size Distribution from MR Gradient Echo Sampling of the Free Induction Decay and Spin Echo Sequence Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vascular remodelling is inherent to the pathogenesis of many diseases including cancer, neurodegeneration, fibrosis, hypertension, and diabetes. In this paper, a new susceptibility-contrast based MRI approach is established to non-invasively image intravoxel vessel size distribution (VSD), enabling a more comprehensive and quantitative assessment of vascular remodelling. The approach is founded on imaging vascular structures across a rodent brain using high-resolution, light-sheet fluorescence microscopy, simulating gradient echo sampling of free induction decay and spin echo (GESFIDE) MRI signals for the three-dimensional vascular networks, and training a deep learning model to predict cerebral blood volume (CBV) and VSD from GESFIDE signals. The results from ex vivo experiments demonstrated strong correlation (r = 0.96) between the true and predicted CBV. Also, high similarity between true and predicted VSDs was observed (mean Bhattacharya Coefficient = 0.92). With further in vivo validation, intravoxel VSD imaging could become a transformative preclinical and clinical tool for interrogating disease and treatment induced vascular remodelling.</description>

      <title>Mixed-gradients Distributed Filtered Reference Least Mean Square Algorithm -- A Robust Distributed Multichannel Active Noise Control Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed multichannel active noise control (DMCANC), which utilizes multiple individual processors to achieve a global noise reduction performance comparable to conventional centralized multichannel active noise control (MCANC), has become increasingly attractive due to its high computational efficiency. However, the majority of current DMCANC algorithms disregard the impact of crosstalk across nodes and impose the assumption of an ideal network devoid of communication limitations, which is an unrealistic assumption. Therefore, this work presents a robust DMCANC algorithm that employs the compensating filter to mitigate the impact of crosstalk. The proposed solution enhances the DMCANC system's flexibility and security by utilizing local gradients instead of local control filters to convey enhanced information, resulting in a mixed-gradients distributed filtered reference least mean square (MGDFxLMS) algorithm. The performance investigation demonstrates that the proposed approach performs well with the centralized method. Furthermore, to address the issue of communication delay in the distributed network, a practical strategy that auto-shrinks the step size value in response to the delayed samples is implemented to improve the system's resilience. The numerical simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed auto-shrink step size MGDFxLMS (ASSS-MGDFxLMS) algorithm across various communication delays, highlighting its practical value.</description>

      <title>Quantized Analog Beamforming Enabled Multi-task Federated Learning Over-the-air</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over-the-air computation (AirComp) has recently emerged as a pivotal technique for communication-efficient federated learning (FL) in resource-constrained wireless networks. Though AirComp leverages the superposition property of multiple access channels for computation, it inherently limits its ability to manage inter-task interference in multi-task computing. In this paper, we propose a quantized analog beamforming scheme at the receiver to enable simultaneous multi-task FL. Specifically, inspiring by the favorable propagation and channel hardening properties of large-scale antenna arrays, a targeted analog beamforming method in closed form is proposed for statistical interference elimination. Analytical results reveal that the interference power vanishes by an order of $\mathcal{O}\left(1/N_r\right)$ with the number of analog phase shifters, $N_r$, irrespective of their quantization precision. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed analog beamforming method and show that the performance upper bound of ideal learning without errors can be achieved by increasing the number of low-precision analog phase shifters.</description>

      <title>RAISE: Optimizing RIS Placement to Maximize Task Throughput in Multi-Server Vehicular Edge Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the limited computing capabilities on autonomous vehicles, onboard processing of large volumes of latency-sensitive tasks presents significant challenges. While vehicular edge computing (VEC) has emerged as a solution, offloading data-intensive tasks to roadside servers or other vehicles is hindered by large obstacles like trucks/buses and the surge in service demands during rush hours. To address these challenges, Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) can be leveraged to mitigate interference from ground signals and reach more edge servers by elevating RIS adaptively. To this end, we propose RAISE, an optimization framework for RIS placement in multi-server VEC systems. Specifically, RAISE optimizes RIS altitude and tilt angle together with the optimal task assignment to maximize task throughput under deadline constraints. To find a solution, a two-layer optimization approach is proposed, where the inner layer exploits the unimodularity of the task assignment problem to derive the efficient optimal strategy while the outer layer develops a near-optimal hill climbing (HC) algorithm for RIS placement with low complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed RAISE framework consistently outperforms existing benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Cache-Aware Cooperative Multicast Beamforming in Dynamic Satellite-Terrestrial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the burgeoning demand for data-intensive services, satellite-terrestrial networks (STNs) face increasing backhaul link congestion, deteriorating user quality of service (QoS), and escalating power consumption. Cache-aided STNs are acknowledged as a promising paradigm for accelerating content delivery to users and alleviating the load of backhaul links. However, the dynamic nature of low earth orbit (LEO) satellites and the complex interference among satellite beams and terrestrial base stations pose challenges in effectively managing limited edge resources. To address these issues, this paper proposes a method for dynamically scheduling caching and communication resources, aiming to reduce network costs in terms of transmission power consumption and backhaul traffic, while meeting user QoS demands and resource constraints. We formulate a mixed timescale problem to jointly optimize cache placement, LEO satellite beam direction, and cooperative multicast beamforming among satellite beams and base stations. To tackle this intricate problem, we propose a two-stage solution framework, where the primary problem is decoupled into a short-term content delivery subproblem and a long-term cache placement subproblem. The former subproblem is solved by designing an alternating optimization approach with whale optimization and successive convex approximation methods according to the cache placement state, while cache content in STNs is updated using an iterative algorithm that utilizes historical information. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms, showcasing their convergence and significantly reducing transmission power consumption and backhaul traffic by up to 52%.</description>

      <title>A State-of-the-Art Review on Acoustic Preservation of Historical Worship Spaces through Auralization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Historical Worship Spaces (HWS) are significant architectural landmarks which hold both cultural and spiritual value. The acoustic properties of these spaces play a crucial role in historical and contemporary religious liturgies, rituals, and ceremonies, as well as in the performance of sacred music. However, the original acoustic characteristics of these spaces are often at risk due to repurposing, renovations, natural disasters, or deterioration over time. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the current state of research on the acquisition, analysis, and synthesis of acoustics, with a focus on HWS. An example case study of the Nassau chapel in Brussels, Belgium, is presented to demonstrate the application of these techniques for the preservation and auralization of historical worship space acoustics. The paper concludes with a discussion of the challenges and opportunities in the field, and outlines future research directions.</description>

      <title>Channel Capacity Saturation Point and Beamforming Acceleration for Near-Field XL-MIMO Multiuser Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most important technologies in the fifth generation (5G) and the sixth generation (6G) is massive multiple input multiple outputs (MIMO) or extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO). With the evolving high-frequency technologies in millimeter band or tereHz band, the communication scene is changing into near-field rather than the conventional far-field scenario. In this letter, instead of advertising the XL-MIMO in the near-field, we appeal that a limit should be set on the size of the antenna array, beyond which the channel capacity will not show a significant increase. We show capacity saturation point can be analytically determined. Moreover, we propose a new beamforming algorithm that relieve the heavy computation due to the large antenna size even around the saturation point. Numerical results are provided to validate our analysis and show the performance of our newly proposed beamforming scheme.</description>

      <title>A Tutorial on Six-Dimensional Movable Antenna Enhanced Wireless Networks: Synergizing Positionable and Rotatable Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) is a new
  and revolutionary technique that fully exploits the wireless
  channel spatial variations at the transmitter/receiver by flexibly
  adjusting the three-dimensional (3D) positions and 3D rotations
  of antennas/antenna surfaces (sub-arrays), thereby improving the performance of wireless
  networks cost-effectively without the need to deploy additional
  antennas. It is thus expected that
  the integration of new 6DMAs into future sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks will fundamentally enhance
  antenna agility and adaptability, and introduce new degrees
  of freedom (DoFs) for system design. Despite its great potential,
  6DMA faces new challenges to be efficiently implemented in wireless
  networks, including corresponding architectures, antenna position and rotation optimization, channel estimation,
  and system design from both communication and sensing perspectives. In
  this paper, we provide a tutorial on 6DMA-enhanced wireless
  networks to address the above issues by unveiling associated new channel models, hardware implementations and
  practical position/rotation constraints, as well as various appealing applications in
  wireless networks. Moreover, we discuss two special cases of 6DMA, namely, rotatable 6DMA with fixed antenna position and positionable 6DMA with fixed antenna rotation, and highlight their respective design challenges and applications.
  We further present prototypes developed for 6DMA-enhanced communication along with experimental results obtained with these prototypes. Finally, we outline promising directions for further investigation.</description>

      <title>Efficient Transformed Gaussian Process State-Space Models for Non-Stationary High-Dimensional Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian process state-space models (GPSSMs) have emerged as a powerful framework for modeling dynamical systems, offering interpretable uncertainty quantification and inherent regularization. However, existing GPSSMs face significant challenges in handling high-dimensional, non-stationary systems due to computational inefficiencies, limited scalability, and restrictive stationarity assumptions. In this paper, we propose an efficient transformed Gaussian process state-space model (ETGPSSM) to address these limitations. Our approach leverages a single shared Gaussian process (GP) combined with normalizing flows and Bayesian neural networks, enabling efficient modeling of complex, high-dimensional state transitions while preserving scalability. To address the lack of closed-form expressions for the implicit process in the transformed GP, we follow its generative process and introduce an efficient variational inference algorithm, aided by the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), to enable computationally tractable learning and inference. Extensive empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our ETGPSSM in system dynamics learning, high-dimensional state estimation, and time-series forecasting, outperforming existing GPSSMs and neural network-based methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>ALWNN Empowered Automatic Modulation Classification: Conquering Complexity and Scarce Sample Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC), deep learning methods have shown remarkable performance, offering significant advantages over traditional approaches and demonstrating their vast potential. Nevertheless, notable drawbacks, particularly in their high demands for storage, computational resources, and large-scale labeled data, which limit their practical application in real-world scenarios. To tackle this issue, this paper innovatively proposes an automatic modulation classification model based on the Adaptive Lightweight Wavelet Neural Network (ALWNN) and the few-shot framework (MALWNN). The ALWNN model, by integrating the adaptive wavelet neural network and depth separable convolution, reduces the number of model parameters and computational complexity. The MALWNN framework, using ALWNN as an encoder and incorporating prototype network technology, decreases the model's dependence on the quantity of samples. Simulation results indicate that this model performs remarkably well on mainstream datasets. Moreover, in terms of Floating Point Operations Per Second (FLOPS) and Normalized Multiply - Accumulate Complexity (NMACC), ALWNN significantly reduces computational complexity compared to existing methods. This is further validated by real-world system tests on USRP and Raspberry Pi platforms. Experiments with MALWNN show its superior performance in few-shot learning scenarios compared to other algorithms.</description>

      <title>Target Speaker Selection for Neural Network Beamforming in Multi-Speaker Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a speaker selection mechanism (SSM) for the training of an end-to-end beamforming neural network, based on recent findings that a listener usually looks to the target speaker with a certain undershot angle. The mechanism allows the neural network model to learn toward which speaker to focus, during training, in a multi-speaker scenario, based on the position of listener and speakers. However, only audio information is necessary during inference. We perform acoustic simulations demonstrating the feasibility and performance when the SSM is employed in training. The results show significant increase in speech intelligibility, quality, and distortion metrics when compared to the minimum variance distortionless filter and the same neural network model trained without SSM. The success of the proposed method is a significant step forward toward the solution of the cocktail party problem.</description>

      <title>Joint Spectrogram Separation and TDOA Estimation using Optimal Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Separating sources is a common challenge in applications such as speech enhancement and telecommunications, where distinguishing between overlapping sounds helps reduce interference and improve signal quality. Additionally, in multichannel systems, correct calibration and synchronization are essential to separate and locate source signals accurately. This work introduces a method for blind source separation and estimation of the Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) of signals in the time-frequency domain. Our proposed method effectively separates signal mixtures into their original source spectrograms while simultaneously estimating the relative delays between receivers, using Optimal Transport (OT) theory. By exploiting the structure of the OT problem, we combine the separation and delay estimation processes into a unified framework, optimizing the system through a block coordinate descent algorithm. We analyze the performance of the OT-based estimator under various noise conditions and compare it with conventional TDOA and source separation methods. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that our proposed approach can achieve a significant level of accuracy across diverse noise scenarios for physical speech signals in both TDOA and source separation tasks.</description>

      <title>Signal Propagation in RIS-Aided 5G Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of radio signal propagation characteristics within the urban environment of Poznan (Poland). The study specifically addresses the deployment of a 5th generation (5G NR - New Radio) Radio Access Network (RAN), which comprises 8 strategically positioned Base Stations (BSs). These base stations are configured with either Single Input Single Output (SISO) or Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) antenna technologies, contingent upon the specific requirements of the network cells they serve. A key focus of our research is the integration of 15 reflecting arrays, known as Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs), which were installed throughout the study area. These RISs were deployed at various suspension heights to evaluate their impact on radio signal propagation and coverage. By exploring the influence of these RIS matrices, our research sheds light on their potential to significantly enhance signal quality, particularly in urban environments.</description>

      <title>Entropic Analysis of Time Series through Kernel Density Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a novel framework for time series analysis using entropic measures based on the kernel density estimate (KDE) of the time series' Takens' embeddings. Using this framework we introduce two distinct analytical tools: (1) a multi-scale KDE entropy metric, denoted as $\Delta\text{KE}$, which quantifies the evolution of time series complexity across different scales by measuring certain entropy changes, and (2) a sliding baseline method that employs the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to detect changes in time series dynamics through changes in KDEs. The $\Delta{\rm KE}$ metric offers insights into the information content and ``unfolding'' properties of the time series' embedding related to dynamical systems, while the KL divergence-based approach provides a noise and outlier robust approach for identifying time series change points (injections in RF signals, e.g.). We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of these tools through a set of experiments encompassing diverse domains. In the space of radio frequency (RF) signal processing, we achieve accurate detection of signal injections under varying noise and interference conditions. Furthermore, we apply our methodology to electrocardiography (ECG) data, successfully identifying instances of ventricular fibrillation with high accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of our tools for dynamic state detection by accurately identifying chaotic regimes within an intermittent signal. These results show the broad applicability of our framework for extracting meaningful insights from complex time series data across various scientific disciplines.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of Proximity Operator for Squared Loss and Performance Prediction of Nonconvex Sparse Signal Recovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2103.10300v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proximal splitting-based convex optimization is a promising approach to linear inverse problems because we can use some prior knowledge of the unknown variables explicitly. An understanding of the behavior of the optimization algorithms would be important for the tuning of the parameters and the development of new algorithms. In this paper, we first analyze the asymptotic property of the proximity operator for the squared loss function, which appears in the update equations of some proximal splitting methods for linear inverse problems. Our analysis shows that the output of the proximity operator can be characterized with a scalar random variable in the large system limit. Moreover, we apply the asymptotic result to the prediction of optimization algorithms for compressed sensing. Simulation results demonstrate that the MSE performance of the Douglas-Rachford algorithm can be well predicted in compressed sensing with the $\ell_{1}$ optimization. We also examine the behavior of the prediction for the case with nonconvex smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) and minimax concave penalty (MCP) regularization.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Aided Joint Source Channel Coding For High Realism Wireless Image Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17736v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning-based joint source-channel coding (deep JSCC) has been demonstrated to be an effective approach for wireless image transmission. Nevertheless, most existing work adopts an autoencoder framework to optimize conventional criteria such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) which do not suffice to maintain the perceptual quality of reconstructed images. Such an issue is more prominent under stringent bandwidth constraints or low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. To tackle this challenge, we propose DiffJSCC, a novel framework that leverages the prior knowledge of the pre-trained Statble Diffusion model to produce high-realism images via the conditional diffusion denoising process. Our DiffJSCC first extracts multimodal spatial and textual features from the noisy channel symbols in the generation phase. Then, it produces an initial reconstructed image as an intermediate representation to aid robust feature extraction and a stable training process. In the following diffusion step, DiffJSCC uses the derived multimodal features, together with channel state information such as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), as conditions to guide the denoising diffusion process, which converts the initial random noise to the final reconstruction. DiffJSCC employs a novel control module to fine-tune the Stable Diffusion model and adjust it to the multimodal conditions. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets reveal that our method significantly surpasses prior deep JSCC approaches on both perceptual metrics and downstream task performance, showcasing its ability to preserve the semantics of the original transmitted images. Notably, DiffJSCC can achieve highly realistic reconstructions for 768x512 pixel Kodak images with only 3072 symbols (&lt;0.008 symbols per pixel) under 1dB SNR channels.</description>

Abstract: Spectrum prediction is considered as a key technology to assist spectrum decision. Despite the great efforts that have been put on the construction of spectrum prediction, achieving accurate spectrum prediction emphasizes the need for more advanced solutions. In this paper, we propose a new multichannel multi-step spectrum prediction method using Transformer and stacked bidirectional LSTM (Bi- LSTM), named TSB. Specifically, we use multi-head attention and stacked Bi-LSTM to build a new Transformer based on encoder-decoder architecture. The self-attention mechanism composed of multiple layers of multi-head attention can continuously attend to all positions of the multichannel spectrum sequences. The stacked Bi-LSTM can learn these focused coding features by multi-head attention layer by layer. The advantage of this fusion mode is that it can deeply capture the long-term dependence of multichannel spectrum data. We have conducted extensive experiments on a dataset generated by a real simulation platform. The results show that the proposed algorithm performs better than the baselines.</description>

      <title>Spatial Frequencies and Degrees of Freedom: Their Roles in Near-Field Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07448v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As wireless technology begins to utilize physically larger arrays and/or higher frequencies, the transmitter and receiver will reside in each other's radiative near field. This fact gives rise to unusual propagation phenomena such as spherical wavefronts and beamfocusing, creating the impression that new spatial dimensions -- called degrees-of-freedom (DoF) -- can be exploited in the near field. However, this is a fallacy because the theoretically maximum DoF are already achievable in the far field. This paper sheds light on these issues by providing a tutorial on spatial frequencies, which are the fundamental components of wireless channels, and by explaining their role in characterizing the DoF in the near and far fields. In particular, we demonstrate how a single propagation path utilizes one spatial frequency in the far field and an interval of spatial frequencies in the near field. We explain how the array geometry determines the number of distinguishable spatial frequency bins and, thereby, the spatial DoF. We also describe how to model near-field multipath channels and their spatial correlation matrices. Finally, we discuss the research challenges and future directions in this field.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Target Location Distribution in MIMO Radar: PCRB vs. PSBP for Waveform Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19209v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the issue of how to exploit prior target location distribution for multiple input multiple output (MIMO) radar waveform design. We consider a MIMO radar aiming to estimate the random angular location parameters of a point target, whose prior distribution information can be exploited by the radar. First, we establish the models of the MIMO radar system and the target location distribution. Based on the considered models, we propose the first category of target location distribution exploitation methods by analyzing the radar direction-of-angle (DoA) estimation performance and deriving a general form of posterior Cramer-Rao bound (PCRB) as the lower bound of the mean square error of DoA estimation. Following this, to investigate the potential of leveraging prior information from two distinct perspectives, thereby providing deeper insights into the estimation process, we proposed the second category of target location distribution exploitation methods by introducing a novel radar metric, probability scaled beampattern (PSBP), from the perspective of radar beampattern. To compare the two methods, we formulate the PCRB and PSBP oriented radar waveform design problems and propose corresponding low-complexity and convergence-guaranteed algorithms to tackle them. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted in different scenarios to provide a comprehensive evaluation and comparison of the radar performance.</description>

      <title>DCSK-based Waveform Design for Self-sustainable RIS-aided Noncoherent SWIPT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of transmit waveform design in the context of a chaotic signal-based self-sustainable reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided system for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). Specifically, we propose a differential chaos shift keying (DCSK)-based RIS-aided point-to-point set-up, where the RIS is partitioned into two non-overlapping surfaces. The elements of the first sub-surface perform energy harvesting (EH), which in turn, provide the required power to the other sub-surface operating in the information transfer (IT) mode. In this framework, by considering a generalized frequency-selective Nakagami-m fading scenario as well as the nonlinearities of the EH process, we derive closed-form analytical expressions for both the bit error rate (BER) at the receiver and the harvested power at the RIS. Our analysis demonstrates, that both these performance metrics depend on the parameters of the wireless channel, the transmit waveform design, and the number of reflecting elements at the RIS, which switch between the IT and EH modes, depending on the application requirements. Moreover, we show that, having more reflecting elements in the IT mode is not always beneficial and also, for a given acceptable BER, we derive a lower bound on the number of RIS elements that need to be operated in the EH mode. Furthermore, for a fixed RIS configuration, we investigate a trade-off between the achievable BER and the harvested power at the RIS and accordingly, we propose appropriate transmit waveform designs. Finally, our numerical results illustrate the importance of our intelligent DCSK-based waveform design on the considered framework.</description>

Our sample complexity guarantee improves upon the best existing one by a factor $\max(r, \log(1/\epsilon))/r$ where $r$ is the rank of the unknown matrix and $\epsilon$ is the final desired accuracy. A second contribution of this work is a detailed comparison of guarantees from all work that studies the exact same mathematical problem as LRCS, but refers to it by different names.</description>

      <title>Point Data for Site-Specific Mid-band Radio Propagation Channel Statistics in the Indoor Hotspot (InH) Environment for 3GPP and Next Generation Alliance (NGA) Channel Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19873v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extensive work has been carried out in the past year by various organizations in an effort to determine standardized statistical channel impulse response (CIR) parameters for the newly-released FR3 mid-band spectrum (7.25 GHz -- 24.25 GHz). In this work, we show that the wireless community currently lacks a unified method for presenting key parameters required for transparency and utilization by several constituencies when presenting propagation data for use by standard bodies or third parties to create statistical CIR models. This paper aims to solve the existing problem by offering a standard method to provide key propagation parameters in a point-data format that supports both statistical and site-specific channel characterization. As shown here, the point-data format enables multiple contributors to create channel model standards or pool measurement data to create larger datasets for exploring ray-tracing (e.g. site-specific) channel modeling or training in AI/ML propagation work, and to ensure the most accurate model using a larger dataset that is continually expanded through measurement contributions. The point-data approach includes site-specific point-by-point propagation data while readily supporting the creation of commonly-used cumulative distribution function (CDF) plot. The indoor hotspot (InH) datasets collected in Spring 2024 at 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHZ by NYU WIRELESS are provided for the first time in point-data form, to augment statistical models previously presented solely as CDFs, in order to demonstrate how a standardized approach to measurement data could allow others to utilize the site-specific locations and key channel parameters observed at each location, to better understand, vet, and build upon statistical or site-specific CIRs from the contributions of many different data sources.</description>

Abstract: Global allocations in the upper mid-band spectrum (4--24 GHz) necessitate a comprehensive exploration of the propagation behavior to meet the promise of coverage and capacity. This paper presents an extensive Urban Microcell (UMi) outdoor propagation measurement campaign at 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz conducted in Downtown Brooklyn, USA, using a 1 GHz bandwidth sliding correlation channel sounder over 40--880 m propagation distance, encompassing seven Line of Sight (LOS) and 13 Non-Line of Sight (NLOS) locations. Analysis of the path loss (PL) reveals lower directional and omnidirectional PL exponents compared to mmWave and sub-THz frequencies in the UMi environment, using the close-in (CI) free space PL (FSPL) model with a 1 m reference distance. Additionally, a decreasing trend in root mean square (RMS) delay spread (DS) and angular spread (AS) with increasing frequency was observed. The measured NLOS RMS DS and RMS AS mean values (as computed by 3GPP methods) are found to be consistently lower compared to 3GPP model predictions. Point-data tables with corresponding site-specific environmental information for all measured statistics at each TX-RX location are provided to support the models and results. The spatio-temporal statistics presented here offer valuable insights for the design of next-generation wireless systems and networks.</description>

      <title>Parameterized TDOA: Instantaneous TDOA Estimation and Localization for Mobile Targets in a Time-Division Broadcast Positioning System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a time-division broadcast positioning system (TDBPS), localizing mobile targets using classical time difference of arrival (TDOA) methods poses significant challenges. Concurrent TDOA measurements are infeasible because targets receive signals from different anchors and extract their transmission times at different reception times, as well as at varying positions. Traditional TDOA estimation schemes implicitly assume that the target remains stationary during the measurement period, which is impractical for mobile targets exhibiting high dynamics. Existing methods for mobile target localization are mostly specialized and rely on motion modeling and do not rely on the concurrent TDOA measurements. This issue limits their direct use of the well-established classical TDOA-based localization methods and complicating the entire localization process. In this paper, to obtain concurrent TDOA estimates at any instant out of the sequential measurements for direct use of existing TDOA-based localization methods, we propose a novel TDOA estimation method, termed parameterized TDOA (P-TDOA). By approximating the time-varying TDOA as a polynomial function over a short period, we transform the TDOA estimation problem into a model parameter estimation problem and derive the desired TDOA estimates thereafter. Theoretical analysis shows that, under certain conditions, the proposed P-TDOA method closely approaches the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for TDOA estimation in concurrent measurement scenarios, despite measurements being obtained sequentially. Extensive numerical simulations validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, highlighting substantial improvements over existing approaches across various scenarios.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents detailed radio propagation measurements for an indoor factory (InF) environment at 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz using a 1 GHz bandwidth channel sounder. Conducted at the NYU MakerSpace in the NYU Tandon School of Engineering campus in Brooklyn, NY, USA, our measurement campaign characterizes the radio propagation in a representative small factory with diverse machinery and open workspaces across 12 locations, comprising 5 line-of-sight (LOS) and 7 non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. Analysis using the close-in (CI) free space path loss (FSPL) model with a 1 m reference distance reveals path loss exponents (PLE) below 2 in LOS at 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz, while in NLOS, PLE is similar to free-space propagation (e.g., PLE = 2). The RMS delay spread (DS) decreases at higher frequencies with a clear frequency dependence. Also, measurements show a wider RMS angular spread (AS) in NLOS compared to LOS at both frequency bands, with a decreasing trend as frequency increases. These observations in a dense-scatterer factory environment demonstrate frequency-dependent behavior that differs from existing industry-standard 3GPP models. Our findings provide crucial insights into complex propagation mechanisms in factory environments, essential for designing robust air interface and industrial wireless networks at the upper mid-band FR3 spectrum.</description>

      <title>Generalized Scattering Matrix of Antenna: Moment Solution, Compression Storage and Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a computation method of generalized scattering matrix (GSM) based on integral equations and the method of moments (MoM), specifically designed for antennas excited through waveguide ports. By leveraging two distinct formulations -- magnetic-type and electric-type integral equations -- we establish concise algebraic relations linking the GSM directly to the impedance matrices obtained from MoM. To address practical challenges in storing GSM data across wide frequency bands and multiple antenna scenarios, we propose a efficient compression scheme. This approach alleviates memory demands by selectively storing the dominant eigencomponents that govern scattering behavior. Numerical validation examples confirm the accuracy of our method by comparisons with full-wave simulation results. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient iterative procedure to predict antenna array performance, highlighting remarkable improvements in computational speed compared to conventional numerical methods. These results collectively demonstrate the GSM framework's strong potential for antenna-array design processes.</description>

      <title>Joint Transmit and Pinching Beamforming for Pinching Antenna Systems (PASS): Optimization-Based or Learning-Based?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel pinching antenna system (PASS)-enabled downlink multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) framework is proposed. PASS consists of multiple waveguides spanning over thousands of wavelength, which equip numerous low-cost dielectric particles, named pinching antennas (PAs), to radiate signals into free space. The positions of PAs can be reconfigured to change both the large-scale path losses and phases of signals, thus facilitating the novel pinching beamforming design. A sum rate maximization problem is formulated, which jointly optimizes the transmit and pinching beamforming to adaptively achieve constructive signal enhancement and destructive interference mitigation. To solve this highly coupled and nonconvex problem, both optimization-based and learning-based methods are proposed. 1) For the optimization-based method, a majorization-minimization and penalty dual decomposition (MM-PDD) algorithm is developed, which handles the nonconvex complex exponential component using a Lipschitz surrogate function and then invokes PDD for problem decoupling. 2) For the learning-based method, a novel Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)-guided dual learning (KDL) approach is proposed, which enables KKT solutions to be reconstructed in a data-driven manner by learning dual variables. Following this idea, a KDL-Tranformer algorithm is developed, which captures both inter-PA/inter-user dependencies and channel-state-information (CSI)-beamforming dependencies by attention mechanisms. Simulation results demonstrate that: i) The proposed PASS framework significantly outperforms conventional massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system even with a few PAs. ii) The proposed KDL-Transformer can improve over 30% system performance than MM-PDD algorithm, while achieving a millisecond-level response on modern GPUs.</description>

      <title>Survival Analysis with Machine Learning for Predicting Li-ion Battery Remaining Useful Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13558v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accurate prediction of RUL for lithium-ion batteries is crucial for enhancing the reliability and longevity of energy storage systems. Traditional methods for RUL prediction often struggle with issues such as data sparsity, varying battery chemistries, and the inability to capture complex degradation patterns over time. In this study, we propose a survival analysis-based framework combined with deep learning models to predict the RUL of lithium-ion batteries. Specifically, we utilize five advanced models: the Cox-type models (Cox, CoxPH, and CoxTime) and two machine-learning-based models (DeepHit and MTLR). These models address the challenges of accurate RUL estimation by transforming raw time-series battery data into survival data, including key degradation indicators such as voltage, current, and internal resistance. Advanced feature extraction techniques enhance the model's robustness in diverse real-world scenarios, including varying charging conditions and battery chemistries. Our models are tested using 10-fold cross-validation, ensuring generalizability and minimizing overfitting. Experimental results show that our survival-based framework significantly improves RUL prediction accuracy compared to traditional methods, providing a reliable tool for battery management and maintenance optimization. This study contributes to the advancement of predictive maintenance in battery technology, offering valuable insights for both researchers and industry practitioners aiming to enhance the operational lifespan of lithium-ion batteries.</description>

      <title>Removing Structured Noise with Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.05290v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving ill-posed inverse problems requires careful formulation of prior beliefs over the signals of interest and an accurate description of their manifestation into noisy measurements. Handcrafted signal priors based on e.g. sparsity are increasingly replaced by data-driven deep generative models, and several groups have recently shown that state-of-the-art score-based diffusion models yield particularly strong performance and flexibility. In this paper, we show that the powerful paradigm of posterior sampling with diffusion models can be extended to include rich, structured, noise models. To that end, we propose a joint conditional reverse diffusion process with learned scores for the noise and signal-generating distribution. We demonstrate strong performance gains across various inverse problems with structured noise, outperforming competitive baselines that use normalizing flows and adversarial networks. This opens up new opportunities and relevant practical applications of diffusion modeling for inverse problems in the context of non-Gaussian measurement models.</description>

      <title>Distributed Bayesian Estimation in Sensor Networks: Consensus on Marginal Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01227v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to design and analyze distributed Bayesian estimation algorithms for sensor networks. The challenges we address are to (i) derive a distributed provably-correct algorithm in the functional space of probability distributions over continuous variables, and (ii) leverage these results to obtain new distributed estimators restricted to subsets of variables observed by individual agents. This relates to applications such as cooperative localization and federated learning, where the data collected at any agent depends on a subset of all variables of interest. We present Bayesian density estimation algorithms using data from non-linear likelihoods at agents in centralized, distributed, and marginal distributed settings. After setting up a distributed estimation objective, we prove almost-sure convergence to the optimal set of pdfs at each agent. Then, we prove the same for a storage-aware algorithm estimating densities only over relevant variables at each agent. Finally, we present a Gaussian version of these algorithms and implement it in a mapping problem using variational inference to handle non-linear likelihood models associated with LiDAR sensing.</description>

      <title>SuperM2M: Supervised and Mixture-to-Mixture Co-Learning for Speech Enhancement and Noise-Robust ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10271v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The current dominant approach for neural speech enhancement is based on supervised learning by using simulated training data. The trained models, however, often exhibit limited generalizability to real-recorded data. To address this, this paper investigates training enhancement models directly on real target-domain data. We propose to adapt mixture-to-mixture (M2M) training, originally designed for speaker separation, for speech enhancement, by modeling multi-source noise signals as a single, combined source. In addition, we propose a co-learning algorithm that improves M2M with the help of supervised algorithms. When paired close-talk and far-field mixtures are available for training, M2M realizes speech enhancement by training a deep neural network (DNN) to produce speech and noise estimates in a way such that they can be linearly filtered to reconstruct the close-talk and far-field mixtures. This way, the DNN can be trained directly on real mixtures, and can leverage close-talk and far-field mixtures as a weak supervision to enhance far-field mixtures. To improve M2M, we combine it with supervised approaches to co-train the DNN, where mini-batches of real close-talk and far-field mixture pairs and mini-batches of simulated mixture and clean speech pairs are alternately fed to the DNN, and the loss functions are respectively (a) the mixture reconstruction loss on the real close-talk and far-field mixtures and (b) the regular enhancement loss on the simulated clean speech and noise. We find that, this way, the DNN can learn from real and simulated data to achieve better generalization to real data. We name this algorithm SuperM2M (supervised and mixture-to-mixture co-learning). Evaluation results on the CHiME-4 dataset show its effectiveness and potential.</description>

      <title>Ice-Filling: Near-Optimal Channel Estimation for Dense Array Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06806v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By deploying a large number of antennas with sub-half-wavelength spacing in a compact space, dense array systems (DASs) can fully unleash the multiplexing and diversity gains of limited apertures. To acquire these gains, accurate channel state information acquisition is necessary but challenging due to the large antenna numbers. To overcome this obstacle, this paper reveals that designing the observation matrix to exploit the high spatial correlation of DAS channels is crucial for realizing near-optimal Bayesian channel estimation. Specifically, we prove that the observation matrix design for channel estimation is equivalent to a time-domain duality of point-to-point multiple-input multiple-output precoding, except for the change in the total power constraint on the precoding matrix to the pilot-wise discrete power constraint on the observation matrix. Inspired by Bayesian regression, a novel ice-filling algorithm is proposed to design amplitude-and-phase controllable observation matrices, and a majorization-minimization algorithm is proposed to address the phase-only controllable case. Particularly, we prove that the ice-filling algorithm can be interpreted as a ``quantized" water-filling algorithm, wherein the latter's continuous power-allocation process is converted into the former's discrete pilot-assignment process. To support the near-optimality of the proposed designs, we provide comprehensive analyses on the achievable mean square errors and their asymptotic expressions. Finally, numerical results confirm that our proposed designs achieve the near-optimal channel estimation performance and outperform existing approaches significantly.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Climate Change Impacts on Renewable Energy Generation: A Super-Resolution Recurrent Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Driven by global climate change and the ongoing energy transition, the coupling between power supply capabilities and meteorological factors has become increasingly significant. Over the long term, accurately quantifying the power generation of renewable energy under the influence of climate change is essential for the development of sustainable power systems. However, due to interdisciplinary differences in data requirements, climate data often lacks the necessary hourly resolution to capture the short-term variability and uncertainties of renewable energy resources. To address this limitation, a super-resolution recurrent diffusion model (SRDM) has been developed to enhance the temporal resolution of climate data and model the short-term uncertainty. The SRDM incorporates a pre-trained decoder and a denoising network, that generates long-term, high-resolution climate data through a recurrent coupling mechanism. The high-resolution climate data is then converted into power value using the mechanism model, enabling the simulation of wind and photovoltaic (PV) power generation on future long-term scales. Case studies were conducted in the Ejina region of Inner Mongolia, China, using fifth-generation reanalysis (ERA5) and coupled model intercomparison project (CMIP6) data under two climate pathways: SSP126 and SSP585. The results demonstrate that the SRDM outperforms existing generative models in generating super-resolution climate data. Furthermore, the research highlights the estimation biases introduced when low-resolution climate data is used for power conversion.</description>
