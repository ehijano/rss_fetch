      <title>Nanomechanics of Shear Rate-Dependent Stiffening in Micellar Electrically Conductive Polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrically conducting polymers with mechanical adaptability are essential for flexible electronics, yet most suffer structural degradation under rapid deformation. In this study, multiscale coarse-grained (MSCG) simulations are used to uncover the nanoscale origins of an unusual strain-rate-dependent stiffening in a poly(2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid) (PAMPSA)-polyaniline (PANI) blend. The self-assembled morphology consists of semi-crystalline PANI-rich micellar cores dispersed in a soft, viscoelastic PAMPSA matrix. At low shear rates, micelles migrate and coalesce into larger aggregates, enhancing local crystallinity and transient entanglement density while dissipating stress through matrix deformation. At high shear rates, micelles cannot reorganize quickly enough, leading to core dissociation and the emergence of highly aligned PANI filaments that directly bear the load, with PAMPSA serving as a weak but extended support phase. These contrasting regimes (densification-driven local alignment versus dissociation-driven global alignment) enable reversible mechanical stiffening across three orders of magnitude in shear rate. The results provide a molecular-level framework for designing solid-state polymers with tunable, rate-adaptive mechanical properties.</description>

      <title>Plastic or Viscous? A Reappraisal of Yielding in Soft Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many soft jammed materials, such as pastes, gels, concentrated emulsions, and suspensions, possess a threshold stress, known as yield stress, that must be exceeded to cause permanent deformation or flow. In rheology, the term plastic flow is commonly used to describe continuous flow (unbounded increase in strain with time) that a material undergoes above a yield stress threshold. However, in solid mechanics, plasticity refers to irreversible but finite, rate-independent deformation (strain that does not evolve with time). In addition, many soft materials exhibit viscosity bifurcation, a prominent thixotropic signature, which further complicates the definition and interpretation of yield stress. The threshold stress at which viscosity bifurcation occurs is also termed a yield stress, even though deformation below this threshold is not purely elastic, while above this threshold, the material flows homogeneously with a constant shear rate. This paper revisits these critical issues by analyzing the rheological and solid mechanics perspectives on plasticity. The insights presented here are intended to address certain terminological ambiguities for interpreting flow in soft jammed materials.</description>

      <title>Phase behaviour and defect structure of soft rods on a sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using particle-resolved molecular-dynamics simulations, we compute the phase diagram for soft repulsive spherocylinders confined on the surface of a sphere. While crystal (K), smectic (Sm), and isotropic (I) phases exhibit a stability region for any aspect ratio of the spherocylinders, a nematic phase emerges only beyond a critical aspect ratio lying between 6.0 and 7.0. As required by the topology of the confining sphere, the ordered phases exhibit a total orientational defect charge of +2. In detail, the crystal and smectic phases exhibit two +1 defects at the poles, whereas the nematic phase features four +1/2 defects which are connected along a great circle. For aspect ratios above the critical value, lowering the packing fraction drives a sequence of transitions: the crystal melts into a smectic phase, which then transforms into a nematic through the splitting of the +1 defects into pairs of +1/2 defects that progressively move apart, thereby increasing their angular separation. Eventually, at very low densities, orientational fluctuations stabilize an isotropic phase. Our simulations data can be experimentally verified in Pickering emulsions and are relevant to understand the morphogenesis in epithelial tissues.</description>

      <title>Domain Growth and Aging in a Phase Separating Binary Fluid Confined Inside a Nanopore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrodynamics is known to have strong effects on the kinetics of phase separation. There exist open questions on how such effects manifest in systems under confinement. Here, we have undertaken extensive studies of the kinetics of phase separation in a two-component fluid that is confined inside pores of cylindrical shape. Using a hydrodynamics-preserving thermostat, we carry out molecular dynamics simulations to obtain results for domain growth and aging for varying temperature and pore-width. We find that all systems freeze into a morphology where stripes of regions rich in one or the other component of the mixture coexist in a locked situation. Our analysis suggests that, irrespective of the temperature the growth of the average domain size, $\ell(t)$, prior to the freezing into stripped patterns, follows the power law $\ell(t)\sim t^{2/3}$, suggesting an inertial hydrodynamic growth, which typically is applicable for bulk fluids only in the asymptotic limit. Similarly, the aging dynamics, probed by the two-time order-parameter autocorrelation function, also exhibits a temperature-independent power-law scaling with an exponent $\lambda \simeq 2.55$, much smaller than what is observed for a bulk fluid.</description>

      <title>Salt crystallization and deliquescence triggered by humidity cycles in nanopores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the response of materials with nanoscale pores containing sodium chloride solutions, to cycles of relative humidity (RH). Compared to pure fluids, we show that these sorption isotherms display much wider hysteresis, with a shape determined by salt crystallization and deliquescence rather than capillary condensation and Kelvin evaporation. Both deliquescence and crystallization are significantly shifted compared to the bulk and occur at unusually low RH. We systematically analyze the effect of pore size and salt amount, and rationalize our findings using confined thermodynamics, osmotic effects and classical nucleation theory.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions of Oscillating Droplets on Horizontally Vibrating Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Droplet deformations caused by substrate vibrations are ubiquitous in nature and highly relevant for applications such as microreactors and single-cell sorting. The vibrations can induce droplet oscillations, a fundamental process that requires an in-depth understanding. Here, we report on extensive many-body dissipative particle dynamics simulations carried out to study the oscillations of droplets of different liquids on horizontally vibrating substrates, covering a wide range of vibration frequencies and amplitudes as well as substrate wettability. We categorize the phases observed for different parameter sets based on the capillary number and identify the transitions between the observed oscillation phases, which are characterized by means of suitable parameters, such as the angular momentum and vorticity of the droplet. The instability growth rate for oscillation phase II, which leads to highly asymmetric oscillations and eventual droplet breakup, is also determined. Finally, we characterize the state of the droplet for the various scenarios by means of the particle-particle and particle-substrate contacts. We find a steady-state scenario for phase I, metastable breathing modes for phase II, and an out-of-equilibrium state for phase III. Thus, we anticipate that this study provides much needed insights into a fundamental phenomenon in nature with significant relevance for applications.</description>

      <title>Extreme breakdown of the Einstein relation in liquid water under centrifugation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present evidence that the Einstein relation (ER) breaks down completely in pure water and dilute aqueous solutions under strong centrifugation fields at 40 oC. Isotopologues (e.g., H2O-18) and solutes migrate at a speed of only 5% of that predicted based on the ER. The ER is restored with the addition of solutes above a transition concentration (ct). We further discovered a new scaling law between the solute's partial molar density, the centrifugal acceleration, and ct, which can be quantitatively described by a two-phase model in analog to the Avrami model for phase transformation. The breakdown may stem from long-range dipole interactions or the hydrogen bond network in water, which are disrupted by the presence of solutes. This report shows that studying transport under centrifugation can be a new strategy to understand fundamental transport properties and complex interactions in liquids.</description>

      <title>Poroelasticity in the presence of active fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a model for characterizing porous, deformable media embedded with magnetorheological fluids (MRFs). These active fluids exhibit tunable mechanical and rheological properties that can be controlled through the application of a magnetic field, which induces a phase transition from a liquid to a solid-like state. This transition profoundly affects both stress transmission and fluid flow within the composite, leading to a behaviour governed by a well-defined threshold that depends on the ratio between the pore size and the characteristic size of clusters of magnetic particles, and can be triggered by adjusting the magnetic field intensity. These effects were confirmed through an experimental campaign conducted on a prototype composite obtained by imbibing a selected MRF into commercial sponges. To design and optimize this new class of materials, a linear poroelastic formulation is proposed and validated through comparison with experimental results. The constitutive relationships, i.e. overall elastic constitutive tensor and permeability, of the model are updated from phenomenological observations, exploiting the experimental data obtained for both the pure fluid and the composite material. The findings demonstrate that the proposed simplified formulation is sufficiently robust to predict and optimize the behaviour of porous media containing MRFs. Such materials hold significant promise for a wide range of engineering applications, including adaptive exosuits for human tissue and joint rehabilitation, as well as innovative structural systems.</description>

      <title>Local ion environment in polyamide membranes revealed by molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF) membranes, the polymer structure and interactions with solvent and solutes dictate the permeability and selectivity. However, these interactions have not been fully characterized within hydrated polymer membranes. In this study, we elucidate the local atomic neighborhood around ions within a RO membrane using molecular dynamics (MD). We built a MD model of a RO membrane closely following experimental synthesis and performed long time scale simulations of ions moving within the polymer. We find that the ion-oxygen nearest neighbor distance within the membrane is essentially the same as in solution, indicating that ions coordinate similarly in the confined membrane as in water. However, we do find that the average coordination number decreases in the polymer, which we attribute primarily to shifting the outer portion of the solvation shell beyond the cutoff, rather than being entirely stripped away. We find that cations bind tightly to both the carboxylate and amide oxygen atoms within the membrane. Even in ionized membranes, binding to amide oxygen atoms appears to play a substantial role in hindering ion mobility. Finally, we find that commonly used measures of ionic solvation structure such as coordination numbers do not fully capture the solvation structure, and we explore other measures such as the chemical composition of the nearest neighbors and the radial distribution function.</description>

      <title>How Do Proteins Fold?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How proteins fold remains a central unsolved problem in biology. While the idea of a folding code embedded in the amino acid sequence was introduced more than 6 decades ago, this code remains undefined. While we now have powerful predictive tools to predict the final native structure of proteins, we still lack a predictive framework for how sequences dictate folding pathways. Two main conceptual models dominate as explanations of folding mechanism: the funnel model, in which folding proceeds through many alternative routes on a rugged, hyperdimensional energy landscape; and the foldon model, which proposes a hierarchical sequence of discrete intermediates. Recent advances on two fronts are now enabling folding studies in unprecedented ways. Powerful experimental approaches; in particular, single-molecule force spectroscopy and hydrogen (deuterium exchange assays) allow time-resolved tracking of the folding process at high resolution. At the same time, computational breakthroughs culminating in algorithms such as AlphaFold have revolutionized static structure prediction, opening opportunities to extend machine learning toward dynamics. Together, these developments mark a turning point: for the first time, we are positioned to resolve how proteins fold, why they misfold, and how this knowledge can be harnessed for biology and medicine.</description>

      <title>Reaction/Diffusion Competition Drives Anomalous Relaxation of Vitrimers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19496v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since their discovery in 2011, vitrimers - covalent associative network polymers - have challenged the traditional understanding of soft matter relaxation dynamics: unlike in typical glass-forming liquids, vitrimers' viscous relaxation can be entirely decoupled from their underlying structural (segmental) dynamics. Beyond this fundamental mystery, the origin of vitrimers' Arrhenius viscosity in the presence of super-Arrhenius structural relaxation behavior has been of high interest due to vitrimers' potential to provide readily reprocessable high-performance plastics. Here, we combine simulations, theory, and experiments to establish a foundational understanding of vitrimer relaxation dynamics. We identify two types of transient networks based on the ratio of atomic displacement scales required for bond exchange to those required to relax a segment. In systems where bond exchange only requires sub-segmental motion, we show that network relaxation is governed by a competition between chemical exchange reactions and segmental diffusion. This competition produces vitrimers' signature network/segment decoupling, while also driving a crossover between Arrhenius and super-Arrhenius behavior that is observed for many vitrimers. This work provides an explanation for longstanding puzzling features of vitrimer dynamics and establishes a foundation for rational vitrimer design.</description>

      <title>Diffusioosmotic corner flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study flows generated within a two-dimensional corner by the chemical activity of the confining boundaries. Catalytic reactions at the surfaces induce diffusioosmotic motion of the viscous fluid throughout the domain. The presence of chemically active sectors can give rise to steady eddies reminiscent of classical Moffatt vortices, which are mechanically induced in similar confined geometries. In our approach, an exact analytical solution of the diffusion problem in a wedge geometry is derived and coupled to the diffusioosmotic slip-velocity formulation, yielding the stream function of associated Stokes flow. In selected limiting cases, simple closed-form expressions provide clear physical insight into the underlying mechanisms. Our results open new perspectives for the design of microscale mixing strategies in dead-end pores and cornered microfluidic channels, and offer benchmarks for numerical simulations of confined (diffusio)osmotic systems.</description>
