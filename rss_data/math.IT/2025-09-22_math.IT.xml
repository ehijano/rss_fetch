      <title>Similarity as Thermodynamic Work: Between Depth and Diversity -- from Information Distance to Ugly Duckling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defining similarity is a fundamental challenge in information science. Watanabe's Ugly Duckling Theorem highlights diversity, while algorithmic information theory emphasizes depth through Information Distance. We propose a statistical-mechanical framework that treats program length as energy, with a temperature parameter unifying these two aspects: in the low-temperature limit, similarity approaches Information Distance; in the high-temperature limit, it recovers the indiscriminability of the Ugly Duckling theorem; and at the critical point, it coincides with the Solomonoff prior. We refine the statistical-mechanical framework by introducing regular universal machines and effective degeneracy ratios, allowing us to separate redundant from core diversity. This refinement yields new tools for analyzing similarity and opens perspectives for information distance, model selection, and non-equilibrium extensions.</description>

      <title>Sparse Regression LDPC Codes for the Block-Fading Non-Coherent SIMO Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse regression codes (SPARCs) are a class of codes that encode information through the superposition of columns of a randomised coding matrix. The combination with an outer non-binary low density parity check (NB-LDPC) code was recently shown to improve the finite-length performance of these codes over the unfaded AWGN channel. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity approximate message passing (AMP) decoder that is capable of decoding NB-LDPC encoded SPARCs on a Rayleigh fading channel with multiple receive antennas. Notably, the decoder does not require channel state information (CSI), i.e., it is fully non-coherent, but achieves the same error probability as a decoder with full CSI, even for moderate block lengths. This is achieved by iteratively re-estimating the channel throughout the decoding iterations. In addition, we provide a rigorous asymptotic analysis of both the block error probability and the channel estimation error. Numerical results confirm the precision of the analysis and show that the presented coding scheme performs within 1.5 dB of the outage capacity and is competitive with coded modulation schemes employing standardised LDPC codes for 5G cellular networks and pilot-based channel estimation.</description>

      <title>Code distances: a new family of invariants of linear codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce code distances, a new family of invariants for linear codes. We establish some properties and prove bounds on the code distances, and show that they are not invariants of the matroid (for a linear block code) or $q$-polymatroid (for a rank-metric code) associated to the code. By means of examples, we show that the code distances allow us to distinguish some inequivalent MDS or MRD codes with the same parameters. We also show that no duality holds, i.e., the sequence of code distances of a code does not determine the sequence of code distances of its dual. Further, we define a greedy and an asymptotic version of code distances. Finally, we relate these invariants to other invariants of linear codes, such as the maximality degree, the covering radius, and the partial distances of polar codes.</description>

      <title>Holographic Multi-User Multi-Stream Beamforming Maintaining Rate-Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first investigation into the transmission of multi-stream information from a base station equipped with reconfigurable holographic surfaces (RHS) to multiple users with the aid of multi-antenna arrays. Building upon this, we propose the joint design of RHS and baseband beamformers that enables multi-stream delivery at fair rates across all users. Specifically, we first introduce a max-min rate optimization approach, which aims for maximizing the minimum rate for all users through iterative solutions of quadratic problems. To reduce complexity, we then propose a surrogate-based optimization approach that offers a low-complexity design alternative relying on closed-form updates. Our simulations show that the surrogate-based approach achieves nearly the same minimum rate as max-min optimization, while delivering sum-rates comparable to those of sum-rate maximization, overcoming the rate-fairness deficiency typical of the latter.</description>

      <title>A New Class of Analog Precoding for Multi-Antenna Multi-User Communications over High-Frequency Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A network relying on a large antenna-array-aided base station is designed for delivering multiple information streams to multi-antenna users over high-frequency bands such as the millimeter-wave and sub-Terahertz bands. The state-of-the-art analog precoder (AP) dissipates excessive circuit power due to its reliance on a large number of phase shifters. To mitigate the power consumption, we propose a novel AP relying on a controlled number of phase shifters. Within this new AP framework, we design a hybrid precoder (HP) for maximizing the users' minimum throughput, which poses a computationally challenging problem of large-scale, nonsmooth mixed discrete-continuous log-determinant optimization. To tackle this challenge, we develop an algorithm which iterates through solving convex problems to generate a sequence of HPs that converges to the max-min solution. We also introduce a new framework of smooth optimization termed soft max-min throughput optimization. Additionally, we develop another algorithm, which iterates by evaluating closed-form expressions to generate a sequence of HPs that converges to the soft max-min solution. Simulation results reveal that the HP soft max-min solution approaches the Pareto-optimal solution constructed for simultaneously optimizing both the minimum throughput and sum-throughput. Explicitly, it achieves a minimum throughput similar to directly maximizing the users' minimum throughput and it also attains a sum-throughput similar to directly maximizing the sum-throughput.</description>

      <title>Further results on bent partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bent partitions of $V_{n}^{(p)}$ play an important role in constructing (vectorial) bent functions, partial difference sets, and association schemes, where $V_{n}^{(p)}$ denotes an $n$-dimensional vector space over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{p}$, $n$ is an even positive integer, and $p$ is a prime. For bent partitions, there remains a challenging open problem: Whether the depth of any bent partition of $V_{n}^{(p)}$ is always a power of $p$. Notably, the depths of all current known bent partitions of $V_{n}^{(p)}$ are powers of $p$. In this paper, we prove that for a bent partition $\Gamma$ of $V_{n}^{(p)}$ for which all the $p$-ary bent functions generated by $\Gamma$ are regular or all are weakly regular but not regular, the depth of $\Gamma$ must be a power of $p$. We present new constructions of bent partitions that (do not) correspond to vectorial dual-bent functions. In particular, a new construction of vectorial dual-bent functions is provided. Additionally, for general bent partitions of $V_{n}^{(2)}$, we establish a characterization in terms of Hadamard matrices.</description>

      <title>Communication over LQG Control Systems: A Convex Optimization Approach to Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study communication over control systems, where a controller-encoder selects inputs to a dynamical system in order to simultaneously regulate the system and convey a message to an observer that has access to the system's output measurements. This setup reflects implicit communication, as the controller embeds a message in the control signal. The capacity of a control system is the maximal reliable rate of the embedded message subject to a closed-loop control-cost constraint. We focus on linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control systems, in which the dynamical system is given by a state-space model with Gaussian noise, and the control cost is a quadratic function of the system inputs and system states. Our main result is a convex optimization upper bound on the capacity of LQG systems. In the case of scalar systems, we prove that the upper bound yields the exact LQG system capacity. The upper bound also recovers all known results, including LQG control, feedback capacity of Gaussian channels with memory, and the LQG system capacity with a state-feedback. For vector LQG control systems, we provide a sufficient condition for tightness of the upper bound, based on the Riccati equation. Numerical simulations indicate the upper bound tightness in all tested examples, suggesting that the upper bound may be equal to the LQG system capacity in the vector case as well.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Mechanisms of Human Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning underlies nearly all human behavior and is central to education and education reform. Although recent advances in neuroscience have revealed the fundamental structure of learning processes, these insights have yet to be integrated into research and practice. Specifically, neuroscience has found that decision-making is governed by a structured process of perception, action-selection, and execution, supported by multiple neural systems with distinct memory stores and learning mechanisms. These systems extract different types of information (categorical, predictive, structural, and sequential) challenging canonical models of memory used in learning and behavioral science research by providing a mechanistic account of how humans acquire and use knowledge. Because each system learns differently, effective teaching requires alignment with system-specific processes. We propose a unified model that integrates these neuroscientific insights, bridging basic mechanisms with outcomes in education, identity, belonging, and wellbeing. By translating first principles of neural information processing into a generalizable framework, this work advances theories of skill acquisition and transfer while establishing a foundation for interdisciplinary research to refine how learning is understood and supported across domains of human behavior.</description>

      <title>Symbol Detection in Inter-Symbol Interference Channels using Expectation Propagation with Channel Shortening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iterative message passing detection based on expectation propagation(EP) has demonstrated near-optimum performance in many signal processing and communication scenarios. The method remains feasible even for channel impulse responses (CIRs), where the optimal Bahl-Cocke-Jelinek-Raviv (BCJR) detector is infeasible. However, significant performance degradation occurs for channels with strong inter-symbol interference (ISI), where the initial linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimate is inaccurate. We propose an EP-based detector that operates in a transformed signal space obtained by channel shortening. Specifically, instead of the conventional approach that iterates between an LMMSE estimator and a non-linear symbol-wise demapper, the proposed method iterates between a linear channel shortening filter-based estimator and a nonlinear BCJR detector with reduced memory compared to the actual channel. Additionally, we propose a deliberate mismatch between the initialized messages and the initialized covariance used in the linear estimator in the first iteration for faster convergence. The proposed approach is evaluated for the well-known Proakis-C ISI channel and for CIRs from a wireless measurement campaign. We demonstrate improvements of up to 6dB at 2 bits per channel use and an improved performance-complexity trade-off over conventional EP-based detection.</description>

      <title>Quickest Change Detection in Continuous-Time in Presence of a Covert Adversary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of covert quickest change detection in a continuous-time setting, where a Brownian motion experiences a drift change at an unknown time. Unlike classical formulations, we consider a covert adversary who adjusts the post-change drift $\mu = \mu(\gamma)$ as a function of the false alarm constraint parameter $\gamma$, with the goal of remaining undetected for as long as possible. Leveraging the exact expressions for the average detection delay (ADD) and average time to false alarm (AT2FA) known for the continuous-time CuSum procedure, we rigorously analyze how the asymptotic behavior of ADD evolves as $\mu(\gamma) \to 0$ with increasing $\gamma$. Our results reveal that classical detection delay characterizations no longer hold in this regime. We derive sharp asymptotic expressions for the ADD under various convergence rates of $\mu(\gamma)$, identify precise conditions for maintaining covertness, and characterize the total damage inflicted by the adversary. We show that the adversary achieves maximal damage when the drift scales as $\mu(\gamma) = \Theta(1/\sqrt{\gamma})$, marking a fundamental trade-off between stealth and impact in continuous-time detection systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical communication over a quantum multiple access channel (MAC) is considered. Since the no-cloning prohibits universal copying of arbitrary quantum states, classical feedback is generated through measurement. An achievable rate region is derived using superposition block Markov coding and a quantum multiparty lemma for the analysis. Our region generalizes both the classical Cover-Leung region and the generalized feedback region. As an example, we show that the quantum binary adder MAC can benefit from feedback.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a manifold $\mathcal{M} \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, we consider all subsets of $\mathcal{M}$ that satisfy the generalized Stokes' theorem and show that $\partial\mathcal{M}$ maximizes the associated information theoretic entropy functional. This provides an information theoretic characterization of the duality expressed by Stokes' theorem, whereby the boundary of a manifold is the `least informative' subset of the manifold satisfying the Stokes relation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subspace tracking is a fundamental problem in signal processing, where the goal is to estimate and track the underlying subspace that spans a sequence of data streams over time. In high-dimensional settings, data samples are often corrupted by non-Gaussian noises and may exhibit sparsity. This paper explores the alpha divergence for sparse subspace estimation and tracking, offering robustness to data corruption. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art robust subspace tracking methods while achieving a low computational complexity and memory storage. Several experiments are conducted to demonstrate its effectiveness in robust subspace tracking and direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Channel Estimation with ELAA Modular Arrays Under Hardware Impairments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs) enable high spatial resolution and multiplexing, especially for user equipments (UEs) in the radiative near-field. To reduce hardware cost, modular ELAA architectures with distributed baseband units (BBUs) are gaining traction. This paper addresses near-field line-of-sight (LOS) channel estimation under low noise amplifier (LNA)-induced hardware impairments in such modular systems. We propose computationally efficient estimators that exploit the array geometry and constant-modulus structure of near-field LOS channels, including a novel two-dimensional (2D) discrete Fourier transform (DFT) masking technique that improves estimation accuracy and significantly reduces fronthaul signaling. Numerical results show that the proposed methods significantly outperform the conventional least squares (LS) method.</description>

      <title>6DMA-Assisted Secure Wireless Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) has been widely studied for capacity enhancement, but its potential for physical layer security (PLS) remains largely unexplored. By adjusting both three-dimensional (3D) positions and 3D rotations of distributed antenna surfaces, 6DMA can increase spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs). The extra DoFs enable dynamic shaping of legitimate channels and suppresses eavesdropping channels, thereby offering unique advantages in enhancing secrecy performance. Motivated by this, this letter proposes a novel 6DMA-assisted secure wireless communication system, where the base station (BS) is equipped with 6DMA to enhance secrecy performance. Specifically, to simultaneously serve multiple legitimate users and counter cooperative interception by multiple eavesdroppers (Eves), we formulate a sum secrecy rate (SSR) maximization problem by jointly optimizing the transmit and artificial noise (AN) beamformers, as well as the 3D positions and 3D rotations of antenna surfaces. To solve this non-convex problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm that decomposes the original problem into two subproblems and solves them iteratively to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate the superior secrecy performance over partially movable and conventional fixed-position antenna systems.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning in Near-Field Communication for 6G: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 6G wireless communication networks are expected to use extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs) to support higher throughput, massive connectivity, and improved system performance. ELAAs would fundamentally alter wave characteristics, transforming them from plane waves into spherical waves, thereby operating in the near field. Near-field communications (NFC) offer unique advantages to enhance system performance, but also present significant challenges in channel modeling, computational complexity, and beamforming design. The use of machine learning (ML) is emerging as a powerful approach to tackle such challenges and has the capabilities to enable intelligent, secure, and efficient 6G wireless communications. In this survey, we discuss ML-driven approaches for NFC. We first outline the fundamental concepts of NFC and ML. We then discuss ML applications in channel estimation, beamforming design, and security enhancement. We also highlight key challenges (e.g., data privacy and computational overhead). Finally, we discuss open issues and future directions to emphasize the role of advanced ML techniques in near-field system design.</description>

      <title>Randomized Space-Time Sampling for Affine Graph Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of dynamical sampling for graph signals influenced by a constant source term. We consider signals evolving over time according to a linear dynamical system on a graph, where both the initial state and the source term are bandlimited. We introduce two random space-time sampling regimes and analyze the conditions under which stable recovery is achievable. While our framework extends recent work on homogeneous dynamics, it addresses a fundamentally different setting where the evolution includes a constant source term. This results in a non-orthogonal-diagonalizable system matrix, rendering classical spectral techniques inapplicable and introducing new challenges in sampling design, stability analysis, and joint recovery of both the initial state and the forcing term. A key component of our analysis is the spectral graph weighted coherence, which characterizes the interplay between the sampling distribution and the graph structure. We establish sampling complexity bounds ensuring stable recovery via the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), and develop a robust recovery algorithm with provable error guarantees. The effectiveness of our method is validated through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Tomography for Tensor Networks in Two Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that for one-dimensional quantum states that can be effectively approximated by matrix product operators (MPOs), a polynomial number of copies of the state suffices for reconstruction. Compared to MPOs in one dimension, projected entangled-pair states (PEPSs) and projected entangled-pair operators (PEPOs), which represent typical low-dimensional structures in two dimensions, are more prevalent as a looped tensor network. However, a formal analysis of the sample complexity required for estimating PEPS or PEPO has yet to be established. In this paper, we aim to address this gap by providing theoretical guarantees for the stable recovery of PEPS and PEPO. Our analysis primarily focuses on two quantum measurement schemes: $(i)$ informationally complete positive operator valued measures (IC-POVMs), specifically the spherical $t$-designs ($t \geq 3$), and $(ii)$ projective rank-one measurements, in particular Haar random projective measurements. We first establish stable embeddings for PEPSs (or PEPOs) to ensure that the information contained in the states can be preserved under these two measurement schemes. We then show that a constrained least-squares estimator achieves stable recovery for PEPSs (or PEPOs), with the recovery error bounded when the number of state copies scales linearly under spherical $t$-designs and polynomially under Haar-random projective measurements with respect to the number of qudits. These results provide theoretical support for the reliable use of PEPS and PEPO in practical quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving State Estimation with Crowd Sensors: An Information-Theoretic Respective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Privacy-preserving state estimation for linear time-invariant dynamical systems with crowd sensors is considered. At any time step, the estimator has access to measurements from a randomly selected sensor from a pool of sensors with pre-specified models and noise profiles. A Luenberger-like observer is used to fuse the measurements with the underlying model of the system to recursively generate the state estimates. An additive privacy-preserving noise is used to constrain information leakage. Information leakage is measured via mutual information between the identity of the sensors and the state estimate conditioned on the actual state of the system. This captures an omnipotent adversary that not only can access state estimates but can also gather direct high-quality state measurements. Any prescribed level of information leakage is shown to be achievable by appropriately selecting the variance of the privacy-preserving noise. Therefore, privacy-utility trade-off can be fine-tuned.</description>

      <title>Empirical AI Ethics: Reconfiguring Ethics towards a Situated, Plural, and Transformative Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mainstream AI ethics, with its reliance on top-down, principle-driven frameworks, fails to account for the situated realities of diverse communities affected by AI (Artificial Intelligence). Critics have argued that AI ethics frequently serves corporate interests through practices of 'ethics washing', operating more as a tool for public relations than as a means of preventing harm or advancing the common good. As a result, growing scepticism among critical scholars has cast the field as complicit in sustaining harmful systems rather than challenging or transforming them. In response, this paper adopts a Science and Technology Studies (STS) perspective to critically interrogate the field of AI ethics. It hence applies the same analytic tools STS has long directed at disciplines such as biology, medicine, and statistics to ethics. This perspective reveals a core tension between vertical (top-down, principle-based) and horizontal (risk-mitigating, implementation-oriented) approaches to ethics. By tracing how these models have shaped the discourse, we show how both fall short in addressing the complexities of AI as a socio-technical assemblage, embedded in practice and entangled with power. To move beyond these limitations, we propose a threefold reorientation of AI ethics. First, we call for a shift in foundations: from top-down abstraction to empirical grounding. Second, we advocate for pluralisation: moving beyond Western-centric frameworks toward a multiplicity of onto-epistemic perspectives. Finally, we outline strategies for reconfiguring AI ethics as a transformative force, moving from narrow paradigms of risk mitigation toward co-creating technologies of hope.</description>

      <title>On the Variational Costs of Changing Our Minds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The human mind is capable of extraordinary achievements, yet it often appears to work against itself. It actively defends its cherished beliefs even in the face of contradictory evidence, conveniently interprets information to conform to desired narratives, and selectively searches for or avoids information to suit its various purposes. Despite these behaviours deviating from common normative standards for belief updating, we argue that such 'biases' are not inherently cognitive flaws, but rather an adaptive response to the significant pragmatic and cognitive costs associated with revising one's beliefs. This paper introduces a formal framework that aims to model the influence of these costs on our belief updating mechanisms.
  We treat belief updating as a motivated variational decision, where agents weigh the perceived 'utility' of a belief against the informational cost required to adopt a new belief state, quantified by the Kullback-Leibler divergence from the prior to the variational posterior. We perform computational experiments to demonstrate that simple instantiations of this resource-rational model can be used to qualitatively emulate commonplace human behaviours, including confirmation bias and attitude polarisation. In doing so, we suggest that this framework makes steps toward a more holistic account of the motivated Bayesian mechanics of belief change and provides practical insights for predicting, compensating for, and correcting deviations from desired belief updating processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01153v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A near-field integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) framework is proposed, which introduces an additional distance dimension for both sensing and communications compared to the conventional far-field system. In particular, the Cramer-Rao bound for the near-field joint distance and angle sensing is derived, which is minimized subject to the minimum communication rate requirement of each user. Both fully digital antennas and hybrid digital and analog antennas are investigated. For fully digital antennas, a globally optimal solution of the ISAC waveform is obtained via semidefinite relaxation. For hybrid antennas, a high-quality solution is obtained through two-stage optimization. Numerical results demonstrate the performance gain introduced by the additional distance dimension of the near-field ISAC over the far-field ISAC.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the problem of encoding data into an $(n, t)$-break-resilient code ($(n, t)$-BRC), i.e., a collections of sequences of length~$n$ from which the original data can be reconstructed even if they are adversarially broken at up to~$t$ arbitrary positions. We establish lower bounds on the redundancy of any $(n, t)$-BRC and present code constructions that meet these bounds up to asymptotically negligible terms. Interestingly, this problem shares similarities with the recently studied torn paper channel, which has emerged in the context of DNA data storage.</description>

      <title>Outer Channel of DNA-Based Data Storage: Capacity and Efficient Coding Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the outer channel for DNA-based data storage. When transmitting over the outer channel, each DNA string is treated as a unit/symbol that would be either correctly received, or erased, or corrupted by uniformly distributed random symbol substitution errors, and all strings are randomly shuffled with each other. We first derive the capacity of the outer channel, which implies that the uniformly distributed random symbol substitution errors are only as harmful as the erasure errors (for infinite-length non-binary random linear codes with near maximum likelihood decoding). Next, we propose practically efficient coding schemes which encode the bits at the same position of different strings into a codeword. We compute the soft/hard information of each bit, which allows us to independently decode the bits within a codeword, leading to an independent decoding scheme. To improve the decoding performance, we measure the reliability of each string based on the independent decoding result, and perform a further step of decoding over the most reliable strings, leading to a joint decoding scheme. Simulations with low-density parity-check codes confirm that the joint decoding scheme can reduce the frame error rate by more than 3 orders of magnitude compared to the independent decoding scheme, and it can outperform the state-of-the-art decoding scheme in the literature across a wide range of parameter regions.</description>

      <title>Alternating Subspace Method for Sparse Recovery of Signals</title>

Abstract: This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication. Copyright may be transferred without notice, after which this version may no longer be accessible.
  Numerous renowned algorithms for tackling the compressed sensing problem employ an alternating strategy, which typically involves data matching in one module and denoising in another. Based on an in-depth analysis of the connection between the message passing and operator splitting, we present a novel approach, the Alternating Subspace Method (ASM), which integrates the principles of the greedy methods (e.g., the orthogonal matching pursuit type methods) and the splitting methods (e.g., the approximate message passing type methods). Essentially, ASM enhances the splitting method by achieving fidelity in a subspace-restricted fashion. We reveal that such confining strategy still yields a consistent fixed point iteration and establish its local geometric convergence on the LASSO problem. Numerical experiments on the LASSO, channel estimation, and dynamic compressed sensing problems demonstrate its high convergence rate and its capacity to incorporate different prior distributions. Overall, the proposed method is promising in efficiency, accuracy and flexibility, which has the potential to be competitive in different sparse recovery applications.</description>

      <title>Error Correction Code Transformer: From Non-Unified to Unified</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03364v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Channel coding is vital for reliable data transmission in modern wireless systems, and its significance will increase with the emergence of sixth-generation (6G) networks, which will need to support various error correction codes. However, traditional decoders were typically designed as fixed hardware circuits tailored to specific decoding algorithms, leading to inefficiencies and limited flexibility. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a unified, code-agnostic Transformer-based decoding architecture capable of handling multiple linear block codes, including Polar, Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC), and Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH), within a single framework. To achieve this, standardized units are employed to harmonize parameters across different code types, while the redesigned unified attention module compresses the structural information of various codewords. Additionally, a sparse mask, derived from the sparsity of the parity-check matrix, is introduced to enhance the model's ability to capture inherent constraints between information and parity-check bits, resulting in improved decoding accuracy and robustness. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed unified Transformer-based decoder not only outperforms existing methods but also provides a flexible, efficient, and high-performance solution for next-generation wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Covariance-Based Device Activity Detection with Massive MIMO for Near-Field Correlated Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the device activity detection problem in a massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system for near-field communications (NFC). In this system, active devices transmit their signature sequences to the base station (BS), which detects the active devices based on the received signal. In this paper, we model the near-field channels as correlated Rician fading channels and formulate the device activity detection problem as a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem. Compared to the traditional uncorrelated channel model, the correlation of channels complicates both algorithm design and theoretical analysis of the MLE problem. On the algorithmic side, we present the classical exact coordinate descent (CD) algorithm for solving the MLE problem, which suffers from numerical instability when applied to correlated channels. We propose a computationally efficient inexact CD algorithm by approximating the objective function, which approximately solves the one-dimensional subproblem and improves both computational efficiency and numerical stability. Additionally, we analyze the detection performance of the MLE problem under correlated channels by comparing it with the case of uncorrelated channels. The analysis shows that when the overall number of devices $N$ is large or the signature sequence length $L$ is small, the detection performance of MLE under correlated channels tends to be better than that under uncorrelated channels. Conversely, when $N$ is small or $L$ is large, MLE performs better under uncorrelated channels than under correlated ones. Finally, we study the MLE model in the joint device activity and data detection context. Simulation results demonstrate the computational performance of the presented algorithms and verify the correctness of the analysis.</description>

      <title>Benford's Law from Turing Ensembles and Integer Partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16314v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop two complementary generative mechanisms that explain when and why Benford's first-digit law arises. First, a probabilistic Turing machine (PTM) ensemble induces a geometric law for code length. Maximizing its entropy under a constraint on halting length yields Benford statistics. This model shows a phase transition with respect to the halt probability. Second, a constrained partition model (Einstein-solid combinatorics) recovers the same logarithmic profile as the maximum-entropy solution under a coarse-grained entropy-rate constraint, clarifying the role of non-ergodicity (ensemble vs. trajectory averages). We also perform numerical experiments that corroborate our conclusions.</description>

      <title>Wireless Communication for Low-Altitude Economy with UAV Swarm Enabled Two-Level Movable Antenna System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is regarded as a key enabling platform for low-altitude economy, due to its advantages such as 3D maneuverability, flexible deployment, and LoS air-to-air/ground communication links. In particular, the intrinsic high mobility renders UAV especially suitable for operating as a movable antenna (MA) from the sky. In this paper, by exploiting the flexible mobility of UAV swarm and antenna position adjustment of MA, we propose a novel UAV swarm enabled two-level MA system, where UAVs not only individually deploy a local MA array, but also form a larger-scale MA system with their individual MA arrays via swarm coordination. We formulate a general optimization problem to maximize the minimum achievable rate over all ground user equipments (UEs), by jointly optimizing the 3D UAV swarm placement positions, their individual MAs' positions, and receive beamforming for different UEs. To gain useful insights, we first consider the special case where each UAV has only one antenna, under different scenarios of one single UE, two UEs, and arbitrary number of UEs. In particular, for the two-UE case, we derive the optimal UAV swarm placement positions in closed-form that achieves IUI-free communication when the uniform plane wave (UPW) model holds, where the UAV swarm forms a uniform sparse array (USA) satisfying minimum safe distance constraint. While for the general case with arbitrary number of UEs, we propose an efficient alternating optimization algorithm to solve the formulated non-convex optimization problem. Then, we extend the results to the case where each UAV is equipped with multiple antennas. Numerical results verify that the proposed low-altitude UAV swarm enabled MA system significantly outperforms various benchmark schemes, thanks to the exploitation of two-level mobility to create more favorable channel conditions for multi-UE communications.</description>

      <title>Elias' Encoding from Lagrangians and Renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23447v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper we give a principled derivation of Elias' Omega code by combining a constrained variational formulation of prefix coding with a renormalization flow on codeword distributions. Starting from a Lagrangian that minimizes average code length under the Kraft-McMillan constraint, we show that the implied distribution is a fixed point of a coarse-graining map, yielding the canonical iterated logarithm length, up to an additive constant.
  This establishes completeness and asymptotic optimality, and connects universal integer coding with coarse-grained entropy, uncertainty-type bounds, and multiplicity relations familiar from statistical physics. The renormalization operator induces a discrete flow that converges to the Elias fixed point for any admissible initialization, up to a bounded error, offering a clean bridge between information-theoretic constraints and RG-style scale invariance.</description>

      <title>Loss-Complexity Landscape and Model Structure Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13543v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a framework for dualizing the Kolmogorov structure function $h_x(\alpha)$, which then allows using computable complexity proxies. We establish a mathematical analogy between information-theoretic constructs and statistical mechanics, introducing a suitable partition function and free energy functional. We explicitly prove the Legendre-Fenchel duality between the structure function and free energy, showing detailed balance of the Metropolis kernel, and interpret acceptance probabilities as information-theoretic scattering amplitudes. A susceptibility-like variance of model complexity is shown to peak precisely at loss-complexity trade-offs interpreted as phase transitions. Practical experiments with linear and tree-based regression models verify these theoretical predictions, explicitly demonstrating the interplay between the model complexity, generalization, and overfitting threshold.</description>

      <title>Bounds and Constructions of High-Memory Spatially-Coupled Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply the Clique Lov\'asz Local Lemma to provide sufficient conditions on memory and lifting degree for removing certain harmful combinatorial structures in spatially-coupled (SC) codes that negatively impact decoding performance. Additionally, we present, for the first time, a constructive algorithm based on the Moser-Tardos algorithm that ensures predictable performance. Furthermore, leveraging the properties of LLL-distribution and M-T-distribution, we establish the dependencies among the harmful structures during the construction process. We provide upper bounds on the probability change of remaining harmful structures after eliminating some of them. In particular, the elimination of 4-cycles increases the probability of 6-cycles becoming active by at most a factor of $e^{8/3}$.</description>

      <title>The Landscape of Fairness: An Axiomatic and Predictive Framework for Network QoE Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evaluating network-wide fairness is challenging because it is not a static property but one highly sensitive to Service Level Agreement (SLA) parameters. This paper introduces a complete analytical framework to transform fairness evaluation from a single-point measurement into a proactive engineering discipline centered on a predictable sensitivity landscape. Our framework is built upon a QoE-Imbalance metric whose form is not an ad-hoc choice, but is uniquely determined by a set of fundamental axioms of fairness, ensuring its theoretical soundness. To navigate the fairness landscape across the full spectrum of service demands, we first derive a closed-form covariance rule. This rule provides an interpretable, local compass, expressing the fairness gradient as the covariance between a path's information-theoretic importance and its parameter sensitivity. We then construct phase diagrams to map the global landscape, revealing critical topological features such as robust "stable belts" and high-risk "dangerous wedges". Finally, an analysis of the landscape's curvature yields actionable, topology-aware design rules, including an optimal "Threshold-First" tuning strategy. Ultimately, our framework provides the tools to map, interpret, and navigate the landscape of system sensitivity, enabling the design of more robust and resilient networks.</description>

      <title>GeoClip: Geometry-Aware Clipping for Differentially Private SGD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) is the most widely used method for training machine learning models with provable privacy guarantees. A key challenge in DP-SGD is setting the per-sample gradient clipping threshold, which significantly affects the trade-off between privacy and utility. While recent adaptive methods improve performance by adjusting this threshold during training, they operate in the standard coordinate system and fail to account for correlations across the coordinates of the gradient. We propose GeoClip, a geometry-aware framework that clips and perturbs gradients in a transformed basis aligned with the geometry of the gradient distribution. GeoClip adaptively estimates this transformation using only previously released noisy gradients, incurring no additional privacy cost. We provide convergence guarantees for GeoClip and derive a closed-form solution for the optimal transformation that minimizes the amount of noise added while keeping the probability of gradient clipping under control. Experiments on both tabular and image datasets demonstrate that GeoClip consistently outperforms existing adaptive clipping methods under the same privacy budget.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical filtrations of line bundles and optimal algebraic geometry codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01859v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce \emph{hierarchical depth}, a new invariant of line bundles and divisors, defined via maximal chains of effective sub-line bundles. This notion gives rise to \emph{hierarchical filtrations}, refining the structure of the Picard group and providing new insights into the geometry of algebraic surfaces. We establish fundamental properties of hierarchical depth, derive inequalities through intersection theory and the Hodge index theorem, and characterize filtrations that are Hodge-tight.
  Using this framework, we develop a theory of \emph{hierarchical algebraic geometry codes}, constructed from evaluation spaces along these filtrations. This approach produces nested families of codes with controlled growth of parameters and identifies an optimal intermediate code maximizing a utility function balancing rate and minimum distance. Hierarchical depth thus provides a systematic method to construct AG codes with favorable asymptotic behavior, linking geometric and coding-theoretic perspectives.
  Our results establish new connections between line bundle theory, surface geometry, and coding theory, and suggest applications to generalized Goppa codes and higher-dimensional evaluation codes.</description>

      <title>Energy-Aware Resource Allocation for Multi-Operator Cell-Free Massive MIMO in V-CRAN Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) implemented in virtualized cloud radio access networks (V-CRAN) has emerged as a promising architecture to enhance spectral efficiency (SE), network flexibility, and energy efficiency (EE) in next-generation wireless systems. In this work, we develop a holistic optimization framework for the efficient deployment of cell-free massive MIMO in V-CRAN with multiple mobile network operators (MNOs). Specifically, we formulate a set of integer programming models to jointly optimize access point (AP) selection, user equipment (UE) association, cloud resource allocation, and MNO assignment while minimizing the maximum total power consumption (TPC) across MNOs. We consider two different scenarios based on whether UEs can be assigned to arbitrary MNOs or not. The numerical results demonstrate the impact of different deployment assumptions on power consumption, highlighting that flexible UE-MNO assignment significantly reduces TPC. The findings provide key insights into optimizing resource management in cell-free massive MIMO V-CRAN, paving the way for energy-efficient wireless network implementations.</description>

      <title>Green One-Bit Quantized Precoding in Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cell-free massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) is expected to be one of the key technologies in sixth-generation (6G) and beyond wireless communications, offering enhanced spectral efficiency for cell-edge user equipments by employing joint transmission and reception with a large number of antennas distributed throughout the region. However, high-resolution RF chains associated with these antennas significantly increase power consumption. To address this issue, the use of low-resolution analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters (ADCs/DACs) has emerged as a promising approach to balance power efficiency and performance in massive MIMO networks. In this work, we propose a novel quantized precoding algorithm tailored for cell-free massive MIMO systems, where the proposed method dynamically deactivates unnecessary antennas based on the structure of each symbol vector, thereby enhancing energy efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms existing methods such as squared-infinity norm Douglas-Rachford splitting (SQUID) and regularized zero forcing (RZF), achieving superior performance while effectively reducing power consumption.</description>
