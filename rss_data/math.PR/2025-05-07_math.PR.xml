      <title>$Q$-functions, synchronization, and Arnold tongues for coupled stochastic oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase reduction is an effective theoretical and numerical tool for studying synchronization of coupled deterministic oscillators. Stochastic oscillators require new definitions of asymptotic phase. The $Q$-function, i.e. the slowest decaying complex mode of the stochastic Koopman operator (SKO), was proposed as a means of phase reduction for stochastic oscillators. In this paper, we show that the $Q$-function approach also leads to a novel definition of ``synchronization" for coupled stochastic oscillators. A system of coupled oscillators in the synchronous regime may be viewed as a single (higher-dimensional) oscillator. Therefore, we investigate the relation between the $Q$-functions of the uncoupled oscillators and the higher-dimensional $Q$-function for the coupled system. We propose a definition of synchronization between coupled stochastic oscillators in terms of the eigenvalue spectrum of Kolmogorov's backward operator (the generator of the Markov process, or the SKO) of the higher dimensional coupled system. We observe a novel type of bifurcation reflecting (i) the relationship between the leading eigenvalues of the SKO for the coupled system and (ii) qualitative changes in the cross-spectral density of the coupled oscillators. Using our proposed definition, we observe synchronization domains for symmetrically-coupled stochastic oscillators that are analogous to Arnold tongues for coupled deterministic oscillators.</description>

      <title>Poissonization-based collision threshold derivation for random walks on lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this expository note, we give a short derivation of the expected number of collisions between two independent simple random walkers on integer lattices. Adapting a Poissonization technique introduced by Lange, we express the collision probability as the return probability of the continuous-time difference walk, given by a modified Bessel function. Analyzing its asymptotic decay yields a clean, self-contained proof that the expected number of collisions in $\mathbb{Z}^d$ is finite if and only if $d\geq3$. We also provide a general formula for the asymptotic number of collisions.</description>

      <title>Stochastic motions of the two-dimensional many-body delta-Bose gas, III: Path integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is the third in a series devoted to constructing stochastic motions for the two-dimensional $N$-body delta-Bose gas for all integers $N\geq 3$ and establishing the associated Feynman-Kac-type formulas. The main results here prove the Feynman-Kac-type formulas by using the stochastic many-$\delta$ motions from [7] as the underlying diffusions. The associated multiplicative functionals show a new form and are derived from the analytic solutions of the two-dimensional $N$-body delta-Bose gas obtained in [4]. For completeness, the main theorem includes the formula for $N=2$, which is a minor modification of the Feynman--Kac-type formula proven in [5] for the relative motions.</description>

      <title>Tamed Euler-Maruyama method for SDEs with non-globally Lipschitz drift and multiplicative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the following stochastic differential equation driven by multiplicative noise on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with a superlinearly growing drift coefficient, \begin{align*}
  \mathrm{d} X_t = b (X_t) \, \mathrm{d} t + \sigma (X_t) \, \mathrm{d} B_t. \end{align*} It is known that the corresponding explicit Euler schemes may not converge. In this article, we analyze an explicit and easily implementable numerical method for approximating such a stochastic differential equation, i.e. its tamed Euler-Maruyama approximation. Under partial dissipation conditions ensuring the ergodicity, we obtain the uniform-in-time convergence rates of the tamed Euler-Maruyama process under $L^{1}$-Wasserstein distance and total variation distance.</description>

      <title>A Regeneration-based a Posteriori Error Bound for a Markov Chain Stationary Distribution Truncation Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the state space of a discrete state space positive recurrent Markov chain is infinite or very large, it becomes necessary to truncate the state space in order to facilitate numerical computation of the stationary distribution. This paper develops a new approach for bounding the truncation error that arises when computing approximations to the stationary distribution. This rigorous a posteriori error bound exploits the regenerative structure of the chain and assumes knowledge of a Lyapunov function. Because the bound is a posteriori (and leverages the computations done to calculate the stationary distribution itself), it tends to be much tighter than a priori bounds. The bound decomposes the regenerative cycle into a random number of excursions from a set $K$ defined in terms of the Lyapunov function into the complement of the truncation set $A$. The bound can be easily computed, and does not (for example) involve a linear program, as do some other error bounds.</description>

      <title>Approximation of Markov Chain Expectations and the Key Role of Stationary Distribution Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a sequence $P_n$ of positive recurrent transition matrices or kernels that approximate a limiting infinite state matrix or kernel $P_{\infty}$. Such approximations arise naturally when one truncates an infinite state Markov chain and replaces it with a finite state approximation. It also describes the situation in which $P_{\infty}$ is a simplified limiting approximation to $P_n$ when $n$ is large. In both settings, it is often verified that the approximation $P_n$ has the characteristic that its stationary distribution $\pi_n$ converges to the stationary distribution $\pi_{\infty}$ associated with the limit. In this paper, we show that when the state space is countably infinite, this stationary distribution convergence implies that $P_n^m$ can be approximated uniformly in $m$ by $P_{\infty}^m$ when n is large. We show that this ability to approximate the marginal distributions at all time scales $m$ fails in continuous state space, but is valid when the convergence is in total variation or when we have weak convergence and the kernels are suitably Lipschitz. When the state space is discrete (as in the truncation setting), we further show that stationary distribution convergence also implies that all the expectations that are computable via first transition analysis (e.g. mean hitting times, expected infinite horizon discounted rewards) converge to those associated with the limit $P_{\infty}$. Simply put, we show that once one has established stationary distribution convergence, one immediately can infer convergence for a huge range of other expectations.</description>

      <title>Universality of the convergence rate for spectral radius of complex IID random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be an $n\times n$ matrix with independent and identically distributed entries $x_{ij} \stackrel{\text { d }}{=} n^{-1 / 2} x$ for some complex random variable $x$ of mean zero and variance one. Let $\{\sigma_i\}_{1\le i\le n}$ be the eigenvalues of $X$ and let $|\sigma_1|:=\max_{1\le i\le n}|\sigma_i|$ be the spectral radius. Set $Y_n=\sqrt{4 n \gamma_n}\left[|\sigma_1|-1-\sqrt{\frac{\gamma_n}{4 n}}\right],$ where
  $\gamma_{n}=\log{n}-2\log{\log{n}}-\log{2\pi}.$ As established in \cite{Cipolloni23Universality}, with specific moment-related conditions imposed on $x,$ the Gumbel distribution $\Lambda$ is identified as the universal weak limit of $Y_n.$ Subsequently, we extend this line of research and rigorously prove that the convergence rate, previously obtained for complex Ginibre ensembles in \cite{MaMeng25}, also possesses the property of universality. Precisely, one gets
  $$\sup_{x\in \mathbb{R}}|\mathbb{P}(Y_n \leq x)-e^{-e^{-x}}|=\frac{2\log\log n}{e\log n}(1+o(1))$$
  and
  $$W_1\left(\mathcal{L}(Y_n), \Lambda\right)=\frac{2\log\log n}{\log n}(1+o(1))$$
  for sufficiently large $n$, where $\mathcal{L}(Y_n)$ is the distribution of $Y_n$.</description>

      <title>Noise sensitivity and variance lower bound for minimal left-right crossing of a square in first-passage percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study first-passage percolation on $\mathbb Z ^2$ with independent and identically distributed weights, whose common distribution is uniform on $\{a,b\}$ with $0&lt;a&lt;b&lt;\infty $.
  Following Ahlberg and De la Riva, we consider the passage time $\tau (n,k)$ of the minimal left-right crossing of the square $[0,n]^2$, whose vertical fluctuations are bounded by $k$. We prove that when $k\le n^{1/2-\epsilon}$, the event that $\tau (n,k)$ is larger than its median is noise sensitive. This improves the main result of Ahlberg and De la Riva which holds when $k\le n^{1/22-\epsilon }$.
  Under the additional assumption that the limit shape is not a polygon with a small number of sides, we extend the result to all $k\le n^{1-\epsilon }$. This extension follows unconditionally when $a$ and $b$ are sufficiently close.
  Under a stronger curvature assumption, we extend the result to all $k\le n$. This in particular captures the noise sensitivity of the event that the minimal left-right crossing $T_n=\tau (n,n)$ is larger than its median.
  Finally, under the curvature assumption, our methods give a lower bound of $n^{1/4-\epsilon }$ for the variance of the passage time $T_n$ of the minimal left-right crossing of the square. We prove the last bound also for absolutely continuous weight distributions, generalizing a result of Damron--Houdr\'e--\"Ozdemir, which holds only for the exponential distribution.
  Our approach differs from the previous works mentioned above; the key idea is to establish a small ball probability estimate in the tail by perturbing the weights for tail events using a Mermin--Wagner type estimate.</description>

      <title>Harmonic analysis of multiplicative chaos Part II: Fourier dimensions of classical multiplicative chaos measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a unified approach for studying the polynomial Fourier decay of classical multiplicative chaos measures. As consequences, we obtain the precise Fourier dimensions for multiplicative chaos measures arising from the following key models: the sub-critical 1D and 2D GMC; the sub-critical $d$-dimensional GMC with $d \ge 3$ when the parameter $\gamma$ is near the critical value; the canonical Mandelbrot random coverings; the canonical Mandelbrot cascades. For various other models, we establish the non-trivial lower bounds of the Fourier dimensions and in various cases we conjecture that they are all optimal and provide the exact value of the Fourier dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the large deviation problem in the sample path space of the nearest-neighbor random walks on regular trees.
  We establish the sample path large deviation principle for the law of the distance from a nearest random walk on a regular tree to the root with a good convex rate function. Furthermore, we derive an implicit expression for the rate function via the Fenchel-Legendre transform of the log-moment generating function.</description>

      <title>Heavy traffic limit of stationary distribution of the multi-level single server queue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atar and Miyazawa recently introduced a single server queue with queue length dependent arrival and service processes, and name it a multi-level queue. They prove that the heavy traffic limit of its queue length process weakly converges to a reflected diffusion with discontinuously state-dependent drift and deviations.
  We derive the heavy traffic limit of the stationary queue length distribution of this multi-level queue in a closed form, which agrees with the stationary distribution of the reflected diffusion obtained by Miyazawa (2024, Journal of the Indian Society for Probability and Statistics). Thus, those results show the limit interchange of process and stationary distribution in heavy traffic.
  The multi-level queue is a simpler version of the 2-level GI/G/1 queue of Miyazawa (2025, Advances in Applied Probability, to appear) and its extension for multi-levels. For this 2-level queue in heavy traffic, the process limit is unknown, and the distributional limit is obtained for limited cases under extra conditions. Nevertheless, it is shown that the method developed in Miyazawa (2025) perfectly works for the present multi-level queue.</description>

      <title>On the optimal stopping of Gauss-Markov bridges with random pinning points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the optimal stopping problem for a Gauss-Markov process conditioned to adopt a prescribed terminal distribution. By applying a time-space transformation, we show it is equivalent to stopping a Brownian bridge pinned at a random endpoint with a time-dependent payoff. We prove that the optimal rule is the first entry into the stopping region, and establish that the value function is Lipschitz continuous on compacts via a coupling of terminal pinning points across different initial conditions. A comparison theorems then order value functions according to likelihood-ratio ordering of terminal densities, and when these densities have bounded support, we bound the optimal boundary by that of a Gauss-Markov bridge. Although the stopping boundary need not be the graph of a function in general, we provide sufficient conditions under which this property holds, and identify strongly log-concave terminal densities that guarantee this structure. Numerical experiments illustrate representative boundary shapes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing with their ability to generate human-like texts. However, a fundamental challenge remains in understanding the underlying mechanisms driving their emergent behaviors, particularly the randomness in their outputs. This paper investigates the application of spin glass theory as a mathematical framework to quantify the uncertainty of LLMs. Moreover, we analyze how the interaction between the noise in LLMs and from social networks shape emergent collective behaviors of the system. By making connections between LLMs and spin glass models, we gain insights into the high-dimensional optimization landscapes of LLMs, the uncertainty in their outputs, and the role of noise in their learning process. We focus on LLMs' ability to replicate human-written flitzes, a form of flirtatious poems unique to Dartmouth College, used to invite peers or a potentially romantic partner to social events. Given flitzes' playful tone, personal references, and role in complex social networks, they represent a uniquely creative form of language, making them ideal for exploring how the temperature parameter in LLMs affects the creativity and verisimilitude of AI-generated content. To better understand where temperature affects model behavior, we look for temperature-based phase transitions through statistical analysis, computational methods, and simulation of our spin glass model. Our findings demonstrate that temperature not only governs randomness in LLM output, but also mediates deeper transitions in linguistic structure, perceived quality, and human-machine alignment. By connecting statistical physics with language generation, we provide a novel framework for understanding emergent behavior in LLMs and their interaction with complex social networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend Perelman's $W$-entropy formula and the concavity of the Shannon entropy power from smooth Ricci flow to super Ricci flows on metric measure spaces. Moreover, we prove the Li-Yau-Hamilton-Perelman Harnack inequality on super Ricci flows. As a significant application, we prove the equivalence between the volume non-local collapsing property and the lower boundedness of the $W$-entropy on RCD$(0, N)$ spaces. Finally, we use the $W$-entropy to study the logarithmic Sobolev inequality with optimal constant on super Ricci flows on metric measure spaces.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a preferential attachment model that incorporates an anomaly. Our goal is to understand the evolution of the network before and after the occurrence of the anomaly by studying the influence of the anomaly on the structural properties of the network. The anomaly is such that after its arrival it attracts newly added edges with fixed probability. We investigate the growth of degrees in the network, finding that the anomaly's degree increases almost linearly. We also provide a heuristic derivation for the exponent of the limiting degree distributions of ordinary vertices, and study the degree growth of the oldest vertex. We show that when the anomaly enters early, the degree distribution is altered significantly, while a late anomaly has minimal impact. Our analysis provides deeper insights into the evolution of preferential attachment networks with an anomalous vertex.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Convergence of Score-based Generative Models under Semiconvexity and Discontinuous Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Score-based Generative Models (SGMs) approximate a data distribution by perturbing it with Gaussian noise and subsequently denoising it via a learned reverse diffusion process. These models excel at modeling complex data distributions and generating diverse samples, achieving state-of-the-art performance across domains such as computer vision, audio generation, reinforcement learning, and computational biology. Despite their empirical success, existing Wasserstein-2 convergence analysis typically assume strong regularity conditions-such as smoothness or strict log-concavity of the data distribution-that are rarely satisfied in practice. In this work, we establish the first non-asymptotic Wasserstein-2 convergence guarantees for SGMs targeting semiconvex distributions with potentially discontinuous gradients. Our upper bounds are explicit and sharp in key parameters, achieving optimal dependence of $O(\sqrt{d})$ on the data dimension $d$ and convergence rate of order one. The framework accommodates a wide class of practically relevant distributions, including symmetric modified half-normal distributions, Gaussian mixtures, double-well potentials, and elastic net potentials. By leveraging semiconvexity without requiring smoothness assumptions on the potential such as differentiability, our results substantially broaden the theoretical foundations of SGMs, bridging the gap between empirical success and rigorous guarantees in non-smooth, complex data regimes.</description>

      <title>Weighted Random Dot Product Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling of intricate relational patterns % through the analysis structures of network data has become a cornerstone of contemporary statistical research and related data science fields. Networks, represented as graphs, offer a natural framework for this analysis. This paper extends the Random Dot Product Graph (RDPG) model to accommodate weighted graphs, markedly broadening the model's scope to scenarios where edges exhibit heterogeneous weight distributions. We propose a nonparametric weighted (W)RDPG model that assigns a sequence of latent positions to each node. Inner products of these nodal vectors specify the moments of their incident edge weights' distribution via moment-generating functions. In this way, and unlike prior art, the WRDPG can discriminate between weight distributions that share the same mean but differ in other higher-order moments. We derive statistical guarantees for an estimator of the nodal's latent positions adapted from the workhorse adjacency spectral embedding, establishing its consistency and asymptotic normality. We also contribute a generative framework that enables sampling of graphs that adhere to a (prescribed or data-fitted) WRDPG, facilitating, e.g., the analysis and testing of observed graph metrics using judicious reference distributions. The paper is organized to formalize the model's definition, the estimation (or nodal embedding) process and its guarantees, as well as the methodologies for generating weighted graphs, all complemented by illustrative and reproducible examples showcasing the WRDPG's effectiveness in various network analytic applications.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we define a class of random growth models whose growth is at least and at most linear and prove an asymptotic shape theorem for these models. This proof generalizes already known proofs for the classical contact process or some of its variants and allows us to obtain conjectured asymptotic shape theorems for several models: the contact process in a randomly evolving environment, the oriented percolation with hostile immigration, the bounded modified contact process, Richardson's model with stirring and the contact process with stirring</description>

      <title>On the asymptotics of extremal lp-blocks cluster inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.13521v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extremes occur in stationary regularly varying time series as short periods with several large observations, known as extremal blocks. We study cluster statistics summarizing the behavior of functions acting on these extremal blocks. Examples of cluster statistics are the extremal index, cluster size probabilities, and other cluster indices. The purpose of our work is twofold. First, we state the asymptotic normality of block estimators for cluster inference based on consecutive observations with large lp-norms, for p &lt; 0. The case p=$\alpha$, where $\alpha$ &gt; 0 is the tail index of the time series, has specific nice properties thus we analyze the asymptotic of blocks estimators when approximating $\alpha$ using the Hill estimator. Second, we verify the conditions we require on classical models such as linear models and solutions of stochastic recurrence equations. Regarding linear models, we prove that the asymptotic variance of classical index cluster-based estimators is null as first conjectured in Hsing T. [26]. We illustrate our findings on simulations.</description>

Abstract: We study the precise large deviation probabilities for the sizes of intermediate level sets in branching Brownian motion (BBM). Our conclusions improve a result of A\"{i}dekon, Hu and Shi in [J. Math. Sci. \textbf{238}(2019)]. Additionally, we analyze the typical behaviors of BBM conditioned on large level sets. Our approach relies on the connections between intermediate level sets, additive martingale limits of BBM, and the global minimum of linearly transformed BBMs.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish the exact Fourier dimensions of all standard sub-critical Gaussian multiplicative chaos on the unit interval, thereby confirming the Garban-Vargas conjecture.

Abstract: We study the space-time scaling limits of solitons in the box-ball system with random initial distribution. In particular, we show that any recentered tagged soliton converges to a Brownian motion in the diffusive space-time scale, and also prove the large deviation principle for the tagged soliton under certain shift-ergodic invariant distributions, including Bernoulli product measures and two-sided Markov distributions. Furthermore, in the diffusive space-time scaling, we show that two tagged solitons converge to the same Brownian motion even if they are macroscopically far apart.</description>

      <title>Hessian descent for spherical spin glasses with uniform log-Sobolev disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present work concerns spherical spin glass models with disorder satisfying a uniform logarithmic Sobolev inequality. We show that the Hessian descent algorithm introduced by Subag can be extended to this setting, thanks to the abundance of small eigenvalues near the edge of the Hessian spectrum. Combined with the ground state universality recently proven by Sawhney and Sellke, this implies that when the model is in the full-RSB phase, the Hessian descent algorithm can find a near-minimum with high probability.
  Our proof consists of two main ingredients. First, we show that the empirical spectral distribution of the Hessian converges to a semicircular law via the moment method. Second, we use the logarithmic Sobolev inequality to establish concentration and obtain uniform control of the spectral edge.</description>

      <title>Lifting couplings in Wasserstein spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.06591v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper makes mathematically precise the idea that conditional probabilities are analogous to path liftings in geometry.
  The idea of lifting is modelled in terms of the category-theoretic concept of a lens, which can be interpreted as a consistent choice of arrow liftings. The category we study is the one of probability measures over a given standard Borel space, with morphisms given by the couplings, or transport plans.
  The geometrical picture is even more apparent once we equip the arrows of the category with weights, which one can interpret as "lengths" or "costs", forming a so-called weighted category, which unifies several concepts of category theory and metric geometry.
  Indeed, we show that the weighted version of a lens is tightly connected to the notion of submetry in geometry.
  Every weighted category gives rise to a pseudo-quasimetric space via optimization over the arrows. In particular, Wasserstein spaces can be obtained from the weighted categories of probability measures and their couplings, with the weight of a coupling given by its cost.
  In this case, conditionals allow one to form weighted lenses, which one can interpret as "lifting transport plans, while preserving their cost".</description>

      <title>Seat number configuration of the box-ball system, and its relation to the 10-elimination and invariant measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15358v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The box-ball system (BBS) is a soliton cellular automaton introduced in [TS], and it is known that the dynamics of the BBS can be linearized by several methods. Recently, a new linearization method, called the seat number configuration, is introduced in [MSSS]. The aim of this paper is fourfold. First, we introduce the $k$-skip map $\Psi_{k} : \Omega \to \Omega$, where $\Omega$ is the state space of the BBS, and show that the $k$-skip map induces a shift operator of the seat number configuration. Second, we show that the $k$-skip map is a natural generalization of the $10$-elimination, which was originally introduced in [MIT] to solve the initial value problem of the periodic BBS. Third, we generalize the notions and results of the seat number configuration and the $k$-skip map for the BBS on the whole-line. Finally, we investigate the distribution of $\Psi_{k}(\eta), \eta \in \Omega$ when the distribution of $\eta$ belongs to a certain class of invariant measures of the BBS introduced in [FG]. As an application of the above results, we compute the expectation of the carrier with seat numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00027v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This manuscript derives locally weighted ensemble Kalman methods from the point of view of ensemble-based function approximation. This is done by using pointwise evaluations to build up a local linear or quadratic approximation of a function, tapering off the effect of distant particles via local weighting. This introduces a candidate method (the locally weighted Ensemble Kalman method for inversion) with the motivation of combining some of the strengths of the particle filter (ability to cope with nonlinear maps and non-Gaussian distributions) and the Ensemble Kalman filter (no filter degeneracy). We provide some numerical evidence for the accuracy of locally weighted ensemble methods, both in terms of approximation and inversion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We exploit the structure of geometric graphs on Riemannian manifolds to analyze strategic dynamic graphs at the limit, when the number of nodes tends to infinity. This framework allows to preserve intrinsic geometrical information about the limiting graph structure, such as the Ollivier curvature. After introducing the setting, we derive a mean field game system, which models a strategic equilibrium between the nodes. It has the usual structure with the distinction of being set on a manifold. Finally, we establish existence and uniqueness of solutions to the system when the Hamiltonian is quadratic for a class of non-necessarily compact Riemannian manifolds, referred to as manifolds of bounded geometry.</description>

Abstract: In this work we explore the Sibuya discrete probability distribution, which serves as the basis and the main instrument for numerical simulations of Grunwald--Letnikov fractional derivatives by the Monte Carlo method. We provide three methods for simulating the Sibuya distribution. We also introduce the Sibuya-like sieved probability distributions, and apply them to numerical fractional-order differentiation. Additionally, we use the Monte Carlo method for evaluating fractional-order integrals, and suggest the notion of the continuous Sibuya probability distribution. The developed methods and tools are illustrated by examples of computation. We provide the MATLAB toolboxes for simulation of the Sibuya probability distribution, and for the numerical examples.</description>
