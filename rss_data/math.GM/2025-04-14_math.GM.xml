      <title>Optional intervals event, sequential operation and their applications in physics, computer science and applied mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce algebraic theories such as set theory and group theory into the analysis of event execution order. We propose concepts like "optional intervals event" and "sequential operation", summarize their algebraic properties and draw Cayley tables. Based on these efforts, we offer new interpretations for certain physical phenomena and computer application scenarios. Finally, we present other issues derived from this paradigm. These concepts can deepen our understanding of motion and find applications in areas such as event arrangement, physical simulation, and computer modeling</description>

      <title>Efficient tensor-based approach to solving linear systems involving Kronecker sum of matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel tensor-based formula for solving the linear systems involving Kronecker sum is proposed. Such systems are directly related to the matrix and tensor forms of Sylvester equation. The new tensor-based formula demonstrates the well-known fact that a Sylvester tensor equation has a unique solution if the sum of spectra of the matrices does not contain zero. We have showcased the effectiveness of the method by efficiently solving the 2D and 3D discretized Poisson equations, as well as the 2D steady-state convection-diffusion equation, on a rectangular domain with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The results suggest that this approach is well-suited for high-dimensional problems.</description>

      <title>A comparison of arithmetical operations with f correlated fuzzy numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a brief introduction to a class of interactive fuzzy numbers, called f-correlated fuzzy numbers, which consist of pairs of fuzzy numbers where one is dependent on the other by a continuous monotone injective function. We have deduced some equations that can directly calculate the results of the sums and products of f-correlated fuzzy numbers, using only basic operations with real numbers, intervals on the real line and the function that relates the fuzzy numbers being considered. We proved that their correlated and standard sum coincide, and that in a certain sense, the correlated product is contained in the standard product.</description>
