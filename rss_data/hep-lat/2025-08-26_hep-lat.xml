      <title>Baryon Electric Charge Correlation as QCD Magnetometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of strong magnetic fields in peripheral heavy-ion collisions is crucial for observing effects such as the chiral magnetic effect but has proven exceptionally difficult. To address this, we propose the baryon electric charge correlation $\chi^{\rm BQ}_{11}$ and the chemical potential ratio $\mu_{\rm Q}/\mu_{\rm B}$ as sensitive probes of magnetic fields, based on (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD simulations at the physical pion mass. Along the transition line, $\chi^{\rm BQ}_{11}$ and $(\mu_{\rm Q}/\mu_{\rm B})_{\rm LO}$ in Pb-Pb collisions increase by factors of 2.1 and 2.4 at $eB \simeq 8M_\pi^2$, respectively. To bridge theoretical predictions with experimental observables, we implement systematic kinematic cuts that emulate detector acceptances of the STAR and ALICE experiments within the hadron resonance gas model. This allows us to construct experimentally relevant proxy observables. Furthermore, we demonstrate that $(\mu_{\rm Q}/\mu_{\rm B})_{\rm LO}$ is also sensitive to the collision system, showing a $1.5$-fold increase from Zr-Zr to Ru-Ru isobar collisions. Our findings offer new insights into thermo-magnetic effects and provide experimentally relevant guidance for the detection of magnetic fields in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Generalized Parton Distributions from Lattice QCD with Asymmetric Momentum Transfer: Unpolarized Quarks at Nonzero Skewness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the formalism of asymmetric frames of reference for generalized parton distributions (GPDs) to the case of nonzero skewness, i.e., including longitudinal momentum transfer. The framework, based on Lorentz-invariant amplitudes and previously developed and numerically implemented for unpolarized, helicity and transversity GPDs at zero skewness, gives efficient access to a broad range of kinematics, making full mapping of GPDs from the lattice realistic. The general-skewness formalism is tested using lattice data with both transverse and longitudinal or only longitudinal momentum transfer, the latter being a special case with a reduced number of independent amplitudes. We extract the amplitudes in coordinate space and express the GPDs $H$ and $E$ in terms of these amplitudes. This is followed by reconstruction of quasi-distributions and their matching to the light cone. We further identify and discuss the principal challenges for nonzero skewness GPDs.</description>

      <title>A Journey of Seeking Pressures and Forces in the Nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been suggested by M. Polyakov et al. that the QCD momentum current density (MCD) $T^{ij}$ in the nucleon, characterized by the form factor $C/D$ of the QCD energy-momentum tensor, can be interpreted as the pressure and shear force distributions inside the nucleon because its interior seems to approximate a continuous mechanical medium. By examining the physics content of MCDs in various classical and quantum systems, we find that momentum current flow originates from both kinetic motion of particles and forces between them, and furthermore, the forces alone cannot determine the interaction MCDs unambiguously, same as the interaction energy potentials and consistent with Noether's theorem. Only in special cases where there are short-range forces between different elements of a system, or short-range interactions with external boundaries that result in discontinuities of MCDs, can the relevant components be interpreted as surface forces, i.e., mechanical pressures and shear forces. For the nucleon in QCD, the range of quark and gluon interactions is comparable to its size and far from short, and we fail to identify any interaction component of the MCD as pressure/shear forces between different parts of the nucleon, nor the total through the form factor $C/D$ which merely depicts the total momentum flux seen through gravity. Following our previous study of the forces through divergences of kinetic MCDs, we affirm that the gluon scalar field in the QCD trace anomaly provides a confining force potential on the quarks, with a strength consistent with that between heavy quarks.</description>

      <title>Yang--Mills $\beta$ function in the gradient flow exact renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gradient flow exact renormalization (GFERG) is a variant of the exact renormalization group of gauge theory that is aimed to preserve gauge symmetry as manifestly as possible. From an integral representation of the Wilson action in GFERG equation for the Yang--Mills theory, we explicitly compute the one-loop renormalization group functions that reproduce correct coefficients. From the correspondence with the gradient flow formalism by L\"uscher and Weisz, we argue that GFERG reproduces the conventional renormalization group functions in all orders of perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Optimized quantum algorithms for simulating the Schwinger effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Schwinger model, which describes lattice quantum electrodynamics in $1+1$ space-time dimensions, provides a valuable framework to investigate fundamental aspects of quantum field theory, and a stepping stone towards non-Abelian gauge theories. Specifically, it enables the study of physically relevant dynamical processes, such as the nonperturbative particle-antiparticle pairs production, known as the Schwinger effect. In this work, we analyze the quantum computational resource requirements associated with simulating the Schwinger effect under two distinct scenarios: (1) a quench process, where the initial state is a simple product state of a non-interacting theory, and interactions are turned on at time $t=0$; (2) a splitting (or scattering) process where two Gaussian states, peaked at given initial momenta, are shot away from (or towards) each other. We explore different physical regimes in which the Schwinger effect is expected to be observable. These regimes are characterized by initial momenta and coupling strengths, as well as simulation parameters such as lattice size and electric-field cutoffs. Leveraging known rigorous bounds for electric-field cutoffs, we find that a reliable simulation of the Schwinger effect is provably possible at high cutoff scales. Furthermore, we provide optimized circuit implementations of both the second-order Trotter formula and an interaction-picture algorithm based on the Dyson series to implement the time evolution. Our detailed resource estimates show the regimes in which the interaction-picture approach outperforms the Trotter approach, and vice versa. The improved theoretical error bounds, optimized quantum circuit designs, and explicitly compiled subroutines developed in this study are broadly applicable to simulations of other lattice models in high-energy physics and beyond.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The article (Gauge networks in noncommutative geometry, J. Geom. Phys. 75 : 71--91, 2014) that motivates this comment provides, in particular, one answer to the following natural question: what is noncommutative geometry on a lattice? In the context of spectral triples, Marcolli and van Suijlekom define in op. cit. a Dirac operator on the lattice and identify the corresponding Spectral Action with the lattice Yang-Mills--Higgs system. In this comment we show that the continuum limit of this theory is the Yang-Mills action functional, without a Higgs scalar.

      <title>JuliaQCD: Portable lattice QCD package in Julia language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new lattice gauge theory code set JuliaQCD using the Julia language. Julia is well-suited for integrating machine learning techniques and enables rapid prototyping and execution of algorithms for four dimensional QCD and other non-Abelian gauge theories. The code leverages LLVM for high-performance execution and supports MPI for parallel computations. Julia's multiple dispatch provides a flexible and intuitive framework for development. The code implements existing algorithms such as Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC), many color and flavor, supports lattice fermions, smearing techniques, and full QCD simulations. It is designed to run efficiently across various platforms, from laptops to supercomputers, allowing for seamless scalability. The code set is currently available on GitHub https://github.com/JuliaQCD.</description>

      <title>Quantum decoherence in the Caldeira-Leggett model by the real-time path integral on a computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20699v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose first-principle calculations of an open system based on the real-time path integral formalism treating the environment as well as the system of our interest together on a computer. The sign problem that occurs in applying Monte Carlo methods can be overcome in general by using the so-called Lefschetz thimble method, which has been developed over the past decade. Here we focus on the Caldeira-Leggett model, which is well known, in particular, as a model of quantum decoherence. In this case, the calculation simplifies drastically since the path integral becomes Gaussian for typical initial conditions. The relevant saddle point, which is unique and complex, can be determined by solving a linear equation with a huge but sparse coefficient matrix, and the integration over the Lefschetz thimble can be performed analytically. Thus we obtain, without assumptions or approximations, the reduced density matrix after a long-time evolution, tracing out a large number of harmonic oscillators in the environment. In particular, we confirm the dependence of the decoherence time on the coupling constant and the temperature that has been predicted from the master equation in a certain parameter regime.</description>

      <title>QCD with an Infrared Fixed Point and a Dilaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13761v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following previous work we further explore the possibility that the chirally broken phase of gauge theories admits an infrared fixed point interpretation. The slope of the $\beta$ function, $\beta'_*$, is found to vanish at the infrared fixed point which has several attractive features such as logarithmic running. We provide a more in-depth analysis of our previous result that the mass anomalous assumes $\gamma_* = 1$ at the fixed point. The results are found to be consistent with ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric gauge theories. In a second part the specific properties of a dilaton, the (pseudo) Goldstone, due to spontaneous symmetry breaking are investigated. Dilaton soft theorems indicate that a soft dilaton mass can only originate from an operator of scaling dimension two. In the gauge theory this role is taken on by the $\bar qq$-operator. The QCD dilaton candidate, the $\sigma = f_0(500)$ meson is investigated. Singlet-octet mixing is found to be important. We briefly discuss the dilaton as a candidate for the Higgs boson, which relies on the ratio of dilaton to pion decay constant being close to unity. In QCD this is approximately satisfied but it is remains unclear if this is accidental or whether there is unknown reason behind it.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Simulation of Asymmetry Generation in Fermion-Bubble Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the out-of-equilibrium dynamics during an early-universe first-order phase transition, we perform real-time simulations of fermion-bubble scattering in $1+1$ dimensions. This nonequilibrium process can generate a charge-conjugation $\mathsf{C}$ asymmetry outside the bubble wall, induced by the complex fermion mass profile. The resulting $\mathsf{C}$ asymmetry is the 1+1-dimensional analog of the $\mathsf{CP}$ asymmetry in 3+1 dimensions, a key ingredient in baryon asymmetry generation at the electroweak scale. Using tensor network methods, we track the real-time evolution of the $\mathsf{C}$ asymmetry in the charge density as the fermion interacts with the bubble wall, a regime inaccessible to analytic calculations. We further introduce two observables to quantify the asymmetry in the asymptotic region where reflected particles are well separated from the scattering point: one based on the net charge outside the bubble wall, and the other on the spatial displacement between the reflected particle and antiparticle wavepackets. Our study represents a first step toward nonperturbative, real-time computations of $\mathsf{CP}$ asymmetry in 3+1 dimensions for electroweak baryogenesis.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the semileptonic decays $\Xi^{(')}_{b}\rightarrow \Xi^{(')}_{c}{\ell}\bar\nu_{\ell}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the semileptonic decays of $\Xi^{(')}_{b}\rightarrow\Xi^{(')}_{c}{\ell}\bar\nu_{\ell}$ in all lepton channels. To do this, we first obtain the form factors defining these decay modes within the framework of QCD sum rules. Then, using the transferred momentum squared-dependent form factors, we compute the decay widths and branching fractions for all lepton channels and compare the results of our calculations with those obtained from other theoretical methods. We also estimate the branching ratios and the ratio of branching fractions at different leptonic channels to provide useful information for future experiments may be planned at different Colliders. Such comparison will provide valuable information about the consistency/inconsistency of the SM theory predictions with experimental data in weak semileptonic single heavy baryon decays.</description>

      <title>Heavy scalar molecule $B_{c}^{+} B_{c}^{-}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mass and full width of the heavy scalar molecule $\mathcal{M}$ composed of the mesons $B_{c}^{+}$ and $B_{c}^{-}$ are calculated in the QCD sum rule framework. To find its mass and current coupling, we apply the two-point sum rule method. The width of the hadronic molecule $\mathcal{M} =B_{c}^{+}B_{c}^{-}$ is evaluated by taking into account its dissociation to $\eta_c\eta_{b}, J/\psi \Upsilon$, and $B_{c}^{+}B_{c}^{-} $ mesons. Decays into $D$ and $B$ meson pairs with appropriate charges and quantum numbers triggered by $\overline{b}b$ and $\overline{c}c$ annihilations to light quark-antiquarks are also included in the analyses. Because the partial widths of $\mathcal{M}$ molecule's decay channels depend on the strong couplings at $\mathcal{M}$-meson-meson vertices, we estimate them by invoking tools of the three-point sum rule method. Our predictions $m=(12725 \pm 85)~\mathrm{ MeV}$ and $\Gamma[\mathcal{\ M}]=(155 \pm 23)~ \mathrm{MeV}$ for the parameters of the molecule $\mathcal{\ M}$ provide useful information for experimental studies of numerous heavy resonances.</description>

      <title>Mechanical properties of the $\Omega^-$ baryon from gravitational form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of the mechanical properties of the $\Omega^-$ baryon by analyzing its gravitational form factors (GFFs) within the framework of QCD sum rules. These form factors encode rich information about the internal structure of hadrons and offer deep insights into the dynamics that govern their stability. The spin-3/2 nature of the $\Omega^-$ baryon manifests in its gravitational form factors as intricate multipole structures, which encapsulate higher-order deformations and demonstrate the influence of intrinsic spin on internal dynamics. We extract the GFFs of the $\Omega^-$ baryon and apply their specific multipole combinations, gravitational multipole form factors (GMFFs), to quantify key mechanical observables-including energy density, angular momentum, pressure and shear force distributions, mass and mechanical radii, and D-terms-associated with different multipole orders. Notably, this work provides the first determination of several of these observables, such as the mechanical radii and the quadrupole contributions to the pressure and shear force distributions. Our analysis shows that the quadrupole contributions to the mechanical properties are generally subdominant compared to those from the monopole component. We further investigate the mechanical stability of the $\Omega^-$ through a multipole analysis of its internal force distributions. These results enhance our understanding of the mechanical structure of spin-3/2 hadrons and provide useful benchmarks for future theoretical and lattice QCD studies.</description>
