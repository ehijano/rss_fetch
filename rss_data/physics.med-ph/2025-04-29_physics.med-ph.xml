      <title>Joint Range-modulator and Spot Optimization for Bragg-peak Proton FLASH Radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Ultra-high-dose-rate (UHDR) radiation therapy has demonstrated promising potential in reducing toxicity to organs-at-risk (OARs). Proton therapy is uniquely positioned to deliver UHDR by leveraging the Bragg peak in conjunction with patient-specific range modulators (PSRMs) to generate a spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP). Existing proton FLASH (pFLASH) planning typically involves (1) generating a multi-energy IMPT plan for spot weights and (2) converting it to single-energy delivery via PSRM optimization. However, the intrinsic coupling between spot weight distribution and PSRM design has not been fully investigated. Purpose: This work proposes Joint Range-Modulator and Spot Optimization (JRSO) that simultaneously optimizes the PSRM and spot weights to improve the plan quality of conformal pFLASH therapy. Methods: Unlike the conventional method, JRSO does not require a one-to-one correspondence between beam spots and PSRM pins. To achieve better plan quality, starting from an initial solution derived from a conventional IMPT plan, JRSO alternatively updates the PSRM design and spot weights. This process progressively refines both parameters while ensuring compliance with practical delivery constraints, such as the minimum monitor-unit (MMU) requirement. Results: JRSO obtained improved plan quality compared to the conventional method. For example, in a head-and-neck (HN) case, JRSO lowered the maximum target dose from 117.6% to 107.1%, improved the conformity index from 0.74 to 0.87, and decreased the region-of-interest (ROI) effective dose from 6.50 Gy to 6.10 Gy. Conclusion: A new optimization method JRSO is proposed for conformal pFLASH radiotherapy. It outperforms the conventional approach and may extend the applicability of PSRM to more complex clinical scenarios, particularly those involving misalignments between beam spots and pins.</description>

      <title>Consensus Recommendations for Hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate MRI Multi-center Human Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging of hyperpolarized (HP) [1-13C]pyruvate allows in-vivo assessment of metabolism and has translated into human studies across diseases at 15 centers worldwide. Consensus on best practice for multi-center studies is required to develop clinical applications. This paper presents the results of a 2-round formal consensus building exercise carried out by experts with HP [1-13C]pyruvate human study experience. Twenty-nine participants from 13 sites brought together expertise in pharmacy methods, MR physics, translational imaging, and data-analysis; with the goal of providing recommendations and best practice statements on conduct of multi-center human studies of HP [1-13C]pyruvate MRI.
  Overall, the group reached consensus on approximately two-thirds of 246 statements in the questionnaire, covering 'HP 13C-Pyruvate Preparation', 'MRI System Setup, Calibration, and Phantoms', 'Acquisition and Reconstruction', and 'Data Analysis and Quantification'.
  Consensus was present across categories, examples include that: (i) different HP pyruvate preparation methods could be used in human studies, but that the same release criteria have to be followed; (ii) site qualification and quality assurance must be performed with phantoms and that the same field strength must be used, but that the rest of the system setup and calibration methods could be determined by individual sites; (iii) the same pulse sequence and reconstruction methods were preferable, but the exact choice should be governed by the anatomical target; (iv) normalized metabolite area-under-curve (AUC) values and metabolite AUC were the preferred metabolism metrics.
  The work confirmed areas of consensus for multi-center study conduct and identified where further research is required to ascertain best practice.</description>

      <title>A High-Granularity Proton CT Enhanced by Track Discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proton Computed Tomography (pCT) provides a promising solution to enhance the accuracy of Relative Stopping Power (RSP) required for proton therapy planning. This research introduces a novel high-granularity pCT architecture that incorporates a silicon pixel tracking system and a calorimetric range telescope, which uniquely integrates range telescope functionality with track discrimination capabilities. The Bortfeld function fitting and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier algorithms are developed and applied for discrimination. In simulation studies, both approaches demonstrate the capability to reduce uncertainty in Water Equivalent Path Length (WEPL) determination for individual proton tracks to below 3~mm. The standard imaging protocol (3.2~mGy, $4\times10^{8}$ protons) achieves sub-millimeter spatial resolution ($\sim$0.5 mm) with sub-1\% RSP accuracy. With proton count requirements reduced by track discrimination, an ultra-low-dose protocol (0.16~mGy, $2\times10^{7}$~protons) is proposed with achieved sub-1\% RSP accuracy and $\sim$1.1~mm spatial resolution in simulation. This low-dose performance significantly expands clinical applicability, particularly for pediatric imaging or frequent imaging scenarios. Furthermore, the target 10 MHz proton detection rate suggests potential for real-time image guidance during radiotherapy. By circumventing the need for ultra-precise energy measurements, this design minimizes hardware complexity and provides a scalable foundation for future pCT systems.</description>

      <title>Diagnostic performance of echocardiography in detecting and differentiating cardiac amyloidosis: a meta-analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims: This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of echocardiographic parameters for cardiac amyloidosis (CA), with a focus on subtype stratification and comparisons with healthy controls. Methods and Results: A comprehensive search identified 26 studies published before February 2025, encompassing 3,802 patients. Compared to healthy individuals, CA patients demonstrated significant echocardiographic abnormalities, including reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF; WMD = -10.65, 95% CI: [-11.84, -9.46]), increased left atrial volume index (WMD = +15.87, 95% CI: [14.35, 17.38]), and thickened posterior wall (WMD = +5.14, 95% CI: [4.85, 5.42]). Subtype analyses revealed that transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CA) was associated with more pronounced systolic dysfunction than light-chain cardiac amyloidosis (AL-CA), evidenced by lower global longitudinal strain (WMD = -2.02, 95% CI: [-2.66, -1.37]), reduced LVEF (WMD = -5.31, 95% CI: [-6.63, -3.99]), and diminished tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (WMD = -1.59, 95% CI: [-2.23, -0.95]). Additionally, ATTR-CA patients exhibited greater ventricular wall thickening in both posterior wall (WMD = +1.87, 95% CI: [1.51, 2.23]) and interventricular septum (WMD = +2.24, 95% CI: [1.85, 2.63]). Conclusion: Echocardiography plays a pivotal role in diagnosing CA and distinguishing between AL-CA and ATTR-CA. Key indices such as LVEF and global longitudinal strain are especially valuable for early detection, while subtype-specific patterns highlight distinct underlying pathophysiologies, offering guidance for tailored diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.</description>

      <title>Two-stage deep learning framework for the restoration of incomplete-ring PET images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is an important molecular imaging tool widely used in medicine. Traditional PET systems rely on complete detector rings for full angular coverage and reliable data collection. However, incomplete-ring PET scanners have emerged due to hardware failures, cost constraints, or specific clinical needs. Standard reconstruction algorithms often suffer from performance degradation with these systems because of reduced data completeness and geometric inconsistencies. We present a two-stage deep-learning framework that, without incorporating any time-of-flight (TOF) information, restores high-quality images from data with about 50% missing coincidences - double the loss levels previously addressed by CNN-based methods. The pipeline operates in two stages: a projection-domain Attention U-Net first predicts the missing sections of the sinogram by leveraging spatial context from neighbouring slices, after which the completed data are reconstructed with OSEM algorithm and passed to a U-Net-diffusion module that removes residual artefacts while reinstating high-frequency detail. Using 206 brain volumes from a public dataset, the result shows that our model successfully preserves most anatomical structures and tracer distribution features with PSNR of 30.92 dB and SSIM of 0.9708. We also achieve higher inference speed, thus providing an effective solution for incomplete-ring PET imaging.</description>
