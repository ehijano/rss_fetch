      <title>Closures of $3$-braids and detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give some new link detection results for link Floer homology, Khovanov homology and annular Khovanov homology. The links we detect arise via different closure operations on $3$-braids. Examples of our results include that link Floer homology detects the Mazur link, that annular Khovanov homology detects the Mazur pattern, and that Khovanov homology detects L6a2 and L9n15. The Mazur pattern detection result depends on a new bound on the rank of the annular Khovanov homology of certain links.</description>

      <title>An endomorphism on immersed curves in the pillowcase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the holonomy-perturbed traceless SU(2) character variety of the trivial four-stranded tangle {p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4} X [0,1] in S^2 X [0,1] equipped with a strong marking, either an earring or a bypass. Viewing these marked tangles as endomorphisms in the cobordism category from the four-punctured sphere to itself, we identify the images of these endomorphisms in the Weinstein symplectic partial category under the partially defined holonomy-perturbed traceless character variety functor. We express these endomorphisms on immersed curves in the pillowcase in terms of doubling and figure eight operations and prove they have the same image.</description>

      <title>The Thurston norm of 2-bridge link complements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Thurston norm is a seminorm on the second real homology group of a compact orientable 3-manifold. The unit ball of this norm is a convex polyhedron, whose shape's data (e.g. number of vertices, regularity) measures the complexity of the surfaces sitting in the ambient 3-manifold.
  Unfortunately, the Thurston norm is generally quite hard to compute, and a long-standing problem is to understand which polyhedra are realised as the unit balls of the Thurston norms of $3$-manifolds. We show that, when $M$ is the complement of a $2$-bridge link $L$ with components $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$, the Thurston ball of $M$ has at most 8 faces. The proof of this result strongly relies on a description of essential surfaces in $2$-bridge link complements given by Floyd and Hatcher. Then, we exhibit norm-minimizing representatives for the integral classes of $H_2(M,\partial M)$ and use them to compare the complexity of the Thurston ball with the complexities of $L$ and of $M$. As an example, we show that all the vertices of the Thurston ball lie on the bisectors if and only if $M$ fibers over the circle with fiber a surface with boundary equal to a longitude of $\ell_1$ and some meridians of $\ell_2$. Finally, we use $2$-bridge links in satellite constructions to find $2$-component links whose complements in $S^3$ have Thurston balls with arbitrarily many vertices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a smooth map $f:M\rightarrow N$ of closed oriented smooth manifolds, is there an immersion homotopic to $f$? We provide an algorithm that decides this when the codimension of the manifolds is odd.</description>

      <title>On the five-dimensional non-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole: Retractions and scalar quasibound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the role played by topology, and some specific boundary conditions as well, on the physics of a higher-dimensional black hole. We analyze the line element of a five-dimensional non-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole to obtain a new family of subspaces that are types of strong retractions and deformations, and then we extend these results to higher dimensions in order to deduce the relationship between various types of transformations. We also study the scalar field perturbations in the background under consideration and obtain an analytical expression for the quasibound state frequencies by using the Vieira-Bezerra-Kokkotas approach, which uses the polynomial conditions of the general Heun functions, and then we discuss the stability of the system and present the radial eigenfunctions. Our main goal is to discuss the physical meaning of these mathematical applications in such higher-dimensional effective metric.</description>

      <title>The worldsheet skein D-module and basic curves on Lagrangian fillings of the Hopf link conormal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: HOMFLYPT polynomials of knots in the 3-sphere in symmetric representations satisfy recursion relations. Their geometric origin is holomorphic curves at infinity on knot conormals that determine a $D$-module with characteristic variety the Legendrian knot conormal augmention variety and with the recursion relations as operator polynomial generators [arXiv:1304.5778, arXiv:1803.04011]. We consider skein lifts of recursions and $D$-modules corresponding to skein valued open curve counts [arXiv:1901.08027] that encode HOMFLYPT polynomials colored by arbitrary partitions. We define a worldsheet skein module which is the universal target for skein curve counts and a corresponding $D$-module.
  We then consider the concrete example of the Legendrian conormal of the Hopf link. We show that the worldsheet skein $D$-module for the Hopf link conormal is generated by three operator polynomials that annihilate the skein valued partition function for any choice of Lagrangian filling and recursively determine it uniquely. We find Lagrangian fillings for any point in the augmentation variety and show that their skein valued partition functions admit quiver-like expansions where all holomorphic curves are generated by a small number of basic holomorphic disks and annuli and their multiple covers.</description>
