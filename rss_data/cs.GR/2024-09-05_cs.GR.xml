      <title>Large \'Etendue 3D Holographic Display with Content-adpative Dynamic Fourier Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging holographic display technology offers unique capabilities for next-generation virtual reality systems. Current holographic near-eye displays, however, only support a small \'etendue, which results in a direct tradeoff between achievable field of view and eyebox size. \'Etendue expansion has recently been explored, but existing approaches are either fundamentally limited in the image quality that can be achieved or they require extremely high-speed spatial light modulators.
  We describe a new \'etendue expansion approach that combines multiple coherent sources with content-adaptive amplitude modulation of the hologram spectrum in the Fourier plane. To generate time-multiplexed phase and amplitude patterns for our spatial light modulators, we devise a pupil-aware gradient-descent-based computer-generated holography algorithm that is supervised by a large-baseline target light field. Compared with relevant baseline approaches, our method demonstrates significant improvements in image quality and \'etendue in simulation and with an experimental holographic display prototype.</description>

      <title>A General Albedo Recovery Approach for Aerial Photogrammetric Images through Inverse Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling outdoor scenes for the synthetic 3D environment requires the recovery of reflectance/albedo information from raw images, which is an ill-posed problem due to the complicated unmodeled physics in this process (e.g., indirect lighting, volume scattering, specular reflection). The problem remains unsolved in a practical context. The recovered albedo can facilitate model relighting and shading, which can further enhance the realism of rendered models and the applications of digital twins. Typically, photogrammetric 3D models simply take the source images as texture materials, which inherently embed unwanted lighting artifacts (at the time of capture) into the texture. Therefore, these polluted textures are suboptimal for a synthetic environment to enable realistic rendering. In addition, these embedded environmental lightings further bring challenges to photo-consistencies across different images that cause image-matching uncertainties. This paper presents a general image formation model for albedo recovery from typical aerial photogrammetric images under natural illuminations and derives the inverse model to resolve the albedo information through inverse rendering intrinsic image decomposition. Our approach builds on the fact that both the sun illumination and scene geometry are estimable in aerial photogrammetry, thus they can provide direct inputs for this ill-posed problem. This physics-based approach does not require additional input other than data acquired through the typical drone-based photogrammetric collection and was shown to favorably outperform existing approaches. We also demonstrate that the recovered albedo image can in turn improve typical image processing tasks in photogrammetry such as feature and dense matching, edge, and line extraction.</description>

      <title>Incorporating dense metric depth into neural 3D representations for view synthesis and relighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthesizing accurate geometry and photo-realistic appearance of small scenes is an active area of research with compelling use cases in gaming, virtual reality, robotic-manipulation, autonomous driving, convenient product capture, and consumer-level photography. When applying scene geometry and appearance estimation techniques to robotics, we found that the narrow cone of possible viewpoints due to the limited range of robot motion and scene clutter caused current estimation techniques to produce poor quality estimates or even fail. On the other hand, in robotic applications, dense metric depth can often be measured directly using stereo and illumination can be controlled. Depth can provide a good initial estimate of the object geometry to improve reconstruction, while multi-illumination images can facilitate relighting. In this work we demonstrate a method to incorporate dense metric depth into the training of neural 3D representations and address an artifact observed while jointly refining geometry and appearance by disambiguating between texture and geometry edges. We also discuss a multi-flash stereo camera system developed to capture the necessary data for our pipeline and show results on relighting and view synthesis with a few training views.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Matrix Visualization for Understanding Tree Ensemble Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high performance of tree ensemble classifiers benefits from a large set of rules, which, in turn, makes the models hard to understand. To improve interpretability, existing methods extract a subset of rules for approximation using model reduction techniques. However, by focusing on the reduced rule set, these methods often lose fidelity and ignore anomalous rules that, despite their infrequency, play crucial roles in real-world applications. This paper introduces a scalable visual analysis method to explain tree ensemble classifiers that contain tens of thousands of rules. The key idea is to address the issue of losing fidelity by adaptively organizing the rules as a hierarchy rather than reducing them. To ensure the inclusion of anomalous rules, we develop an anomaly-biased model reduction method to prioritize these rules at each hierarchical level. Synergized with this hierarchical organization of rules, we develop a matrix-based hierarchical visualization to support exploration at different levels of detail. Our quantitative experiments and case studies demonstrate how our method fosters a deeper understanding of both common and anomalous rules, thereby enhancing interpretability without sacrificing comprehensiveness.</description>

      <title>Mastoidectomy Multi-View Synthesis from a Single Microscopy Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cochlear Implant (CI) procedures involve performing an invasive mastoidectomy to insert an electrode array into the cochlea. In this paper, we introduce a novel pipeline that is capable of generating synthetic multi-view videos from a single CI microscope image. In our approach, we use a patient's pre-operative CT scan to predict the post-mastoidectomy surface using a method designed for this purpose. We manually align the surface with a selected microscope frame to obtain an accurate initial pose of the reconstructed CT mesh relative to the microscope. We then perform UV projection to transfer the colors from the frame to surface textures. Novel views of the textured surface can be used to generate a large dataset of synthetic frames with ground truth poses. We evaluated the quality of synthetic views rendered using Pytorch3D and PyVista. We found both rendering engines lead to similarly high-quality synthetic novel-view frames compared to ground truth with a structural similarity index for both methods averaging about 0.86. A large dataset of novel views with known poses is critical for ongoing training of a method to automatically estimate microscope pose for 2D to 3D registration with the pre-operative CT to facilitate augmented reality surgery. This dataset will empower various downstream tasks, such as integrating Augmented Reality (AR) in the OR, tracking surgical tools, and supporting other video analysis studies.</description>

      <title>Geometry Image Diffusion: Fast and Data-Efficient Text-to-3D with Image-Based Surface Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating high-quality 3D objects from textual descriptions remains a challenging problem due to computational cost, the scarcity of 3D data, and complex 3D representations. We introduce Geometry Image Diffusion (GIMDiffusion), a novel Text-to-3D model that utilizes geometry images to efficiently represent 3D shapes using 2D images, thereby avoiding the need for complex 3D-aware architectures. By integrating a Collaborative Control mechanism, we exploit the rich 2D priors of existing Text-to-Image models such as Stable Diffusion. This enables strong generalization even with limited 3D training data (allowing us to use only high-quality training data) as well as retaining compatibility with guidance techniques such as IPAdapter. In short, GIMDiffusion enables the generation of 3D assets at speeds comparable to current Text-to-Image models. The generated objects consist of semantically meaningful, separate parts and include internal structures, enhancing both usability and versatility.</description>

      <title>G-Style: Stylized Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce G-Style, a novel algorithm designed to transfer the style of an image onto a 3D scene represented using Gaussian Splatting. Gaussian Splatting is a powerful 3D representation for novel view synthesis, as -- compared to other approaches based on Neural Radiance Fields -- it provides fast scene renderings and user control over the scene. Recent pre-prints have demonstrated that the style of Gaussian Splatting scenes can be modified using an image exemplar. However, since the scene geometry remains fixed during the stylization process, current solutions fall short of producing satisfactory results. Our algorithm aims to address these limitations by following a three-step process: In a pre-processing step, we remove undesirable Gaussians with large projection areas or highly elongated shapes. Subsequently, we combine several losses carefully designed to preserve different scales of the style in the image, while maintaining as much as possible the integrity of the original scene content. During the stylization process and following the original design of Gaussian Splatting, we split Gaussians where additional detail is necessary within our scene by tracking the gradient of the stylized color. Our experiments demonstrate that G-Style generates high-quality stylizations within just a few minutes, outperforming existing methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.</description>

      <title>Deep Neural Implicit Representation of Accessibility for Multi-Axis Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the main concerns in design and process planning for multi-axis additive and subtractive manufacturing is collision avoidance between moving objects (e.g., tool assemblies) and stationary objects (e.g., a part unified with fixtures). The collision measure for various pairs of relative rigid translations and rotations between the two pointsets can be conceptualized by a compactly supported scalar field over the 6D non-Euclidean configuration space. Explicit representation and computation of this field is costly in both time and space. If we fix $O(m)$ sparsely sampled rotations (e.g., tool orientations), computation of the collision measure field as a convolution of indicator functions of the 3D pointsets over a uniform grid (i.e., voxelized geometry) of resolution $O(n^3)$ via fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) scales as in $O(mn^3 \log n)$ in time and $O(mn^3)$ in space. In this paper, we develop an implicit representation of the collision measure field via deep neural networks (DNNs). We show that our approach is able to accurately interpolate the collision measure from a sparse sampling of rotations, and can represent the collision measure field with a small memory footprint. Moreover, we show that this representation can be efficiently updated through fine-tuning to more efficiently train the network on multi-resolution data, as well as accommodate incremental changes to the geometry (such as might occur in iterative processes such as topology optimization of the part subject to CNC tool accessibility constraints).</description>

      <title>GarmentCodeData: A Dataset of 3D Made-to-Measure Garments With Sewing Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17609v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research interest in the learning-based processing of garments, from virtual fitting to generation and reconstruction, stumbles on a scarcity of high-quality public data in the domain. We contribute to resolving this need by presenting the first large-scale synthetic dataset of 3D made-to-measure garments with sewing patterns, as well as its generation pipeline. GarmentCodeData contains 115,000 data points that cover a variety of designs in many common garment categories: tops, shirts, dresses, jumpsuits, skirts, pants, etc., fitted to a variety of body shapes sampled from a custom statistical body model based on CAESAR, as well as a standard reference body shape, applying three different textile materials. To enable the creation of datasets of such complexity, we introduce a set of algorithms for automatically taking tailor's measures on sampled body shapes, sampling strategies for sewing pattern design, and propose an automatic, open-source 3D garment draping pipeline based on a fast XPBD simulator, while contributing several solutions for collision resolution and drape correctness to enable scalability.
