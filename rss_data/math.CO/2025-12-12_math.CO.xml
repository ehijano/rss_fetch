      <title>Small palindromic lengths in free groups and word equations with antimorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The palindromic length of a finite word $w$ is defined as the minimal number of palindromes such that their product is $w$. Clearly, this function may take different values depending on if we consider $w$ as an element a free semigroup or of a free group: for example, in the free semigroup, the palindromic length of $abca$ is 4 (here every letter is a palindrome), and in the free group, it is 3 since $abca=(aba)(a^{-1}a^{-1})(aca)$.
  In free semigroups, the palindromic length can clearly be computed, and there are fast algorithms for that. In free groups, the question is trickier. In this paper, we characterize words in the free group whose palindromic length is 2 and 3.</description>

      <title>Yoshinaga's criterion and the Varchenko--Gelfand algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central question in the theory of hyperplane arrangements is when the complement of a complex arrangement is aspherical. Yoshinaga provides a necessary condition in the case of complexifications of real arrangements, which he formulates purely combinatorially. We show that Yoshinaga's criterion is equivalent to a natural statement about the Varchenko-Gelfand ring, which in practice allows for fast calculation. We conclude with an investigation of the relationships between various properties of arrangements, including Yoshinaga's criterion and the asphericity of the arrangement complement.</description>

      <title>Squares of subcubic planar graphs without cycles of length 4-8 are 6-choosable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The {\em square} of a graph $G$, denoted $G^2$, has the same vertex set as $G$ and an edge between any two vertices at distance at most $2$ in $G$. Wegner (1977) conjectured that for a planar graph $G$, $\chi(G^2) \leq 7$ if $\Delta(G) = 3$, $\chi(G^2) \leq \Delta(G)+5$ if $4 \leq \Delta(G) \leq 7$, and $\chi(G^2) \leq \lfloor 3\Delta(G)/2 \rfloor$ if $\Delta(G) \geq 8$, and Thomassen (2018) confirmed the conjecture for $\Delta(G) = 3$. Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k et al. (2008) and Feder et al. (2021) further conjectured that $\chi(G^2) \leq 6$ for cubic bipartite planar graphs. A natural question is whether this bound also holds for the list-chromatic number, i.e., whether $\chi_{\ell}(G^2) \leq 6$ for such graphs. More generally, it is of interest to determine sufficient conditions ensuring $\chi_{\ell}(G^2) \leq 6$ for subcubic planar graphs. In this paper, we prove that $\chi_{\ell}(G^2) \leq 6$ for subcubic planar graphs containing no $k$-cycles for $4 \leq k \leq 8$, improving a result of Cranston and Kim (2008).</description>

      <title>Bell coloring graphs: realizability and reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, the Bell $k$-coloring graph $\mathcal{B}_k(G)$ has vertices given by partitions of $V(G)$ into $k$ independent sets (allowing empty parts), with two partitions adjacent if they differ only in the placement of a single vertex. We first give a structural classification of cliques in Bell coloring graphs. We then show that all trees and all cycles arise as Bell coloring graphs, while $K_4-e$ is not a Bell coloring graph and, more generally, $K_n-e$ is not an induced subgraph of any Bell coloring graph whenever $n \geq 6$. We also prove two reconstruction results: the Bell $3$-coloring graph is a complete invariant for trees, and the Bell $n$-coloring multigraph determines any graph up to universal vertices.</description>

      <title>Andr{\'a}sfai--Erd\H{o}s--S\'{o}s theorem under max-degree constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the following strengthening of the celebrated Andr{\'a}sfai--Erd\H{o}s--S\'{o}s theorem: If $G$ is an $n$-vertex $K_{r+1}$-free graph whose minimum degree $\delta(G)$ and maximum degree $\Delta(G)$ satisfy
  \begin{align*}
  \delta(G) &gt; \min \left\{ \frac{3r-4}{3r-2}n-\frac{\Delta(G)}{3r-2},~n-\frac{\Delta(G)+1}{r-1} \right\},
  \end{align*}
  then $G$ is $r$-partite. This bound is tight for all feasible values of $\Delta(G)$. We also obtain an analogous tight result for graphs with large odd girth.
  Our proof does not rely on the Andr{\'a}sfai--Erd\H{o}s--S\'{o}s theorem itself, and therefore yields an alternative proof of this classical result.</description>

      <title>Diagonal Simplicial Tensor Modules and Algebraic $n$-Hypergroupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a commutative ring, $k\in\mathbb{Z}^+$, and $\vec{s}=(n_1,\dots,n_k)\in(\mathbb{Z}^+)^k$ with $n=\min(\vec{s})-1$. We attach to $\vec{s}$ a diagonal simplicial tensor module $X_\bullet(\vec{s};A)$ whose $p$-simplices are functions on a cosimplicial index set $I_p(\vec{s})\subseteq\mathbb{N}^k$. This extends Quillen's diagonal on double simplicial groups to $k$ commuting directions in $\mathbf{Mod}_A$, compatibly with Dold--Kan normalization.
  We analyze the horn kernels $R_{p,j}(X)$ via ``missing indices'' and show that $R_{p,j}(X)\neq 0$ if and only if $k\ge p$, independently of $j$. It follows that $X_\bullet(\vec{s};A)$ is an algebraic $n$-hypergroupoid in the sense of Duskin--Glenn precisely when $k\le n$, and that horn fillers in dimension $n$ are non-unique precisely when $k\ge n$; in particular $X_\bullet(\vec{s};A)$ is \emph{strict} in our sense precisely when $k=n$. A Horn Non-Degeneracy Lemma then shows that $R_{n,j}(X)\cap D_n=\{0\}$ and yields a decomposition $X_n=R_{n,j}(X)\oplus D_n$. A shift-and-truncate chain homotopy, $\operatorname{Stab}(\vec{s})$-equivariant and filtration-preserving, shows that $X_\bullet(\vec{s};A)$ is contractible and forces the associated spectral sequence to collapse at $E_1$.
  When $A$ is an infinite field $K$, we classify simplicial submodules generated by a single tensor via kernel sequences and a moduli map to a product of Grassmannians, obtaining an irreducible and unirational incidence variety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a bounded and graded poset $P$, we show that if $P$ is EL-shellable, then so is its $t$-fold Segre power $P^{(t)}=P\circ \cdots \circ P$ ($t$ factors), as defined by Bj\"orner and Welker [J. Pure Appl. Algebra, 198(1-3), 43--55 (2005)]. Our EL-labeling leads to formulas for the rank-selected invariants of $P^{(t)}$, generalising those given by Stanley for the subspace lattice [J. Combinatorial Theory Ser. A, 20(3):336-356, 1976].</description>

      <title>Spectral bounds for vertex-weighted Laplacians of simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vertex-weighted Laplacian naturally extends the combinatorial Laplacian for simplicial complexes. Inspired by Lew's foundational techniques for vertex-weighted Laplacians, we present a comprehensive spectral analysis of this operator. First, we determine how basic operations, including joins, complements, and Alexander duals, affect its spectrum. This yields a sharp upper bound on the spectral radius in terms of vertex weights, along with a lower bound on the multiplicity at which this bound is attained. Second, we establish a sharp lower bound for the spectral gap and characterize when the equality holds. Third, explicit lower bounds for the remaining eigenvalues are derived, linking the vertex-weighted Laplacian spectrum to that of a related weighted graph. Finally, we reveal new spectral relations between a simplicial complex and its subcomplexes. These results not only generalize numerous known theorems on combinatorial Laplacians but also provide deeper spectral insights into simplicial structures, ultimately unifying and extending a broad range of earlier work in this field.</description>

      <title>Color-avoiding Ramsey for directed paths and vector sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two closely related Ramsey-type questions. The first is about vectors: how long can a sequence of vectors in $[n]^q$ be if, for all pairs in the sequence, the later vector is strictly larger than the earlier in at least $q-1$ coordinates? The second is graph-theoretic: given a $q$-edge-coloring of a tournament, how long of a directed path can we guarantee whose edges avoid one of the colors? These problems arise naturally in many areas, such as convex geometry and extremal hypergraph theory, and have been extensively studied over the past 50 years.
  We prove that if $\varepsilon&gt;0$ is fixed and $q$ is sufficiently large, then every $N$-vertex tournament contains a color-avoiding directed path of length $N^{1-\varepsilon}$. Consequently, the maximum length of a $(q-1)$-increasing sequence of vectors in $[n]^q$ has length at most $n^{1+\varepsilon}$. Our results answer a question of Gowers and Long, strengthen several of their results, and extend earlier works of Tiskin and Loh.</description>

      <title>On the $P$-vertex problem in Bipartite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Property $(P)$, introduced in recent work and rooted in the classical theory of Parter vertices, concerns the existence of a nonsingular matrix $A\in S(G)$ for which every vertex of $G$ is a $P$-vertex. Previous investigations have fully characterized the property for trees, established it for cycles, extended it to unicyclic graphs, and shown that bipartite graphs with a perfect matching always satisfy property $(P)$. However, whether the converse holds for connected bipartite graphs remains open in general.
  In this paper, we make progress toward answering this question on multiple fronts. We first prove that every connected bipartite graph satisfying property $(P)$ must be balanced, providing a fundamental necessary condition. We further establish complete characterizations for several significant families of bipartite graphs. Specially, we show that every connected bipartite graph of order at most $8$ has property $(P)$ if and only if it has a perfect matching, and more generally, that a connected bipartite graph of order $8+2k$ with at least $k$ pendant edges satisfies property $(P)$ exactly when it has a perfect matching. We further prove that within the class of triangular bipartite graphs, property $(P)$ is equivalent to the existence of a perfect matching, providing a full characterization for this broad structural subclass.
  In addition, we introduce the threaded union over a graph, a general operation for assembling larger graphs from smaller components, and show that threaded union over a tree--cycle block graph preserves property $(P)$. This significantly generalizes earlier result about joining two graphs with property $(P)$ by a single edge preserves property $(P)$.</description>

      <title>On Neutral Edge Sets in Anti-Ramsey Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anti-Ramsey number of a graph $G$, introduced by Erd\H{o}s et al.\ in 1975, is the maximum number of colors in an edge-coloring of the complete graph $K_n$ that avoids a rainbow copy of $G$. We call a subset of edges of $G$ \emph{neutral} for the anti-Ramsey number if removing them does not alter the anti-Ramsey number of $G$. Let $k$, $t$, and $n$ be positive integers, and consider $G = kP_4 \cup tP_2$. Assume $S \subseteq E(G)$ consists of internal edges of the $P_4$ components in $G$. It is known that $S$ is neutral when $t \geq k+1 \geq 2$ and $n \geq 8k + 2t - 4$. In this paper, we identify values of $k \geq t$ such that, for all $n$ in a specific subinterval of $[8k + 2t - 4, \infty)$, $S$ remains neutral. Since the anti-Ramsey numbers for matchings are well understood, our results provide a complete determination of the anti-Ramsey number for $G$ under these conditions. Based on our findings, we conjecture that this neutrality may extend to the general case $t \geq 1$, $k \geq 1$, and $n \geq 4k + 2t$, but not when $t = 0$, $k \geq 2$, and $n \geq 4k$.</description>

      <title>Vertex-distinguishing edge coloring of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k \ge 1$ be an integer and let $G$ be a nonempty simple graph. An \emph{edge-$k$-coloring} $\varphi$ of $G$ is an assignment of colors from $\{1,\ldots,k\}$ to the edges of $G$ such that no two adjacent edges receive the same color. For a vertex $v \in V(G)$, we write $\varphi(v)$ for the set of colors assigned to the edges incident with $v$. The coloring $\varphi$ is called \emph{vertex-distinguishing} if $\varphi(u) \ne \varphi(v)$ for every pair of distinct vertices $u,v \in V(G)$. A vertex-distinguishing edge-$k$-coloring exists if and only if $G$ has at most one isolated vertex and no isolated edge. The least integer $k$ for which such a coloring exists is called the \emph{vertex-distinguishing chromatic index} of $G$, denoted $\chi'_{vd}(G)$. In 1997, Burris and Schelp conjectured that for every graph $G$ with at most one isolated vertex and no isolated edge, $ k(G) \;\le\; \chi'_{vd}(G) \;\le\; k(G)+1$, where $k(G)$ is the natural lower bound required for a vertex-distinguishing coloring in $G$. In 2004, Balister, Kostochka, Li, and Schelp verified the conjecture for graphs $G$ satisfying $\Delta(G) \ge \sqrt{2|V(G)|} + 4 $ and $\delta(G) \ge 5$. For graphs that do not satisfy these conditions, the best known general upper bound on $\chi'_{vd}(G)$ remains $|V(G)| + 1$, established in 1999 by Bazgan, Harkat-Benhamdine, Li, and Wo\'zniak. In this paper, we prove that $\chi'_{vd}(G) \le \floor{5.5k(G)+6.5}$, which represents a substantial improvement over the bound $|V(G)| + 1$ whenever $k(G) = o(|V(G)|)$. We further show that $\chi'_{vd}(G) \le k(G) + 3$, for all $d$-regular graphs $G$ with $d \ge \log_2 |V(G)|\geq 8$.</description>

      <title>The Coboundary Quasi-Polynomials of Hyperplane Arrangements over Residually Finite Dedekind Domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The characteristic polynomial plays an important role in study of hyperplane arrangements. There are several refinements of the characteristic polynomial. One of them is the coboundary polynomial defined by Crapo. Another refinement is the characteristic quasi-polynomial for an integral arrangement defined by Kamiya, Takemura, and Terao. Recently, the first and third authors introduced the characteristic quasi-polynomial for arrangement defined over a residually finite Dedekind domain.

      <title>Complexity of Linear Subsequences of $k$-Automatic Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct automata with input(s) in base $k$ recognizing some basic relations and study their number of states. We also consider some basic operations on $k$-automatic sequences and discuss their state complexity. We find a relationship between subword complexity of the interior sequence $(h'(i))_{i \geq 0}$ and state complexity of the linear subsequence $(h(ni+c))_{i \geq 0}$. We resolve a recent question of Zantema and Bosma about linear subsequences of $k$-automatic sequences with input in most-significant-digit-first format. We also discuss the state complexity and runtime complexity of using a reasonable interpretation of B\"uchi arithmetic to actually construct some of the studied automata recognizing relations or carrying out operations on automatic sequences.</description>

      <title>Approximate Counting in Local Lemma Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish efficient approximate counting algorithms for several natural problems in local lemma regimes. In particular, we consider the probability of intersection of events and the dimension of intersection of subspaces. Our approach is based on the cluster expansion method. We obtain fully polynomial-time approximation schemes for both the probability of intersection and the dimension of intersection for commuting projectors. For general projectors, we provide two algorithms: a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme under a global inclusion-exclusion stability condition, and an efficient affine approximation under a spectral gap assumption. As corollaries of our results, we obtain efficient algorithms for approximating the number of satisfying assignments of conjunctive normal form formulae and the dimension of satisfying subspaces of quantum satisfiability formulae.</description>

      <title>Improved Small Set Expansion in High Dimensional Expanders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small set expansion in high dimensional expanders is of great importance, e.g., towards proving cosystolic expansion, local testability of codes and constructions of good quantum codes.
  In this work we improve upon the state of the art results of small set expansion in high dimensional expanders. Our improvement is either on the expansion quality or on the size of sets for which expansion is guaranteed.
  One line of previous works [KM22, DD24] has obtained weak expansion for small sets, which is sufficient for deducing cosystolic expansion of one dimension below. We improve upon their result by showing strong expansion for small sets.
  Another line of works [KKL14, EK16, KM21] has shown strong expansion for small sets. However, they obtain it only for very small sets. We get an exponential improvement on the size of sets for which expansion is guaranteed by these prior works.
  Interestingly, our result is obtained by bridging between these two lines of works. The works of [KM22, DD24] use global averaging operators in order to obtain expansion for larger sets. However, their method could be utilized only on sets that are cocycle-like. We show how to combine these global averaging operators with ideas from the so-called ``fat machinery'' of [KKL14, EK16, KM21] in order to apply them for general sets.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a new algorithm for generating planar circle patterns. The algorithm employs gradient descent and conjugate gradient method to compute circle radii and centers separately. Compared with existing algorithms, the proposed method is more efficient in computing centers of circles and is applicable for realizing circle patterns with possible obtuse overlap angles.</description>

      <title>Fano and Reflexive Polytopes from Feynman Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We classify the Fano and reflexive polytopes that arise from quasi-finite Feynman integrals. These polytopes appear as scaled Minkowski sums of the Newton polytopes associated with the Symanzik graph polynomials. For one-loop graphs and multiloop sunset graphs, we identify the Fano and reflexive cases by computing the number of interior points from the associated bivariate Ehrhart polynomials. More generally, we utilize the properties of Symanzik polynomials and their symmetries to conduct a direct search over all Feynman graphs in generic kinematics with up to ten edges and nine loops. We find that such cases are remarkably sparse: for example, we find only two two-dimensional reflexive polytopes, three three-dimensional reflexive polytopes, and four three-dimensional Fano polytopes. We also reveal a surprising feature of one-loop $N$-gon integrals in higher dimensions: their associated reflexive polytopes encode degenerate Calabi--Yau $(N-2)$-folds. We further analyze the geometric structures encoded by these polytopes and exhibit explicit connections with del Pezzo surfaces, $K3$ surfaces, and Calabi--Yau threefolds. Since reflexive polytopes naturally correspond to Calabi--Yau varieties, our classification demonstrates that quasi-finite Feynman integrals, with reflexive polytopes, are intrinsically linked to Calabi--Yau period integrals.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of multidimensional Simple Clock Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simple Clock Auctions (SCA) are a mechanism commonly used in spectrum auctions to sell lots of frequency bandwidths. We study such an auction with one player having access to perfect information against straightforward bidders. When the opponents' valuations satisfy the ordinary substitutes condition, we show that it is optimal to bid on a fixed lot overtime. In this setting, we consider a continuous-time version of the SCA auction in which the prices follow a differential inclusion with a piecewise-constant dynamics. We show that there exists a unique solution in the sense of Filippov. This guarantees that the continuous-time model coincides with the limit of the discrete-time auction when price increments tend to zero. Moreover, we show that the value function of this limit auction is piecewise linear (though possibly discontinuous). Finally, we illustrate these results by analyzing a simplified version of the multiband Australian spectrum auction of 2017.</description>

Abstract: Let $\operatorname{spt}(n)$ be the number of smallest parts in the partitions of $n$. In this paper, we give some generalized Euler-like recursive formulas for the $\operatorname{spt}$ function in terms of Hecke trace of values of special twisted quadratic Dirichlet series. As a corollary, we give a closed form expressions of the power series $\sum_{n\geq 0}\operatorname{spt}(\ell n-\delta_{\ell})q^n\pmod{\ell}$, $\delta_{\ell}:=(\ell^2-1)/24$, by Hecke traces for weight $\ell+1 $ cusp forms on $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$. We further establish an incongruence result for the $\operatorname{spt}$ function.</description>

      <title>A tree bijection for cusp-less planar hyperbolic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a tree bijection has been found for planar hyperbolic surfaces, which allows for an easy computation of the Weil--Petersson volumes, and opens the path to get distance statistic on random hyperbolic surfaces and to find scaling limits when the number of boundaries becomes large. Crucially, this tree bijection requires the hyperbolic surface to have at least one cusp as origin, from which point distances are measured. In this paper we will extend this tree bijection, such that having a cusp is no longer required. We will first extend the bijection to half-tight cylinders. Since general planar hyperbolic surfaces can be naturally decomposed in two half-tight cylinders, this general case is also covered. In the half-tight cylinder the distances to the origin are replaced by the so-called Busemann function. This Busemann function is not well-defined on the surface, but it is on the cylinder cover.</description>

      <title>Rank-based linkage I: triplet comparisons and oriented simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02200v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rank-based linkage is a new tool for summarizing a collection $S$ of objects according to their relationships. These objects are not mapped to vectors, and ``similarity'' between objects need be neither numerical nor symmetrical. All an object needs to do is rank nearby objects by similarity to itself, using a Comparator which is transitive, but need not be consistent with any metric on the whole set. Call this a ranking system on $S$. Rank-based linkage is applied to the $K$-nearest neighbor digraph derived from a ranking system. Computations occur on a 2-dimensional abstract oriented simplicial complex whose faces are among the points, edges, and triangles of the line graph of the undirected $K$-nearest neighbor graph on $S$. In $|S| K^2$ steps it builds an edge-weighted linkage graph $(S, \mathcal{L}, \sigma)$ where $\sigma(\{x, y\})$ is called the in-sway between objects $x$ and $y$. Take $\mathcal{L}_t$ to be the links whose in-sway is at least $t$, and partition $S$ into components of the graph $(S, \mathcal{L}_t)$, for varying $t$. Rank-based linkage is a functor from a category of ``out-ordered'' digraphs to a category of partitioned sets, with the practical consequence that augmenting the set of objects in a rank-respectful way gives a fresh clustering which does not ``rip apart'' the previous one. The same holds for single linkage clustering in the metric space context, but not for typical optimization-based methods. Orientation sheaves play in a fundamental role and ensure that partially overlapping data sets can be ``glued'' together. Open combinatorial problems are presented in the last section.</description>

Abstract: The {\it inversion} of a set $X$ of vertices in a digraph $D$ consists of reversing the direction of all arcs of $D\langle X\rangle$. We study $sinv'_k(D)$ (resp. $sinv_k(D)$) which is the minimum number of inversions needed to transform $D$ into a $k$-arc-strong (resp. $k$-strong) digraph and $sinv'_k(n) = \max\{sinv'_k(D) \mid D~\mbox{is a $2k$-edge-connected digraph of order $n$}\}$. We show :
  $(i): \frac{1}{2} \log (n - k+1) \leq sinv'_k(n) \leq \log n + 4k -3$ ;
  $(ii):$ for any fixed positive integers $k$ and $t$, deciding whether a given oriented graph $D$ with $sinv'_k(D)&lt;+\infty$ satisfies $sinv'_k(D) \leq t$ is NP-complete;
  $(iii):$ for any fixed positive integers $k$ and $t$, deciding whether a given oriented graph $D$ with $sinv_k(D)&lt;+\infty$ satisfies $sinv_k(D) \leq t$ is NP-complete;
  $(iv):$ if $T$ is a tournament of order at least $2k+1$, then $sinv'_k(T) \leq sinv_k(T) \leq 2k$, and $sinv'_k(T) \leq \frac{4}{3}k+o(k)$;
  $(v):\frac{1}{2}\log(2k+1) \leq sinv'_k(T) \leq sinv_k(T)$ for some tournament $T$ of order $2k+1$;
  $(vi):$ if $T$ is a tournament of order at least $19k-2$ (resp. $11k-2$), then $sinv'_k(T) \leq sinv_k(T) \leq 1$ (resp. $sinv_k(T) \leq 3$);
  $(vii):$ for every $\epsilon&gt;0$, there exists $C$ such that $sinv'_k(T) \leq sinv_k(T) \leq C$ for every tournament $T$ on at least $2k+1 + \epsilon k$ vertices.</description>

Abstract: Segre products of posets were defined by Bj\"orner and Welker (2005). We investigate the homology representations of the $t$-fold Segre power $B_n^{(t)}$ of the Boolean lattice $B_n$. The direct product $\sym_n^{\times t}$ of the symmetric group $\sym_n$ acts on the homology of rank-selected subposets of $B_n^{(t)}$. We give an explicit formula for the decomposition into $\sym_n^{\times t}$-irreducibles of the homology of the full poset, as well as formulas for the diagonal action of the symmetric group $\sym_n$. For the rank-selected homology, we show that the stable principal specialisation of the product Frobenius characteristic of the $\sym_n^{\times t}$-module coincides with the corresponding rank-selected invariant of the $t$-fold Segre power of the subspace lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06595v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that any lower unitriangular and totally nonnegative matrix gives rise to a family of polynomials with only real zeros. This has consequences for problems in several areas of mathematics. We use it to develop a general theory for chain enumeration in posets and zeros of chain polynomials. The results obtained extend and unify results of the first author, Brenti, Welker and Athanasiadis. In the process we define a notion of $h$-vectors for a large class of posets which generalize the notions of $h$-vectors associated to simplicial and cubical complexes. A consequence of our methods is a characterization of the convex hull of all characteristic polynomials of hyperplane arrangements of fixed dimension and over a fixed finite field. This may be seen as a refinement of the Critical Problem of Crapo and Rota.
  We also use the methods developed to answer an open problem posed by Forg\'acs and Tran on the real-rootedness of polynomials arising from certain bivariate rational functions.</description>

Abstract: Athanasiadis and Kalampogia-Evangelinou recently conjectured that the chain polynomial of any geometric lattice has only real zeros. We verify this conjecture for families of geometric lattices including perfect matroid designs, Dowling lattices, and for a class of geometric lattices that contains all lattices of flats of paving matroids. We also investigate how the conjecture behaves with respect to certain operations such as direct products, ordinal sums and single-element extensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $d\ge3$ and $\mathbb{F}_q^{\,d}$ be the $d$-dimensional vector space over a finite field of order $q$, where $q$ is an odd prime power. Let $X_\pi$ be the set of lines through the origin intersecting the slice $\pi\cap S^{d-1}$, where $\pi=\{x_d=\lambda\}$ and $S^{d-1}=\{x:\|x\|=1\}$. For $E\subset\mathbb{F}_q^{\,d}$ and $N\ge1$, we study the exceptional sets \[ T_1(X_\pi,E,N)=\bigl\{V\in X_\pi:\ |\pi_V(E)|\le N\bigr\},\qquad T_2(X_\pi,E,N)=\bigl\{V\in X_\pi:\ |\pi_{V^\perp}(E)|\le N\bigr\}, \] with their respective natural ranges of $N$. Using discrete Fourier analysis together with restriction/extension estimates for cone and sphere-type quadrics over finite fields, we obtain sharp upper bounds (up to constant factors) for $\lvert T_1\rvert$ and $\lvert T_2\rvert$, with separate analyses for the cases $\lambda \in \{0, \pm 1\}$. The bounds exhibit arithmetic-geometric dichotomies absent in the full Grassmannian: the quadratic character of $\lambda^{2}-1$ and the parity of $d$ determine the size of the exceptional sets. As an application, when $|E|\ge q$, there exists a positive proportion of elements $\mathbf{y}\in \pi\cap S^{d-1}$ such that the pinned dot-product sets $\{\mathbf{y}\cdot \mathbf{x}\colon \mathbf{x}\in E\}$ have cardinality $\Omega(q)$. We further study analogous families arising from the spheres of radii $0$ and $-1$, and, by combining the results, recover the known estimates for projections over the full Grassmannian, complementing a result of Chen (2018).</description>

Abstract: According to a study by Erd\H{o}s et al. in 1975, the anti-Ramsey number of a graph \(G\), denoted as \(AR(n, G)\), is defined as the maximum number of colors that can be used in an edge-coloring of the complete graph \(K_n\) without creating a rainbow copy of \(G\). In this paper, we investigate the anti-Ramsey number under edge deletion and demonstrate that both decreasing and unchanging are possible outcomes. For three non-negative integers \(k\), \(t\), and \(n\), let \(G = kP_4 \cup tP_2\). Let \(E'\) be a subset of the edge set \(E(G)\) such that every endpoint of these edges has a degree of two in \(G\). We prove that if one of the conditions (i) \(t \geq k + 1 \geq 2\) and \(n \geq 8k + 2t - 4\); (ii) \(k, t \geq 1\) and \(n = 4k + 2t\); (iii) \(k = 1\), \(t \geq 1\), and \(n \geq 2t + 4\), occurs then the behavior of the anti-Ramsey number remains consistent when the edges in \(E'\) are removed from \(G\), i.e., \(AR(n, G) = AR(n, G - E')\). However, this is not the case when \(k \geq 2\), \(t = 0\), and \(n=4k\). As a result, we calculate \(AR(kP_4 \cup tP_2)\) for the cases: (i) \(t \geq k + 1 \geq 2\) and \(n \geq 8k + 2t - 4\); (ii) \(k, t \geq 1\) and \(n = 4k + 2t\); (iii) \(k = 1\), \(t \geq 0\), and \(n \geq 2t + 4\); (iv) \(k \geq 1\), \(t = 0\), and \(n = 4k\).</description>

      <title>Edge density and minimum degree thresholds for $H$-free graphs with unbounded chromatic number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chromatic threshold $\delta_\chi(H)$ of a graph $H$ is the infimum of $d&gt;0$ such that the chromatic number of every $n$-vertex $H$-free graph with minimum degree at least $dn$ is bounded in terms of $H$ and $d$. A breakthrough result of Allen, B\"ottcher, Griffiths, Kohayakawa, and Morris determined $\delta_\chi(H)$ for every graph $H$; in particular, if $\chi(H)=r\ge 3$, then $\delta_\chi(H) \in\{\frac{r-3}{r-2},~\frac{2 r-5}{2 r-3},~\frac{r-2}{r-1}\}$.
  In this paper we investigate the trade-off between minimum degree and edge density in the critical window around the chromatic threshold. For a fixed graph $H$ with $\chi(H)=r$, allowing a constant deficit below $\delta_\chi(H)$, we prove sharp (up to lower-order terms) upper bounds on the edge density of $n$-vertex $H$-free graphs whose chromatic number diverges. Equivalently, within this degree regime we show that a suitable global bound on the number of edges forces the chromatic number to remain bounded. Our results thus quantify how global edge density can compensate for a deficit in the local minimum-degree condition near $\delta_\chi(H)$; more specifically, we obtain explicit bounds in two of the three possible cases arising in the trichotomy of $\delta_\chi(H)$. Our extremal constructions -- based on Erd\H{o}s graphs and blowups of Borsuk--Hajnal graphs -- show that these bounds are best possible up to $o(n^2)$ terms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss formulas for the asymptotic growth rate of the number of summands in tensor powers in certain (finite or infinite) monoidal categories. Our focus is on monoidal categories with infinitely many indecomposable objects, with our main tools being generalized Perron-Frobenius theory alongside techniques from random walks.</description>

      <title>Service Rate Regions of MDS Codes &amp; Fractional Matchings in Quasi-uniform Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The service rate region (SRR) has emerged as a critical performance metric for distributed systems that store data redundantly. It measures the system's ability to serve multiple users concurrently. Mathematically, the SRR is a polytope in R^k where each dimension corresponds to the service request rate of one of the k data objects. This paper focuses on systems employing a class of Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes. For each code in the class, we characterize the k axes intercept points of its SRR, and the smallest standard simplex that includes the SRR. We use these results to show that the SRR grows with the increasing number of systematic columns in the generator matrices. We establish a graph-theoretic framework associating this SRR problem with fractional matchings in quasi-uniform hypergraphs. Identifying the SRR polytope is equivalent to determining a particular image of the fractional-matching polytope. We introduce a notion of Greedy Matching and show that it is sufficient to focus on these matchings to characterize the SRR rather than the entire matching polytope. With these tools, we determine the SRR of a large subset of the considered class of codes. Our results generalize previous characterizations of systematic and non-systematic MDS-coded systems, offering a unified framework for analyzing service rate regions of codes.</description>

      <title>Proof of a magnificent conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by super-Yang-Mills theory on a Calabi-Yau 4-fold, Nekrasov and Piazzalunga have assigned weights to $r$-tuples of solid partitions and conjectured a formula for their weighted generating function.
  We define $K$-theoretic virtual invariants of Quot schemes of 0-dimensional quotients of $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{C}^4}^{\oplus r}$ by realizing them as zero loci of isotropic sections of orthogonal bundles on non-commutative Quot schemes. Via the Oh-Thomas localization formula, we recover Nekrasov-Piazzalunga's weights and derive their sign rule.
  Our proof passes through refining the $K$-theoretic invariants to sheaves and describing them via Clifford modules, which lets us show that they arise from a factorizable sequence of sheaves in the sense of Okounkov. Taking limits of the equivariant parameters, we then deduce the Nekrasov-Piazzalunga conjecture from its 3-dimensional analog.</description>

      <title>A Nakayama result for the quantum K theory of homogeneous spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the ideal of relations in the (equivariant) quantum K ring of a homogeneous space is generated by quantizations of each of the generators of the ideal in the classical (equivariant) K ring. This extends to quantum K theory a result of Siebert and Tian in quantum cohomology. We illustrate this technique in the case of the quantum K ring of partial flag manifolds, using a set of quantum K Whitney relations conjectured by the authors, and recently proved by Huq-Kuruvilla.</description>

      <title>Threshold Graphs Are Globally Synchronizing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kuramoto model describes phase oscillators on the unit circle whose interactions are encoded by a graph. Each edge acts like a spring that pulls the two adjacent oscillators toward each other whenever their phases differ. A central question is to determine which graphs are globally synchronizing, meaning that trajectories of the Kuramoto dynamics converge to the fully synchronized state from almost all initial conditions, except for a set of measure zero. This property is tightly linked to the benign nonconvexity of the model's energy landscape. Existing guarantees for global synchronization rely on minimum-degree thresholds, which require the graph to be highly dense. In this work, we show that connected threshold graphs, whose density may vary from $2/n$ to $1$, are globally synchronizing. Our proof relies on a phasor-geometric analysis of the stationary points of the associated energy landscape.</description>

Abstract: A characterization is completed for finite groups acting arc-transitively on maps with square-free Euler characteristic, associated with infinite families of regular maps of square-free Euler characteristic presented. This is based on a classification of finite groups of which each Sylow subgroup has a cyclic or dihedral subgroup of prime index.</description>
