      <title>Comparative Analysis of Single Charged Particle Production in Proton-Carbon Interactions at High Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of charged pions, kaons, and protons from proton beam incident on Carbon at 31 GeV/c is calculated and compared with the results of the NA61/SHINE experiment. Predictions of the single charged particle yield by proton off the Carbon target is calculated using the Giessen Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (GiBUU) model and compared with the recent data of the EMPHATIC hadron scattering and production experiment for incident proton beam energies of 20, 30, and 120 GeV/c within $\pm$20 mrad with respect to the beam particle. We present the analysis for the single and double differential cross-sections for the produced particles at various scattering angles and conduct a comprehensive comparison with the experimental data. These studies show significant agreement with the measured data.</description>

      <title>RELICS: a REactor neutrino LIquid xenon Coherent elastic Scattering experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS) provides a unique probe for neutrino properties Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics. REactor neutrino LIquid xenon Coherent Scattering experiment (RELICS), a proposed reactor neutrino program using liquid xenon time projection chamber (LXeTPC) technology, aims to investigate the CEvNS process of antineutrinos off xenon atomic nuclei. In this work, the design of the experiment is studied and optimized based on Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. To achieve a sufficiently low energy threshold for CEvNS detection, an ionization-only analysis channel will be adopted for RELICS. A high emission rate of delayed electrons after a big ionization signal is the major background, leading to an analysis threshold of 120 photo-electrons in the CEvNS search. The second largest background, nuclear recoils induced by cosmic-ray neutrons, is suppressed via a passive water shield. The physics potential of RELICS was explored with a 32 kg-yr exposure at a baseline of 25 m from a reactor core with a 3 GW thermal power. In an energy range of 120 to 240 PEs, we the expected 13673.5 CEvNS and 2133.7 background events.The sensitivity of RELICS to the weak mixing angle was investigated at a low momentum transfer. Our study has shown that RELICS can further improve the constraints on the non-standard neutrino interaction (NSI) compared to the best results. RELICS set out to develop a powerful surface-level detection technology for low-energy neutrinos from reactors.</description>

      <title>Development, Characterization and Production of a novel Water-based Liquid Scintillator based on the Surfactant TRITON X-100</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water-based Liquid Scintillator (WbLS) is a novel detector medium for particle physics experiments. Applications range from the use as hybrid Cherenkov/scintillation target in low-energy and accelerator neutrino experiments to large-volume neutron vetoes for dark matter detectors. Here, we present a novel WbLS featuring new components (the surfactant Triton-X and vitamin C for long-term stability), a new production recipe, and a thorough characterization of its properties. Moreover, based on neutron scattering data we are able to demonstrate that the pulse shape discrimination capabilities of this particular LS are comparable to fully-organic LAB based scintillators.</description>

      <title>Probing CPV mixing in the Higgs sector in VBF at 1 TeV ILC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the current precision of measurements by the ATLAS and CMS experiments, it cannot be excluded that a SM-like Higgs boson is a CP violating mixture of CP-even and CP-odd states. We explore this possibility here, assuming Higgs boson production in ZZ-fusion, at 1 TeV ILC, with unpolarized beams. The full simulation of SM background and fast simulation of the signal is performed, simulating 8 ab$^{-1}$ of data collected with the ILD detector. We demonstrate that the CP mixing angle $\Psi_{\mathrm{CP}}$ between scalar and pseudoscalar states can be measured with the statistical uncertainty of 3.8 mrad at 68% CL, corresponding to 1.44 $\cdot 10^{-5}$ for the CP parameter $f_\mathrm{CP}$, for the pure scalar state. This is the first result on sensitivity of an $e^{+}e^{-}$ collider to measure $f_\mathrm{CP}$ in the Higgs production vertex in vector boson fusion.</description>

      <title>In-medium changes of nucleon cross sections tested in neutrino-induced reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Historically studied in the context of heavy-ion collisions, the extent to which free nucleon-nucleon forces are modified in-medium remains undetermined by these data sets. Therefore, we investigate the impact of NN in-medium modifications on neutrino-nucleus cross section predictions using the GiBUU transport model. We find that including an in-medium lowering of the NN cross section and density dependence on $\Delta$ excitation improves agreement with MicroBooNE neutrino-argon scattering data. This is observed for both proton and neutral pion spectra in charged-current muon neutrino and neutral-current single pion production datasets. The impact of collision broadening of the $\Delta$ resonance is also investigated.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter from Anomaly Cancellation at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a class of theories that predict a fermionic dark matter candidate from gauge anomaly cancellation. As an explicit example, we study the predictions in theories where the global symmetry associated with baryon number is promoted to a local gauge symmetry. In this context the symmetry-breaking scale has to be below the multi-TeV scale in order to be in agreement with the cosmological constraints on the dark matter relic density. The new physical "Cucuyo" Higgs boson in the theory has very interesting properties, decaying mainly into two photons in the low mass region, and mainly into dark matter in the intermediate mass region. We study the most important signatures at the Large Hadron Collider, evaluating the experimental bounds. We discuss the correlation between the dark matter relic density, direct detection and collider constraints. We find that these theories are still viable, and are susceptible to being probed in current, and future high-luminosity, running.</description>

      <title>Quasielastic Lepton-Nucleus Scattering and the Correlated Fermi Gas Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The neutrino research program in the coming decades will require improved precision. A major source of uncertainty is the interaction of neutrinos with nuclei that serve as targets for such experiments. Broadly speaking, this interaction often depends, e.g., for charge-current quasi-elastic scattering, on the combination of ``nucleon physics", expressed by form factors, and ``nuclear physics", expressed by a nuclear model. It is important to get a good handle on both. We present a fully analytic implementation of the Correlated Fermi Gas Model for electron-nucleus and charge-current quasi-elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering. The implementation is used to compare separately form factors and nuclear model effects for both electron-carbon and neutrino-carbon scattering data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The production of multiple Higgs bosons at the LHC and beyond is a strong test of the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking. Taking inspiration from recent experimental efforts to move towards limits on triple Higgs production at the Large Hadron Collider, we consider generic bosonic deviations of $HH$ and $HHH$ production from the Standard Model in the guise of Higgs Effective Field Theory. Including one-loop radiative corrections within the HEFT and going up to ${\mathcal{O}}(p^4)$ in the momentum expansion, we provide a detailed motivation of the parameter range that the LHC (and future hadron colliders) can explore, through accessing non-standard coupling modifications and momentum dependencies that probe Higgs boson non-linearities. In particular, we find that radiative corrections can enhance the sensitivity to Higgs-self coupling modifiers and HEFT-specific momentum dependencies can vastly increase triple Higgs production thus providing further motivation to consider these processes during the LHC's high-luminosity phase.</description>

      <title>Incoherent Fermionic Dark Matter Absorption with Nucleon Fermi Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the incoherent regime of the fermionic dark matter absorption by nuclei using the relativistic Fermi gas model and nuclear form factors. With the momentum transfer being roughly equal to the dark matter mass $m_\chi$, the incoherent regime contributes significantly to the absorption process for $m_\chi \gtrsim 100$ MeV with a spin-independent operator and for even smaller mass with a spin-dependent one. We also compare the situations for various target nuclei ($^{131}$Xe, $^{72}$Ge, $^{40}$Ar, $^{20}$Ne and $^4$He) that are typically used in the dark matter direct detection. A heavier nucleus actually has the advantage of probing the incoherent scattering of the fermionic absorption dark matter. Observing both the coherent and incoherent contributions would be an important justification of the fermionic dark matter absorption.</description>

      <title>Prospects to study hyperon-nucleon interactions at BESIII</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.12601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The prospects to study hyperon-nuclei/nucleon interactions at BESIII and similar $e^+ e^-$ colliders are proposed in this work. Utilizing the large quantity of hyperons produced by the decay of 10 billion $J/\psi$ and 2.7 billion $\psi(3686)$ collected at BESIII, the cross sections of several specific elastic or inelastic hyperon-nuclei reactions can be measured via the scattering between the hyperons and the nucleus in the dense objects of BESIII detector. Subsequently, the cross sections of corresponding hyperon-nucleon interactions are able to be extracted with further phenomenological calculation. Furthermore, the interactions between antihyperon and nuclei/nucleon, including scattering and annihilation, can also be studied via the method proposed in this paper. The results will definitely benefit a lot the precise probe of the hyperon-nuclei/nucleon interactions and provide constraints for the studies of the potential of strong interaction, the origin of color confinement, the unified model for baryon-baryon interactions, and the internal structure of neutron stars. In addition, the desirable prospects of corresponding studies in the future Super Tau-Charm Factory (STCF) are discussed and estimated in this work.</description>

      <title>Determination of the resonant parameters of chi_c0(3915) with global fit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chi_c0(3915) was observed firstly by the Belle experiment in the omega J/psi invariant mass spectrum in the process B -&gt; K omegaJ/psi, and then confirmed by the Babar experiment. The two experiments reported the resonant parameters of this particle in the both processes gammagamma -&gt; omegaJ/psi and B -&gt; K omega J/psi by assuming chi_c0(3915) as a S-wave Breit-Wigner resonance. We perform a global fit to the distributions of invariant mass of omega J/psi measured by the Belle and Babar experiments, and incorporate the measurement by the LHCb experiment additionally to extract the mass and width of chi_c0(3915). We obtain M = 3921.0 +/- 0.9 MeV/c2 and Gamma = 17.9 +/- 2.4 MeV which are consistent with the values on PDG within one standard deviation but with improved precision.</description>

      <title>Exploring light dark matter with the Migdal effect in hydrogen-doped liquid xenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An ongoing challenge in dark matter direct detection is to improve the sensitivity to light dark matter in the MeV--GeV mass range. One proposal is to dope a liquid noble-element direct detection experiment with a lighter element such as hydrogen. This has the advantage of enabling larger recoil energies compared to scattering on a heavy target, while leveraging existing detector technologies. Direct detection experiments can also extend their reach to lower masses by exploiting the Migdal effect, where a nuclear recoil leads to electronic ionisation or excitation. In this work we combine these ideas to study the sensitivity of a hydrogen-doped LZ experiment (HydroX), and a future large-scale experiment such as XLZD. We find that HydroX could have sensitivity to dark matter masses as low as 5~MeV for both spin-independent and spin-dependent scattering, with XLZD extending that reach to lower cross sections. Notably, this technique substantially enhances the sensitivity of direct detection to spin-dependent proton scattering, well beyond the reach of any current experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The best way to probe CP violation in the lepton sector is with long-baseline accelerator neutrino experiments in the appearance mode: the appearance of $\nu_e$ in predominantly $\nu_\mu$ beams. Here we show that it is possible to discover CP violation with disappearance experiments only, by combining JUNO for electron neutrinos and DUNE or Hyper-Kamiokande for muon neutrinos. While the maximum sensitivity to discover CP is quite modest ($1.6\sigma$ with 6 years of JUNO and 13 years of DUNE), some values of $\delta$ may be disfavored by $&gt;3\sigma$ depending on the true value of $\delta$.</description>

      <title>Precise determination of the pole position of the exotic $Z_c(3900)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a unified description of the experimental data of the $\pi^+\pi^-$ and $J/\psi\pi^\pm$ invariant mass spectra for $e^+e^- \rightarrow J/\psi \pi^+\pi^-$ and the $D^0 D^{\ast-}$ mass spectrum for $e^+e^- \rightarrow D^0 D^{\ast-} \pi^+$ at $e^+e^-$ center-of-mass energies 4.23 and 4.26 GeV. The analysis takes into account open-charm meson loops that contain triangle singularities, the $J/\psi\pi$-$D\bar D^*$ coupled-channel interaction respecting unitarity, and the strong $\pi\pi$-$K\bar K$ final state interaction using dispersion relations. The analysis leads to a precise determination of the $Z_c(3900)$ pole with the pole mass and width $(3880.7 \pm 1.7_\text{stat}\pm 22.4_\text{syst})$ MeV and $(35.9 \pm 1.4_\text{stat}\pm 15.3_\text{syst})$ MeV, respectively, and hints at that the $D\bar D^*$ molecular and non-molecular components are of similar importance in the $Z_c(3900)$ formation.</description>
