      <title>Defining 3-dimensional marine provinces with phytoplankton compositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Marine provinces rarely include fine-resolution biological data, and are often defined spatially across only latitude and longitude. Therefore, we aimed to determine how phytoplankton distributions define marine provinces across 3-dimensions (i.e., latitude, longitude, and depth). To do this, we developed a new algorithm called \texttt{bioprovince} which can be applied to compositional biological data. The algorithm first clusters compositional samples to identify spatially coherent groups of samples, then makes flexible province predictions in the broader 3d spatial grid based on environmental similarity. We applied \texttt{bioprovince} to phytoplankton Amplicon Sequencing Variants (ASVs) from five, depth-resolved ocean transects spanning north-south in the Pacific Ocean. In the surface layer of the ocean, our method agreed well with traditional Longhurst provinces. In some cases, the method revealed that with more granular taxonomic resolution afforded by ASVs, traditional Longhurst provinces were divided into smaller zones. Also, one of the major advances of this method is its ability to incorporate a third dimension, depth. Indeed, our analysis found significant depth-wise partitions throughout the Pacific with remarkable agreement in the equatorial region with the base of the euphotic zone. Our algorithm's ability to delineate 3-dimensional bioprovinces will enable scientists to discover new ecological interpretations of marine phytoplankton ecology and biogeography. Furthermore, as compositional biological data inherently exists in three spatial dimensions in nature, bioprovince is broadly applicable beyond marine plankton, offering a more holistic perspective on biological provinces across diverse environments.</description>

      <title>Distribution of Gaps in Multi-lane Orderly and Disorderly Traffic Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To study gap acceptance behaviour one needs the distribution (or probability density function) of gaps in the opposing stream. Further, in these times of widespread availability of large computing powers, traffic simulation has emerged as a popular analysis and design tool. Such simulations rely on randomly generating the arriving vehicles in a way that statistically resembles real-world streams. The generation process for disorderly streams requires information on gap distributions. A study of past literature reveals that very little work has been done to determine the distribution of gaps on multi-lane orderly and disorderly streams. This study aims to develop an analytical framework to specify the distribution of gaps for such streams. This analytical framework is built using the Renewal Process Theory. A maximum likelihood based process for the estimation of the parameters of the analytically derived distribution is also described. Later, real-world gap data from three different sites covering orderly and disorderly streams are used to show how the derived distribution function (using the proposed method) ably describes the observed gap distributions.</description>

      <title>Genetic Regression Analysis of Human Brain Connectivity Using an Efficient Estimator of Genetic Covariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-invasive measurements of the human brain using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have significantly improved our understanding the brain's network organization by enabling measurement of anatomical connections between brain regions (structural connectivity) and their coactivation (functional connectivity). Heritability analyses have established that genetics account for considerable intersubject variability in structural and functional connectivity. However, characterizing how genetics shape the relationship between structural and functional connectomes remains challenging, since this association is obscured by unique environmental exposures in observed data. To address this, we develop a regression analysis framework that enables characterization of the relationship between latent genetic contributions to structural and functional connectivity. Implementing the proposed framework requires estimating genetic covariance matrices in multivariate random effects models, which is computationally intractable for high-dimensional connectome data using existing methods. We introduce a constrained method-of-moments estimator that is several orders of magnitude faster than existing methods without sacrificing estimation accuracy. For the genetic regression analysis, we develop regularized estimation approaches, including ridge, lasso, and tensor regression. Applying our method to Human Connectome Project data, we find that functional connectivity is moderately predictable from structure at the genetic level (max R^2 = 0.34), though it is not directly predictable in the observed data (max R^2 = 0.03). This stark contrast suggests that unique environmental factors mask strong genetically-encoded structure-function relationships.</description>

      <title>Commanding the Foul Shot: A New Ensemble of Free Throw Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the NBA's adoption of in-game limb tracking in 2023, Sony's Hawk-Eye system now captures high-resolution, 3D poses of players and the ball 60 times per second. Linking these data to key events such as shots, passes, and rebounds opens a new era in NBA analytics. Here, we leverage Hawk-Eye tracking to introduce a novel ensemble of metrics for evaluating free-throw shooting and demonstrate that our framework captures skill more effectively than traditional make-or-miss statistics. Inspired by baseball analytics, we introduce command, which quantifies the quality of a free throw by measuring a shooter's accuracy and precision near the basket's bullseye. This metric recognizes that some makes (or misses) are better than others and captures a player's ability to execute quality attempts consistently. To identify what drives command, we define launch-based metrics assessing consistency in release velocity, angle, and 3D position. Players with greater touch -- i.e., more consistent launch dynamics -- exhibit stronger command as they can reliably control their shot trajectory. Finally, we develop a physics model to identify the range of launch conditions that result in a make and to determine which launch conditions are most robust to small perturbations. This framework reveals "safe" launch regions and explains why certain players, such as Steph Curry, excel at free throws, providing actionable insights for player development.</description>

      <title>Multifractal behavior of price changes in the Green Bonds funds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate change has driven the market to seek new ways of raising funds to mitigate its effects. One such innovation is the emergence of Green Bonds financial assets specifically designed to support sustainable projects. This study explores the fractal behavior of daily price changes in thirty-five Green Bond funds using the Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA) method. Our results indicate that price changes exhibit persistent behavior and high multifractality, characterized by large fluctuations. Only one of the thirty-five time series analyzed showed an outlier result, suggesting that the funds display very similar behavior. By shuffling the series, we were able to reduce multifractality significantly. These findings suggest that Green Bond funds exhibit multifractal behavior typical of other financial assets.</description>

      <title>Functional Random Forest with Adaptive Cost-Sensitive Splitting for Imbalanced Functional Data Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classification of functional data where observations are curves or trajectories poses unique challenges, particularly under severe class imbalance. Traditional Random Forest algorithms, while robust for tabular data, often fail to capture the intrinsic structure of functional observations and struggle with minority class detection. This paper introduces Functional Random Forest with Adaptive Cost-Sensitive Splitting (FRF-ACS), a novel ensemble framework designed for imbalanced functional data classification. The proposed method leverages basis expansions and Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA) to represent curves efficiently, enabling trees to operate on low dimensional functional features. To address imbalance, we incorporate a dynamic cost sensitive splitting criterion that adjusts class weights locally at each node, combined with a hybrid sampling strategy integrating functional SMOTE and weighted bootstrapping. Additionally, curve specific similarity metrics replace traditional Euclidean measures to preserve functional characteristics during leaf assignment. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real world datasets including biomedical signals and sensor trajectories demonstrate that FRF-ACS significantly improves minority class recall and overall predictive performance compared to existing functional classifiers and imbalance handling techniques. This work provides a scalable, interpretable solution for high dimensional functional data analysis in domains where minority class detection is critical.</description>

      <title>The limit joint distributions of some statistics used in testing the quality of random number generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The limit joint distribution of statistics that are generalizations of some statistics from the NIST STS, TestU01, and other packages is found under the following hypotheses $H_0$ and $H_1$. Hypothesis $H_0$ states that the tested sequence is a sequence of independent random vectors with a known distribution, and the simple alternative hypothesis $H_1$ converges in some sense to $H_0$ with increasing sample size. In addition, an analogue of the Berry-Esseen inequality is obtained for the statistics under consideration, and conditions for their asymptotic independence are found.</description>

      <title>Cabin Layout, Seat Density, and Passenger Segmentation in Air Transport: Implications for Prices, Ancillary Revenues, and Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates how the layout and density of seats in aircraft cabins influence the pricing of airline tickets on domestic flights. The analysis is based on microdata from boarding passes linked to face-to-face interviews with passengers, allowing us to relate the price paid to the location on the aircraft seat map, as well as market characteristics and flight operations. Econometric models were estimated using the Post-Double-Selection LASSO (PDS-LASSO) procedure, which selects numerous controls for unobservable factors linked to commercial and operational aspects, thus enabling better identification of the effect of variables such as advance purchase, reason for travel, fuel price, market structure, and load factor, among others. The results suggest that a higher density of seat rows is associated with lower prices, reflecting economies of scale with the increase in aircraft size and gains in operational efficiency. An unexpected result was also obtained: in situations where there was no seat selection fee, passengers with more expensive tickets were often allocated middle seats due to purchasing at short notice, when the side alternatives were no longer available. This behavior helps explain the economic logic behind one of the main ancillary revenues of airlines. In addition to quantitative analysis, the study incorporates an exploratory approach to innovative cabin concepts and their possible effects on density and comfort on board.</description>

      <title>Subcellular proteome niche discovery using semi-supervised functional clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intracellular compartmentalization of proteins underpins their function and the metabolic processes they sustain. Various mass spectrometry-based proteomics methods (subcellular spatial proteomics) now allow high throughput subcellular protein localization. Yet, the curation, analysis and interpretation of these data remain challenging, particularly in non-model organisms where establishing reliable marker proteins is difficult, and in contexts where experimental replication and subcellular fractionation are constrained. Here, we develop FSPmix, a semi-supervised functional clustering method implemented as an open-source R package, which leverages partial annotations from a subset of marker proteins to predict protein subcellular localization from subcellular spatial proteomics data. This method explicitly assumes that protein signatures vary smoothly across subcellular fractions, enabling more robust inference under low signal-to-noise data regimes. We applied FSPmix to a subcellular proteomics dataset from a marine diatom, allowing us to assign probabilistic localizations to proteins and uncover potentially new protein functions. Altogether, this work lays the foundation for more robust statistical analysis and interpretation of subcellular proteomics datasets, particularly in understudied organisms.</description>

      <title>Branching Fixed Effects: A Proposal for Communicating Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Economists often rely on estimates of linear fixed effects models developed by other teams of researchers. Assessing the uncertainty in these estimates can be challenging. I propose a form of sample splitting for network data that breaks two-way fixed effects estimates into statistically independent branches, each of which provides an unbiased estimate of the parameters of interest. These branches facilitate uncertainty quantification, moment estimation, and shrinkage. Algorithms are developed for efficiently extracting branches from large datasets. I illustrate these techniques using a benchmark dataset from Veneto, Italy that has been widely used to study firm wage effects.</description>

Abstract: This paper attempts a first analysis of citation distributions based on the genderedness of authors' first name. Following the extraction of first name and sex data from all human entity triplets contained in Wikidata, a first name genderedness table is first created based on compiled sex frequencies, then merged with bibliometric data from eponymous, US-affiliated authors. Comparisons of various cumulative distributions show that citation concentrations fluctuations are highest at the opposite ends of the genderedness spectrum, as authors with very feminine and masculine first names respectively get a lower and higher share of citations for every article published, irrespective of their contribution role.</description>

      <title>Wishart kernel density estimation for strongly mixing time series on the cone of positive definite matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Wishart kernel density estimator (KDE) is introduced for density estimation in the cone of positive definite matrices. The estimator is boundary-aware and mitigates the boundary bias suffered by conventional KDEs, while remaining simple to implement. Its mean squared error, uniform strong consistency on expanding compact sets, and asymptotic normality are established under the Lebesgue measure and suitable mixing conditions. This work represents the first study of density estimation on this space under any metric. For independent observations, an asymptotic upper bound on the mean absolute error is also derived. A simulation study compares the performance of the Wishart KDE to another boundary-aware KDE that relies on the matrix-variate lognormal distribution proposed by Schwartzman [Int. Stat. Rev., 2016, 84(3), 456-486]. Results suggest that the Wishart KDE is superior for a selection of autoregressive coefficient matrices and innovation covariance matrices when estimating the stationary marginal density of a Wishart autoregressive process. To illustrate the practical utility of the Wishart KDE, an application to finance is made by estimating the marginal density function of a time series of realized covariance matrices, calculated from 5-minute intra-day returns, between the share prices of Amazon Corp. and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 exchange-traded fund over a one-year period. All code is publicly available via the R package ksm to facilitate implementation of the method and reproducibility of the findings.</description>

      <title>Parsimonious Generative Machine Learning for Non-Gaussian Tail Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14368v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of non-Gaussian tails is a prevalent characteristic in many financial modeling scenarios, necessitating the use of complex non-Gaussian distributions such as the generalized beta of the second kind (GB2) and the skewed generalized $t$ (SGT). The approach we propose for modeling heavy-tailed data differs significantly from traditional methods. We utilize generative machine learning, which offers an entirely different paradigm for modeling distributions. A parsimonious nonlinear transformation is applied to a simple base random variable such as Gaussian. The parameters can be estimated effectively, and the theoretical heavy-tail properties are derived. Robust performance is observed with this approach when compared to traditional distributions. More importantly, this method is broadly useful for machine learning due to its mathematical elegance and numerical convenience.</description>

      <title>A statistical test for network similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we revisit and expand our prior work on graph similarity. As with our earlier work, we focus on a view of similarity which does not require node correspondence between graphs under comparison. Our work is suited to the temporal study of networks, change-point and anomaly detection and simple comparisons of static graphs. It provides a similarity metric for the study of (weakly) connected graphs. Our work proposes a metric designed to compare networks and assess the (dis)similarity between them. For example, given three different graphs with possibly different numbers of nodes, $G_1$, $G_2$ and $G_3$, we aim to answer two questions: a) "How different is $G_1 $ from $G_2$?" and b) "Is graph $G_3$ more similar to $G_1$ or to $G_2$?". We illustrate the value of our test and its accuracy through several new experiments, using synthetic and real-world graphs.</description>
