      <title>Weak Existence for Degenerate Distribution Dependent SDEs with multiplicative Noise -- a pathwise regularization approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the existence of weak solutions to a class of distribution-dependent stochastic differential equations (DDSDEs) with possibly degenerate multiplicative noise and singular coefficients. Extending the weak existence techniques introduced by Bechtold &amp; Hofmanova 2023 to a distribution-dependent framework, we utilize pathwise averaging and local-time decomposition methods to show how irregular noise effectively regularizes analytical challenges associated with degeneracies in stochastic systems.</description>

      <title>Criticality of the abelian sandpile in dimension 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the critical behavior of the dissipative abelian sandpile model on Z with dissipative sites at arbitrary positions (x_k). This is equivalent to studying whether the expected stopping time of a trapped random walk on Z is finite. Our main contribution is a precise description of this phase transition via three distinct regimes. Our analysis captures criticality through the asymptotic behavior of an explicit recursive sequence, revealing counterintuitive phenomena in which traps may be farther apart yet the stopping time becomes shorter.</description>

      <title>Natural Latents: Latent Variables Stable Across Ontologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose two Bayesian agents each learn a generative model of the same environment. We will assume the two have converged on the predictive distribution, i.e. distribution over some observables in the environment, but may have different generative models containing different latent variables. Under what conditions can one agent guarantee that their latents are a function of the other agents latents?
  We give simple conditions under which such translation is guaranteed to be possible: the natural latent conditions. We also show that, absent further constraints, these are the most general conditions under which translatability is guaranteed. Crucially for practical application, our theorems are robust to approximation error in the natural latent conditions.</description>

      <title>Euler-type approximation for the invariant measure: An abstract framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a general framework to study the rate of convergence of a Euler type approximation scheme with decreasing time steps to the invariant measure, for a general class of stochastic systems. The error is measured in general Wasserstein distances, which enables to encompass cases with non global contractivity conditions. Our main assumption is a coupling property which is expressed in terms of the one-step approximation. We show that the proposed set-up can be applied to a wide range of equations that may be law dependent, such as Langevin equations, reflected equations, Boltzmann type equations and for a recent McKean Vlasov type model for neuronal activity.</description>

      <title>An Approach to Sub-Gaussian Heat Kernel Estimates via Analysis on Metric Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we establish a new characterization of sub-Gaussian heat kernel estimates for Dirichlet forms on metric measure spaces. Our formulation is based on the newly introduced \emph{cutoff energy condition}, which provides a simpler and more transparent alternative for earlier technical energy inequalities, in particular the cutoff Sobolev inequality. The main idea of our approach is to reinterpret the cutoff Sobolev inequality as a certain Poincar\'e type inequality, and analyze it using Haj{\l}asz--Koskela techniques from analysis on metric spaces. We present a broad class of new examples in which the sub-Gaussian heat kernel estimates are verified.</description>

      <title>Once-Reinforced and Self-Interacting Random Walks beyond exchangeability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first rigorous quantitative analysis of once-reinforced random walks (ORRW) on general graphs, based on a novel change of measure formula.~This enables us to prove large deviations estimates for the range of the walk to have cardinality of the order $N^{d/(d+2)}$ in dimension larger than or equal than two. We also prove that ORRW is transient on all non-amenable graphs for small reinforcement.~Moreover, we study the shape of oriented ORRW on euclidean lattices.
  We also provide a new approach to the study of general self-interacting random walk, which we apply to random walk in random environment, reinforced processes on oriented graphs, including the directed ORRW.</description>

      <title>The limiting law of the Discrete Gaussian level-lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the $(2+1)$D Discrete Gaussian (ZGFF, integer-valued Gaussian free field) model in an $L\times L$ box above a hard floor. Bricmont, El-Mellouki and Fr\"ohlich (1986) established that, at low enough temperature, this random surface exhibits entropic repulsion: the floor propels the average height to be poly-logarithmic in $L$. The second author, Martinelli and Sly (2016) showed that, for all but exceptional values of $L$, the surface has a plateau whose height concentrates on an explicit integer $H(L)$, and fills nearly the full square. It was conjectured there that the boundary of this plateau -- the top level-line of the surface -- should have random fluctuations of $L^{1/3+o(1)}$.
  We confirm this conjecture of [LMS16] and further recover the limiting law of the top level-line: there exists an explicit sequence $N=L^{1-o(1)}$ such that the distance of the top level-line from $I$, the interval of length $N^{2/3}$ centered along the side boundary, converges, after rescaling it by $N^{1/3}$ and the width of the interval by $N^{2/3}$, to a Ferrari--Spohn diffusion. In particular, the level-line fluctuations at, say, the center of $I$, have a limit law involving the Airy function rescaled by $N^{1/3}$. This gives the first example of one of the $(2+1)$D $|\nabla \phi|^p$ models (approximating 3D Ising and crystal formation) where a Ferrari--Spohn limit law of its level-lines is confirmed (ZGFF is the case $p=2$).
  More generally, we find the joint limit law of any finite number of top level-lines: rescaling their distances from the side boundary, each by its $(N_n^{2/3},N_n^{1/3})$, yields a product of Ferrari--Spohn laws. These new results extend to the full universality class of $|\nabla\phi|^p$ models for any fixed $p&gt;1$.</description>

      <title>Precise asymptotics for the norm of large random rectangular Toeplitz matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spectral norm of large rectangular random Toeplitz and circulant matrices with independent entries. For Toeplitz matrices, we show that the scaled norm converges to the norm of a bilinear operator defined via the pointwise product of two scaled sine kernel operators. In the square case, this limit reduces to the squared $2\!\to\!4$ norm of the sine kernel operator, in agreement with the result of Sen and Vir\'{a}g (2013). For $p\times n$ circulant matrices, we show that their norm divided by $\sqrt{p\log n}$ converges in probability to 1. We further investigate the finite-sample performance of these asymptotic results via Monte Carlo experiments, which reveal both non-negligible bias and dispersion. For circulant matrices, a higher-order asymptotic analysis in the Gaussian case explains these effects, connects the fluctuations to shifted Gumbel distributions, and suggests a natural conjecture on the limiting law.</description>

      <title>Escape over a saddle by coloured noise: theory and numerics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic dynamical systems allow modelling of transitions induced by disturbances, in particular from an attracting equilibrium and crossing the stable manifold of a saddle. In the small-noise limit, the probability of such transitions is governed by a large deviation principle. We illustrate a computational approach-the Method of Division-for approximating rare transition events, including their most likely paths, transition rates, and associated probabilities. To cater for realistic applications, we allow unbounded time, coloured and degenerate forcing. Its effectiveness is demonstrated on two examples: an inverted double-well potential and a simplified roll-heave ship capsize model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate the inverse problem in a Bayesian framework and aim to train a generative model that allows us to simulate (i.e., sample from the likelihood) and do inference (i.e., sample from the posterior). We review the use of triangular normalizing flows for conditional sampling in this context and show how to combine two such triangular maps (an upper and a lower one) in to one invertible mapping that can be used for simulation and inference. We work out several useful properties of this invertible generative model and propose a possible training loss for training the map directly. We illustrate the workings of this new approach to conditional generative modeling numerically on a few stylized examples.</description>

      <title>Divergence-Kernel method for linear responses and diffusion models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the divergence-kernel formula for the linear response (parameter-derivative of marginal or stationary distributions) of random dynamical systems, and formally pass to the continuous-time limit. Our formula works for multiplicative and parameterized noise over any period of time; it does not require hyperbolicity. Then we derive a pathwise Monte-Carlo algorithm for linear responses. With this, we propose a forward-only diffusion generative model and test on simple problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a probabilistic interpretation of several functional isoperimetric inequalities within the class of $p$-concave functions, building on random models for such functions introduced by P. Pivovarov and J. Rebollo-Bueno. First, we establish a stochastic isoperimetric inequality for a functional extension of the classical quermassintegrals, which yields a Sobolev-type inequality in this random setting as a particular case. Motivated by the latter, we further show that Zhang's affine Sobolev inequality holds in expectation when dealing with these random models of $p$-concave functions. Finally, we confirm that our results recover both their geometric analogues and deterministic counterparts. As a consequence of the latter, we establish a generalization of Zhang's affine Sobolev inequality restricted to $p$-concave functions in the context of convex measures.</description>

      <title>Simplicity Lies in the Eye of the Beholder: A Strategic Perspective on Controllers in Reactive Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the game-theoretic approach to controller synthesis, we model the interaction between a system to be controlled and its environment as a game between these entities, and we seek an appropriate (e.g., winning or optimal) strategy for the system. This strategy then serves as a formal blueprint for a real-world controller. A common belief is that simple (e.g., using limited memory) strategies are better: corresponding controllers are easier to conceive and understand, and cheaper to produce and maintain.
  This invited contribution focuses on the complexity of strategies in a variety of synthesis contexts. We discuss recent results concerning memory and randomness, and take a brief look at what lies beyond our traditional notions of complexity for strategies.</description>

Abstract: We prove a simple, explicit lower bound on the radius of a zero-free disk for Gibbs point processes defined by finite-range, repulsive multi-body interactions. Our lower bound improves on those previously known, and we demonstrate that it is essentially sharp in the generality with which our arguments apply. The key ingredient is a multi-body generalization of integral identities for point densities of Gibbs point processes in the spirit of earlier work of Michelen and Perkins.</description>

      <title>Mean-field Potts and random-cluster dynamics from high-entropy initializations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A common obstruction to efficient sampling from high-dimensional distributions with Markov chains is the multimodality of the target distribution because they may get trapped far from stationarity. Still, one hopes that this is only a barrier to the mixing of Markov chains from worst-case initializations and can be overcome by choosing high-entropy initializations, e.g., a product or weakly correlated distribution. Ideally, from such initializations, the dynamics would escape from the saddle points separating modes quickly and spread its mass between the dominant modes with the correct probabilities.
  In this paper, we study convergence from high-entropy initializations for the random-cluster and Potts models on the complete graph -- two extensively studied high-dimensional landscapes that pose many complexities like discontinuous phase transitions and asymmetric metastable modes. We study the Chayes--Machta and Swendsen--Wang dynamics for the mean-field random-cluster model and the Glauber dynamics for the Potts model. We sharply characterize the set of product measure initializations from which these Markov chains mix rapidly, even though their mixing times from worst-case initializations are exponentially slow. Our proofs require careful approximations of projections of high-dimensional Markov chains (which are not themselves Markovian) by tractable 1-dimensional random processes, followed by analysis of the latter's escape from saddle points separating stable modes.</description>

      <title>A stochastic model for immune response with mutations and evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17950v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider two simple stochastic models for a pathogen population in the presence of an immune response, where we assume that the immune system must first get rid of the pathogen type with the lowest fitness in each ancestral lineage of pathogen types present in the host. In the first model, the pathogens reproduce independently at rate $\lambda$ without spatial restrictions. The second model is similar but evolves on a graph. In this case, each pathogen occupies a site and can only place offspring on adjacent empty sites. In both models, when a new pathogen is born, it has the same type as its parent with probability $1-r$. Conversely, with probability $r$, a beneficial mutation occurs, generating a new pathogen type with a higher fitness than its parent's type. We assume that the immune system develops an effective immune response, independently at rate 1, for each pathogen type without ancestral types that are still alive, which simultaneously kills all pathogens of that type. Our main results are a complete characterization of the survival-extinction phase diagram of the first model, and sufficient conditions for survival and extinction of the second model on $\mathbb{Z}^d.$ A comparison with similar models introduced by Schinazi and Schweinsberg (2008), where mutations are not necessarily beneficial and the immune response for each pathogen type occurs independently at rate 1, reveals that the first and second models exhibit more complex and comparable behaviors, respectively.</description>

Abstract: We represent the product of two correlated normal random variables, and more generally the sum of independent copies of such random variables, as a difference of two independent noncentral chi-square random variables (which we refer to as the noncentral chi-square difference distribution). As a consequence, we obtain, amongst other results, an exact formula for the probability density function of the noncentral chi-square difference distribution, a Stein characterisation of the noncentral chi-square difference distribution, a simple formula for the moments of the sum of independent copies of the product of correlated normal random variables, an exact formula for the probability that such a random variable is negative, and also show that such random variables are self-decomposable and provide a L\'evy-Khintchine representation of the characteristic function.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic delocalization of low temperature 3D Ising and Potts interfaces above a hard floor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the entropic repulsion of the low temperature 3D Ising and Potts interface in an $n\times n \times n$ box with blue boundary conditions on its bottom face (the hard floor), and red boundary conditions on its other five faces. For Ising, Frohlich and Pfister proved in 1987 that the typical interface height above the origin diverges (non-quantitatively), via correlation inequalities special to the Ising model; no such result was known for Potts. We show for both the Ising and Potts models that the entropic repulsion fully overcomes the potentially attractive interaction with the floor, and obtain a logarithmically diverging lower bound on the typical interface height. This is complemented by a conjecturally sharp upper bound of $\lfloor \xi^{-1}\log n\rfloor$ where $\xi$ is the rate function for a point-to-plane non-red connection under the infinite volume red measure. The proof goes through a coupled random-cluster interface to overcome the potential attractive interaction with the boundary, and a coupled fuzzy Potts model to reduce the upper bound to a simpler setting where the repulsion is attained by conditioning a no-floor interface to lie in the upper half-space.</description>

      <title>A localisation phase transition for the catalytic branching random walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show the existence of a phase transition between a localisation and a non-localisation regime for a branching random walk with a catalyst at the origin. More precisely, we consider a continuous-time branching random walk that jumps at rate one, with simple random walk jumps on $\mathbb Z^d$, and that branches (with binary branching) at rate $\lambda&gt;0$ everywhere, except at the origin, where it branches at rate $\lambda_0&gt;\lambda$. We show that, if $\lambda_0$ is large enough, then the occupation measure of the branching random walk localises (i.e. when normalised by the total number of particles, it converges almost surely without spatial renormalisation), whereas, if $\lambda_0$ is close enough to $\lambda$, then the occupation measure delocalises, in the sense that the proportion of particles in any finite given set converges almost surely to zero. The case $\lambda = 0$ (when branching only occurs at the origin) has been extensively studied in the literature and a transition between localisation and non-localisation was also exhibited in this case. Interestingly, the transition that we observe, conjecture, and partially prove in this paper occurs at the same threshold as in the case $\lambda=0$. One of the strengths of our result is that, in the localisation regime, we are able to prove convergence of the occupation measure, whilst existing results in the case $\lambda = 0$ give convergence of moments instead.</description>

      <title>Fourier dimension of the graph of fractional Brownian motion with $H \ge 1/2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the Fourier dimension of the graph of fractional Brownian motion with Hurst index greater than $1/2$ is almost surely 1. This extends the result of Fraser and Sahlsten (2018) for the Brownian motion and confirms part of the conjecture of Fraser, Orponen and Sahlsten (2014). We introduce a combinatorial integration by parts formula to compute the moments of the Fourier transform of the graph measure. The proof of our main result is based on this integration by parts formula together with Fa\`a di Bruno's formula and strong local nondeterminism of fractional Brownian motion. We also show that the graph of a symmetric $\alpha$-stable process has Fourier dimension 1 almost surely when $\alpha \in [1,2]$ and is a Salem set when $\alpha = 1$.</description>

      <title>Random matrices acting on sets: Independent columns</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study random matrices with independent subgaussian columns. Assuming each column has a fixed Euclidean norm, we establish conditions under which such matrices act as near-isometries when restricted to a given subset of their domain. We show that, with high probability, the maximum distortion caused by such a matrix is proportional to the Gaussian complexity of the subset, scaled by the subgaussian norm of the matrix columns. This linear dependence on the subgaussian norm is a new phenomenon, as random matrices with independent rows or independent entries typically exhibit superlinear dependence. As a consequence, normalizing the columns of random sparse matrices leads to stronger embedding guarantees.</description>

Abstract: We study a family of integer-valued random interface models on the two-dimensional square lattice that include the solid-on-solid model and more generally $p$-SOS models for $0&lt;p\le2$, and prove that at sufficiently high temperature the interface is delocalized logarithmically uniformly in the boundary data. Fr\"ohlich and Spencer had studied the analogous problem with free boundary data, and our proof is based on their multi-scale argument, with various technical improvements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21658v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the stochastic dynamics of infinite particle systems in $\mathbb{R}^d$ interacting through the $d$-dimensional Coulomb potential. For arbitrary inverse temperature $\beta&gt;0$ and all dimensions $d\ge2$, we construct solutions to the associated infinite-dimensional stochastic differential equations (ISDEs). Our main results establish the existence of strong solutions and their pathwise uniqueness. The resulting labeled process is an $(\mathbb{R}^d)^N$-valued diffusion with no invariant measure, while the associated unlabeled process is reversible with respect to the Coulomb random point field. Furthermore, we prove that finite-particle systems converge to these infinite-particle dynamics, thereby providing a rigorous foundation for Coulomb interacting Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Multipoint distributions of the KPZ fixed point with compactly supported initial conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The KPZ fixed point is a universal limiting space-time random field for the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. While the joint law of the KPZ fixed point at a fixed time has been studied extensively, the multipoint distributions of the KPZ fixed point in the general space-time plane are much less well understood. More explicitly, formulas were only available for the narrow wedge initial condition arXiv:1906.01053, arXiv:1907.09876 and the flat initial condition arXiv:1907.09876 for the multipoint distributions, and the half-Brownian and Brownian initial conditions arXiv:2010.07357v1, arXiv:2504.19975 for the two-point distributions.
  In this paper, we obtain the first formula for the space-time joint distributions of the KPZ fixed point with general initial conditions of compact support. The formula is obtained through taking $1:2:3$ KPZ scaling limit of the multipoint distribution formulas for the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP). A key novelty is a probabilistic representation, inspired by arXiv:1701.00018, of the kernel encoding the initial condition for TASEP, which was first defined through an implicit characterization in arXiv:1907.09876. Moreover, we also verify that the equal time degenerated version of our formula matches the path integral formula in arXiv:1701.00018 for the KPZ fixed point.</description>

      <title>Single-seed generation of Brownian paths and integrals for adaptive and high order SDE solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06464v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the success of adaptive time-stepping in ODE simulation, it has so far seen few applications for Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs). To simulate SDEs adaptively, methods such as the Virtual Brownian Tree (VBT) have been developed, which can generate Brownian motion (BM) non-chronologically. However, in most applications, knowing only the values of Brownian motion is not enough to achieve a high order of convergence; for that, we must compute time-integrals of BM such as $\int_s^t W_r \, dr$. With the aim of using high order SDE solvers adaptively, we extend the VBT to generate these integrals of BM in addition to the Brownian increments. A JAX-based implementation of our construction is included in the popular Diffrax library (https://github.com/patrick-kidger/diffrax).
  Since the entire Brownian path produced by VBT is uniquely determined by a single PRNG seed, previously generated samples need not be stored, which results in a constant memory footprint and enables experiment repeatability and strong error estimation. Based on binary search, the VBT's time complexity is logarithmic in the tolerance parameter $\varepsilon$. Unlike the original VBT algorithm, which was only precise at some dyadic times, we prove that our construction exactly matches the joint distribution of the Brownian motion and its time integrals at any query times, provided they are at least $\varepsilon$ apart.
  We present two applications of adaptive high order solvers enabled by our new VBT. Using adaptive solvers to simulate a high-volatility CIR model, we achieve more than twice the convergence order of constant stepping. We apply an adaptive third order underdamped or kinetic Langevin solver to an MCMC problem, where our approach outperforms the No U-Turn Sampler, while using only a tenth of its function evaluations.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Unadjusted Langevin in High Dimensions: Delocalization of Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The unadjusted Langevin algorithm is commonly used to sample probability distributions in extremely high-dimensional settings. However, existing analyses of the algorithm for strongly log-concave distributions suggest that, as the dimension $d$ of the problem increases, the number of iterations required to ensure convergence within a desired error in the $W_2$ metric scales in proportion to $d$ or $\sqrt{d}$. In this paper, we argue that, despite this poor scaling of the $W_2$ error for the full set of variables, the behavior for a small number of variables can be significantly better: a number of iterations proportional to $K$, up to logarithmic terms in $d$, often suffices for the algorithm to converge to within a desired $W_2$ error for all $K$-marginals. We refer to this effect as delocalization of bias. We show that the delocalization effect does not hold universally and prove its validity for Gaussian distributions and strongly log-concave distributions with certain sparse interactions. Our analysis relies on a novel $W_{2,\ell^\infty}$ metric to measure convergence. A key technical challenge we address is the lack of a one-step contraction property in this metric. Finally, we use asymptotic arguments to explore potential generalizations of the delocalization effect beyond the Gaussian and sparse interactions setting.</description>

Abstract: For an invariant probability measure for the Gauss map, almost all numbers are Diophantine if the log of the partial quotient function is integrable. We show that with respect to a ``continued fraction mixing'' measure for the Gauss map with the log of the partial quotient function non-integrable, almost all numbers are Liouville. We also exhibit Gauss-invariant, ergodic measures with arbitrary irrationality exponent. The proofs are applications of our study of the ``extravagance'' of positive, stationary, stochastic processes. In addition, we prove a Khinchin-type dichotomy for Diophantine approximation with respect to ergodic``weak Renyi measures'' which are ``doubling at $0$''.</description>

      <title>Bounding Escape Rates and Approximating Quasi-Stationary Distributions of Brownian Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Throughout physics Brownian dynamics are used to describe the behaviour of molecular systems. When the Brownian particle is confined to a bounded domain, a particularly important question arises around determining how long it takes the particle to encounter certain regions of the boundary from which it can escape. Termed the first passage time, it sets the natural timescale of the chemical, biological, and physical processes that are described by the stochastic differential equation. Probabilistic information about the first passage time can be studied using spectral properties of the deterministic generator of the stochastic process. In this work we introduce a framework for bounding the leading eigenvalue of the generator which determines the exponential rate of escape of the particle from the domain. The method employs sum-of-squares programming to produce nearly sharp numerical upper and lower bounds on the leading eigenvalue, while also giving good numerical approximations of the associated leading eigenfunction, the quasi-stationary distribution of the process. To demonstrate utility, the method is applied to prototypical low-dimensional problems from the literature.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda_p$ Style Bounds in Orlicz Spaces Close to $L^2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(\varphi_i)_{i=1}^n$ be mutually orthogonal functions on a probability space such that $\|\varphi_i\|_\infty \leq 1 $ for all $i \in [n]$. Let $\alpha &gt; 0$. Let $\Phi(u) = u^2 \log^{\alpha}(u)$ for $u \geq u_{0}$, and $\Phi(u) = c(\alpha) u^2$ otherwise. $u_0 \geq e$ and $c(\alpha)$ are constants chosen so that $\Phi$ is a Young function, depending only on $\alpha$. Our main result shows that with probability at least $1/4$ over subsets $I$ of $[n]$, where $I$ is constructed by choosing each index of $[n]$ independently from a Bernoulli distribution, the following holds: $|I| \geq \frac{n}{e \log^{\alpha+1}(n)} $ and for any $a \in \mathbb{C}^n$, $$ \left \|\sum_{i \in I} a_i \varphi_i \right \|_{\Phi} \leq K(\alpha) \log^{\frac{\alpha}{2}}(\log n) \cdot \|a\|_2. $$ $K(\alpha)$ is a constant depending only on $\alpha$.
  In the main Theorem of \cite{Ryou22}, Ryou proved the result above to a constant factor, depending on $p$ and $\alpha$, when the Orlicz space is a $L^p(\log L)^{p\alpha}$ space for $p &gt; 2$ where $|I| \sim \frac{n^{2/p}}{\log^{2 \alpha /p}(n)}$. However, their work did not extend to the case where $p=2$, an open question in \cite{Iosevich25}. Our result resolves the latter question up to $\log \log n$ factors. Moreover, our result sharpens the constants of Limonova's main result in \cite{Limonova23} from a factor of $\log n$ to a factor of $\log \log n$, if the orthogonal functions are bounded by a constant. In addition, our proof is much shorter and simpler than the latter's.
  Finally, to complement our main result, we give a probabilistic lower bound (subsets of $[n]$ are selected by a Bernoulli distribution over $[n]$'s indices) that matches our main result's upper bound.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of the existence of the bounded harmonic functions on a simply connected Riemannian manifold $\widetilde{M}$ without conjugate points, which can be compactified via the ideal boundary $\widetilde{M}(\infty)$. Let $\widetilde{M}$ be a uniform visibility manifold which satisfy the Axiom $2$, or a rank $1$ manifold without focal points, suppose that $\Gamma$ is a cocompact discrete subgroup of $Iso(\widetilde{M})$, we show that for a given continuous function on $\widetilde{M}(\infty)$, there exists a harmonic extension to $\widetilde{M}$. And furthermore, when $\widetilde{M}$ is a rank $1$ manifold without focal points, the Brownian motion defines a family of harmonic measures $\nu_{\ast}$ on $\widetilde{M}(\infty)$, we show that $(\widetilde{M}(\infty),\nu_{\ast})$ is isomorphic to the Poisson boundary of $\Gamma$.</description>

Abstract: For a simple model of shallow and wide neural networks, we show that the epigraph of its input-output map as a function of the network parameters approximates epigraph of a. convex function in a precise sense. This leads to a plausible explanation of their observed good performance.</description>

      <title>Improved sampling algorithms and Poincar\'e inequalities for non-log-concave distributions</title>

Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from a distribution $\mu$ with density $\propto e^{-V}$ for some potential function $V:\mathbb R^d\to \mathbb R$ with query access to $V$ and $\nabla V$. We start with the following standard assumptions:
  (1) The potential function $V$ is $L$-smooth.
  (2) The second moment $\mathbf{E}_{X\sim \mu}[\|X\|^2]\leq M$.
  Recently, He and Zhang (COLT'25) showed that the query complexity of sampling from such distributions is at least $\left(\frac{LM}{d\epsilon}\right)^{\Omega(d)}$ where $\epsilon$ is the desired accuracy in total variation distance, and the Poincar\'e constant can be arbitrarily large.
  Meanwhile, another common assumption in the study of diffusion based samplers (see e.g., the work of Chen, Chewi, Li, Li, Salim and Zhang (ICLR'23)) strengthens the smoothness condition (1) to the following:
  (1*) The potential function of *every* distribution along the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process starting from $\mu$ is $L$-smooth.
  We show that under the assumptions (1*) and (2), the query complexity of sampling from $\mu$ can be $\mathrm{poly}(L,d)\cdot \left(\frac{Ld+M}{\epsilon^2}\right)^{\mathcal{O}(L+1)}$, which is polynomial in $d$ and $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ when $L=\mathcal{O}(1)$ and $M=\mathrm{poly}(d)$. This improves the algorithm with quasi-polynomial query complexity developed by Huang et al. (COLT'24). Our results imply that the seemly moderate strengthening of the smoothness condition (1) to (1*) can lead to an exponential gap in the query complexity of sampling algorithms.
  Moreover, we show that together with the assumption (1*) and the stronger moment assumption that $\|X\|$ is $\lambda$-sub-Gaussian for $X\sim\mu$, the Poincar\'e constant of $\mu$ is at most $\mathcal{O}(\lambda)^{2(L+1)}$. As an application of our technique, we obtain improved estimate of the Poincar\'e constant for mixture of Gaussians with the same covariance.</description>
