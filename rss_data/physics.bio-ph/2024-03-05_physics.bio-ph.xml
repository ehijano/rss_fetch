      <title>Optical-coherence-tomography-based deep-learning scatterer-density estimator using physically accurate noise model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a deep-learning-based scatterer density estimator (SDE) that processes local speckle patterns of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images and estimates the scatterer density behind each speckle pattern. The SDE is trained using large quantities of numerically simulated OCT images and their associated scatterer densities. The numerical simulation uses a noise model that incorporates the spatial properties of three types of noise, i.e., shot noise, relative-intensity noise, and non-optical noise. The SDE's performance was evaluated numerically and experimentally using two types of scattering phantom and in vitro tumor spheroids. The results confirmed that the SDE estimates scatterer densities accurately. The estimation accuracy improved significantly when compared with our previous deep-learning-based SDE, which was trained using numerical speckle patterns generated from a noise model that did not account for the spatial properties of noise.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Exponential Integrate-and-Fire Model with Fractal Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The description of neuronal activity has been of great importance in neuroscience. In this field, mathematical models are useful to describe the electrophysical behaviour of neurons. One successful model used for this purpose is the Adaptive Exponential Integrate-and-Fire (Adex), which is composed of two ordinary differential equations. Usually, this model is considered in his standard formulation, i.e., with integer order derivatives. In this work, we propose and study the fractal extension of Adex model, which in simple terms corresponds to replacing the integer derivative by non-integer. As non-integer operators, we choose the fractal derivatives. We explore the effects of equal and different orders of fractal derivatives in the firing patterns and mean frequency of the neuron described by the Adex model. Previous results suggest that fractal derivatives can provide a more realistic representation due to the fact that the standard operators are generalized. Our findings show that the fractal order influences the inter-spike intervals and changes the mean firing frequency. In addition, the firing patterns depend not only on the neuronal parameters but also on the order of respective fractal operators. As our main conclusion, the fractal order below the unit value increases the influence of the adaptation mechanism in the spike firing patterns.</description>

      <title>Anomalous mass dependency in Hydra endoderm cell cluster diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tissue organization plays a crucial role in morphogenesis, wound healing and cancer metastasis. Hydra, known for its regenerative capabilities, serves as an excellent model for studying cellular structures, particularly in pattern formation and the diffusion of cell clusters. Established experimental protocols enable the examination of regeneration and tissue segregation through optical microscopy. Recent experiments challenge previous theories by suggesting that cell collective behavior is a key factor in hydra cell aggregate organization. Utilizing image treatment techniques on fluorescent images from Hydra's segregation experiment, we track endoderm cell clusters and investigate the relationship between their diffusion constant and cluster size. In contrast to results observed in non-active matter, we discover a nearly constant dependence of diffusion on cluster mass. This finding contributes to understanding the rapid segregation observed in recent experiments and holds implications for general cellular tissue processes.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Biomolecular Simulations in the Exascale Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complexity of biological systems and processes, spanning molecular to macroscopic scales, necessitates the use of multiscale simulations to get a comprehensive understanding. Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are crucial for capturing processes beyond the reach of classical MD simulations. The advent of exascale computing offers unprecedented opportunities for scientific exploration, not least within life sciences, where simulations are essential to unravel intricate molecular mechanisms underlying biological processes. However, leveraging the immense computational power of exascale computing requires innovative algorithms and software designs. In this context, we discuss the current status and future prospects of multiscale biomolecular simulations on exascale supercomputers with a focus on QM/MM MD. We highlight our own efforts in developing a versatile and high-performance multiscale simulation framework with the aim of efficient utilization of state-of-the-art supercomputers. We showcase its application in uncovering complex biological mechanisms and its potential for leveraging exascale computing.</description>

      <title>Cell sorting by active forces in a phase-field model of cell monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell sorting, the segregation of cells with different properties into distinct domains, is a key phenomenon in biological processes such as embryogenesis. We use a phase-field model of a confluent cell layer to study the role of activity in cell sorting. We find that a mixture of cells with extensile or contractile dipolar activity, and which are identical apart from their activity, quickly sort into small, elongated patches which then grow slowly in time. We interpret the sorting as driven by the different diffusivity of the extensile and contractile cells, mirroring the ordering of Brownian particles connected to different hot and cold thermostats. We check that the free energy is not changed by either partial or complete sorting, thus confirming that activity can be responsible for the ordering even in the absence of thermodynamic mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Stoichiometric Rays: A simple method to compute the controllable set of enzymatic reaction systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple method to compute the controllable set of chemical reaction systems with enzyme concentrations as the control parameters is presented. The method features the fact that the catalyst enhances the reaction rate while not changing the equilibrium, and it enables the efficient computation of the global controllability of linear- and nonlinear models. The method is applied to the reversible Brusselator and the toy model of cellular metabolism. With the metabolism model, we show that the stoichiometric rays is a powerful tool for quantifying the ``life-death boundary" of the cell model.</description>

      <title>Single-channel and multi-channel electrospinning for the fabrication of PLA/PCL tissue engineering scaffolds: comparative study of the materials physicochemical and biological properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fabrication of tissue engineering scaffolds with tailored physicochemical and biological characteristics is a relevant task in biomedical engineering. The present work was focused at the evaluation of the effect of fabrication approach (single-channel or multi-channel electrospinning) on the properties of the fabricated poly(lactic acid)(PLA)/poly(epsilon-caprolactone)(PCL) scaffolds with various polymer mass ratios (1/0, 2/1, 1/1, 1/2, and 0/1). The scaffolds with same morphology (regardless of electrospinning variant) were fabricated and characterized using SEM, water contact angle measurement, FTIR, XRD, tensile testing and in vitro experiment with multipotent mesenchymal stem cells. It was demonstrated, that multi-channel electrospinning prevents intermolecular interactions between the polymer components of the scaffold, preserving their crystal structure, what affects the mechanical characteristics of the scaffold (particularly, leads to 2-fold difference in elongation). Better adhesion of multipotent mesenchymal stem cells on the surface of the scaffolds fabricated using multichannel electrospinning was demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Two-colour photon correlations probe coherent vibronic contributions to electronic excitation transport under incoherent illumination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying signatures of quantum coherent behaviour in photoactive systems that are maintained in stationary states away from thermal equilibrium is an open problem of wide interest in a variety of physical scenarios, including single photosynthetic complexes subjected to continuous incoherent illumination. Here we consider a prototype light-harvesting heterodimer exhibiting coherent and collective exciton-vibration interactions and show that the second-order frequency-filtered correlations of fluorescence photons provide insightful information on the influence of such coherent interactions for different transitions, thereby yielding fundamentally different photon-counting statistics. Furthermore, we show that coherent vibronic mechanisms strongly affect the asymmetries characteristic of time-resolved photon cross-correlations and manifest themselves in a time-dependent violation of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality bounding cross-correlations for classically fluctuating fields. We finally discuss how such second-order correlation asymmetry establishes important connections between coherent vibronic interactions, directional exciton population transport, and violation of quantum detailed balance. Our work then indicates that measurement of two-colour photon correlation asymmetry can be an important avenue to investigate quantum behaviour of single photoactive biomolecular and chemical systems under incoherent illumination conditions.</description>

      <title>$\Gamma$-VAE: Curvature regularized variational autoencoders for uncovering emergent low dimensional geometric structure in high dimensional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural systems with emergent behaviors often organize along low-dimensional subsets of high-dimensional spaces. For example, despite the tens of thousands of genes in the human genome, the principled study of genomics is fruitful because biological processes rely on coordinated organization that results in lower dimensional phenotypes. To uncover this organization, many nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques have successfully embedded high-dimensional data into low-dimensional spaces by preserving local similarities between data points. However, the nonlinearities in these methods allow for too much curvature to preserve general trends across multiple non-neighboring data clusters, thereby limiting their interpretability and generalizability to out-of-distribution data. Here, we address both of these limitations by regularizing the curvature of manifolds generated by variational autoencoders, a process we coin ``$\Gamma$-VAE''. We demonstrate its utility using two example data sets: bulk RNA-seq from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx); and single cell RNA-seq from a lineage tracing experiment in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation. We find that the resulting regularized manifolds identify mesoscale structure associated with different cancer cell types, and accurately re-embed tissues from completely unseen, out-of distribution cancers as if they were originally trained on them. Finally, we show that preserving long-range relationships to differentiated cells separates undifferentiated cells -- which have not yet specialized -- according to their eventual fate. Broadly, we anticipate that regularizing the curvature of generative models will enable more consistent, predictive, and generalizable models in any high-dimensional system with emergent low-dimensional behavior.</description>

      <title>Piezoelectricity and flexoelectricity in biological cells: The role of cell structure and organelles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Living tissues experience various external forces on cells, influencing their behaviour, physiology, shape, gene expression, and destiny through interactions with their environment. Despite much research done in this area, challenges remain in our better understanding of the behaviour of the cell in response to external stimuli, including the arrangement, quantity, and shape of organelles within the cell. This study explores the electromechanical behaviour of biological cells, including organelles like microtubules, mitochondria, nuclei, and cell membranes. Two distinct cell structures have been developed to explore the cell responses to mechanical displacement, resembling actual cell shapes. The finite element method has been utilized to integrate the linear piezoelectric and non-local flexoelectric effects accurately. It is found that the longitudinal stress is absent and only the transverse stress plays a crucial role when the mechanical load is imposed on the top side of the cell through compressive displacement. The impact of flexoelectricity is elucidated by introducing a new parameter called the maximum electric potential ratio ($V_{\text{R,max}}$). It has been found that $V_{\text{R,max}}$ depends upon the orientation angle and shape of the microtubules. Further, the study reveals that the number of microtubules significantly impacts effective elastic and piezoelectric coefficients, affecting cell behaviour based on structure, microtubule orientation, and mechanical stress direction. The insight obtained from the current study can assist in advancements in medical therapies such as tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the Energetics of the Finite-time Driving of Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phase transitions for many-body systems have been understood using field theories. A few canonical physical model classes encapsulate the underlying physical properties of a large number of systems. The finite-time driving of such systems and associated optimal energetic costs have not been investigated yet. We consider two universality classes Model A and Model B, that describe the dynamics for the non-conserved and conserved scalar order parameters respectively. Here, using the recent developments in stochastic thermodynamics and optimal transport theory, we analytically compute the optimal driving protocols by minimizing the mean stochastic work required for finite-time driving. Further, we numerically optimize the mean and variance of the stochastic work simultaneously. Such a multi-objective optimization is called a Pareto optimization problem and its optimal solution is a Pareto front. We discover a first-order Pareto phase transition in the Pareto front. Physically, it corresponds to the coexistence of two classes of optimal driving protocols analogous to the liquid-gas coexistence for the equilibrium phase transition. Our framework sheds light on the finite-time optimal driving of the fields and the trade-off between the mean and fluctuations of the optimal work.</description>

      <title>Effective extensional-torsional elasticity and dynamics of helical filaments under distributed loads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study slender, helical elastic rods subject to distributed forces and moments. Focussing on the case when the helix axis remains straight, we employ the method of multiple scales to systematically derive an 'effective-column' theory from the Kirchhoff rod equations: the helical filament is described as a naturally-straight rod (aligned with the helix axis) for which the extensional and torsional deformations are coupled. Importantly, our analysis is asymptotically exact in the limit of a 'highly-coiled' filament (i.e., when the helical wavelength is much smaller than the characteristic lengthscale over which the filament bends due to external loading) and is able to account for large, unsteady displacements. In the small-deformation limit, we exactly recover the coupled wave equations used to describe the free vibrations of helical coil springs, thereby justifying previous effective-column approximations in which linearised stiffness coefficients are assumed to apply locally and dynamically. We then illustrate our theory with two loading scenarios: (I) a heavy helical rod deforming under its own weight; and (II) the dynamics of axial rotation (twirling) in viscous fluid, which may be considered as a simple model for a bacteria flagellar filament. More broadly, our analysis provides a framework to develop reduced models of helical rods in a wide variety of physical and biological settings, and yields analytical insight into their elastic instabilities. In particular, our analysis indicates that tensile instabilities are a generic phenomenon when helical rods are subject to a combination of distributed forces and moments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular systems can convert between different steady-state probability distributions over system states, an operation that can be considered to be a computational step. Rather than converting between equilibrium steady-states at computational timepoints, biology uses chemical energy to access non-equilibrium steady-states, which require energy expenditure even when no computations are being performed. The information-theoretic advantage of this costly paradigm is poorly understood. Here we derive a concise expression relating the thermodynamic force to the information gain achievable in an arbitrary computational step. We show that information gain can be exponentially amplified by the thermodynamic force, explaining how incremental changes in inputs can generate qualitative changes in outputs, a defining characteristic of living systems. Numerical sampling demonstrates the tightness of this universal bound, and as examples, we show that Ras signaling and microtubule assembly can closely approach it. We anticipate this relation being used to determine whether particular molecular transformations are achievable.</description>
