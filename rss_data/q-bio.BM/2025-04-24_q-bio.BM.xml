      <title>Heterogeneous networks in drug-target interaction prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drug discovery requires a tremendous amount of time and cost. Computational drug-target interaction prediction, a significant part of this process, can reduce these requirements by narrowing the search space for wet lab experiments. In this survey, we provide comprehensive details of graph machine learning-based methods in predicting drug-target interaction, as they have shown promising results in this field. These details include the overall framework, main contribution, datasets, and their source codes. The selected papers were mainly published from 2020 to 2024. Prior to discussing papers, we briefly introduce the datasets commonly used with these methods and measurements to assess their performance. Finally, future challenges and some crucial areas that need to be explored are discussed.</description>

      <title>The Dance of Atoms-De Novo Protein Design with Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The de novo design of proteins refers to creating proteins with specific structures and functions that do not naturally exist. In recent years, the accumulation of high-quality protein structure and sequence data and technological advancements have paved the way for the successful application of generative artificial intelligence (AI) models in protein design. These models have surpassed traditional approaches that rely on fragments and bioinformatics. They have significantly enhanced the success rate of de novo protein design, and reduced experimental costs, leading to breakthroughs in the field. Among various generative AI models, diffusion models have yielded the most promising results in protein design. In the past two to three years, more than ten protein design models based on diffusion models have emerged. Among them, the representative model, RFDiffusion, has demonstrated success rates in 25 protein design tasks that far exceed those of traditional methods, and other AI-based approaches like RFjoint and hallucination. This review will systematically examine the application of diffusion models in generating protein backbones and sequences. We will explore the strengths and limitations of different models, summarize successful cases of protein design using diffusion models, and discuss future development directions.</description>

      <title>Ultra-high dose rate 6 MeV electron irradiation generates stable [1-$^{13}$C]alanine radicals suitable for medical imaging with dissolution Dynamic Nuclear Polarisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dissolution Dynamic Nuclear Polarisation (dDNP) is an experimental technique that increases the sensitivity of magnetic resonance experiments by more than a factor of $10^5$, permitting isotopically-labelled molecules to be transiently visible in MRI scans with their biochemical fates spatially resolvable over time following injection into a patient. dDNP requires a source of unpaired electrons to be in contact with the isotope-labelled nuclei, cooled to temperatures close to absolute zero, and spin-pumped into a given state by microwave irradiation. At present, these electrons are typically provided by chemical radicals which require removal by filtration prior to injection into humans. Alternative sources include UV irradiation, requiring storing samples in liquid nitrogen, or cobalt-60 gamma irradiation, which requires days and generates polarisation two to three orders of magnitude lower than chemical radicals. In this study, we present ultra-high dose rate electron beam irradiation as a novel alternative for generating non-persistent radicals in glycerol/alanine mixtures. These radicals are stable for months at room temperature, are present at concentrations dependent on irradiation dose, and generate comparable nuclear polarisation to the typically used trityl radicals (20%) through a novel mechanism. The process of their generation inherently sterilises samples, and they enable the imaging of alanine metabolism in vivo using dDNP. This new method of generating radicals for dDNP offers the potential to report on relevant biological processes while being translatable to the clinic.</description>

      <title>Exploring zero-shot structure-based protein fitness prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to make zero-shot predictions about the fitness consequences of protein sequence changes with pre-trained machine learning models enables many practical applications. Such models can be applied for downstream tasks like genetic variant interpretation and protein engineering without additional labeled data. The advent of capable protein structure prediction tools has led to the availability of orders of magnitude more precomputed predicted structures, giving rise to powerful structure-based fitness prediction models. Through our experiments, we assess several modeling choices for structure-based models and their effects on downstream fitness prediction. Zero-shot fitness prediction models can struggle to assess the fitness landscape within disordered regions of proteins, those that lack a fixed 3D structure. We confirm the importance of matching protein structures to fitness assays and find that predicted structures for disordered regions can be misleading and affect predictive performance. Lastly, we evaluate an additional structure-based model on the ProteinGym substitution benchmark and show that simple multi-modal ensembles are strong baselines.</description>
