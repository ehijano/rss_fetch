      <title>Energy Response and Resolution to Positrons in a Capillary-Tube Dual-Readout Calorimeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of a test beam campaign on a capillary-tube fibre-based dual-readout calorimeter, designed for precise hadronic and electromagnetic energy measurements in future collider experiments. The calorimeter prototype consists of nine modules, each composed of brass capillary tubes housing scintillating and Cherenkov optical fibres, read out using silicon photomultipliers for the central module and photomultiplier tubes for the outer modules. The performance of the detector was assessed using a positron beam with energies ranging from 10 to 120 GeV at the CERN SPS H8 beamline. The prototype is characterised in terms of the linearity and resolution of its energy response to positrons. The results confirm the feasibility of the capillary-tube mechanical design for large-scale dual-readout calorimetry and provide a benchmark for future detector development within the HiDRa project.</description>

      <title>Minimal material, maximum coverage: Silicon Tracking System for high-occupancy conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon strip sensors have long been a reliable technology for particle detection. Here, we push the limits of silicon tracking detectors by targeting an unprecedentedly low material budget of 2%-7% $X_0$ in an 8-layer 4 m$^2$ detector designed for high-occupancy environments ($\leq$ 10 MHz/cm$^2$).
  To achieve this, we employ Double-Sided Double Metal (DSDM) silicon microstrip sensors, coupled with readout electronics capable of precise timing and energy measurements. These 320 $\mu$m thick sensors, featuring $2\times 1024$ channels with a 58 $\mu$m pitch, are connected via ultra-lightweight aluminium-polyimide microcables for signal transmission and integrated with a custom SMX readout ASIC, operating in free-streaming mode. This system enables the simultaneous measurement of time ($\Delta t \simeq 5$~ns) and charge deposition (0.1-100 fC), significantly enhancing the detector's capacity for high-precision track reconstruction in high-occupancy and harsh radiation field environments.
  The primary application of this technology is the Silicon Tracking System (STS) for the CBM experiment, with additional potential in projects like the J-PARC E16 experiment and future uses in medical physics, such as advanced imaging telescopes. In this contribution, we present the current status of CBM STS construction, with almost one-third of the modules produced and tested. We also discuss immediate applications and explore promising prospects in both scientific and medical fields.</description>

      <title>Velocity Map Imaging Spectrometer Optimized for Reduction of Background from Scattered UV Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Velocity map imaging spectroscopy is a powerful technique for detecting the momentum distribution of photoelectrons resulting from an ionization experiment on atoms or molecules. However, when used with ultraviolet light sources, scattered photons can lead to the emission of photoelectrons from the spectrometer's electrodes, giving rise to severe noise disturbing the desired signal. We present a velocity map imaging spectrometer optimized to reduce unwanted background signals. The primary modifications to the conventional design include spectrometer electrode geometries with small cross section exposed to the scattered photons, with blocked pathways for photoelectrons from the electrodes to the detector, as well as the incorporation of optical baffles. Compared to a conventional design optimized solely on the spectrometer's photoelectron momentum resolution, we have achieved the elimination of 99.9 \% of the background noise without substantial compromise to the resolution. Note that most of the improvements were achieved without the necessity of high-grade windows, reducing the sensitivity to window degradation by UV light. We give general guidelines on efficiently coping with the long-standing experimental problem of electron background originating from scattered light by considering it already in the design stage of a new spectrometer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution recordings of extracellular potentials are fundamental for the study of neuronal networks, the basis of neuronal coding and transmission. Here we present an innovative method for an in vivo electrical imaging of Local Field Potentials using novel implantable neural interfaces with a high-density array of 256 recording sites and a spatial resolution of 15 {\mu}m. Thanks to this technology, we analyze the propagation of whisker-evoked activity in a single barrel-column of the rat somatosensory cortex.</description>

      <title>Quantum Metrology of Newton's Constant with Levitated Mechanical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Newton's constant is the least well-measured among the fundamental constants of Nature, and, indeed, its accurate measurement has long served an experimental challenge. Levitated mechanical systems are attracting growing attention for their promising applications in sensing and as an experimental platform for exploring the intersection between quantum physics and gravitation. Here we propose a mechanical interferometric scheme of interacting levitated oscillators for the accurate estimation of Newton's constant. Our scheme promises to beat the current standard by several orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Performance study of a bakelite RPC prototype built by new technique of linseed oil coating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07336v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resistive Plate Chamber (RPC) is one of the most commonly used detectors in high energy physics experiments for triggering and tracking because of its good efficiency ($\textgreater$~90\%) and time resolution ($\sim$~1-2~ns). Generally, bakelite which is one of the most commonly used materials as electrode plates in RPC, sometimes suffers from surface roughness issues. If the surface is not smooth, the probability of micro discharges and spurious pulses increase, which leads to the deterioration in the performance of the detector. We have developed a new method of linseed oil coating for the bakelite based detectors to avoid the surface roughness issue. The detector is characterised with Tetrafluoroethane (R134a) based gas mixture. The detector is also tested with a high rate of gamma radiation environment in the laboratory for the radiation hardness test. The detailed measurement procedure and test results are presented in this article.</description>

      <title>High-resolution computed tomography of two-dimensional beam profile using dual-axis rotating wire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of a wire probe is a robust method for beam profile measurement, but it can only provide a 1D projection of the beam profile. In this study, we developed a novel method for measuring a beam projected from a 360{\deg} angle by a dual-axis rotation of a wire probe and obtaining a complete 2D profile via image reconstruction. We conducted a proof-of-principle study using an Ar+ ion beam and optimized the reconstruction algorithm. The experimental results showed that the use of the order subsets expectation maximization (OS-EM) algorithm is the most reasonable method, providing a highly accurate absolute 2D beam profile within a processing time on the millisecond scale. Furthermore, analysis of 2D profiles at different probing positions provided the beam direction and the phase space distribution. This versatile method can be applied to various fields of quantum beam technologies, such as particle therapy, semiconductor processing, and material analysis, as well as basic scientific research.</description>

      <title>Classification of Electron and Muon Neutrino Events for the ESS$\nu$SB Near Water Cherenkov Detector using Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the effort to obtain a precise measurement of leptonic CP-violation with the ESS$\nu$SB experiment, accurate and fast reconstruction of detector events plays a pivotal role. In this work, we examine the possibility of replacing the currently proposed likelihood-based reconstruction method with an approach based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). As the likelihood-based reconstruction method is reasonably accurate but computationally expensive, one of the benefits of a Machine Learning (ML) based method is enabling fast event reconstruction in the detector development phase, allowing for easier investigation of the effects of changes to the detector design. Focusing on classification of flavour and interaction type in muon and electron events and muon- and electron neutrino interaction events, we demonstrate that the GNN reconstructs events with greater accuracy than the likelihood method for events with greater complexity, and with increased speed for all events. Additionally, we investigate the key factors impacting reconstruction performance, and demonstrate how separation of events by pion production using another GNN classifier can benefit flavour classification.</description>
