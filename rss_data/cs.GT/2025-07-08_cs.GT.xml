      <title>Beyond Advertising: Mechanism Design for Platform-Wide Marketing Service "QuanZhanTui"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On e-commerce platforms, sellers typically bid for impressions from ad traffic to promote their products. However, for most sellers, the majority of their sales come from organic traffic. Consequently, the relationship between their ad spending and total sales remains uncertain, resulting in operational inefficiency. To address this issue, e-commerce platforms have recently introduced a novel platform-wide marketing service known as QuanZhanTui, which has reportedly enhanced marketing efficiency for sellers and driven substantial revenue growth for platforms. QuanZhanTui allows sellers to bid for impressions from the platform's entire traffic to boost their total sales without compromising the platform's user experience. In this paper, we investigate the mechanism design problem that arises from QuanZhanTui. The problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization to balance sellers' welfare and platform's user experience. We first introduce the stock-constrained value maximizer model, which reflects sellers' dual requirements on marketing efficiency and platform-wide ROI. Then, we propose the Liquid Payment Auction (LPA), an auction designed to optimize the balanced objectives while accounting for sellers' requirements in the auto-bidding environment. It employs a simple payment rule based on sellers' liquid welfare, providing a clearer link between their investment and total sales. Under mild assumptions, we theoretically prove desirable properties of LPA, such as optimality and incentive compatibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate LPA's superior performance over conventional auctions in QuanZhanTui.</description>

      <title>Last-Iterate Convergence of No-Regret Learning for Equilibria in Bargaining Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bargaining games, where agents attempt to agree on how to split utility, are an important class of games used to study economic behavior, which motivates a study of online learning algorithms in these games. In this work, we tackle when no-regret learning algorithms converge to Nash equilibria in bargaining games. Recent results have shown that online algorithms related to Follow the Regularized Leader (FTRL) converge to Nash equilibria (NE) in the last iterate in a wide variety of games, including zero-sum games. However, bargaining games do not have the properties used previously to established convergence guarantees, even in the simplest case of the ultimatum game, which features a single take-it-or-leave-it offer. Nonetheless, we establish that FTRL (without the modifications necessary for zero-sum games) achieves last-iterate convergence to an approximate NE in the ultimatum game along with a bound on convergence time under mild assumptions. Further, we provide experimental results to demonstrate that convergence to NE, including NE with asymmetric payoffs, occurs under a broad range of initial conditions, both in the ultimatum game and in bargaining games with multiple rounds. This work demonstrates how complex economic behavior (e.g. learning to use threats and the existence of many possible equilibrium outcomes) can result from using a simple learning algorithm, and that FTRL can converge to equilibria in a more diverse set of games than previously known.</description>

      <title>Iterative Vickrey Auctions via Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the linear programming approach to competitive equilibrium pricing, we develop a general method for constructing iterative auctions that achieve Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) outcomes. We show how to transform a linear program characterizing competitive equilibrium prices into one that characterizes universal competitive equilibrium (UCE) prices, which elicit precisely the information needed to compute VCG payments. By applying a primal-dual algorithm to these transformed programs, we derive iterative Vickrey auctions that maintain a single price path, eliminating the overhead and incentive problems associated with multiple price paths used solely for payment calculations. We demonstrate the versatility of our method by developing a novel iterative Vickrey auction for the multi-unit setting and an iterative variant of the Product-Mix auction. The resulting auctions combine the transparency of iterative price discovery with the efficiency and incentive properties of the VCG mechanism.</description>

      <title>Tight Efficiency Bounds for the Probabilistic Serial Mechanism under Cardinal Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Probabilistic Serial (PS) mechanism -- also known as the simultaneous eating algorithm -- is a canonical solution for the assignment problem under ordinal preferences. It guarantees envy-freeness and ordinal efficiency in the resulting random assignment. However, under cardinal preferences, its efficiency may degrade significantly: it is known that PS may yield allocations that are $\Omega(\ln{n})$-worse than Pareto optimal, but whether this bound is tight remained an open question.
  Our first result resolves this question by showing that the PS mechanism guarantees $(\ln(n)+2)$-approximate Pareto efficiency, even in the more general submodular setting introduced by Fujishige, Sano, and Zhan (ACM TEAC 2018). This is established by showing that, although the PS mechanism may incur a loss of up to $O(\sqrt{n})$ in utilitarian social welfare, it still achieves a $(\ln{n}+2)$-approximation to the maximum Nash welfare. In addition, we present a polynomial-time algorithm that computes an allocation which is envy-free and $e^{1/e}$-approximately Pareto-efficient, answering an open question posed by Tr\"obst and Vazirani (EC 2024).
  The PS mechanism also applies to the allocation of chores instead of goods. We prove that it guarantees an $n$-approximately Pareto-efficient allocation in this setting, and that this bound is asymptotically tight. This result provides the first known approximation guarantee for computing a fair and efficient allocation in the assignment problem with chores under cardinal preferences.</description>

      <title>On characterization and existence of a constrained correlated equilibria in Markov games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Markov games with coupling constraints provide a natural framework to study constrained decision-making involving self-interested agents, where the feasibility of an individual agent's strategy depends on the joint strategies of the others. Such games arise in numerous real-world applications involving safety requirements and budget caps, for example, in environmental management, electricity markets, and transportation systems. While correlated equilibria have emerged as an important solution concept in unconstrained settings due to their computational tractability and amenability to learning, their constrained counterparts remain less explored. In this paper, we study constrained correlated equilibria-feasible policies where any unilateral modifications are either unprofitable or infeasible. We first characterize the constrained correlated equilibrium showing that different sets of modifications result in an equivalent notion, a result which may enable efficient learning algorithms. We then address existence conditions. In particular, we show that a strong Slater-type condition is necessary in games with playerwise coupling constraints, but can be significantly weakened when all players share common coupling constraints. Under this relaxed condition, we prove the existence of a constrained correlated equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Fair and Efficient Allocation of Indivisible Mixed Manna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study fair division of indivisible mixed manna (items whose values may be positive, negative, or zero) among agents with additive valuations. Here, we establish that fairness -- in terms of a relaxation of envy-freeness -- and Pareto efficiency can always be achieved together. Specifically, our fairness guarantees are in terms of envy-freeness up to $k$ reallocations (EFR-$k$): An allocation $A$ of the indivisible items is said to be EFR-$k$ if there exists a subset $R$ of at most $k$ items such that, for each agent $i$, we can reassign items from within $R$ (in $A$) and obtain an allocation, $A^i$, which is envy-free for $i$. We establish that, when allocating mixed manna among $n$ agents with additive valuations, an EFR-$(n-1)$ and Pareto optimal (PO) allocation $A$ always exists. Further, the individual envy-free allocations $A^i$, induced by reassignments, are also PO. In addition, we prove that such fair and efficient allocations are efficiently computable when the number of agents, $n$, is fixed.
  We also obtain positive results focusing on EFR by itself (and without the PO desideratum). Specifically, we show that an EFR-$(n-1)$ allocation of mixed manna can be computed in polynomial time. In addition, we prove that when all the items are goods, an EFR-${\lfloor n/2 \rfloor}$ allocation exists and can be computed efficiently. Here, the $(n-1)$ bound is tight for chores and $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$ is tight for goods.
  Our results advance the understanding of fair and efficient allocation of indivisible mixed manna and rely on a novel application of the Knaster-Kuratowski-Mazurkiewicz (KKM) Theorem in discrete fair division. We utilize weighted welfare maximization, with perturbed valuations, to achieve Pareto efficiency, and overall, our techniques are notably different from existing market-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Ex-Ante Truthful Distribution-Reporting Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies mechanism design for revenue maximization in a distribution-reporting setting, where the auctioneer does not know the buyers' true value distributions. Instead, each buyer reports and commits to a bid distribution in the ex-ante stage, which the auctioneer uses as input to the mechanism. Buyers strategically decide the reported distributions to maximize ex-ante utility, potentially deviating from their value distributions. As shown in previous work, classical prior-dependent mechanisms such as the Myerson auction fail to elicit truthful value distributions at the ex-ante stage, despite satisfying Bayesian incentive compatibility at the interim stage. We study the design of ex-ante incentive compatible mechanisms, and aim to maximize revenue in a prior-independent approximation framework. We introduce a family of threshold-augmented mechanisms, which ensures ex-ante incentive compatibility while boosting revenue through ex-ante thresholds. Based on these mechanisms, we construct the Peer-Max Mechanism, which achieves an either-or approximation guarantee for general non-identical distributions. Specifically, for any value distributions, its expected revenue either achieves a constant fraction of the optimal social welfare, or surpasses the second-price revenue by a constant fraction, where the constants depend on the number of buyers and a tunable parameter. We also provide an upper bound on the revenue achievable by any ex-ante incentive compatible mechanism, matching our lower bound up to a constant factor. Finally, we extend our approach to a setting where multiple units of identical items are sold to buyers with multi-unit demands.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Refund Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a mechanism design setting with a single item and a single buyer who is uncertain about the value of the item. Both the buyer and the seller have a common model for the buyer's value, but the buyer discovers her true value only upon receiving the item. Mechanisms in this setting can be interpreted as randomized refund mechanisms, which allocate the item at some price and then offer a (partial and/or randomized) refund to the buyer in exchange for the item if the buyer is unsatisfied with her purchase. Motivated by their practical importance, we study the design of optimal deterministic mechanisms in this setting. We characterize optimal mechanisms as virtual value maximizers for both continuous and discrete type settings. We then use this characterization, along with bounds on the menu size complexity, to develop efficient algorithms for finding optimal and near-optimal deterministic mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Two-sided Assortment Optimization: Revenue Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04156v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study adaptive two-sided assortment optimization for revenue maximization in choice-based matching platforms. The platform has two sides of agents, an initiating side, and a responding side. The decision-maker sequentially selects agents from the initiating side, shows each an assortment of agents from the responding side, and observes their choices. After processing all initiating agents, the responding agents are shown assortments and make their selections. A match occurs when two agents mutually select each other, generating pair-dependent revenue. Choices follow Multinomial Logit (MNL) models. This setting generalizes prior work focused on maximizing the number of matches under submodular demand assumptions, which do not hold in our revenue-maximization context. Our main contribution is the design of polynomial-time approximation algorithms with constant-factor guarantees. In particular, for general pairwise revenues, we develop a randomized algorithm that achieves a $(\frac{1}{2} - \epsilon)$-approximation in expectation for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$. The algorithm is static and provides guarantees under various agent arrival settings, including fixed order, simultaneous processing, and adaptive selection. When revenues are uniform across all pairs involving any given responding-side agent, the guarantee improves to $(1 - \frac{1}{e} - \epsilon)$. In structural settings where responding-side agents share a common revenue-based ranking, we design a simpler adaptive deterministic algorithm achieving a $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation. Our approach leverages novel linear programming relaxations, correlation gap arguments, and structural properties of the revenue functions.</description>

      <title>Constant-Approximate and Constant-Strategyproof Two-Facility Location</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study deterministic mechanisms for the two-facility location problem. Given the reported locations of n agents on the real line, such a mechanism specifies where to build the two facilities. The single-facility variant of this problem admits a simple strategyproof mechanism that minimizes social cost. For two facilities, however, it is known that any strategyproof mechanism is $\Omega(n)$-approximate. We seek to circumvent this strong lower bound by relaxing the problem requirements. Following other work in the facility location literature, we consider a relaxed form of strategyproofness in which no agent can lie and improve their outcome by more than a constant factor. Because the aforementioned $\Omega(n)$ lower bound generalizes easily to constant-strategyproof mechanisms, we introduce a second relaxation: Allowing the facilities (but not the agents) to be located in the plane. Our first main result is a natural mechanism for this relaxation that is constant-approximate and constant-strategyproof. A characteristic of this mechanism is that a small change in the input profile can produce a large change in the solution. Motivated by this observation, and also by results in the facility reallocation literature, our second main result is a constant-approximate, constant-strategyproof, and Lipschitz continuous mechanism.</description>

      <title>Truthful, Credible, and Optimal Auctions for Matroids via Blockchains and Commitments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a revenue-optimizing auctioneer in single-dimensional environments with matroid feasibility constraints. Akbarpour and Li (2020) argue that any revenue-optimal, truthful, and credible mechanism requires unbounded communication. Recent works (Ferreira and Weinberg, 2020; Essaidi et al., 2022; Chitra et al., 2024) circumvent their impossibility for the single-item setting through the use of cryptographic commitments and blockchains. We extend their results to matroid feasibility constraints.
  At a high level, the two-round Deferred-Revelation Auction (DRA) discussed by Ferreira and Weinberg (2020) and Chitra et al., (2024) requires each bidder to submit a deposit, which is slashed upon presenting verifiable evidence indicating a deviation from the behaviour prescribed by the mechanism. We prove that the DRA satisfies truthfulness, credibility and revenue-optimality for all matroid environments when bidders' values are drawn from $\alpha$-strongly regular distributions for $\alpha &gt; 0$. Further, we argue that the DRA is not credible for any feasibility constraint beyond matroids and for any smaller deposits than suggested by previous literature even in single-item environments.
  Finally, we modify the Ascending Deferred-Revelation Auction (ADRA) for single-item settings proposed by Essaidi et al., (2022) for arbitrary bidder value distributions. We implement a deferred-revelation variant of the deferred-acceptance auction for matroids due to Bikhchandani et al., (2011), which requires the same bounded communication as the ADRA.</description>

      <title>A number game reconciliation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Number games play a central role in alternating normal play combinatorial game theory due to their real-number-like properties (Conway 1976). Here we undertake a critical re-examination: we begin with integer and dyadic games and identify subtle inconsistencies and oversights in the established literature (e.g. Siegel 2013), most notably, the lack of distinction between a game being a number and a game being equal to a number. After addressing this, we move to the general theory of number games. We analyze Conway's original definition and a later refinement by Siegel, and highlight conceptual gaps that have largely gone unnoticed. Through a careful dissection of these issues, we propose a more coherent and robust formulation. Specifically, we develop a refined characterization of numbers, via several subclasses, dyadics, canonical forms, their group theoretic closure and zugzwangs, that altogether better capture the essence of number games. This reconciliation not only clarifies existing ambiguities but also uncovers several open problems.</description>

      <title>Vector Cost Bimatrix Games with Applications to Autonomous Racing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a vector cost alternative to the scalarization method for weighting and combining multi-objective costs. The algorithm produces solutions to bimatrix games that are simultaneously pure, unique Nash equilibria and Pareto optimal with guarantees for avoiding worst case outcomes. We achieve this by enforcing exact potential game constraints to guide cost adjustments towards equilibrium, while minimizing the deviation from the original cost structure. The magnitude of this adjustment serves as a metric for differentiating between Pareto optimal solutions. We implement this approach in a racing competition between agents with heterogeneous cost structures, resulting in fewer collision incidents with a minimal decrease in performance.

      <title>A contemporary approach on revisited cost allocation using airport games: the effects of code-sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important operational aspect in airport management is the allocation of fees to aircraft movements on a runway, whether operated by separate operators or under code-sharing agreements. This paper analyses the problem of determining fees under code-sharing of the movements at an airport from a game theoretic perspective. In particular, we propose the configuration value for games with coalition configuration as the mechanism for allocating operating costs. We provide the exact expression of this game-theoretic solution for airport games, which depends only on the parameters of the associated airport problem. For this purpose, we consider a new and natural game-theoretic characterization of the configuration value. Finally, for the specific context of airport games, we apply it to a real case as a mechanism to determine the aircraft fees at a Spanish airport in a code-sharing scenario.</description>

      <title>Attraction of the core and the cohesion flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We adopt a continuous-time dynamical system approach to study the evolution of the state of a game driven by the willingness to reduce the total dissatisfaction of the coalitions about their payment. Inspired by the work of Grabisch and Sudh\"olter about core stability, we define a vector field on the set of preimputations from which is defined, for any preimputation, a cohesion curve describing the evolution of the state. We prove that for each preimputation, there exists a unique cohesion curve. Subsequently, we show that, for the cohesion flow of a balanced game, the core is the unique minimal attractor of the flow, the realm of which is the whole preimputation set. These results improve our understanding of the ubiquity of the core in the study of cooperative games with transferable utility.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Resolution Dynamic Game Framework for Cross-Echelon Decision-Making in Cyber Warfare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyber warfare has become a critical dimension of modern conflict, driven by society's increasing dependence on interconnected digital and physical infrastructure. Effective cyber defense often requires decision-making at different echelons, where the tactical layer focuses on detailed actions such as techniques, tactics, and procedures, while the strategic layer addresses long-term objectives and coordinated planning. Modeling these interactions at different echelons remains challenging due to the dynamic, large-scale, and interdependent nature of cyber environments. To address this, we propose a multi-resolution dynamic game framework in which the tactical layer captures fine-grained interactions using high-resolution extensive-form game trees, while the strategic layer is modeled as a Markov game defined over lower-resolution states abstracted from those game trees. This framework supports scalable reasoning and planning across different levels of abstraction through zoom-in and zoom-out operations that adjust the granularity of the modeling based on operational needs. A case study demonstrates how the framework works and its effectiveness in improving the defender's strategic advantage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a data-driven approach to Bayesian persuasion. The receiver is privately informed about the prior distribution of the state of the world, the sender knows the receiver's preferences but does not know the distribution of the state variable, and the sender's payoffs depend on the receiver's action but not on the state. Prior to interacting with the receiver, the sender observes the distribution of actions taken by a population of decision makers who share the receiver's preferences in best response to an unobserved distribution of messages generated by an unknown and potentially heterogeneous signal. The sender views any prior that rationalizes this data as plausible and seeks a signal that maximizes her worst-case payoff against the set of all such distributions. We show positively that the two-state many-action problem has a saddle point and negatively that the two-action many-state problem does not. In the former case, we identify adversarial priors and optimal signals. In the latter, we characterize the set of robustly optimal Blackwell experiments.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Game-Theory and Deep Learning Framework for Predicting Tourist Arrivals via Big Data Analytics and Opinion Leader Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of Industry 5.0, data-driven decision-making has become indispensable for optimizing systems across Industrial Engineering. This paper addresses the value of big data analytics by proposing a novel non-linear hybrid approach for forecasting international tourist arrivals in two different contexts: (i) arrivals to Hong Kong from five major source nations (pre-COVID-19), and (ii) arrivals to Sanya in Hainan province, China (post-COVID-19). The method integrates multiple sources of Internet big data and employs an innovative game theory-based algorithm to identify opinion leaders on social media platforms. Subsequently, nonstationary attributes in tourism demand data are managed through Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT), ensuring refined time-frequency analysis. Finally, a memory-aware Stacked Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Stacked BiLSTM) network is used to generate accurate demand forecasts. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques and remains robust under dynamic and volatile conditions, highlighting its applicability to broader Industrial Engineering domains, such as logistics, supply chain management, and production planning, where forecasting and resource allocation are key challenges. By merging advanced Deep Learning (DL), time-frequency analysis, and social media insights, the proposed framework showcases how large-scale data can elevate the quality and efficiency of decision-making processes.</description>

      <title>Evolutionarily Stable Preferences Against Multiple Mutations in Multi-player Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:1810.12660v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the indirect evolutionary approach to study evolutionarily stable preferences against multiple mutations in single- and multi-population matching settings, respectively. Players choose strategies to maximize their subjective preferences, which may be inconsistent with the material payoff function giving them the actual fitness values. In each of the two settings, $n$-player games are played, and we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for multi-mutation stability. These results definitely reveal the connection between the order of stability and the level of efficiency.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Efficiency of Regulation in Matching Markets with Distributional Disparities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.14387v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cap-based regulations are widely used to address distributional disparities in matching markets, but their efficiency relative to alternative instruments such as subsidies remains poorly understood. This paper develops a framework for evaluating policy interventions by incorporating regional constraints into a transferable utility matching model. We show that a policymaker with aggregate-level match data can implement a taxation policy that maximizes social welfare and outperforms any cap-based policy. Using newly collected data from the Japan Residency Matching Program, we estimate participant preferences and simulate counterfactual match outcomes under both cap-based and subsidy-based policies. The results reveal that the status quo cap-based regulation generates substantial efficiency losses, whereas small, targeted subsidies can achieve similar distributional goals with significantly higher social welfare.</description>

      <title>Arena-independent Memory Bounds for Nash Equilibria in Reachability Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the memory requirements of Nash equilibria in turn-based multiplayer games on possibly infinite graphs with reachability, safety, shortest-path, B\"uchi and co-B\"chi objectives.
  We present constructions for finite-memory Nash equilibria in these games that apply to arbitrary game graphs, bypassing the finite-arena requirement that is central in existing approaches. We show that, for these five types of games, from any Nash equilibrium, we can derive another Nash equilibrium where all strategies are finite-memory such that all objectives satisfied by the outcome of the original equilibrium also are by the outcome of the derived equilibrium, without increasing costs for shortest-path games.
  Furthermore, we provide memory bounds that are independent of the size of the game graph for reachability, safety and shortest-path games. These bounds depend only on the number of players.
  To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first results pertaining to finite-memory constrained Nash equilibria in infinite arenas and the first arena-independent memory bounds for Nash equilibria.</description>

      <title>Method of Equal Shares with Bounded Overspending</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15005v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In participatory budgeting (PB), voters decide through voting which subset of projects to fund within a given budget. Proportionality in the context of PB is crucial to ensure equal treatment of all groups of voters. However, pure proportional rules can sometimes lead to suboptimal outcomes. We introduce the Method of Equal Shares with Bounded Overspending (BOS Equal Shares), a robust variant of Equal Shares that balances proportionality and efficiency. BOS Equal Shares addresses inefficiencies implied by strict proportionality axioms, yet the rule still provides fairness guarantees, similar to the original Method of Equal Shares. Our extensive empirical analysis on real-world PB instances shows excellent performance of BOS Equal Shares across several metrics. In the course of the analysis, we also present and examine a fractional variant of the Method of Equal Shares which allows for partial funding of projects.</description>

      <title>You Can't Always Get What You Want: Games of Ordered Preference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21447v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study noncooperative games, in which each player's objective is composed of a sequence of ordered- and potentially conflicting-preferences. Problems of this type naturally model a wide variety of scenarios: for example, drivers at a busy intersection must balance the desire to make forward progress with the risk of collision. Mathematically, these problems possess a nested structure, and to behave properly players must prioritize their most important preference, and only consider less important preferences to the extent that they do not compromise performance on more important ones. We consider multi-agent, noncooperative variants of these problems, and seek generalized Nash equilibria in which each player's decision reflects both its hierarchy of preferences and other players' actions. We make two key contributions. First, we develop a recursive approach for deriving the first-order optimality conditions of each player's nested problem. Second, we propose a sequence of increasingly tight relaxations, each of which can be transcribed as a mixed complementarity problem and solved via existing methods. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach reliably converges to equilibrium solutions that strictly reflect players' individual ordered preferences.</description>

      <title>Near-Linear MIR Algorithms for Stochastically-Ordered Priors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rise of online applications, recommender systems (RSs) often encounter constraints in balancing exploration and exploitation. Such constraints arise when exploration is carried out by agents whose utility must be taken into account when optimizing overall welfare. A recent work by Bahar et al. (2020) suggests that recommendations should be \emph{mechanism-informed individually rational} (MIR). Specifically, if agents have a default arm they would use, relying on the RS should yield each agent at least the reward of the default arm, conditioned on the information available to the RS. Under the MIR constraint, striking a balance between exploration and exploitation becomes a complex planning problem. To that end, Bahar et al. propose an approximately optimal yet inefficient planning algorithm that runs in $O(2^K K^2 H^2)$, where $K$ is the number of arms and $H$ is the size of the support of the reward distributions. In this paper, we make a significant improvement for a special yet practical case, removing both the dependence on $H$ and the exponential dependence on $K$. We assume a stochastic order of the rewards (e.g., Gaussian with unit variance, Bernoulli, etc.), and devise an asymptotically optimal algorithm with a runtime of $O(K \log K)$. Our technique is based on formulating a Goal Markov Decision Process (GMDP), establishing an optimal dynamic programming procedure, and then unveiling its crux -- fleshing out a simple index-based structure that facilitates efficient computation. Additionally, we present an incentive-compatible version of our algorithm.</description>

      <title>Two-Sided Matching with Resource-Regional Caps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study two-sided many-to-one matching problems under a novel type of distributional constraints, resource-regional caps. In the context of college admissions, under resource-regional caps, an admitted student may be provided with a unit of some resource through a college, which belongs to a region possessing some amount of this resource. A student may be admitted to a college with at most one unit of any resource, i.e., all resources are close substitutes, e.g., dorms on the campus, dorms outside the campus, subsidies for renting a room, etc. The core feature of our model is that students are allowed to be admitted without any resource, which breaks heredity property of previously studied models with regions.
  It is well known that a stable matching may not exist under markets with regional constraints. Thus, we focus on three weakened versions of stability that restore existence under resource-regional caps: envyfreeness plus resource-efficiency, non-wastefulness, and novel direct-envy stability. For each version of stability we design corresponding matching mechanism(s). Finally, we compare stability performances of constructed mechanisms on an exhaustive collection of synthetic markets, and conclude that the most sophisticated direct-envy stable mechanism is the go-to mechanism for maximal stability of the resulting matching under resource-regional caps.</description>

      <title>When is Truthfully Allocating Chores no Harder than Goods?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of fairly and efficiently allocating a set of items among strategic agents with additive valuations, where items are either all indivisible or all divisible. When items are goods, numerous positive and negative results are known regarding the fairness and efficiency guarantees achievable by truthful mechanisms, whereas our understanding of truthful mechanisms for chores remains considerably more limited. In this paper, we discover various connections between truthful good and chore allocations, greatly enhancing our understanding of the latter via tools from the former.
  For indivisible chores with two agents, by leveraging the observation that a simple bundle-swapping operation transforms several properties for goods including truthfulness to the corresponding properties for chores, we characterize truthful mechanisms and derive tight guarantees of various fairness notions achieved by truthful mechanisms. Moreover, for homogeneous divisible chores, by generalizing the above transformation to an arbitrary number of agents, we characterize truthful mechanisms with two agents, show that every truthful mechanism with two agents admits an efficiency ratio of $0$, and derive a large family of strictly truthful, envy-free (EF), and proportional mechanisms for an arbitrary number of agents. Finally, for indivisible chores with an arbitrary number of agents having bi-valued cost functions, we give an ex-ante truthful, ex-ante Pareto optimal, ex-ante EF, and ex-post envy-free up to one item mechanism, improving the best guarantees for bi-valued instances by prior works.</description>

      <title>Perspectives on Unsolvability in the Roommates Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the well-studied Stable Roommates problem, we seek a stable matching of agents into pairs, where no two agents prefer each other over their assigned partners. However, some instances of this problem are unsolvable, lacking any stable matching. A long-standing open question posed by Gusfield and Irving (1989) asks about the behavior of the probability function Pn, which measures the likelihood that a random instance with n agents is solvable.
  This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the landscape surrounding this question, combining structural, probabilistic, and experimental perspectives. We review existing approaches from the past four decades, highlight connections to related problems, and present novel structural and experimental findings. Specifically, we estimate Pn for instances with preferences sampled from diverse statistical distributions, examining problem sizes up to 5,001 agents, and look for specific sub-structures that cause unsolvability. Our results reveal that while Pn tends to be low for most distributions, the number and lengths of "unstable" structures remain limited, suggesting that random instances are "close" to being solvable.
  Additionally, we present the first empirical study of the number of stable matchings and the number of stable partitions that random instances admit, using recently developed algorithms. Our findings show that the solution sets are typically small. This implies that many NP-hard problems related to computing optimal stable matchings and optimal stable partitions become tractable in practice, and motivates efficient alternative solution concepts for unsolvable instances, such as stable half-matchings and maximum stable matchings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00631v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Correctness is an emergent property of systems where exposing error is cheaper than committing it. In dynamic, low-trust environments, autonomous AI agents benefit from delegating work to sub-agents, yet correctness cannot be assured through upfront specification or centralized oversight. We propose a protocol that enforces correctness through collateralized claims in a recursive verification game. Tasks are published as intents, and solvers compete to fulfill them. Selected solvers carry out tasks under risk, with correctness checked post hoc by verifiers. Any challenger can challenge a result by staking against it to trigger the verification process. Incorrect agents are slashed and correct opposition is rewarded, with an escalation path that penalizes erroneous verifiers themselves. When incentives are aligned across solvers, challengers, and verifiers, falsification conditions make correctness the Nash equilibrium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.05590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A powerful feature in mechanism design is the ability to irrevocably commit to the rules of a mechanism. Commitment is achieved by public declaration, which enables players to verify incentive properties in advance and the outcome in retrospect. However, public declaration can reveal superfluous information that the mechanism designer might prefer not to disclose, such as her target function or private costs. Avoiding this may be possible via a trusted mediator; however, the availability of a trustworthy mediator, especially if mechanism secrecy must be maintained for years, might be unrealistic. We propose a new approach to commitment, and show how to commit to, and run, any given mechanism without disclosing it, while enabling the verification of incentive properties and the outcome -- all without the need for any mediators. Our framework utilizes zero-knowledge proofs -- a cornerstone of modern cryptographic theory. Applications include both private-type settings such as auctions and private-action settings such as contracts, as well as non-mediated bargaining with hidden yet binding offers.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a blockchain-based insurance scheme that integrates parametric and collaborative elements. A pool of investors, referred to as surplus providers, locks funds in a smart contract, enabling blockchain users to underwrite parametric insurance contracts. These contracts automatically trigger compensation when predefined conditions are met. The collaborative aspect is embodied in the generation of tokens, which are distributed to surplus providers. These tokens represent each participant's share of the surplus and grant voting rights for management decisions. The smart contract is developed in Solidity, a high-level programming language for the Ethereum blockchain, and deployed on the Sepolia testnet, with data processing and analysis conducted using Python. In addition, open-source code is provided and main research challenges are identified, so that further research can be carried out to overcome limitations of this first proof of concept.</description>

      <title>Unsolvability and Beyond in Many-To-Many Non-Bipartite Stable Matching</title>

Abstract: We study the Stable Fixtures problem, a many-to-many generalisation of the classical non-bipartite Stable Roommates matching problem. Building on the foundational work of Tan on stable partitions, we extend his results to this significantly more general setting and develop a rich framework for understanding stable structures in many-to-many contexts. Our main contribution, the notion of a generalised stable partition (GSP), not only characterises the solution space of this problem, but also serves as a versatile tool for reasoning about ordinal preference systems with capacity constraints.
  We show that a GSP can be computed efficiently and and can provide an elegant representation of key aspects of a preference system. Leveraging a connection to stable half-matchings, we also establish a non-bipartite analogue of the Rural Hospitals Theorem for stable half-matchings and GSPs, and connect our results to recent work on near-feasible matchings, providing a simpler algorithm and tighter analysis for this problem.
  Our work also addresses the computational challenges of finding optimal stable half-matchings and GSPs, presenting a flexible integer linear programming model for various objectives. Beyond theoretical insights, we conduct the first empirical analysis of random Stable Fixtures instances, uncovering surprising results, such as the impact of capacity functions on the solvability likelihood. Our work not only unifies and extends classical and recent perspectives on stability in non-bipartite stable matching but also establishes new tools, techniques, and directions for advancing the study of stable matchings and their applications.</description>
