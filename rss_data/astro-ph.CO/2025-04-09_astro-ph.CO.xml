      <title>Scanning the Universe for Large-Scale Structures using Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past few decades, large universal structures have been found that challenge the homogeneity and isotropy expected in standard cosmological models. The largest of these, identified as the Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall, was found in 2014 in the northern galactic hemisphere in the redshift range of 1.6 &lt; z &lt; 2.1. Subsequent studies used an increasing gamma-ray burst database to show that the cluster was unlikely to have been caused by statistical sampling uncertainties. This study re-examines burst clustering in the northern galactic hemisphere using a recently developed methodology. Evidence is provided that the Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall cluster is larger than previously thought, with members potentially spanning the redshift range of 0.33 &lt; z &lt; 2.43. The extension of this cluster's size does not appear to have been due to statistical variations or sampling biases.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Infrared Background Tomography and a Census of Cosmic Dust and Star Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmic far-infrared background (CIB) encodes dust emission from all galaxies and carries valuable information on structure formation, star formation, and chemical enrichment across cosmic time. However, its redshift-dependent spectrum remains poorly constrained due to line-of-sight projection effects. We address this by cross-correlating 11 far-infrared intensity maps spanning a 50-fold frequency range from Planck, Herschel, and IRAS, with spectroscopic galaxies and quasars from SDSS I-IV tomographically. We mitigate foregrounds using CSFD, a CIB-free Milky Way dust map. These cross-correlation amplitudes on two-halo scales trace bias-weighted CIB redshift distributions and collectively yield a $60\sigma$ detection of the evolving CIB spectrum, sampled across hundreds of rest-frame frequencies over $0 &lt; z &lt; 4$. We break the bias-intensity degeneracy by adding monopole information from FIRAS. The recovered spectrum reveals a dust temperature distribution that is broad, spanning the full range of host environments, and moderately evolving. Using low-frequency CIB amplitudes, we constrain cosmic dust density, $\Omega_{\rm dust}$, which peaks at $z = 1$-$1.5$ and declines threefold to the present. Our broad spectral coverage enables a determination of the total infrared luminosity density to 0.04 dex precision, tracing star-formation history with negligible cosmic variance across 90% of cosmic time. We find that cosmic star formation is 80% dust-obscured at $z = 0$ and 60% at $z = 4$. Our results, based on intensity mapping, are complete, requiring no extrapolation to faint galaxies or low-surface-brightness components. We release our tomographic CIB spectrum and redshift distributions as a public resource for future studies of the CIB, both as a cosmological matter tracer and CMB foreground.</description>

      <title>The Route to Unveil the Cosmic Genealogy of Supermassive Black Hole Binaries Using Nano-Hertz Gravitational Waves and Galaxy Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nano-hertz (nHz) stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), produced by unresolved supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), offers a unique probe of their cosmic evolution. Using our recently proposed technique, we investigate the prospect of discovering the SMBHB population and its evolution by combining the SGWB signal and its anisotropies with galaxy observation by exploring their cross-correlation. Using a Fisher analysis, we demonstrate that the SGWB power spectrum alone can provide only a weak measurement of the cosmic genealogy of SMBHBs, while the inclusion of the angular power spectrum of SGWB and its cross-correlation with the galaxy distribution can significantly improve our measurement and open a discovery space. With a PTA of 2000 pulsars, achievable in the SKA era, we find that the redshift evolution of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass and galaxy stellar mass can be measured with an SNR up to 4 in the redshift range up to three. The frequency distribution can be constrained with an SNR of approximately up to 80 in the same redshift range at a frequency range accessible from nHz. These SNRs improve further with the increase in the number of pulsars to 5000 expected from SKA. This demonstrates the prospect of answering the decades-long unsolved problem of SMBH growth and evolution over cosmic time and shedding new insights on the standard model of cosmology using synergy between nHz GW and galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Exploring Statistical Isotropy in Planck Data Release 4: Angular Clustering and Cosmological Parameter Variations Across the Sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of small deviations from statistical isotropy in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) - the so-called CMB anomalies - remains an open question in modern cosmology. In this work, we test statistical isotropy in Planck Data Release 4 (PR4) by estimating the temperature and $E$-mode power spectra across independent sky regions. We find that the directions with higher local bandpower amplitudes in intensity are clustered for multipoles between 200 and 2000 with clustering probabilities consistently below 1% for all these scales when compared to end-to-end (E2E) Planck simulations; notably, this range extends beyond that reported in Planck Data Release 3 (PR3). On the other hand, no significant clustering is observed in the polarization $E$-modes. In a complementary analysis, we search for dipolar variations in cosmological parameters fitted using the previously computed power spectra. When combining temperature and polarization power spectra, we identify a potential anomaly in the amplitude of the primordial power spectrum, $A_{s}$, with only 5 out of 600 simulations exhibiting a dipole amplitude as large as that observed in the data. Interestingly, the dipole direction aligns closely with the known hemispherical power asymmetry, suggesting a potential link between these anomalies. All other cosmological parameters remain consistent with $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ expectations. Our findings highlight the need to further investigate these anomalies and understand their nature and potential implications for better understanding of the early Universe.</description>

      <title>A new approach for simulating PBH formation from generic curvature fluctuations with the Misner-Sharp formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) may have formed in the early Universe due to the collapse of super-horizon curvature fluctuations. Simulations of PBH formation have been essential for inferring the initial conditions that lead to black hole formation and for studying their properties and impact on our Universe. The Misner-Sharp formalism is commonly used as a standard approach for these simulations. Recently, type-II fluctuations, characterized by a non-monotonic areal radius, have gained interest. In the standard Misner-Sharp approach for simulating PBH formation with these fluctuations, the evolution equations suffer from divergent terms (0/0), which complicate and prevent the simulations. We formulate a new approach to overcome this issue in a simple manner by using the trace of the extrinsic curvature as an auxiliary variable, allowing simulations of type-II fluctuations within the Misner-Sharp formalism. Using a set of standard exponential-shaped curvature profiles, we apply our new approach and numerical code based on pseudospectral methods to study the time evolution of the gravitational collapse, threshold values of type A/B PBHs and PBH mass. Interestingly, we identify cases of type-II fluctuations that do not necessarily result in PBH formation.</description>

      <title>The threshold for PBH formation in the type-II region and its analytical estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically simulate the formation of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) in a radiation-dominated Universe under the assumption of spherical symmetry, driven by the collapse of adiabatic fluctuations, for different curvature profiles $\zeta$. Our results show that the threshold for PBH formation, defined as the peak value of the critical compaction function $\mathcal{C}_{c}(r_m)$ (where $r_m$ is the scale at which the peak occurs), does not asymptotically saturate to its maximum possible value in the type-I region for sufficiently sharp profiles. Instead, the threshold is found in the type-II region with $\mathcal{C}_{c}(r_m)$ being a minimum. We find, for the cases tested, that this is a general trend associated with profiles that exhibit extremely large curvatures in the linear component of the compaction function $\mathcal{C}_{l}(r) \equiv -4r \zeta'(r)/3$ shape around its peak $r_m$ (spiky shapes). To measure this curvature at $r_m$, we define a dimensionless parameter: $\kappa \equiv -r^{2}_m \mathcal{C}_l''(r_m)$, and we find that the thresholds observed in the type-II region occur for $\kappa \gtrsim 30$ for the profiles we have used. By defining the threshold in terms of $\mathcal{C}_{l,c}(r_m)$, we extend previous analytical estimations to the type-II region, which is shown to be accurate within a few percent when compared to the numerical simulations for the tested profiles. Our results suggest that current PBH abundance calculations for models where the threshold lies in the type-II region may have been overestimated due to the general assumption that it should saturate at the boundary between the type-I and type-II regions.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from primordial black hole dominance: The effect of inflaton decay rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore primordial black holes (PBH) formation scenario during the post-inflationary preheating stage dominated by the inflaton field. We consider, in particular, a model-independent parametrization of the Gaussian peak inflationary power spectrum that leads to amplified inflationary density fluctuations before the end of inflation. These modes can reenter the horizon during preheating and could experience instabilities that trigger the production of PBH. This is estimated with the Khlopov-Polnarev (KP) formalism that takes into account non-spherical effects. We derive an accurate analytical expression for the mass fraction under the KP formalism that fits well with the numerical evaluation. Particularly, we focus on ultra-light PBH of masses $M_{\text{PBH}}&lt;10^9g$ and study their evolution and (possible) dominance after the decay of the inflation field into radiation and before the PBH evaporation via Hawking radiation. These considerations alter the previous estimates of induced gravitational waves (GWs) from PBH dominance and open new windows for detecting stochastic GW backgrounds with future detectors.</description>

      <title>On the Hamilton-Jacobi approach to inflation beyond slow roll</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hamilton-Jacobi approach is a powerful tool to describe super-Hubble dynamics during cosmological inflation in a non-linear way. A key assumption of this framework is to neglect anisotropic perturbations on large scales. We show that neglecting the anisotropic sector in the momentum constraint corresponds to discarding the non-adiabatic mode of scalar-field perturbations at large scales. Consequently, the Hamilton-Jacobi approach cannot be used to describe the evolution of large-scale perturbations during inflation beyond slow roll, when non-adiabatic fluctuations play an important role on super-Hubble scales due to the absence of an attractor trajectory. As an example, we analyse the case of cosmological perturbations during a phase of ultra-slow-roll inflation.</description>

      <title>Has ACT measured radiative corrections to the tree-level Higgs-like inflation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starobinsky inflation and non-minimally coupled Higgs inflation have been among the most favored models of the early universe, as their predictions for the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ fall comfortably within the constraints set by Planck and BICEP/Keck. However, new results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) suggest a preference for higher values of $n_s$, introducing tension with the simplest realizations of these models. In this work, being agnostic about the nature of the inflaton, we show that incorporating one-loop corrections to a Higgs-like inflationary scenario leads to a shift in the predicted value of $n_s$, which brings Higgs-like inflation into better agreement with ACT observations. Remarkably, we find that this can be achieved with non-minimal couplings $\xi &lt; 1$, in contrast to the large values typically required in conventional Higgs inflation, thereby pushing any unitarity-violation scale above the Planck scale. The effect is even more significant when the model is formulated in the Palatini approach, where the modified field-space structure naturally enhances deviations from the metric case. These findings highlight the importance of quantum corrections and gravitational degrees of freedom in refining inflationary predictions in light of new data.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy in light of the DESI DR2 Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether dark energy deviates from the cosmological constant ($\Lambda$CDM) by analyzing baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Data Release 1 (DR1) and Data Release 2 (DR2) of DESI observations, in combination with Type Ia supernovae (SNe) and cosmic microwave background (CMB) distance information. We find that with the larger statistical power and wider redshift coverage of the DR2 dataset the preference for dynamical dark energy does not decrease and remains at approximately the same statistical significance as for DESI~DR1. Employing both a shape-function reconstruction and non-parametric methods with a correlation prior derived from Horndeski theory, we consistently find that the dark energy equation of state $w(z)$ evolves with redshift. While DESI DR1 and DR2 BAO data alone provide modest constraints, combining them with independent SNe samples (PantheonPlus, Union3, and the DES 5-year survey) and a CMB distance prior strengthens the evidence for dynamical dark energy. Bayesian model-selection tests show moderate support for dark energy dynamics when multiple degrees of freedom in $w(z)$ are allowed, pointing to increasing tension with $\Lambda$CDM at a level of roughly $3\sigma$ (or more in certain data combinations). Although the methodology adopted in this work is different from those used in companion DESI papers, we find consistent results, demonstrating the complementarity of dark energy studies performed by the DESI collaboration. Although possible systematic effects must be carefully considered, it currently seems implausible that $\Lambda$CDM will be rescued by future high-precision surveys, such as the complete DESI, Euclid, and next-generation CMB experiments. These results therefore highlight the possibility of new physics driving cosmic acceleration and motivate further investigation into dynamical dark energy models.</description>

      <title>Primordial Features in light of the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the simplest inflationary models predict a power-law form of the primordial power spectrum (PPS), various UV complete scenarios predict features on top of the standard power law that leave characteristic imprints in the late-time distribution of matter, encoded in the galaxy power spectrum. In this work, we assess the validity of the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure (EFTofLSS) and the IR-resummation scheme of PyBird in the context of primordial (oscillatory) features. We find an excellent agreement at the level of the matter power spectrum between N-body simulations and the one-loop EFT predictions, for models commonly studied in the literature. We then apply the EFTofLSS to the galaxy power spectrum measurements from BOSS LRG and eBOSS QSO to constrain specific global and local features in the PPS. We demonstrate that while such features can improve the fit to cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, they may result in a poorer fit to clustering measurements at low redshift. The resulting constraints on the amplitude of the primordial oscillations are competitive with those obtained from CMB data, despite the well-known damping of oscillations due to non-linear structure formation processes. For the first time in this context, we jointly analyze the galaxy power spectrum (monopole and quadrupole) in combination with Planck CMB data to derive strong constraints on the amplitude of primordial features. This work highlights the EFTofLSS as a powerful tool for testing early universe scenarios on scales that complement CMB observations.</description>

      <title>Constraining the [CII] luminosity function from the power spectrum of line intensity maps at redshift 3.6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forthcoming measurements of the line-intensity-mapping power spectrum (PS) are expected to set precious constraints on several quantities of astrophysical and cosmological interest. Our study targets the [CII] luminosity function (LF) at high redshift, which is still highly uncertain, in particular at the faint end. As an example of future opportunities, we present forecasts for the Deep Spectroscopic Survey (DSS) that will be conducted with the Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope at $z \simeq 3.6$ and also make predictions for eventual $10\times$ wider and/or $\sqrt{10}\times$ more sensitive surveys. The halo-occupation properties of [CII] emitters in the MARIGOLD simulations provide us with the motivation to abundance match two versions of the ALPINE LF against the halo mass function. We employ the resulting luminosity-mass relation within the halo model to predict the expected PS signal and its uncertainty. Finally, we use Bayesian inference to analyse mock PS data and forecast what constraints could be achieved on the first two moments of the LF and on Schechter fits. Depending on the actual LF, the DSS will measure the clustering and shot-noise amplitudes of the PS with a signal-to-noise ratio of $\sim 3$ or higher. However, degeneracies with the bias parameter and redshift-space distortions make it unfeasible to extract the first moment of the LF. Even the widest and most sensitive survey we consider can only constrain it with a $50\%$ uncertainty. By jointly fitting the PS and the LF, we directly constrain Schechter-function parameters. We find that the normalisation and the cutoff luminosity are precisely and accurately measured while the faint-end slope remains highly uncertain (unless the true value approaches $-2$). Overall, increasing the survey sensitivity at fixed sky coverage yields greater improvements than covering a larger area at fixed sensitivity.</description>

Abstract: In the audible axion mechanism, axion-like particles source primordial gravitational waves via their coupling to a dark Abelian gauge field. The original setup, however, relies on a large axion decay constant and coupling to produce sizable signals. In this article, we show that delaying the onset of axion oscillations opens up the testable parameter space and reduces the required coupling to $\alpha \gtrsim 1$. Furthermore, we investigate the emission of gravitational waves via the axion coupling to the Standard Model photon in the presence of Schwinger pair production, generating a strong signal in the $\mu$Hz or ultra-high frequency range. Cosmological constraints and gravitational wave projections are provided for both scenarios.</description>

      <title>Primordial Stochastic Gravitational Waves from Massive Higher-Spin Bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can a stationary stone radiate gravitational waves (GWs)? While the answer is typically "no" in flat spacetime, we get a "yes" in inflationary spacetime. In this work, we study the stationary-stone-produced GWs in inflation with a concrete model, where the role of stones is played by massive higher-spin particles. We study particles of spin-2 and higher produced by helical chemical potentials, and show that the induced GWs feature a scale-invariant and helicity-biased power spectrum in the slow-roll limit. Including slow-roll corrections leads to interesting backreactions from the higher-spin boson production, resulting in an intriguing scale-dependence of GWs at small scales. Given the existing observational and theoretical constraints, we identify viable parameter regions capable of generating visibly large GWs for future observations.</description>

      <title>Conformal form-invariant parametrization of scalar-tensor gravity theories: A critical analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the recent result that the action of matter fields is conformal form-invariant in its standard form and on the active and passive approaches to conformal transformations, we review the conformal form-invariant parametrization of scalar-tensor gravity theories. We investigate whether this parametrization is actually different from other existing parametrizations. We also check the accuracy of the claim that the classical physical predictions of these theories are conformal-frame invariants.</description>

      <title>A Redshift Survey of the Coma Cluster (A1656): Understanding the Nature of Subhalos in the Weak-lensing Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the physical properties of weak-lensing subhalos in the Coma cluster of galaxies using data from galaxy redshift surveys. The data include 12989 galaxies with measured spectroscopic redshifts (2184 from our MMT/Hectospec observation and 10807 from the literature). The $r$-band magnitude limit at which the differential spectroscopic completeness drops below 50% is 20.2 mag, which is spatially uniform in a region of 4.5 deg$^{2}$ where the weak-lensing map of Okabe et al. (2014) exists. We identify 1337 member galaxies in this field and use them to understand the nature of 32 subhalos detected in the weak-lensing analysis. We use Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) in the line-of-sight velocity domain to measure the mean velocity, the velocity dispersion, and the number of subhalo galaxies by mitigating the contamination from the interloping galaxies. Using subhalo properties calculated with GMM, we find no significant difference in the redshift space distribution between the cluster member galaxies and subhalos. We find that the weak-lensing mass shows strong correlations with the number of subhalo member galaxies, velocity dispersion, and dynamical mass of subhalos with power-law slopes of $0.54^{+0.16}_{-0.15}$, $0.93^{+0.35}_{-0.32}$, and $0.50^{+0.31}_{-0.18}$, respectively. The slope of the mass--velocity dispersion relation of the weak-lensing subhalos appears shallower than that of the galaxy clusters, galaxy groups, and individual galaxies. These results suggest that the combination of redshift surveys with weak-lensing maps can be a powerful tool for better understanding the nature of subhalos in clusters.</description>

      <title>Scalar-assisted magnetogenesis during the radiation-dominated epoch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism to generate primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) strong enough to explain the observed cosmic magnetic fields. We employ a scalar field charged under U(1) gauge symmetry with a non-trivial VEV to provide an effective mass term to the EM field and thus break its conformal invariance. The primordial magneto-genesis takes place in the radiation dominated (RD) epoch, after the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) phase. As a result, our mechanism is naturally free from the over-production of electric fields due to high conductivity in the RD epoch, and the baryon isocurvature problem which takes place only if magneto-genesis happens before the ESWB phase. In addition, we find that a significant amount of PMFs can be generated when the scalar field experiences a tachyonic phase. In this case, the scalar field is light and weakly coupled and has negligible energy density compared to the cold dark matter, hence the strong coupling problem and the back-reaction problem are also absent. Therefore, our model is free from the above-mentioned problems that frequently appear in other primordial magneto-genesis scenarios.</description>

      <title>Pushing JWST to the extremes: search and scrutiny of bright galaxy candidates at z$\simeq$15-30</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We designed customized Lyman-break color selection techniques to identify galaxy candidates in the redshift ranges $15 \leq z \leq 20$ and $20 \leq z \leq 28$. The selection was performed on the ASTRODEEP-JWST multi-band catalogs of the CEERS, Abell-2744, JADES, NGDEEP, and PRIMER survey fields, covering a total area of $\sim0.2$ sq. deg. We identify nine candidates at $15 \leq z \leq 20$, while no objects are found based on the $z\gtrsim20$ color selection criteria. Despite exhibiting a $&gt;$1.5 mag break, all the objects display multimodal redshift probability distributions across different SED-fitting codes and methodologies. The alternative solutions correspond to poorly understood populations of low-mass quiescent or dusty galaxies at z$\sim$3-7. This conclusion is supported by the analysis of a NIRSpec spectrum recently acquired by the CAPERS program for one interloper object, which is confirmed to be a dusty ($E(B-V)=0.8$ mag) starburst galaxy at $z=6.56$. We measured the UV luminosity function under different assumptions on the contamination level within our sample. We find that if even a fraction of the candidates is indeed at $z\gtrsim15$, the resulting UV LF points to a very mild evolution compared to estimates at $z&lt;15$, implying a significant tension with existing theoretical models. In particular, confirming our bright ($M_{\text{UV}}&lt;-21$) candidates would require substantial revisions to the theoretical framework. In turn, if all these candidates will be confirmed to be interlopers, we conclude that future surveys may need ten times wider areas to select $M_{\text{UV}}\lesssim-20$ galaxies at $z&gt;15$. Observations in the F150W and F200W filters at depths comparable to those in the NIRCam LW bands are also required to mitigate contamination from rare red objects at z$\lesssim$8.</description>

      <title>Cosmic inflation in non-perturbative quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: String field theory motivated infinite-derivative models lead to non-local gravity modifications which form a promising class of quantum gravity candidates. In this paper we investigate effects of non-locality on the three-point function (the bi-spectrum) during cosmic inflation. The study is done in an Einstein frame with an infinite-derivative scalar field Lagrangian minimally coupled to the Einstein-Hilbert term. A non-local generalization of the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation is derived. Infinite-derivative operators present in this equation lead to an appearance of infinitely many new background induced states in the perturbation spectrum during inflation with complex masses on top of a usual nearly massless inflaton. On contrary to a flat background such states can be classically stable in a de Sitter space-time. This helps preserving observational constraints on the scalar power-spectrum. We proceed by studying a particular configuration assuming that the generalized Mukhanov-Sasaki equation gives rise to an inflaton and one pair of new states with complex conjugate masses as perturbative degrees of freedom. The corresponding scalar bi-spectrum is computed numerically in squeezed and equilateral limits. We use the latest observational constraints on amplitude of the bi-spectrum $f_{NL}$ from Planck 2018 dataset as a guideline for possible values of masses of new emerging states. We find that $f_{NL}$ is non-trivially sensitive to the values of complex masses and this can reduce the parameter space of gravity modifications. In particular we find that the amplitude of the squeezed limit gets easily enhanced while of the equilateral limit can stay like in a local single-field model of inflation. We end up discussing open questions relevant for this class of models of inflation.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Tails of Gravitational Waves in Schwarzschild Black Hole Ringdown</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schwarzschild black holes evolve toward their static configuration by emitting gravitational waves, which decay over time following a power law at fixed spatial positions. We derive this power law analytically for the second-order even gravitational perturbations, demonstrating that it is determined by the fact that the second-order source decays as the inverse square of the distance. Quadratic gravitational modes with multipole $\ell$ decay according to a law $\sim t^{-2\ell-1}$, in contrast to the linear Price law scaling $\sim t^{-2\ell-3}$. Consequently, nonlinear tails may persist longer than their linear counterparts.</description>

      <title>Prospects for constraining interacting dark energy cosmology with gravitational-wave bright sirens detected by future SKA-era pulsar timing arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.04000v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the constraints on cosmological parameters in interacting dark energy (IDE) models described by energy transfer rates $Q = \beta H \rho_{\rm de}$ and $Q = \beta H \rho_{\rm c}$, using simulated gravitational-wave (GW) bright siren data from pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) and the Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. In particular, we simulate a future PTA observation in the FAST/SKA era with 20 millisecond pulsars (MSPs), each having 20\,ns white noise over a 10-year observation span, and demonstrate that this mock dataset significantly improves the constraint precision of key cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant $H_0$, matter density $\Omega_m$, and the coupling parameter $\beta$. For the IDE model $Q = \beta H \rho_{\rm de}$, PTA data alone provides tighter constraints on these parameters than the CMB data alone, primarily due to the high sensitivity of GW standard sirens in probing the late universe. Combining PTA and CMB data further enhances the constraints by 43.6\% for $H_0$, 43.2\% for $\Omega_m$, and 44.7\% for $\beta$, relative to using CMB data alone. In contrast, for $Q = \beta H \rho_{\rm c}$, the CMB data alone constrains $\beta$ more tightly than the PTA data, due to the stronger impact of this interaction in the early universe. Nevertheless, the PTA+\,CMB combination still yields improvements of 13.3\% for $H_0$, 22.7\% for $\Omega_m$, and 18.2\% for $\beta$. Increasing the number of MSPs in the PTA further tightens all parameter constraints in both IDE models. Our results highlight the great potential of future PTA observations for significantly improving cosmological parameter estimation in IDE models, offering critical insights into the nature of dark energy and its interaction with dark matter.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel statistical method to measure cosmic birefringence and demonstrate its power in probing parity violation due to axions. Exploiting an empirical correlation between the integrated radio polarization direction of a spiral galaxy and its apparent shape, we devise an unbiased minimum-variance estimator for the rotation angle, which should achieve an uncertainty of $5^\circ$--$ 15^\circ$ per galaxy. Large galaxy samples from the forthcoming SKA continuum surveys, together with optical shape catalogs, promise a comparable or even lower noise power spectrum for the rotation angle than in the CMB Stage-IV (CMB-S4) experiment, with different systematics.</description>

Abstract: In previous work we have shown that the dipole in the low redshift supernovae of the Pantheon+SH0ES data does not agree with the one inferred from the velocity of the solar system as obtained from CMB data. We interpreted this as the presence of significant bulk velocities. In this paper we study the monopole, dipole and quadrupole in the Pantheon+SH0ES data. We find that in addition to the dipole also both, the monopole and the quadrupole are detected with high significance. They are of similar amplitudes as the bulk flow. While the monopole is only significant at very low redshift, the quadrupole even increases with redshift.</description>

      <title>Impacts of dark energy on weighing neutrinos after DESI BAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15640v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, DESI has released baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data, and DES has also published its five-year supernova (SN) data. These observations, combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, support a dynamically evolving dark energy at a high confidence level. When using cosmological observations to weigh neutrinos, the results of weighing neutrinos will be significantly affected by the measurement of dark energy due to the degeneracy between neutrino mass and the dark-energy equation of state. Therefore, we need to understand how the dynamical evolution of dark energy in the current situation will affect the measurement of neutrino mass. In this work, we utilize these latest observations and other additional distance measurements to discuss the mutual influence between neutrinos and dark energy, then calculate the Bayes factor to compare models. We consider three neutrino mass hierarchies including degenerate hierarchy (DH), normal hierarchy (NH), and inverted hierarchy (IH), as well as three dark energy models including $\Lambda \rm CDM$, $w\rm CDM$, and $w_0w_a \rm CDM$ models. Cosmological data combined with the prior of particle physics experiments can provide strong to decisive evidence favoring the $w_0w_a {\rm CDM}+\sum m_\nu$ model with NH. In the $w_0w_a \rm CDM$ model, using the CMB+DESI+DESY5 data, we obtain constraints on the total neutrino mass, $\sum m_\nu&lt;0.171\ \rm eV,\ 0.204\ \rm eV,\ 0.220\ \rm eV$, for DH, NH, and IH, respectively. Furthermore, taking into account the neutrino hierarchy or incorporating additional distance measurements results in a more pronounced deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model for dark energy. The latter, particularly, exhibits a deviation at a confidence level that surpasses $4\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Probing a nonminimal coupling through superhorizon instability and secondary gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07767v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of scalar fluctuations ($\chi$) non-minimally coupled to gravity, $\xi\chi^2 R$, as a potential source of secondary gravitational waves (SGWs). Our study reveals that when reheating EoS $\wre &lt; 1/3$ and $\xi \lesssim 1/6$ or $\wre &gt; 1/3$ and $\xi \gtrsim 1/6$, the super-horizon modes of scalar field experience a \textit{Tachyonic instability} during the reheating phase. Such instability causes a substantial growth in the scalar field amplitude leading to pronounced production of SGWs in the low and intermediate-frequency ranges that are strong enough to be detected by Planck and future gravitational wave detectors. Such growth in super-horizon modes of the scalar field and associated GW production may have a significant effect on the strength of the tensor fluctuation at the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) scales (parametrized by $r$) and the number of relativistic degrees of freedom (parametrized by $\dneff$) at the time of CMB decoupling. To prevent such overproduction, the PLANCK constraints on tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \leq 0.036$ and $\dneff \leq 0.284$ yield a strong lower bound on $\xi$ for $\wre &lt; 1/3$, and upper bound on the value of $\xi$ for $\wre &gt; 1/3$. Taking into account all the observational constraints we found the value of $\xi$ should be $ \gtrsim 0.02$ for $\wre =0$, and $\lesssim 4.0$ for $\wre \geq 1/2$ for a wide range of reheating temperature within $10^{-2} \lesssim \Tre \lesssim 10^{14}$ GeV, and for a wide range of inflationary energy scales. Further, as one approaches $\wre$ towards $1/3$, the value of $\xi$ remains unconstrained. Finally, we identify the parameter regions in $(\Tre,\xi)$ plane which can be probed by the upcoming GW experiments namely BBO, DECIGO, LISA, and ET.</description>

      <title>Constraints on dark energy and modified gravity from the BOSS Full-Shape and DESI BAO data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We constrain dark energy and modified gravity within the effective field theory of dark energy framework using the full-shape BOSS galaxy power spectrum, combined with Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and recent baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurements from DESI. Specifically, we focus on a varying braiding parameter $\alpha_{\rm B}$, a running of the ``effective'' Planck mass $\alpha_{\rm M}$, and a constant dark energy equation of state $w$. The analysis is performed with two of these parameters at a time, including all the other standard cosmological parameters and marginalizing over bias and nuisance parameters. The full-shape galaxy power spectrum is modeled using the effective field theory of large-scale structure up to 1-loop order in perturbation theory. We find that the CMB data is most sensitive to $\alpha_{\rm B}$, and that adding large-scale structure information only slightly changes the parameter constraints. However, the large-scale structure data significantly improve the bounds on $\alpha_{\rm M}$ and $w$ by a factor of two. This improvement is driven by background information contained in the BAO, which breaks the degeneracy with $H_0$ in the CMB. We confirm this by comparing the BOSS full-shape information with BOSS BAO, finding no significant differences. This is likely to change with future high-precision full-shape data from Euclid and DESI however, to which the pipeline developed here is immediately applicable.</description>

      <title>Fast Simulation of Cosmological Neutral Hydrogen based on the Halo Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmological neutral hydrogen (HI) surveys provide a promising tomographic probe of the post-reionization era and of the standard model of cosmology. Simulations of this signal are crucial for maximizing the utility of these surveys. We present a fast method for simulating the cosmological distribution of HI based on a halo model approach. Employing the approximate $\texttt{PINOCCHIO}$ code, we generate the past light cone of dark matter halos. Subsequently, the halos are populated with HI according to a HI-halo mass relation. The nature of 21 cm intensity mapping demands large-volume simulations with a high halo mass resolution. To fulfill both requirements, we simulate a past light cone for declinations between -15{\deg} and -35{\deg} in the frequency range from 700 to 800 MHz, matching HIRAX, the Hydrogen Intensity and Real-time Analysis eXperiment. We run $\texttt{PINOCCHIO}$ for a 1 h$^{-3}$Gpc$^3$ box with 6700$^3$ simulation particles. With this configuration, halos with masses as low as M$_\text{min}$ = 4.3 $\times$ 10$^{9}$M$_{\odot}$ are simulated, resulting in the recovery of more than 97% of the expected HI density. From the dark matter and HI past light cone, maps with a width of 5 MHz are created. To validate the simulations, we have implemented and present here an analytical dark matter and HI halo model in $\texttt{PyCosmo}$, a Python package tailored for theoretical cosmological predictions. We perform extensive comparisons between analytical predictions and the simulations for the mass function, mass density, power spectrum, and angular power spectrum for dark matter and HI. We find close agreement in the mass function and mass densities, with discrepancies within a few percent. For the three-dimensional power spectra and angular power spectra, we observe an agreement better than 10%.</description>

      <title>Non-parametric reconstructions of cosmic curvature: current constraints and forecasts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The assumption of a flat Universe that follows the cosmological principle, i.e., that the universe is statistically homogeneous and isotropic at large scales, comprises one of the core foundations of the standard cosmological model -- namely, the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Nevertheless, it has been rarely tested in the literature. In this work, we assess the validity of this hypothesis by reconstructing the cosmic curvature with currently available observations, such as Type Ia Supernova and Cosmic Chronometers. We do so by means of null tests, given by consistency relations within the standard model scenario, using a non-parametric method -- which allows us to circumvent prior assumptions on the underlying cosmology. We find no statistically significant departure from the cosmological principle and null curvature in our analysis. In addition, we show that future cosmological observations, specifically those expected from Hubble parameter measurements from redshift surveys, along with gravitational wave observations as standard sirens, will be able to significantly reduce the uncertainties of current reconstructions.</description>

      <title>Interacting dark sector with quadratic coupling: theoretical and observational viability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16299v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Models proposing a non-gravitational interaction between dark energy (DE) and dark matter (CDM) have been extensively studied as alternatives to the standard cosmological model. A common approach to describing the DE-CDM coupling assumes it to be linearly proportional to the dark energy density. In this work, we consider the model with interaction term $Q=3H\gamma{\rho_{x}^{2}}/{(\rho_{c}+\rho_{x})}$. We show that for positive values of $\gamma$ this model predicts a future violation of the Weak Energy Condition (WEC) for the dark matter component, and for a specific range of negative values of $\gamma$ the CDM energy density can be negative in the past. We perform a parameter selection analysis for this model using data from Type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon sample, $H(z)$ measurements from the Cosmic Chronometers sample, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from the DESI survey, and Cosmic Microwave Background data from the Planck combined with the Hubble constant $H_0$ prior. Imposing a prior to ensure that the WEC is not violated, our model is consistent with $\Lambda$CDM in 2$\sigma$ C.L., yet exhibits a preference for smaller values of $\sigma_8$, alleviating the $\sigma_8$ tension between the CMB results from Planck 2018 and the weak gravitational lensing observations from the KiDS-1000 cosmic shear survey.</description>

      <title>Forecasting the performance of the Minimally Informed foreground cleaning method for CMB polarization observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Astrophysical foreground substraction is crucial to retrieve the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization out of the observed data. Recent efforts have been carried out towards the development of a minimally informed component separation method to handle a priori unknown foreground spectral energy distributions (SEDs), while being able to estimate both cosmological, foreground, and potentially instrumental parameters, jointly. In this paper, we develop a semi-analytical performance forecasting framework for the minimally informed method and we validate it by comparing its results against direct sampling of the harmonic-based likelihood and the pixel domain implementation MICMAC. We then use the forecasting tool to demonstrate the robustness of the bias correction procedure introduced in the minimally informed approach. We find that a data-driven approach based on the currently available observational data is enough to efficiently regularize the bias of the method.</description>

      <title>A mechanism to generate varying speed of light via Higgs-dilaton coupling: Theory and cosmological applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02583v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We allow the Higgs field $\Phi$ to interact with a dilaton field $\chi$ of the background spacetime via the coupling $\chi^2\,\Phi^\dagger\Phi$. Upon spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking, the Higgs VEV becomes proportional to $\chi$. While traditionally this linkage is employed to make the Planck mass and particle masses dependent on $\chi$, we present an $\textit alternative$ mechanism: the Higgs VEV will be used to construct Planck's constant $\hbar$ and speed of light $c$. Specifically, each open set vicinity of a given point $x^*$ on the spacetime manifold is equipped with a replica of the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam action operating with its own effective values of $\hbar_*$ and $c_*$ per $\hbar_*\propto\chi^{-1/2}(x^*)$ and $c_*\propto\chi^{1/2}(x^*)$, causing these ``fundamental constants'' to vary alongside the dynamical field $\chi$. Moreover, in each open set around $x^*$, the prevailing value $\chi(x^*)$ determines the length and time scales for physical processes occurring in this region as $l\propto\chi^{-1}(x^*)$ and $\tau\propto\chi^{-3/2}(x^*)$. This leads to an $\textit anisotropic$ relation $\tau^{-1}\propto l^{-3/2}$ between the rate of clocks and the length of rods, resulting in a distinct set of novel physical phenomena. For late-time cosmology, the variation of $c$ along the trajectory of light waves from distant supernovae towards the Earth-based observer necessitates modifications to the Lema\^itre redshift relation and the Hubble law. These modifications are capable of: (1) Accounting for the Pantheon Catalog of SNeIa $\textit{through a declining speed of light in an expanding Einstein--de Sitter universe}$, thus avoiding the need for dark energy; (2) Revitalizing Blanchard-Douspis-Rowan-Robinson-Sarkar's CMB power spectrum analysis that bypassed dark energy [A&amp;A 412, 35 (2003)]; and (3) Resolving the $H_0$ tension without requiring a dynamical dark energy component.</description>

      <title>Dimming Starlight with Dark Compact Objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a new technique to search for dark compact objects. When dark matter comprising a dark compact object interacts with photons, the compact object can disperse light traveling though it. As these objects pass between Earth and a distant star, they act as "lampshades" that dim the star. We examine how dimming effects from clumps of dark matter in the Galaxy could be searched for in microlensing surveys, which measure the brightness of stars as a function of time. Using the EROS-2 and OGLE surveys, we show that a dimming analysis of existing data can be used to constrain dark sectors, and could be used to discover dark matter in compact objects.</description>

      <title>Probing vector gravitational atoms with eccentric intermediate mass-ratio inspirals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight bosons, proposed as candidates for dark matter (DM), are predicted by various new physics models. In the presence of bosons with suitable masses, superradiant (SR) instability can naturally transform a spinning black hole (BH) into a gravitational atom (GA). Here we study the dynamics of intermediate mass-ratio inspirals (IMRIs) around a GA formed by ultralight vector field saturated in its SR ground state. We employ a perturbative model at the leading Newtonian order to consistently account for both the conservative effect of cloud gravity and the dissipative effect of cloud ionization. We find the cloud can make a sizable negative contribution to the secular periastron precession at binary separations comparable to the gravitational Bohr radius. Meanwhile, the backreaction of ionization could significantly accelerate the process of orbital decay and circularization. Considering reasonably small vector boson masses, we examine the adiabatic orbital evolution and gravitational waveforms of eccentric inspirals. The results indicate that vector GAs might be detectable through observations of low-frequency IMRIs by the future space-based gravitational-wave detectors, such as LISA and Taiji.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Molecular Hydrogen Cooling on the Galaxy Formation Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of molecular (${\rm H_2}$) and atomic (HI) hydrogen cooling on the galaxy formation threshold. We calculate the fraction of dark matter (DM) halos that exceeds a critical mass required for star formation, $M_{\mathrm{crit}}(z)$, as a function of their peak mass. By convolving analytic halo mass accretion histories (MAHs) with models for $M_{\mathrm{crit}}(z)$, we predict that halos with peak virial masses below $\sim 10^8~M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$ can form stars before reionization through ${\rm H_2}$ cooling. These halos remain dark when only HI cooling and reionization are modeled. However, less than $\approx 10\%$ of halos with peak masses below $\sim 10^{7}~M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$ ever exceed $M_{\mathrm{crit}}(z)$, even when ${\rm H_2}$ cooling is included; this threshold is primarily set by relative streaming motion between DM and baryons imprinted at recombination. We obtain similar results using subhalo MAHs from an extremely high-resolution cosmological DM--only zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way (MW) analog (particle mass $6.3\times 10^3~M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$). Based on the abundance of MW satellites, these results imply that at least some known ultra-faint dwarf galaxies formed through ${\rm H_2}$ cooling. This work sharpens predictions for the galaxy formation threshold and demonstrates how its essential features emerge from the underlying distribution of halo growth histories.</description>

      <title>Isotropic cosmic birefringence from string axion domain walls without cosmic strings, and DESI results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6 have shown a preference for isotropic cosmic birefringence, consistent with previous analyses based on Planck and WMAP data. Separately, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR2 results suggest that dark energy evolves over cosmic history, pointing to new physics in the late-time universe. In this paper, we propose that domain walls associated with the string axion can naturally explain the isotropic cosmic birefringence, focusing on the case in which the axion starts near a hilltop. Interestingly, to avoid the domain wall problem, these walls must form well after recombination. The predicted rotation angle, $\beta \approx 0.21\,c_\gamma$ degrees (with anomaly coefficient $c_\gamma \approx 1$), is in excellent agreement with observations. This scenario can be further tested by probing anisotropic birefringence of photons emitted long after recombination, as well as gravitational waves. Moreover, starting the axion oscillation from a hilltop naturally enhances its abundance via anharmonic effects, thus contributing to the dark energy component. We discuss how this hilltop axion scenario may connect with the DESI results.</description>

      <title>S-dual Quintessence, the Swampland, and the DESI DR2 Results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a dark energy model in which a quintessence field $\phi$ rolls near the vicinity of a local maximum of its potential characterized by the simplest $S$ self-dual form $V(\phi) = \Lambda \ {\rm sech}(\sqrt{2} \, \phi/M_p)$, where $M_p$ is the reduced Planck mass and $\Lambda \sim 10^{-120} M_p^4$ is the cosmological constant. We confront the model with Swampland ideas and show that the $S$-dual potential is consistent with the distance conjecture, the de Sitter conjecture, and the trans-Planckian censorship conjecture. We also examine the compatibility of this phenomenological model with the intriguing DESI DR2 results and show that the shape of the $S$-dual potential is almost indistinguishable from the axion-like potential, $V (\phi) = m_a^2 \ f_a^2 \ [ 1 + \cos(\phi/f_a)]$, with $m_a$ and $f_a$ parameters fitted by the DESI Collaboration to accommodate the DR2 data. The self-dual potential has the advantage that one starts at the self-dual point and this is a theoretical motivation, because as the universe cools off the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry gets broken leading to a natural rolling away from the symmetric point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The enhancement of induced gravitational waves (GWs) occurs due to a sudden transition from an early matter-dominated era to the radiation-dominated era. We analyze the impact of the transition rate on the scalar potential. We find that the finite transition duration suppresses the oscillation amplitude of the scalar potential, consequently suppressing the amplitude of the GW energy spectrum. By numerically solving the background and perturbation equations, we demonstrate that the physically motivated models, such as the evaporation of primordial black holes and the decay of Q-balls, cannot produce an observable GW signal.</description>
