      <title>Prompt Fission Neutron Spectra of 233U(n,F)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt fission neutron spectra produced up to 20 MeV. Simultaneous analysis of measured and calculated data for 233U(n, F), 235U(n, F) and 239Pu(n, F) maintains stronger justification for the predicted PFNS of 233U(n, F). For the latter the reliable measured PFNS data are available at Eth only. Pre-fission neutron spectra influence the partitioning of fission energy between excitation energy and total kinetic energy of fission fragments. For the reactions 233U (n, F) and 235U (n, F) we have shown that the shape of PFNS depends on the fissility of composite and residual nuclei. The correlation of these peculiarities with contributions of (n, xnf) to the (n, F) and competition of (n, ng) and (n, xn) is established. Exclusive neutron spectra (n, xnf) are consistent with cross sections of 235U(n, F), 234U(n, F), 233U(n, F) and 232U(n,F) reactions, as well as neutron emissive spectra of 235U(n,xn) at 14 MeV. Initial model parameters for 233U (n,F) PFNS are fixed by description of prompt fission neutron spectra of 233U (nth, F). We predict the 233U(n,xnf) exclusive pre-fission neutron spectra of 233U(n,xn) reactions, total kinetic energy TKE of fission fragments and products, partials of average PFNS and observed PFNS of 233U(n,F). PFNS of 233U (n, F) are harder than those of 235U(n, F) PFNS, but softer than those of 239Pu(n, F). Difference of average energies of PFNS of 233U (n, F) and 235U(n, F) amounts to 1-3 %. At incident energies higher than (n, 2nf) reaction threshold the observed PFNS may seem similar, though the partial contributions of 233U(n,xnf) and 235U(n,xnf) are quite different. PFNS of 233U(n,xnf) are obtained in the energy range up to 20 MeV.</description>

      <title>Universal separable structure of the optical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on a momentum-space in-medium folding model, we disclose the universal separability of the optical potential, revealing its radial and nonlocality features at beam energies in the range 40 - 400 MeV and target mass numbers in the range $40\le A\le 208$. From this microscopic study we find that the nonlocality form factor is inherently complex and of hydrogenic nature, affecting both central and spin-orbit components of the potential. A striking outcome from this study is the consistent appearance of a nodal point in the imaginary radial form factor, notably suppressing surface absorption peaks, in evident contrast with Woods-Saxon's assumption of an absorptive peak at the nuclear surface. Our analysis reveals that the complex radial form factor can effectively be represented as convolutions of uniform spherical distribution with a Gaussian form factor and a Yukawa term. These robust microscopically-driven findings offer new ways for investigating nuclear reactions beyond the restricting Woods-Saxon and Perey-Buck assumptions.</description>

      <title>Induced Isotensor Interactions in Heavy-Ion Double-Charge-Exchange Reactions and the Role of Initial and Final State Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of initial state (ISI) and final state (FSI) ion-ion interactions in heavy-ion double-charge-exchange (DCE) reactions $A(Z,N)\to A(Z\pm 2,N\mp 2)$ are studied for double single-charge-exchange (DSCE) reactions given by sequential actions of the isovector nucleon-nucleon (NN) T-matrix. In momentum representation, the second-order DSCE reaction amplitude is shown to be given in factorized form by projectile and target nuclear matrix elements and a reaction kernel containing ISI and FSI. Expanding the intermediate propagator in a Taylor series with respect to auxiliary energy allows us to perform the summation in the leading-order term over intermediate nuclear states in closure approximation. %Please ensure meaning has been retained - corrected HL. The nuclear matrix element attains a form given by the products of two-body interactions directly exciting the $n^2p^{-2}$ and $p^2n^{-2}$ DCE transitions in the projectile and the target nucleus, respectively. %Please ensure meaning has been retained - corrected HL. A surprising result is that the intermediate propagation induces correlations between the transition vertices, showing that DSCE reactions are a two-nucleon process that resembles a system of interacting spin-isospin dipoles. Transformation of the DSCE NN T-matrix interactions from the reaction theoretical t-channel form to the s-channel operator structure required for spectroscopic purposes is elaborated in detail, showing that, in general, a rich spectrum of spin scalar, spin vector and higher-rank spin tensor multipole transitions will contribute to a DSCE reaction. Similarities (and differences) to two-neutrino double-beta decay (DBD) are discussed. ISI/FSI distortion and absorption effects are illustrated in black sphere approximation and in an illustrative application to data.</description>

      <title>Initial energy-momentum to final flow: a general framework for heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of a relativistic heavy-ion collision is typically understood as a process that transmutes the initial geometry of the system into the final momentum distribution of observed hadrons, which can be described via a cumulant expansion of the initial distribution of energy density and is represented at leading order as the well-known eccentricity scaling of anisotropic flow. We extend this framework to include the contribution from initial momentum-space properties, as encoded in other components of the energy-momentum tensor. We confirm the validity of the framework in state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations of large and small systems. With this new framework, it is possible to separate the effects of early-time dynamics from those of final-state evolution, even in the case when the distribution of energy does not fully determine subsequent evolution, as for example, in small systems. Specifically, we answer the question of when and how azimuthal correlations from the initial state survive to the final state. In very small systems such as $p$-$p$, for example, initial momentum degrees of freedom dominate over energy. Thus, even if the system forms a quark-gluon plasma that is well described by hydrodynamics, the usual hydrodynamic picture of the transmutation of initial geometry to final momentum anisotropy is broken. Nevertheless, we show that the hydrodynamic response to the full energy-momentum tensor can be well understood in a similar manner as larger systems. Additionally, this framework elucidates the generic features of the system's evolution that are responsible for the impressive success of hydrodynamic simulations, but which may still hold even in cases where hydrodynamics is not applicable.</description>

      <title>"Soft" interaction parameters setting in the extended quantum molecular dynamics model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extended quantum molecular dynamics (EQMD) model is one of the few quantum molecular dynamics (QMD)-like transport approaches that can be used to study the effective clustering structure as well as heavily deformed nuclei in both ground state nuclei and nuclear reactions. However, there are only two parameter sets that lead to hard incompressibility for long times. The aim of the present work is to obtain a soft equation of state (EoS) in the EQMD model. In this context, we take the isoscalar giant monopole resonance (ISGMR), which is sensitive to the EoS, as an example to check our work. By introducing a kind of standard Skyrme energy density functional with different parameter sets, such as SkP, SkT1, and SKXce, whose incompressibility value ranges from 200 to 268 MeV, the ISGMR of $^{208}$Pb and other nuclei are studied. When the SkP parameter sets are adopted, our new soft interaction in the EQMD model gives reasonable agreement with the experimental data in the heavy ion regime.</description>

      <title>Isovector giant dipole resonance mode with an improved propagation approach in the framework of EQMD model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Extended Quantum Molecular Dynamics (EQMD) model is one of the few QMD-like transport approaches that can describe the $\alpha$-clustering structure with efficient computational power. However, compared to most QMD-like models, the choice of equation of state (EOS) for nuclear matter is very limited. In this work, a Monte Carlo integral method is employed to calculate the density integration with non-integer exponent. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach by studying the isovector giant dipole resonance (IVGDR). This improvement will be beneficial for the EQMD model to study more valuable effects for heavy ion collisions in the near future.</description>

      <title>Theory of Majorana-Type Heavy Ion Double Charge Exchange Reactions by Pion--Nucleon Isotensor Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of heavy ion double charge exchange (DCE) reactions proceeding by effective rank-2 isotensor interactions is presented. Virtual pion--nucleon charge exchange interactions are investigated as the source for induced isotensor interactions, giving rise to the Majorana DCE (MDCE) reaction mechanism. MDCE is of a generic character, proceeding through pairs of complementary ($\pi^\pm,\pi^\mp$) reactions in the projectile and target nucleus. The dynamics of the elementary processes is discussed, where the excitation of pion--nucleon resonances are of central importance. Investigations of initial and final state ion--ion interactions show that these effects are acting as vertex renormalizations. In closure approximation, well justified by the finite pion mass, the second-order transition matrix elements reduce to pion potentials and effective two-body isotensor DCE interactions, giving rise also to two-body correlations in either of the participating nuclei. Connections to neutrinoless Majorana double beta decay (MDBD) are elucidated at various levels of the dynamics, from the underlying fundamental electro-weak and QCD scales to the physical scales of nuclear MDBD and MDCE physics. It is pointed out that heavy ion MDCE reactions may also proceed by competing electro-weak charge exchange processes, leading to lepton MDCE by electrons, positrons, and neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity fluctuations and rapidity correlations in ultracentral proton-nucleus collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A collision between a proton and a heavy nucleus at ultrarelativistic energy creates particles whose rapidity distribution is asymmetric, with more particles emitted in the direction of the nucleus than in the direction of the proton. This asymmetry becomes more pronounced as the centrality estimator, defined from the energy deposited in a calorimeter, increases. We argue that for high-multiplicity collisions, the variation of the impact parameter plays a negligible role, and that the fluctuations of the multiplicity and of the centrality estimator are dominated by quantum fluctuations, whose probability distribution can be well approximated by a correlated gamma distribution. We show that this simple model reproduces existing data, and we make quantitative predictions for collisions in the $0-0.1\%$ and $0-0.01\%$ centrality windows. We argue that by repeating the same analysis with a different centrality estimator, one can obtain direct information about the rapidity decorrelation in particle production.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic moments of the odd-mass nickel isotopes $^{59-67}$Ni</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetic dipole and the spectroscopic quadrupole moments of the nuclear ground states in the odd-mass nickel isotopes $^{59-67}$Ni have been determined using collinear laser spectroscopy at the CERN-ISOLDE facility. They are compared to ab initio valence-space in-medium similarity renormalization group (VS-IMSRG) calculations including contributions of two-body currents as well as to shell-model calculations. The two-body-current contributions significantly improve the agreement with experimental data, reducing the mean-square deviation from the experimental moments by a factor of 3 to 5, depending on the employed interaction. For all interactions, the largest contributions are obtained for the $5/2^-$ ($7/2^-$) isotopes $^{65}$Ni ($^{55}$Ni), which is ascribed to the high angular momentum of the $f$ orbitals. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of two-body-current contributions to the magnetic moment in an isotopic chain of complex nuclei can be handled by the VS-IMSRG and can outperform phenomenological shell-model calculations using effective $g$-factors in the nickel region.</description>

Abstract: This paper describes my personal appreciation for some of the great research achievements of Mitya Diakonov, Vitya Petrov, and Maxim Polyakov and how my own research career has followed the paths they opened. Among the topics where they have been the most influential have been the pursuit and study of the exotic pentaquark. The search for exotics may require a complementary approach, such as experimental and theoretical activity. Here, I would like to focus on a story of $N(1680)$ in which I was involved.</description>

      <title>Flavor dependence of unpolarized quark Transverse Momentum Distributions from a global fit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an extraction of the unpolarized transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution and fragmentation functions that takes into account possible differences between quark flavors and final-state hadrons. The extraction is based on experimental measurements from Drell-Yan processes and semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering, whose combination is essential to distinguish flavor differences. The analysis is carried out at N$^3$LL accuracy. The extracted flavor-dependent distributions give a very good description of the data ($\chi^2/N_{\rm dat} = 1.08$). The resulting uncertainties take fully into account also the uncertainties in the determination of the corresponding collinear distributions.</description>

      <title>In-beam $\gamma-$spectroscopy of the transitional nucleus $^{217}$Ac</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-spin states in the transitional $^{217}$Ac nucleus are established up to 3.8 MeV excitation energy and $I^{\pi} =$ 41/2$^+$ with the addition of around 20 new transitions. The structure of the yrast and near-yrast states below the 29/2$^+$ isomer is revisited. The inconsistencies in the level schemes reported earlier are resolved. The level structure above the 29/2$^+$ isomer is established for the first time. Large-basis shell-model calculations with the KHPE interaction are performed to compare the experimentally observed level energies with the theoretical predictions. A comparison with the systematics of the N = 128 isotones suggests that the yrast structures result from a weak coupling of the odd proton to the even-even 216Ra core, which is consistent with the shell-model configurations. Furthermore, alpha decay of the 29/2$^+$ isomer is revisited and the decay scheme established from this work is discussed in the framework of the shell model.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the growing interest in the applications of quantum information science in astrophysical settings, especially for the neutrino transport in compact objects where three-flavors of neutrinos need to be mapped on qutrits, we review properties of one- and two-qudit systems. We contrast two-qubit and two-qudits systems by pointing out how some of the properties of two-qubit systems generalize to higher dimensions and explore emerging new properties for dimensions three or higher. One example is provided by the Werner states: when the density operator is written in the fundamental representation, we show that only two-qubit Werner states can be pure states, but not two-qudit Werner states when the qudit dimension is larger than two.</description>

      <title>A Joint X-ray and Optical Study of the Massive Redback Pulsar J2215+5135</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PSR J2215+5135 (J2215) is a `redback' spider pulsar, where the intrabinary shock (IBS) wraps around the pulsar rather than the stellar-mass companion. Spider orbital light curves are modulated, dominated by their binary companion thermal emission in the optical band and by IBS synchrotron emission in the X-rays. We report on new XMM-Newton X-ray and U-band observations of J2215. We produce orbital light curves and use them to model the system properties. From our optical light curve modeling, we find a neutron star mass $M_{NS}=2.15\pm0.10 M_\odot$, somewhat lower than previously reported. From the X-ray analysis, we find that the IBS still wraps around the pulsar, but with a wind/companion wind momenta ratio unusually close to unity, implying a flatter IBS geometry {than seen in other spiders. Estimating the companion wind momentum and speed from the X-ray light curve, we find a companion mass-loss rate of ${\dot M}_c\gtrsim10^{-10}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, so that J2215 may become an isolated millisecond pulsar in $\sim 1$ Gyr. Our X-ray analyses support models of magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration in the highly magnetized relativistic IBS.</description>

      <title>Pion gravitational form factors in the QCD instanton vacuum I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pion form factors of the QCD energy-momentum tensor (EMT) are studied in the instanton liquid model (ILM) of the QCD vacuum. In this approach the breaking of conformal symmetry is encoded in the form of stronger-than-Poisson fluctuations in the number of instantons. For the trace of the EMT, it is shown that the gluonic trace anomaly term contributes half the pion mass, with the other half coming from the quark-mass-dependent sigma term. The $Q^2$ dependence of the form factors is governed by glueball and scalar meson exchanges. For the traceless EMT, the spin-0 and 2 form factors are computed at next-to-leading order in the instanton density using effective quark operators. Relations between the gluon and quark contributions to the EMT form factors are derived. The form factors are also expressed in terms of the pion light-front wave functions in the ILM. The results at the low resolution scale of the inverse instanton size are evolved to higher scales using the renormalization group equation. The ILM results compare well with those of recent lattice QCD calculations.</description>

      <title>Strangelets at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of strangelets at finite temperature $T$, employing an equivparticle model that incorporates both linear confinement and leading-order perturbative interactions with density-dependent quark masses. The shell effects are analyzed by solving the Dirac equations for quarks within the mean-field approximation. As temperature increases, these effects weaken due to the occupation probability of single-particle levels being governed by the Fermi-Dirac statistics, a phenomenon known as shell dampening. Surprisingly, the surface tension, derived from a liquid-drop formula, does not decrease with temperature but instead rises until it peaks at $T \approx 20-40$ MeV. At this temperature, shell corrections become negligible, and the formula provides a reasonable approximation for the free energy per baryon of strangelets. However, the curvature term decreases with $T$ despite the presence of shell effects. The neutron and proton emission rates are determined microscopically by the external nucleon gas densities that are in equilibrium with strangelets. These emission rate generally increases with $T$ for stable strangelets, but decrease for those that are unstable to nucleon emission at $T$ = 0. The other properties of $\beta$-stable strangelets obtained with various parameter sets are presented as well. The results indicated in this work are useful for understanding the products of binary compact star mergers and heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>High-precision spectroscopy of $^{20}$O benchmarking ab-initio calculations in light nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The excited states of unstable $^{20}$O were investigated via $\gamma$-ray spectroscopy following the $^{19}$O$(d,p)^{20}$O reaction at 8 $A$MeV. By exploiting the Doppler Shift Attenuation Method, the lifetime of the 2$^+_2$ and 3$^+_1$ states were firmly established. From the $\gamma$-ray branching and E2/M1 mixing ratios for transitions deexciting the 2$^+_2$ and 3$^+_1$ states, the B(E2) and B(M1) were determined. Various chiral effective field theory Hamiltonians, describing the nuclear properties beyond ground states, along with a standard USDB interaction, were compared with the experimentally obtained data. Such a comparison for a large set of $\gamma$-ray transition probabilities with the valence space in medium similarity renormalization group ab-initio calculations was performed for the first time in a nucleus far from stability. It was shown that the ab-initio approaches using chiral EFT forces are challenged by detailed high-precision spectroscopic properties of nuclei. The reduced transition probabilities were found to be a very constraining test of the performance of the ab-initio models.</description>

      <title>Fully charmed tetraquarks from LHC to FCC: Natural stability from fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the inclusive production of fully charmed tetraquarks, $T_{4c}(0^{++})$ or $T_{4c}(2^{++})$ radial excitations, in high-energy proton collisions. We build our study upon the collinear fragmentation of a single parton in a variable-flavor number scheme, suited to describe the tetraquark formation mechanism from moderate to large transverse-momentum regimes. To this extent, we derive a novel set of DGLAP-evolving collinear fragmentation functions, named TQ4Q1.0 determinations. They encode initial-scale inputs corresponding to both gluon and heavy-quark fragmentation channels, defined within the context of quark-potential and spin-physics inspired models, respectively. We work within the NLL/NLO$^+$ hybrid factorization and make use of the JETHAD numeric interface along with the symJETHAD symbolic calculation plugin. With these tools, we provide predictions for high-energy observables sensitive to $T_{4c}$ plus jet emissions at center-of-mass energies ranging from 14 TeV at the LHC to the 100 TeV nominal energy of the FCC.</description>

      <title>NN scattering with NDelta coupling: Dibaryon resonances without "dibaryons"?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08647v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that at their threshold intermediate two-baryon NDelta states can produce resonance-like structures in some isospin one states, often interpreted as more exotic manifest six-quark states. This paper applies the coupled-channel method to study details of the NDelta effect in isospin one NN scattering with interactions constrained to exclude the influence of such extraneous hypothetical particles in two respects. Firstly, the calculated phase parameters are fitted below pion inelasticity, i.e. far below the region of "dibaryons". Secondly, the strength of the NN --&gt; NDelta transition is constrained to agree with the pion production reaction NN --&gt; dpi, fairly independent of the details of the pure "diagonal" NN potential and its effect practically as strong as the NN itself. The results may be considered as a necessary background for searches of additional dibaryon effects. Optimal conditions for resonant NDelta appearances involve a decrease of the orbital angular momentum in the transition NN --&gt; NDelta, as is the case in the 1D2 and 3F3 waves. Also the effective NDelta threshold as well as its width are state dependent. Detailed complex phase shift results are presented for isospin one partial waves up to J=6, where NDelta excitation is still found to be comparable to or even larger than one pion exchange.</description>

      <title>Production of doubly charmed hadron $\Xi_{cc}^{++}$ and $T_{cc}^+$ in relativistic heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02987v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heavy ion collisions provide a unique opportunity for studying the properties of exotic hadrons with two charm quarks. The production of $T_{cc}^+$ is significantly enhanced in nuclear collisions compared to proton-proton collisions due to the creation of multiple charm pairs. In this study, we employ the Langevin equation in combination with the Instantaneous Coalescence Model (LICM) to investigate the production of $T_{cc}^+$ and $\Xi_{cc}^{++}$ which consists of two charm quarks. We consider $T_{cc}^+$ as molecular states composed of $D$ and $D^*$ mesons. The Langevin equation is used to calculate the energy loss of charm quarks and $D$ mesons in the hot medium. The hadronization process, where charm quarks transform into each $D$ state as constituents of $T_{cc}^+$ production, is described using the coalescence model. The coalescence probability between $D$ and $D^*$ is determined by the Wigner function, which encodes the information of the $T_{cc}^+$ wave function. Our results show that the $T_{cc}^+$ production varies by approximately one order of magnitude when different widths in the Wigner function, representing distinct binding energies of $T_{cc}^+$, are considered. This variation offers valuable insights into the nature of $T_{cc}^+$ through the analysis of its wave function. The $\Xi_{cc}^{++}$ is treated as a hadronic state produced at the hadronization of the deconfined matter. Its production is also calculated as a comparison with the molecular state $T_{cc}^+$.</description>

      <title>Saturation of nuclear matter in the relativistic Brueckner Hatree-Fock approach with a leading order covariant chiral nuclear force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear saturation is a crucial feature in nuclear physics that plays a fundamental role in understanding various nuclear phenomena, ranging from properties of finite nuclei to those of neutron stars. However, a proper description of nuclear saturation is highly nontrivial in modern nonrelativistic~\textit{ab initio}~studies because of the elusive three-body forces. In this letter, we calculate the equation of state for nuclear matter in the relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (RBHF) framework with the leading order covariant chiral nuclear force. We show that a simultaneous description of the nucleon-nucleon scattering data and the saturation of the symmetric nuclear matter can be achieved. In this regard, the relativistic effects nicely explain the saturation of nuclear matter. As a result, the present study based on the covariant chiral nuclear force shows that in the RBHF framework, one can achieve saturation with a leading order covariant chiral nuclear force with only two-body forces, in contrast to the vast majorities of studies in the non-relativistic framework, where the next-to-next-to-leading order two-body and three-body chiral forces are needed. This study sets the foundation for studying nuclear saturation with the covariant chiral force in the RBHF framework, which allows for a systematic understanding of one of the key features of nuclear physics more microscopically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01597v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the equations of motion of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics, as well as microscopic expressions for all of its transport coefficients, from the Boltzmann equation using the method of moments. In contrast to reference Phys. Rev. D 98(7) 2018, where a single component gas was considered, we perform our derivation for a locally neutral fluid composed of two massless particle species with opposite charges. We demonstrate that the magnetohydrodynamical equations of motion become dramatically different for this more realistic system. The shear-stress tensor no longer obeys a single differential equation; it breaks into three non-degenerate components with respect to the magnetic field, each evolving according to different dynamical equations. For large magnetic fields, we further show that the solution of this theory displays oscillatory behaviour that can no longer be described by an Israel-Stewart-like theory. Finally, we investigate the derived equations in a Bjorken flow scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02759v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the investigation of the kinetic freeze-out properties of identified hadrons ($\pi^\pm$, $K^\pm$ and $p(\bar p)$) along with light (anti-)nuclei $d (\bar d)$, $t (\bar t)$ and ${}^{3}He$ in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC energies. A simultaneous fit is performed with the Blast-Wave (BW) model to the transverse momentum ({\ppt}) spectra of identified hadrons together with light (anti-)nuclei produced in $Au+Au$ collisions at {\sqrtsNN} = 7.7 -- 200 GeV at the RHIC and in $Pb+Pb$ collisions at $\sqrt{\mathrm{s}_{_{\mathrm{NN}}}}$ = 2.76 TeV at the LHC. The energy and centrality dependence of freeze-out parameters, i.e., kinetic freeze-out temperature ($T_{kin}$) and collective flow velocity $\langle \beta \rangle$ has been studied. It is observed that light (anti-)nuclei also participate in the collective expansion of the medium created in the collision when included in a common fit with the light hadrons. We observe a marginal rise in $T_{kin}$ and a slight decrease in $\langle \beta \rangle$ when compared to the values obtained from the fit to light hadrons. A similar $\langle \beta \rangle$ and significantly larger $T_{kin}$ is observed when a fit is performed to only protons and light (anti-)nuclei. Both, $T_{kin}$ and $\langle \beta \rangle$ show a weak energy dependence at most collision energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A potential model is applied for the analysis of the astrophysical direct nuclear capture process $^{16}$O(p,$\gamma)^{17}$F. The phase-equivalent potentials of the Woods-Saxon form for the p$-^{16}$O interaction are examined which reproduce the binding energies and the empirical values of ANC for the $^{17}$F(5/2$^+$) ground and $^{17}$F(1/2$^+$) ($E^*$=0.495 MeV) excited bound states from different sources. The best description of the experimental data for the astrophysical $S$ factor is obtained within the potential model which yields the ANC values of 1.043 fm$^{-1/2}$ and 75.484 fm$^{-1/2}$ for the $^{17}$F($5/2^{+}$) ground and $^{17}$F($1/2^{+}$) excited bound states, respectively. The zero-energy astrophysical factor $S(0)=9.321$ KeV b is obtained by using the asymptotic expansion method of D. Baye. The calculated reaction rates within the region up to 10$^{10}$ K are in good agreement with those from the R-matrix approach and the Bayesian model in both absolute values and temperature dependence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain a formal integral solution to the 3+1 D Boltzmann Equation in relaxation time approximation. The gradient series obtained from this integral solution contains exponentially decaying non-hydrodynamic terms. It is shown that this gradient expansion can have a finite radius of convergence under certain assumptions of analyticity. We then argue that, in the relaxation time model, proximity to local thermal equilibrium is not necessary for the system to be described by hydrodynamic equations.</description>

      <title>Understanding parton evolution in matter from renormalization group analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.11940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a renormalization group (RG) analysis of collinear hadron production in deep inelastic scattering on nuclei. We consider the limit where the parent parton energy $E$ is large, while the medium opacity $L/\lambda_g$ remains small. We identify the fixed order and leading $\ln(E/\xi^2 L)$ enhanced medium contributions to the semi-inclusive cross sections and derive RG equations that resum multiple emissions near the endpoints of the splitting functions at first order in opacity. These evolution equations treat the same type of radiation enhancement in matter as the modified Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi approach, but differ in the way one regulates the collinear divergences. They provide a unique analytic insight into the problem of resummation and a faster and more efficient path to phenomenology. The new RG evolution framework is applied to study fragmentation in $e$A reactions.</description>

      <title>Tidal heating as a direct probe of strangeness inside neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been discussed whether viscous processes in neutron star matter during a binary inspiral can damp out the tidal energy induced by the companion and heat up the star. Earlier investigations concluded that this tidal heating is negligible for normal neutron star matter. In this work, we suggest a novel effect of tidal heating involving strange matter in the neutron star interior, that can significantly heat up the star, and is potentially observable by current and future gravitational wave detectors.

      <title>Viscous hydrodynamic evolution of neutron star merger accretion disks: a code comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accretion disk formed after a neutron star merger is an important contributor to the total ejecta from the merger, and hence to the kilonova and the $r$-process yields of each event. Axisymmetric viscous hydrodynamic simulations of these disks can capture thermal mass ejection due to neutrino absorption and in the advective phase -- after neutrino cooling has subsided -- and are thus likely to provide a lower-limit to the total disk ejecta relative to MHD evolution. Here we present a comparison between two viscous hydrodynamic codes that have been used extensively on this problem over the past decade: ALCAR and FLASH. We choose a representative setup with a black hole at the center, and vary the treatment of viscosity and neutrino transport. We find good overall agreement ($\sim 10\%$ level) in most quantities. The average outflow velocity is sensitive to the treatment of the nuclear binding energy of heavy nuclei, showing a larger variation than other quantities. We post-process trajectories from both codes with the same nuclear network, and explore the effects of code differences on nucleosynthesis yields, heating rates, and kilonova light curves. For the latter, we also assess the effect of varying the number of tracer particles in reconstructing the spatial abundance distribution for kilonova light curve production.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18831v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the Schwinger-Dyson equation (SDE) on the complex plane, which was treated in our previous research, to finite temperature. As a simple example, we solve the SDE for a model with four-fermion interactions in the (1+1) space-time dimensions at strong coupling region. We investigate the properties of the effective mass and energy for the fermions, especially near the phase transition temperature.</description>

      <title>QCD Kondo effect for single heavy quark in chiral-symmetry broken phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) Kondo effect for a single heavy quark in quark matter composed of light quarks with chiral symmetry breaking. Introducing several spinor structures in QCD Kondo condensates, i.e., particle-projected condensate, antiparticle-projected condensate, and normal condensate without projection, we calculate the attractive energy gained by the heavy quark within the mean-field approximation in the path-integral formalism. We show that the normal condensate is favored at low density and the particle-projected condensate is favored at high density, when the light quark has a nonzero mass. We interpret such a density-dependent transition between the two condensates in terms of the Kondo resonances.</description>

      <title>Electroweak three-body decays in the presence of two- and three-body bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, formalism has been derived for studying electroweak transition amplitudes for three-body systems both in infinite and finite volumes. The formalism provides exact relations that the infinite-volume amplitudes must satisfy, as well as a relationship between physical amplitudes and finite-volume matrix elements, which can be constrained from lattice QCD calculations. This formalism poses additional challenges when compared with the analogous well-studied two-body equivalent one, including the necessary step of solving integral equations of singular functions. In this work, we provide some non-trivial analytical and numerical tests on the aforementioned formalism. In particular, we consider a case where the three-particle system can have three-body bound states as well as bound states in the two-body subsystem. For kinematics below the three-body threshold, we demonstrate that the scattering amplitudes satisfy unitarity. We also check that for these kinematics the finite-volume matrix elements are accurately described by the formalism for two-body systems up to exponentially suppressed corrections. Finally, we verify that in the case of the three-body bound state, the finite-volume matrix element is equal to the infinite-volume coupling of the bound state, up to exponentially suppressed errors.</description>

      <title>Constraints on new physics with (anti)neutrino-nucleon scattering data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: New physics contributions to the (anti)neutrino-nucleon elastic scattering process can be constrained by precision measurements, with controlled Standard Model uncertainties. In a large class of new physics models, interactions involving charged leptons of different flavor can be related, and the large muon flavor component of accelerator neutrino beams can mitigate the lepton mass suppression that occurs in other low-energy measurements. We employ the recent high-statistics measurement of the cross section for $\bar{\nu}_\mu p \to \mu^+ n$ scattering on the hydrogen atom by MINERvA to place new confidence intervals on tensor and scalar neutrino-nucleon interactions: $\mathfrak{Re} C_T = -1^{+14}_{-13} \times 10^{-4}$, $|\mathfrak{Im} C_T| \le 1.3 \times 10^{-3}$, and $|\mathfrak{Im} C_S| = 45^{+13}_{-19} \times 10^{-3}$. These results represent a reduction in uncertainty by a factor of $2.1$, $3.1$, and $1.2$, respectively, compared to existing constraints from precision beta decay.</description>

      <title>Dynamical tidal response of non-rotating relativistic stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03254v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately modeling the tidal response of neutron stars is crucial to connecting gravitational wave observations of binaries to ultra-dense nuclear physics. Most current models of the tidal response of relativistic stars either assume a static response model, or use phenomenological models inspired by Newtonian gravity. In this work, we present a general formalism for computing the linear dynamical tidal response function of relativistic, spherically symmetric stars. Our formalism incorporates stratification due to thermal and chemical imbalances, allowing one to study the effects of g modes on the tidal response function. We also describe how to incorporate sources of dissipation due to shear and bulk viscosity. To showcase the utility of our approach, we present several applications for polytropic stars in general relativity. We show how our formalism can capture the dynamical tidal resonance due to the f and g modes of inviscid stars and explore the sensitivity of the dynamical tidal response to the compactness of the star. We also compute the dissipative tidal deformability due to bulk and shear viscous dissipation assuming a simple viscous profile for the bulk and shear viscosity.</description>

      <title>Particle-theory input for neutron-star physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the properties and physical phase of the dense strongly interacting matter present in the cores of neutron stars or created in their binary mergers remains one of the most prominent open problems in nuclear astrophysics. While most microscopic analyses have historically relied on solvable phenomenological models of nuclear and quark matter, in recent years a model-independent approach utilizing only controlled ab-initio calculations and astrophysical observations has emerged as a viable alternative.
  In these lecture notes, I review recent progress in first-principles weak-coupling calculations within high-density quark matter, shedding light on its thermodynamic and transport properties. I cover the most important technical tools used in such calculations, introduce selected highlight results, and explain how this information can be used in phenomenological studies of neutron-star physics. The notes do not offer a self-consistent treatment of the topics covered, but rather aim at filling gaps in existing textbooks on thermal field theory and at connecting the dots in a story developed in several recent research articles, to which the interested reader is directed for further technical details.</description>

      <title>Observation of Universal Expansion Anisotropy from Cold Atoms to Hot Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Azimuthal anisotropy has been ubiquitously observed in high-energy proton-proton, proton-nucleus, and nucleus-nucleus (heavy-ion) collisions, shaking the early belief that those anisotropies must stem from utterly strong interactions. This work reports a study of anisotropic expansion of cold $^{6}$Li Fermi gases, initially trapped in an anisotropic potential, as a function of the interaction strength that can be readily tuned by an external magnetic field. It is found that the expansion anisotropy builds up quickly at small interaction strength, without the need of utterly strong interactions. A universal behavior of the expansion anisotropy is quantitatively observed between cold-atom and heavy-ion systems, despite their vast differences in physics. This universality will potentially unify a variety of disciplines in nature, from the weakly interacting dilute systems of gases to the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma of the early universe.</description>

      <title>Study of possible $DND^*$ bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We start from a recently favored picture in which the $\Lambda_c(2940)$ and $\Lambda_c(2910)$ correspond mostly to $ND^*$ bound states with $J^P = 1/2^-,\, 3/2^-$ and then add a $D$ as a third particle, looking for the possible binding of the $DND^*$ three body system within the framework of the Fixed Center Approximation. We find that the system is bound with respect to the corresponding $\Lambda_c^* D$ threshold with a binding of about $60$ MeV and a width of about $90$ MeV. Alternatively we assume a cluster of $ND$ and a $D^*$ meson interacting with the cluster and we find similar results. The observation of these states of $J^P = 1/2^+,\, 3/2^+$ would provide new and valuable information concerning the $DN$ and $D^* N$ interaction, an issue of current debate.</description>
