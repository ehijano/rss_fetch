      <title>Detecting kHz gravitons from a neutron star merger with a multi-mode resonant bar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a multi-mode bar consisting of mass elements of decreasing size for the direct detection of stimulated absorption of up to kHz gravitons from a neutron star merger and post-merger. We find that the multi-mode detector has normal modes that retain the coupling strength to the gravitational wave of the largest mass-element, while only having an effective mass comparable to the mass of the smallest element. This allows the normal modes to have graviton absorption rates due to the tonne-scale largest mass, while the single graviton absorption process in the normal mode could be resolved through energy measurements of a mass-element in-principle smaller than pico-gram scale. This improves the transduction of the single-graviton signal compared to a single-mode detector, enhancing the feasibility of detecting single gravitons.</description>

      <title>Forecast measurement of the 21 cm global spectrum from Lunar orbit with the Vari-Zeroth-Order Polynomial (VZOP) method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmic 21 cm signal serves as a crucial probe for studying the evolutionary history of the Universe. However, detecting the 21 cm signal poses significant challenges due to its extremely faint nature. To mitigate the interference from the Earth's radio frequency interference (RFI), the ground and the ionospheric effects, the Discovering the Sky at the Longest Wavelength (DSL) project will deploy a constellation of satellites in Lunar orbit, with its high-frequency daughter satellite tasked with detecting the global 21 cm signal from cosmic dawn and reionization era (CD/EoR). We intend to employ the Vari-Zeroth-Order Polynomial (VZOP) for foreground fitting and subtracting. We have studied the effect of thermal noise, thermal radiation from the Moon, the Lunar reflection, anisotropic frequency-dependent beam, inaccurate antenna beam pattern, and RFI contamination. We discovered that the RFI contamination can significantly affect the fitting process and thus prevent us from detecting the signal. Therefore, experimenting on the far side of the moon is crucial. We also discovered that using VZOP together with DSL, after 1080 orbits around the Moon, which takes about 103 days, we can successfully detect the CD/EoR 21 cm signal.</description>

      <title>At First Sight: Zero-Shot Classification of Astronomical Images with Large Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language multimodal Models (VLMs) offer the possibility for zero-shot classification in astronomy: i.e. classification via natural language prompts, with no training. We investigate two models, GPT-4o and LLaVA-NeXT, for zero-shot classification of low-surface brightness galaxies and artifacts, as well as morphological classification of galaxies. We show that with natural language prompts these models achieved significant accuracy (above 80 percent typically) without additional training/fine tuning. We discuss areas that require improvement, especially for LLaVA-NeXT, which is an open source model. Our findings aim to motivate the astronomical community to consider VLMs as a powerful tool for both research and pedagogy, with the prospect that future custom-built or fine-tuned models could perform better.</description>

      <title>A first demonstration of active feedback control and multi-frequency imaging techniques for kinetic inductance detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RF-ICE is a signal processing platform for the readout of large arrays of superconducting resonators. Designed for flexibility, the system's low digital latency and ability to independently and dynamically set the frequency and amplitude of probe tones in real time has enabled previously-inaccessible views of resonator behaviour, and opened the door to novel resonator control schemes. We introduce a multi-frequency imaging technique, developed with RF-ICE, which allows simultaneous observation of the entire resonance bandwidth. We demonstrate the use of this technique in the examination of the response of superconducting resonators to variations in applied readout current and thermal loading. We observe that, used in conjunction with a conventional frequency sweep at sufficiently large amplitude to induce resonance bifurcation, the multi-frequency imaging technique reveals a resonator response which is not captured by the frequency sweep measurement alone. We demonstrate that equivalent resonant frequency shifts can be achieved using either thermal, optical, or readout loading, and use this equivalence to counteract a change in thermal loading by digitally modulating the readout current through a resonator. We develop and implement a proof-of-concept closed-loop negative electro-quasiparticle feedback algorithm which first sets and then maintains the resonant frequency of a lumped element kinetic inductance detector while the loading on it is varied. Although this simple implementation is not yet suitable to deploy at scale, it demonstrates the utility of this feedback technique to improve linearity while addressing amplifier distortion, resonator response non-uniformity, and crosstalk. It can be applied to kinetic inductors in non-bolometric operation, and sets the stage for future developments.</description>

      <title>Upgrading the Submillimeter Array: wSMA and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Submillimeter Array (SMA) is an array of 8 antennas operating at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths on Maunakea, Hawaii, operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Taiwan. Over the past several years, we have been preparing a major upgrade to the SMA that will replace the aging original receiver cryostats and receiver cartridges with all new cryostats and new 230 and 345 GHz receiver designs. This wideband upgrade (wSMA) will also include significantly increased instantaneous bandwidth, improved sensitivity, and greater capabilities for dual frequency observations. In this paper, we will describe the wSMA receiver upgrade and status, as well as the future upgrades that will be enabled by the deployment of the wSMA receivers.</description>

      <title>Jacobian-Free Newton-Krylov method for multilevel NLTE radiative transfer problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The calculation of the emerging radiation from a model atmosphere requires knowledge of the emissivity and absorption coefficients, which are proportional to the atomic level population densities of the levels involved in each transition. Due to the intricate interdependency of the radiation field and the physical state of the atoms, iterative methods are required in order to calculate the atomic level population densities. A variety of different methods have been proposed to solve this problem, which is known as the Non-Local Thermodynamical Equilibrium (NLTE) problem.
  In this study we have developed a Jacobian-Free Newton-Krylov method (JFNK) to solve multi-level NLTE radiative transfer problems. Using the Rybicki &amp; Hummer (1992) method as a reference (Rybicki, G. B. &amp; Hummer, D. G. 1992, A&amp;A, 262, 209), our results show that our JFNK solver can achieve up to a factor two speed up when using local approximate operators / preconditioners, while also achieving a lower residual error in the statistical equilibrium equations. Another advantage of this method is that the addition of charge conservation and partial redistribution effects should be straight forward.
  Our method can help accelerating the calculation of the emerging spectra from numerical models and also the reconstruction of chromospheric datasets through NLTE inversions.</description>

      <title>A review of unsupervised learning in astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review summarizes popular unsupervised learning methods, and gives an overview of their past, current, and future uses in astronomy. Unsupervised learning aims to organise the information content of a dataset, in such a way that knowledge can be extracted. Traditionally this has been achieved through dimensionality reduction techniques that aid the ranking of a dataset, for example through principal component analysis or by using auto-encoders, or simpler visualisation of a high dimensional space, for example through the use of a self organising map. Other desirable properties of unsupervised learning include the identification of clusters, i.e. groups of similar objects, which has traditionally been achieved by the k-means algorithm and more recently through density-based clustering such as HDBSCAN. More recently, complex frameworks have emerged, that chain together dimensionality reduction and clustering methods. However, no dataset is fully unknown. Thus, nowadays a lot of research has been directed towards self-supervised and semi-supervised methods that stand to gain from both supervised and unsupervised learning.</description>

      <title>Assessment of the environmental impacts of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Mid-Sized Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astronomical observatories have been identified as substantial contributors to the carbon footprint of astrophysical research. Being part of the collaboration that currently develops the Medium-Sized Telescope (MST) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array, a ground-based observatory for very-high-energy gamma rays that will comprise 64 telescopes deployed on two sites, we assessed the environmental impacts of one MST on the Northern site by means of a Life Cycle Assessment. We identified resource use and climate change as the most significant impacts, being driven by telescope manufacturing and energy consumption during operations. We estimate life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of 2,660 +/- 274 tCO2 equivalent for the telescope, 44% of which arise from construction, 1% from on-site assembly and commissioning, and 55% from operations over 30 years. Environmental impacts can be reduced by using renewable energies during construction and operations, use of less electronic components and metal casting, and use of recycled materials. We propose complementing project requirements with environmental budgets as an effective measure for impact management and reductions.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations for the SAXO+ upgrade: Performance analysis of the adaptive optics system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SPHERE, operating at the VLT since 2014, is currently one of the high-contrast instruments with a higher performance. Its adaptive optics system, known as SAXO, will be upgraded to SAXO+, which features the addition of a second stage of adaptive optics. This stage will use a near-infrared pyramid wavefront sensor to record images of fainter exoplanets around redder stars. In this work, we compare the performance of SAXO and SAXO+. We look for the optimal values of the key system parameters of SAXO+ for various science cases and turbulence conditions. We performed numerical simulations using COMPASS, an end-to-end adaptive optics simulation tool. We simulated perfect coronagraph images of an on-axis point source, and we minimized the residual starlight intensity between 3 and 5 ${\lambda}/D$ as a performance criterion. The explored parameter space includes science cases, turbulence conditions, and key system parameters. In every science case and turbulence condition, SAXO+ reduces the residual starlight intensity inside the correction zone of the second stage by a factor of ten compared to SAXO. The optimal first stage gain is lower for SAXO+ than for SAXO alone. We quantified the gain in performance of SAXO+ when changing the second stage frequency from 2 kHz to 3 kHz, and we conclude that 2 kHz may be sufficient for most realistic conditions. We give the optimal first stage gain as well as the first and second stage frequencies for every seeing, coherence time, and science case. Finally, we find that a 2 ${\lambda_{\mathrm{WFS}}}/D$ pyramid modulation radius is a good trade-off between performance and robustness against varying turbulence conditions. This study shows that the future SAXO+ system will outperform the current SAXO system in all studied cases.</description>

      <title>Design and Validation of a Cold Load for Characterization of CMB-S4 Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design and validation of a variable temperature cryogenic blackbody source, hereinafter called a cold load, that will be used to characterize detectors to be deployed by CMB-S4, the next-generation ground-based cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiment. Although cold loads have been used for detector characterization by previous CMB experiments, this cold load has three novel design features: (1) the ability to operate from the 1 K stage of a dilution refrigerator (DR), (2) a 3He gas-gap heat switch to reduce cooling time, and (3) the ability to couple small external optical signals to measure detector optical time constants under low optical loading. The efficacy of this design was validated using a 150 GHz detector array previously deployed by the Spider experiment. Thermal tests showed that the cold load can be heated to temperatures required for characterizing CMB-S4's detectors without significantly impacting the temperatures of other cryogenic stages when mounted to the DR's 1 K stage. Additionally, optical tests demonstrated that external signals can be coupled to a detector array through the cold load without imparting a significant optical load on the detectors, which will enable measurements of the CMB-S4 detectors' optical time constants.</description>

      <title>The SNEWS 2.0 Alert Software for the Coincident Detection of Neutrinos from Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neutrino signal from the next galactic core-collapse supernova will provide an invaluable early warning of the explosion. By combining the burst trigger from several neutrino detectors, the location of the explosion can be triangulated minutes to hours before the optical emission becomes visible, while also reducing the rate of false-positive triggers. To enable multi-messenger follow-up of nearby supernovae, the SuperNova Early Warning System 2.0 (SNEWS 2.0) will produce a combined alert using a global network of neutrino detectors. This paper describes the trigger publishing and alert formation framework of the SNEWS 2.0 network. The framework is built on the HOPSKOTCH publish-subscribe system to easily incorporate new detectors into the network, and it implements a coincidence system to form alerts and estimate a false-positive rate for the combined triggers. The paper outlines the structure of the SNEWS 2.0 software and the initial testing of coincident signals.</description>

      <title>Impact of extragalactic point sources on the low-frequency sky spectrum and cosmic dawn global 21-cm measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contribution of resolved and unresolved extragalactic point sources to the low-frequency sky spectrum is a potentially non-negligible part of the astrophysical foregrounds for cosmic dawn 21-cm experiments. The clustering of such point sources on the sky, combined with the frequency-dependence of the antenna beam, can also make this contribution chromatic. By combining low-frequency measurements of the luminosity function and the angular correlation function of extragalactic point sources, we develop a model for the contribution of these sources to the low-frequency sky spectrum. Using this model, we find that the contribution of sources with flux density $&gt;10^{-6}\,$Jy to the sky-averaged spectrum is smooth and of the order of a few kelvins at 50 - $200\,$MHz. We combine this model with measurements of the galactic foreground spectrum and convolve the result with the beam of the conical log-spiral antenna planned as part of the Radio Experiment for the Analysis of Cosmic Hydrogen (REACH) project. We find that the contribution of point sources to resultant spectrum is $\sim0.4\%$ of the total foregrounds, but still larger by at least an order of magnitude than the standard predictions for the cosmological 21-cm signal. As a result, not accounting for the point-source contribution leads to a systematic bias in 21-cm signal recovery. We show, however, that in the REACH case, this reconstruction bias can be removed by modelling the point-source contribution as a power law with a running spectral index. We make our code publicly available as a Python package labelled epspy.</description>

      <title>STag II: Classification of Serendipitous Supernovae Observed by Galaxy Redshift Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the number of supernovae observed expected to drastically increase thanks to large-scale surveys like the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), it is necessary that the tools we use to classify these objects keep up with this increase. We previously created Supernova Tagging and Classification (STag) to address this problem by employing machine learning techniques alongside logistic regression in order to assign 'tags' to spectra based on spectral features. STag II is a continuation of this work, which now makes use of model supernova spectra combined with real DESI spectra in order to train STag to better deal with realistic data. We also make use of the rlap score as a trustworthiness cut, making for a more robust and accurate supernova classifier than before.</description>

      <title>A General-Purpose Transit Simulator for Arbitrary Shaped Objects Orbiting Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a versatile transit simulator aimed at generating light curves for arbitrarily shaped objects transiting stars. Utilizing a Monte Carlo algorithm, it accurately models the stellar flux blocked by these objects, producing precise light curves. The simulator adeptly handles realistic background stars, integrating effects such as tidal distortions and limb darkening, alongside the rotational dynamics of transiting objects of arbitrary geometries. We showcase its wide-ranging utility through successful simulations of light curves for single and multi-planet systems, tidally distorted planets, eclipsing binaries and exocomets. Additionally, our simulator can simulate light curves for hypothetical alien megastructures of any conceivable shape, providing avenues to identify interesting candidates for follow-up studies. We demonstrate applications of the simulator in modeling a Dyson Swarm in construction, Dyson rings and Dyson disks, discussing how tidally locked Dyson disks can be distinguished from planetary light curves.</description>

      <title>XAMI -- A Benchmark Dataset for Artefact Detection in XMM-Newton Optical Images</title>

Abstract: Reflected or scattered light produce artefacts in astronomical observations that can negatively impact the scientific study. Hence, automated detection of these artefacts is highly beneficial, especially with the increasing amounts of data gathered. Machine learning methods are well-suited to this problem, but currently there is a lack of annotated data to train such approaches to detect artefacts in astronomical observations. In this work, we present a dataset of images from the XMM-Newton space telescope Optical Monitoring camera showing different types of artefacts. We hand-annotated a sample of 1000 images with artefacts which we use to train automated ML methods. We further demonstrate techniques tailored for accurate detection and masking of artefacts using instance segmentation. We adopt a hybrid approach, combining knowledge from both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer-based models and use their advantages in segmentation. The presented method and dataset will advance artefact detection in astronomical observations by providing a reproducible baseline. All code and data are made available (https://github.com/ESA-Datalabs/XAMI-model and https://github.com/ESA-Datalabs/XAMI-dataset).</description>

      <title>Delving into the Utilisation of ChatGPT in Scientific Publications in Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid progress in the capabilities of machine learning approaches in natural language processing has culminated in the rise of large language models over the last two years. Recent works have shown unprecedented adoption of these for academic writing, especially in some fields, but their pervasiveness in astronomy has not been studied sufficiently. To remedy this, we extract words that ChatGPT uses more often than humans when generating academic text and search a total of 1 million articles for them. This way, we assess the frequency of word occurrence in published works in astronomy tracked by the NASA Astrophysics Data System since 2000. We then perform a statistical analysis of the occurrences. We identify a list of words favoured by ChatGPT and find a statistically significant increase for these words against a control group in 2024, which matches the trend in other disciplines. These results suggest a widespread adoption of these models in the writing of astronomy papers. We encourage organisations, publishers, and researchers to work together to identify ethical and pragmatic guidelines to maximise the benefits of these systems while maintaining scientific rigour.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Approach to Event Reconstruction for Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes Combining Machine Learning and Likelihood Fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The imaging atmospheric Cherenkov technique provides potentially the highest angular resolution achievable in astronomy at energies above the X-ray waveband. High-resolution measurements provide the key to progress on many of the major questions in high-energy astrophysics, including the sites of particle acceleration to PeV energies. The potential of the next-generation CTA observatory in this regard can be realised with the help of improved algorithms for the reconstruction of the air-shower direction and energy. Hybrid methods combining likelihood-fitting techniques with neural networks represent a particularly promising approach and have recently been applied to the reconstruction of astrophysical neutrinos. Here, we present the FreePACT algorithm, a hybrid reconstruction method for IACTs. In this, making use of the neural ratio estimation technique from the field of likelihood-free inference, the analytical likelihood used in traditional image likelihood fitting is replaced by a neural network that approximates the charge probability density function for each pixel in the camera. The performance of this algorithm is demonstrated using simulations of the planned CTA southern array. For this setup, FreePACT provides significant performance improvements over analytical likelihood techniques, with improvements in angular and energy resolution of 25% or more over a wide energy range and an angular resolution as low as 40 arcseconds at energies above 50 TeV for observations at 20 degrees zenith angle. It also yields more accurate estimations of the uncertainties on the reconstructed parameters and speeds up the reconstruction compared to analytical likelihood techniques while showing the same stability with respect to changes in the observation conditions. Therefore, the FreePACT method is a promising upgrade over the current state-of-the-art likelihood event reconstruction techniques.</description>

      <title>Local Spherical Collapsing Box in Athena++: Numerical Implementation and Benchmark Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We implement a local model for a spherical collapsing/expanding gas cloud into the Athena++ magnetohydrodynamic code. This local model consists of a Cartesian periodic box with time-dependent geometry. We present a series of benchmark test problems, including non-linear solutions and linear perturbations of the local model, confirming the code's desired performance. During a spherical collapse, a horizontal shear flow is amplified, corresponding to angular momentum conservation of zonal flows in the global problem; wave speed and amplitude of sound waves increase in the local frame, due to the reduction in the characteristic length scale of the box, which can lead to an anisotropic effective sound speed in the local box. Our code conserves both mass and momentum to machine precision. This numerical implementation of the local model has potential applications to the study of local physics and hydrodynamic instabilities during protostellar collapse, providing a powerful framework for better understanding the earliest stages of star and planet formation.</description>

      <title>Position and Time Determination without Prior State Knowledge via Onboard Optical Observations of Delta Scuti Variable Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a navigation concept for solving the lost in space and time problem using optical observations of $\delta$ Scuti variable stars. Only a small number of techniques exist that allow a spacecraft to recover from being lost in both space and time, which can be caused by a failure of the onboard clock and navigation systems. Optical observations of $\delta$ Scuti stars, which can be collected onboard from star trackers or navigation cameras, may enable faster and/or more accurate position and time solutions compared to existing techniques without requiring additional equipment. Our results indicate that one day of observation by the OSIRIS-APEX MapCam may enable position and time determination accuracy within 0.05 au (3$\sigma$) and 15 s (3$\sigma$).</description>

      <title>Premerger detection of massive black hole binaries using deep learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coalescing massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) are one of primary sources for space-based gravitational wave (GW) observations. The mergers of these binaries are expected to give rise to detectable electromagnetic (EM) emissions with a narrow time window. The premerger detection of GW signals is vital for follow-up EM observations. The conventional approach for searching GW signals involves high computational costs. In this study, we present a deep learning model to search for GW signals from MBHBs. Our model is able to process 4.7 days of simulated data within 0.01 seconds and detect GW signals several hours to days before the final merger. The model provides the possibility of the coincident GW and EM detection of MBHBs.</description>

      <title>The European Low Frequency Survey on the Simons Array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present the European Low Frequency Survey (ELFS), a project that will enable foregrounds-free measurements of the primordial $B$-mode polarization and a detection of the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, to a level $\sigma(r) = 0.001$ by measuring the Galactic and extra-galactic emissions in the 5--120\,GHz frequency window. Indeed, the main difficulty in measuring the B-mode polarization comes from the fact that many other processes in the Universe also emit polarized microwaves, which obscure the faint Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) signal. The first stage of this project is being carried out in synergy with the Simons Array (SA) collaboration, installing a 5.5--11\,GHz (X-band) coherent receiver at the focus of one of the three 3.5\,m SA telescopes in Atacama, Chile, followed by the installation of the QUIJOTE-MFI2 in the 10--20 GHz range. We designate this initial iteration of the ELFS program as ELFS-SA. The receivers are equipped with a fully digital back-end that will provide a frequency resolution of 1\,MHz across the band, allowing us to clean the scientific signal from unwanted radio frequency interference, particularly from low-Earth orbit satellite mega constellations. This paper reviews the scientific motivation for ELFS and its instrumental characteristics, and provides an update on the development of ELFS-SA.</description>

      <title>Fishing for Planets: A Comparative Analysis of EPRV Survey Performance in the Presence of Correlated Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With dedicated exoplanet surveys underway for multiple extreme precision radial velocity (EPRV) instruments, the near-future prospects of RV exoplanet science are promising. These surveys' generous time allocations are expected to facilitate the discovery of Earth analogs around bright, nearby Sun-like stars. But survey success will depend critically on the choice of observing strategy, which will determine the survey's ability to mitigate known sources of noise and extract low-amplitude exoplanet signals. Here, we present an analysis of the Fisher information content of simulated EPRV surveys, accounting for the most recent advances in our understanding of stellar variability on both short and long timescales (i.e., oscillations and granulation within individual nights, and activity-induced variations across multiple nights). In this analysis, we capture the correlated nature of stellar variability by parameterizing these signals with Gaussian Process kernels. We describe the underlying simulation framework as well as the physical interpretation of the Fisher information content, and we evaluate the efficacy of EPRV survey strategies that have been presented in the literature. We explore and compare strategies for scheduling observations over various timescales and we make recommendations to optimize survey performance for the detection of Earth-like exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Time delay interferometry with minimal null frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time delay interferometry (TDI) is a key technique employed in gravitational wave (GW) space missions to mitigate laser frequency noise by combining multiple laser links and establishing an equivalent equal arm interferometry. The null frequencies will be introduced in noise spectra and GW response when the periodical signal/noise is canceled in synthesized laser links. These frequencies are characteristic frequencies (CFs) of a TDI which related to its geometry of combination. In this work, we implement a second-generation TDI configuration referred to as hybrid Relay to perform noise suppressions and data analysis, whose CFs are only one-quarter that of the fiducial second-generation Michelson observables. We examine the performance of TDI configuration in laser noise cancellation and clock noise suppression and justify its essential capabilities. To assess its robustness for signal extraction, we simulate data containing GW signals from massive black hole binaries and perform parameter inferences with comparisons against the fiducial Michelson TDI configuration. The results demonstrate that the alternative TDI solution could be more robust than Michelson in fulfilling data analysis.</description>
