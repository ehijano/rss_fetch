      <title>Doppler-free three-photon spectroscopy on narrow-line optical transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate coherent Doppler-free three-photon excitation of the $^{1}S_{0}$$\leftrightarrow$$^{3}P_{0}$ optical clock transition and the $^{1}S_{0}$$\leftrightarrow$$^{3}P_{1}$ intercombination transition in free-space thermal clouds of $^{88}$Sr atoms. By appropriate orientation of the wavevectors of three lasers incident on the atoms, the first-order Doppler shift can be eliminated for all velocity classes. Three-photon excitation of the $^{1}S_{0}$$\leftrightarrow$$^{3}P_{1}$ transition enables high-contrast Ramsey spectroscopy with interrogation times comparable to the 21$\mu$s natural lifetime using a single near-resonant laser source. Three-photon spectroscopy on the $^{1}S_{0}$$\leftrightarrow$$^{3}P_{0}$ clock transition, using only laser frequencies nearly resonant with the $^{1}S_{0}$$\leftrightarrow$$^{3}P_{0}$ and $^{1}S_{0}$$\leftrightarrow$$^{3}P_{1}$ transitions, enables a reduction in Doppler broadening by two orders of magnitude and a corresponding $\sim470$Hz linewidth without a confining potential.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement during single-cycle nonsequential ionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to elucidate the correlated motion of atomic electrons, we investigate the attosecond-scale dynamics of their entanglement arising due to nonsequential ionization driven by a strong, linearly-polarized laser field. The calculation is based on numerical integration of the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation for helium irradiated by a one-cycle, near-infrared field whose intensity is in the neighborhood of $1\textrm{ PW/cm}^2$. The entanglement measure (Schmidt weight) is resolved on a sub-cycle timescale, and its key dependency on the field profile is exposed for the first time by tuning the carrier-envelope phase (CEP) to control the ionization-recollision timing. We find that between CEP cases, this can result in a $20\%$ enhancement in the peak entanglement. A connection is made between the entanglement, the probability current, and the correlation coefficient for the two electron momenta, providing new insights into the nonsequential ionization mechanism.</description>

      <title>Sensing Aharonov--Bohm phase using a multiply-orbiting-ion interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interferometers, which are built using spatially propagating light or matter waves, are commonly used to measure physical quantities. These measurements are made possible by exploiting the interference between waves traveling along different paths. This study introduces a novel approach to sensing of the Aharonov--Bohm phase, an ion matter-wave interferometer operating within a two-dimensional circular trajectory in a trap potential. The ion orbitals in the potential form Lissajous curves, causing the direction of ion rotation to reverse. This reversal results in a corresponding change in the interference phase. Our study is groundbreaking as it is the first attempt to utilize propagating matter waves of an ion in constructing an interferometer for the measurement of physical quantities. Given that the scale factor of the interferometer to the cyclotron motion and the rotation of the system is common, the sensitivity to the Aharonov--Bohm phase in this study corresponds to a rotation sensitivity of approximately 300~rad/s. Besides advancing interferometry, our work also lays the foundation for future research into the use of ion matter waves in gyroscopic applications.</description>

      <title>A single-photon large-momentum-transfer atom interferometry scheme for Sr/Yb atoms with application to determining the fine-structure constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The leading experimental determinations of the fine-structure constant, $\alpha$, currently rely on atomic photon-recoil measurements from Ramsey-Bord\'e atom interferometry with large momentum transfer to provide an absolute mass measurement. We propose an experimental scheme for an intermediate-scale differential atom interferometer to measure the photon-recoil of neutral atomic species with a single-photon optical clock transition. We calculate trajectories for our scheme that optimise the recoil phase while nullifying the undesired gravity gradient phase by considering independently launching two clouds of ultracold atoms with the appropriate initial conditions. For Sr and Yb, we find an atom interferometer of height 3m to be sufficient for an absolute mass measurement precision of $\Delta m / m \sim 1\times 10^{-11}$ with current technology. Such a precise measurement (the first of its kind for Sr or Yb) would yield a factor of two reduction in the uncertainty of $\alpha$ -- an uncertainty that would no longer be limited by an absolute mass measurement. The removal of this bound facilitates reducing the uncertainty in $\alpha$ by a factor of 10 with improvements in relative mass measurements, thus paving the way for higher-precision tests of the Standard Model of particle physics.</description>

      <title>Exploring Valence Electron Dynamics of Xenon through Laser-Induced Electron Diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong-field ionization can induce electron motion in both the continuum and the valence shell of the parent ion. Here, we explore their interplay by studying laser-induced electron diffraction (LIED) patterns arising from interaction with the potentials of two-hole states of the xenon cation. The quantitative rescattering theory is used to calculate the corresponding photoelectron momentum distributions, providing evidence that the spin-orbit dynamics could be detected by LIED. We identify the contribution of these time-evolving hole states to the angular distribution of the rescattered electrons, particularly noting a distinct change along the backward scattering angles. We benchmark numerical results with experiments using ultrabroad and femtosecond laser pulses centered at \SI{3100}{nm}.</description>

      <title>Iterative Confinement of Ions via the Quantum Zeno Effect: Probing Paradoxical Energy Consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building upon our previously introduced mechanism for ion trapping based on the quantum Zeno effect (QZE), we propose a novel approach to systematically draw ions closer together, solely via quantum measurements. The proposed method involves repeated measurements of the electromagnetic force exerted by ions on an enclosure of conductor plates to confine the ions within an incrementally smaller spatial region, achieved by exploiting the behaviour of the wavefunction at its boundaries. Taking a two-proton system as a case study, we explore the dynamics between the energy gain of the system, attributed to successive QZE measurements, and the energy expended making such measurements. The results reveal a paradox wherein, under specific circumstances, protons appear to accumulate more energy than is seemingly introduced into the system. This peculiarity aligns with prior studies that highlight challenges in energy conservation within quantum mechanics. To verify these observations, we propose an iterative confinement setup that is feasible with current technological capabilities. Confirmation of these findings could offer new insights for applications in quantum physics, including fusion research. Therefore, the proposed novel method of manipulating ions not only harbours considerable potential for diverse applications but also furnishes an additional tool for probing fundamental questions in the field.</description>

      <title>Full leading-order nuclear polarization in highly charged ions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nuclear-polarization corrections to the energy levels of highly charged ions are systematically investigated to leading order in the fine-structure constant. To this end, the notion of effective photon propagators with nuclear-polarization insertions is employed, where the nuclear excitation spectrum is calculated by means of the Hartree-Fock-based random-phase approximation. The effective Skyrme force is used to describe the interaction between nucleons, and the model dependence is analyzed. To leading order, the formalism predicts two contributions given by the effective vacuum-polarization and self-energy diagrams. The existing ambiguity around the vacuum-polarization term is resolved by demonstrating that it is effectively absorbed in the standard finite-nuclear-size correction. The self-energy part is evaluated with the full electromagnetic electron-nucleus interaction taken into account, where the importance of the effects of the nuclear three-currents is emphasized.</description>

      <title>Retardation Effects in Atom-Wall Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The onset of retardation effects in atom-wall interactions is studied. It is shown that the transition range from the 1/z^3 short-range (van der Waals) interaction to the 1/z^4 long-range (Casimir) retarded interaction critically depends on the atomic properties and on the dielectric function of the material. For simple non-alkali atoms (e.g., ground-state hydrogen and ground-state helium) interacting with typical dielectric materials such as intrinsic silicon, the transition to the retarded regime is shown to proceed at a distance of about 10 nm (200 Bohr radii). This is much shorter than typical characteristic absorption wavelengths of solids. Larger transition regimes are obtained for atoms with a large static polarizability such as metastable helium. We present a simple estimate for the critical distance, z_cr=137*(\alpha(0)/Z)^(1/2) atomic units, where alpha(0) is the static polarizability (expressed in atomic units) and Z is the number of electrons of the atom.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing Simulation of a Mixed Spin-Boson Hamiltonian and Its Performance for a Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to broaden the spectrum of possible applications of quantum computers and use their capabilities to investigate effects in cavity quantum electrodynamics ("cavity QED"). Interesting application examples are material properties, multiphoton effects such as superradiance, systems with strong field-matter coupling, and others. For QED applications, experimental studies are challenging, and classical simulations are often expensive. Therefore, exploring the capabilities of quantum computers is of interest. Below we present a methodology for simulating a phase transition in a pair of coupled cavities that permit photon hopping. We map the spin and boson systems to separate parts of the register and use first-order Trotterization to time-propagate the wavefunction. The order parameter, which is the observable for the phase transition, is calculated by measuring the number operator and its square. We introduce a boson-to-qubit mapping to facilitate a multi-photon, multi-atom case study. Our mapping scheme is based on the inverse Holstein-Primakoff transformation. In the multi-photon regime, boson operators are expressed via higher-spin operators which are subsequently mapped on a circuit using Pauli operators. We use a Newton series expansion to enable rigorous treatment of the square root operator. We reproduce the results of classical simulations of a phase transition with a noiseless 6-qubit simulation. We find that the simulation can be performed with a modest amount of quantum resources. Finally, we perform simulations on noisy emulators and find that mitigation techniques are essential to distinguish signal from noise.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy-Induced Spin Parity Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin parity effects refer to those special situations where a dichotomy in the physical behavior of a system arises, solely depending on whether the relevant spin quantum number is integral or half-odd integral. As is the case with the Haldane conjecture in antiferromagnetic spin chains, their pursuit often derives deep insights and invokes new developments in quantum condensed matter physics. Here we put forth a simple and general scheme for generating such effects in any spatial dimension through the use of anisotropic interactions, and a setup within reasonable reach of state-of-the-art cold-atom implementations. We demonstrate its utility through a detailed analysis of the magnetization behavior of a specific one-dimensional spin chain model -- an anisotropic antiferromagnet in a transverse magnetic field, unraveling along the way the quantum origin of finite-size effects observed in the magnetization curve that had previously been noted but not clearly understood.</description>
