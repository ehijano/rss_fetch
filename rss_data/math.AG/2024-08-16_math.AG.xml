      <title>The Moduli Stack of Triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that Dyck's Surface, which is the connected sum of three projective planes, is a fine moduli stack of possibly-degenerate similarity classes of triangles, where degeneracy is defined broadly to be compatible with the metric closures of known constructions of nondegenerate spaces, which are based on either side-side-side or angle-angle-angle criteria. We also prove the blowup of $\mathbb C^3-\{0\}$ at three hyperplanes is a fine moduli stack of possibly-degenerate triangles, also using the broadest reasonable definition of degeneracy.</description>

      <title>The Rank of the Normal Functions of the Ceresa and Gross--Schoen Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main result is that when the genus is at least 3, the rank of the normal function function of the Ceresa cycle over the moduli space of curves has maximal rank. This result was proved independently by Z. Gao and S.-W. Zhang (arXiv:2407.01304) by different methods. In genus 3 we show that the Green--Griffiths invariant of this normal function is a Teichmuller modular form of weight (4,0,-1) and use this to show that the rank of the Ceresa normal function is exactly 1 along the hyperelliptic locus.</description>

Abstract: We establish a geometric analog of the Casselman-Shalika formula for a split connected reductive group over a mixed characteristic local field. In particular, we construct sheaves on the Witt vector affine Grassmannian which geometrize the Fourier coefficients of spherical Hecke operators, and compute their cohomology.</description>

Abstract: We consider minimal compactifications of the complex affine plane. Minimal compactifications of the affine plane with at most log canonical singularities are classified. Moreover, every minimal compactification of the affine plane with at most log canonical singularities has only star-shaped singular points. In this article, we classify minimal compactifications of the affine plane with only star-shaped singular points.</description>

      <title>The geometric fundamental group of the affine line over a finite field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The affine line and the punctured affine line over a finite field F are taken as benchmarks for the problem of describing geometric \'etale fundamental groups. To this end, using a reformulation of Tannaka duality we construct for a projective variety X a (non-commutative) universal affine pro-algebraic group Lu(X), such that for any given affine subvariety U of X any finite and \'etale Galois covering of U over F is a pull-back of a Galois covering of a quotient Lu(X,U) of Lu(X). Then the geometric fundamental group of U is a completion of the k-points of Lu(X,U), where k is an algebraic closure of F. We obtain explicit descriptions of the universal affine groups Lu(X,U) for U the affine line and the punctured affine line over F.</description>

      <title>IVHS via Kuznetsov components and categorical Torelli theorems for weighted hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the categorical Torelli theorem for smooth (weighted) hypersurfaces in (weighted) projective spaces via the Hochschild--Serre algebra of its Kuznetsov component. In the first part of the paper, we show that a natural graded subalgebra of the Hochschild--Serre algebra of the Kuznetsov component of a degree $d$ weighted hypersurface in $\mathbb{P}(a_0,\ldots,a_n)$ reconstructs the graded subalgebra of the Jacobian ring generated by the degree $t:=\mathrm{gcd}(d,\Sigma_{i=0}^na_i)$ piece under mild assumptions. Using results of Donagi and Cox--Green, this gives a categorical Torelli theorem for most smooth hypersurfaces $Y$ of degree $d \le n$ in $\mathbb{P}^n$ such that $d$ does not divide $n+1$ (the exception being the cases of the form $(d,n) = (4, 4k + 2)$, for which a result of Voisin lets us deduce a generic categorical Torelli theorem when $k \ge 150$). Next, we show that the Jacobian ring of the Veronese double cone can be reconstructed from its graded subalgebra of even degree, thus proving a categorical Torelli theorem for the Veronese double cone.
  In the second part, we rebuild the infinitesimal Variation of Hodge structures of a series of (weighted) hypersurfaces from their Kuznetsov components via the Hochschild--Serre algebra. As a result, we prove categorical Torelli theorems for two classes of (weighted) hypersurfaces: $(1):$ Generalized Veronese double cone; $(2):$ Certain $k$-sheeted covering of $\mathbb{P}^n$, when they are generic. Then, we prove a refined categorical Torelli theorem for a Fano variety whose Kuznetsov component is a Calabi--Yau category of dimension $2m+1$. Finally, we prove the actual categorical Torelli theorem for generalized Veronese double cone and $k$-sheeted covering of $\mathbb{P}^n$.</description>

      <title>Interlacing triangles, Schubert puzzles, and graph colorings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that interlacing triangular arrays, introduced by Aggarwal-Borodin-Wheeler to study certain probability measures, can be used to compute structure constants for multiplying Schubert classes in the $K$-theory of Grassmannians, in the cohomology of their cotangent bundles, and in the cohomology of partial flag varieties. Our results are achieved by establishing a splitting lemma, allowing for interlacing triangular arrays of high rank to be decomposed into arrays of lower rank, and by constructing a bijection between interlacing triangular arrays of rank 3 with certain proper vertex colorings of the triangular grid graph that factors through generalizations of Knutson-Tao puzzles. Along the way, we prove one enumerative conjecture of Aggarwal-Borodin-Wheeler and disprove another.</description>

      <title>On the adelic Gaussian hypergeometric function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define the adelic hypergeometric function of special Gaussian type by means of a tower of hypergeometric curves. This function takes values in an adelic completed group ring and interpolates all the hypergeometric functions of the same type over all finite fields. It specializes at the unit argument to the adelic beta function of Ihara and Anderson. We prove some transformation formulas and a summation formula for the adelic hypergeometric function, which are known classically for complex hypergeometric functions.</description>

      <title>A note on subvarieties of powers of OT-manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the space of finite-to-finite holomorphic correspondences on an OT-manifold is discrete. When the OT-manifold has no proper infinite complex-analytic subsets, it then follows by known model-theoretic results that its cartesian powers have no interesting complex-analytic families of subvarieties. The methods of proof, which are similar to [Moosa, Moraru, and Toma ``An essentially saturated surface not of K\"ahler-type", {\em Bull. of the LMS}, 40(5):845--854, 2008], require studying finite unramified covers of OT-manifolds.</description>

      <title>The canonical representation of the Drinfeld curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.05286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If $C$ is a smooth projective curve over an algebraically closed field $\mathbb{F}$ and $G$ is a subgroup of automorphisms of $C$, then $G$ acts linearly on the $\mathbb{F}$-vector space of holomorphic differentials $H^0\big(C,\Omega_C\big)$ by pulling back differentials. In other words, $H^0\big(C,\Omega_C\big)$ is a representation of $G$ over the field $\mathbb{F}$, called $\textit{the canonical representation}$ of $C$. Computing its decomposition as a direct sum of indecomposable representations is still an open problem when the ramification of the cover of curves $C \longrightarrow C/G$ is wild. In this paper, we compute this decomposition for $C$ the Drinfeld curve ${XY^q-X^qY-Z^{q+1}=0}$, $\mathbb{F}=\bar{\mathbb{F}}_q$, and ${G=SL_2\big(\mathbb{F}_q\big)}$ where $q$ is a prime power.</description>

Abstract: We show boundedness of polarized Calabi--Yau fibrations over curves only with fixed volumes of general fibers and Iitaka volumes. As its application, we construct a separated coarse moduli space of K-stable Calabi-Yau fibrations over curves in an adiabatic sense [Hat22b] and show that all members (resp. smooth members) of the moduli are simultaneously uniformly K-stable (resp. have cscK metrics) for a certain choice of polarizations.</description>

      <title>On tame ramification and centers of $F$-purity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of tame ramification for general finite covers. When specialized to the separable case, it extends to higher dimensions the classical notion of tame ramification for Dedekind domains and curves and sits nicely in between other notions of tame ramification in arithmetic geometry. However, when applied to the Frobenius map, it naturally yields the notion of center of $F$-purity (aka compatibly $F$-split subvariety). As an application, we describe the behavior of centers of $F$-purity under finite covers -- it all comes down to a transitivity property for tame ramification in towers.</description>

      <title>Machine learning for moduli space of genus two curves and an application to isogeny based cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use machine learning to study the moduli space of genus two curves and more specifically distribution of fine moduli points and detecting if a genus two curve has $(n, n)$-split Jacobian.
  We show that there are very few rational moduli points with small weighted height and $(n, n)$-split Jacobian for $n=2, 3, 5$. Moreover, using a K-Neighbors Classifier we are able to detect splitting with an accuracy of 99.9\%. This shows that artificial neural networks and machine learning techniques could be quite reliable on arithmetic questions in the moduli space of genus two curves and can possibly be used to applications in isogeny based cryptography.</description>

Abstract: Let $Y\to X$ be an unramified Galois cover of curves over a perfect field $k$ of characteristic $p&gt;0$ with $\mathrm{Gal}(Y/X)\cong\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$, and let $J_X$ and $J_Y$ be the Jacobians of $X$ and $Y$ respectively. We consider the $p$-torsion subgroup schemes $J_X[p]$ and $J_Y[p]$, analyze the Galois-module structure of $J_Y[p]$, and find restrictions this structure imposes on $J_Y[p]$ (for example, as manifested in its Ekedahl--Oort type) taking $J_X[p]$ as given.</description>

      <title>The Average Size of 2-Selmer Groups of Elliptic Curves in Characteristic 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08493v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be the function field of a smooth curve $B$ over a finite field $k$ of arbitrary characteristic. We prove that the average size of the $2$-Selmer groups of elliptic curves $E/K$ is at most $1+2\zeta_B(2)\zeta_B(10)$, where $\zeta_B$ is the zeta function of the curve $B$. In particular, in the limit as $q=\#k\to\infty$ (with the genus $g(B)$ fixed), we see that the average size of 2-Selmer is bounded above by $3$, even in "bad" characteristics. This completes the proof that the average rank of elliptic curves, over $\textit{any}$ fixed global field, is finite. Handling the case of characteristic $2$ requires us to develop a new theory of integral models of 2-Selmer elements, dubbed "hyper-Weierstrass curves."</description>

For these integral models, we moreover show uniformization of isogeny classes by integral local Shimura varieties, and prove a conjecture of Kisin and Pappas on local model diagrams.</description>
