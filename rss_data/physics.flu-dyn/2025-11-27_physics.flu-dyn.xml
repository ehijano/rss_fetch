      <title>Numerical Methods for a 2D "Bad" Boussinesq Equation: RK4, Strang Splitting, and High-frequency Fourier Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical methods for a two-dimensional ``bad'' Boussinesq equation: $u_{tt} = u_{xx} + u_{xxxx} + u_{yy} - 3 (u^{2})_{xx}$ are presented with good accuracy. The methods are based on Runge-Kutta fourth order (RK4) and Strang operator splitting. Before implementing the two methods, we analyze using Fourier series the linearized version of the equation by removing the nonlinear term $3(u^{2})_{xx}$, and found that a particular bound or condition needs to be satisfied to avoid blow-up solution. We found that high-frequency Fourier modes that do not satisfy the condition must be excluded from the Fourier solution. We then apply this condition to the numerical methods for solving the nonlinear Boussinesq equation and found that including only the Fourier modes that satisfy the condition gives stable solution with good accuracy. Including even just a few number of Fourier modes that violate the condition result in a blow-up solution. The accuracy of the method is measured by computing the $L^{\infty}$ error against a soliton exact solution. The errors resulting from RK4 and Strang splitting differ slightly, with the RK4 performs insignificantly better. Using our numerical methods, we also display a simulation with Dirichlet boundary condition to account for wave reflections.</description>

      <title>Bistability of interfacial long waves in two layer Couette flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the stability of interfacial long waves in two-layer plane Couette flow using an asymptotic model developed in Kalogirou et al. (2016) to match the experimental findings of Barthelet et al. (1995). Concentrating on the bistable regime, we show a remarkable agreement with the asymptotic model, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The two stable traveling waves are identified and their basins of attraction characterized via different initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Direct numerical simulation of thermo-diffusively unstable premixed hydrogen-air flames in a fully-developed turbulent channel flow at $Re_\tau=530$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of premixed hydrogen-air flames anchored in a fully-developed turbulent channel flow (TCF) are performed at a friction Reynolds number of $\mathrm{Re}_\tau=530$ and thermochemical conditions susceptible to the emergence of intrinsic thermo-diffusive (TD) phenomena acting on the turbulent flame. Two premixed flames are studied: a slower flame ($\varphi=0.25$), predominantly propagating within the core flow, and a faster one ($\varphi=0.35$), reaching closer to the channel walls and intermittently quenching on it.
  The present DNS database provides new insights into the characteristics of premixed flames susceptible to TD phenomena and propagating in realistic near-wall shear turbulence. The influence of varying turbulence intensity, and of wall-distance dependent time and length scales, on the flame propagation characteristics is evaluated through a detailed analysis of the local stretch factor $I_0$, quantifying reactivity enhancements caused by TD phenomena.
  At $\varphi=0.25$, the flame response to the fluid motions is mainly forced by the weaker turbulence present in the core flow. This results in an augmented $I_0$ compared to the laminar reference value, suggesting reactivity enhancement by the strongly non-linear interaction of TD phenomena with (relatively) weak turbulent motions present within the core flow. At $\varphi=0.35$, as the flame propagates from the core flow towards the channel walls, the flame response is forced by turbulence of increasing intensity, resulting in a corresponding augmentation of the Karlovitz number. Crucially, as the flame propagates into the near-wall region, the peak value of $I_0$ is co-located with the peak Reynolds stresses ($y^+ \sim 10$). This observation suggests a strong (local) synergistic interaction between TD phenomena and wall turbulence, ultimately resulting in significantly enhanced flame speed.</description>

      <title>Hardware-Accelerated Phase-Averaging for Cavitating Bubbly Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive validation, performance characterization, and scalability analysis of a hardware-accelerated phase-averaged multiscale solver designed to simulate acoustically driven dilute bubbly suspensions. The carrier fluid is modeled using the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. The dispersed phase is represented through two distinct subgrid formulations: a volume-averaged model that explicitly treats discrete bubbles within a Lagrangian framework, and an ensemble-averaged model that statistically represents the bubble population through a discretized distribution of bubble sizes. For both models, the bubble dynamics are modeled via the Keller--Miksis equation. For the GPU cases, we use OpenACC directives to offload computation to the GPUs. The volume-averaged model is validated against the analytical Keller-Miksis solution and experimental measurements, showing excellent agreement with root-mean-squared errors of less than 8% for both single-bubble oscillation and collapse scenarios. The ensemble-averaged model is validated by comparing it to volume-averaged simulations. On an NCSA Delta node with 4 NVIDIA A100 GPUs, we observe a speedup 16-fold compared to a 64-core AMD Milan CPU. The ensemble-averaged model offers additional reductions in computational cost by solving a single set of averaged equations, rather than multiple stochastic realizations. However, the volume-averaged model enables the interrogation of individual bubble dynamics, rather than the averaged statistics of the bubble dynamics. Weak and strong scaling tests demonstrate good scalability across both CPU and GPU platforms. These results show the proposed method is robust, accurate, and efficient for the multiscale simulation of acoustically driven dilute bubbly flows.</description>

      <title>First-order buoyancy correction of modal instabilities in stratified boundary layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a perturbation-based framework that captures buoyancy effects on modal instabilities in stratified boundary-layer flows within the fully compressible, non-Oberbeck-Boussinesq formulation. Treating the Richardson number as a small parameter and recasting the stability problem into an adjoint-residual form, we derive a first-order correction for the eigenvalues using only the neutrally buoyant eigenvalue problem. This eliminates the need to re-solve the eigenvalue problem at each stratification level. For ideal-gas boundary layers, the framework accurately predicts how stable and unstable stratification modifies Tollmien-Schlichting waves, from growth rates and eigenfunctions to $N$-factors, holding across a wide range of Prandtl numbers, temperature ratios, and Mach numbers. Notably, the buoyancy sensitivity varies strongly with Prandtl number, revealing that for a given Richardson number, buoyancy can switch from destabilising to stabilising depending on the fluid. Beyond ideal-gas conditions, we apply the first-order buoyancy correction to strongly stratified boundary layers with supercritical fluids, where the phase relationship between density and velocity perturbations determines whether buoyancy stabilises or destabilises the underlying instability. The resulting $N$-factors demonstrate, for the first time, that buoyancy significantly affects transition predictions under pseudo-boiling conditions.</description>

      <title>The effect of tip-speed ratio and free-stream turbulence on the coupled wind turbine blade/wake dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wind turbines operating within wind farms experience complex aerodynamic loading arising from the interplay between wake-induced velocity deficits, enhanced turbulence, and varying operational conditions. Understanding the relationship between the blade's structural response to the different operating regimes and flow structures generated in the turbine's wake is critical for predicting fatigue damage and optimizing turbine performance. In this work, we implement a novel technique, allowing us to simultaneously measure spatially distributed blade strain and wake dynamics for a model wind turbine under controlled free-stream turbulence (FST) and tip-speed ratio ($\lambda$) conditions. A $1$ $\mathrm{m}$ diameter three-bladed rotor was instrumented with distributed Rayleigh backscattering fibre-optic sensors, while synchronised hot-wire anemometry captured wake evolution up to $4$ rotor diameters downstream. Experiments were conducted covering a wide $\{\mathrm{FST}, \lambda\}$ parameter space -- $21$ cases in total. Results reveal that aerodynamic-induced strain fluctuations peak at $\lambda \approx 3.5$, close to the design tip -speed ratio ($\lambda_d = 4$), with the blade's tip experiencing a contribution from the aerodynamically-driven strain fluctuations of up to $75\%$ of the total fluctuating strain at design conditions. Spectral analysis shows frequency-selective coupling between wake flow structures and the blade response, dominated by flow structures dynamically related to the rotor's rotating frequency (\textit{eg.} tip vortex structure). The novel experimental methodology and results establish a data-driven foundation for future aeroelastic models' validation, and fatigue-informed control strategies.</description>

      <title>An octree-based sampling algorithm for analyzing big simulation data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As computational resources continue to increase, the storage and analysis of vast amounts of data will inevitably become a bottleneck in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and related fields. Although compression algorithms and efficient data formats can mitigate this issue, they are often insufficient when post-processing large amounts of volume data. Processing such data may require additional high-performance software and resources, or it may restrict the analysis to shorter time series or smaller regions of interest. The present work proposes an improved version of the existing \emph{Sparse Spatial Sampling} algorithm ($S^3$) to reduce the data from time-dependent flow simulations. The $S^3$ algorithm iteratively generates a time-invariant octree grid based on a user-defined metric, efficiently down-sampling the data while aiming to preserve as much of the metric as possible. Using the sampled grid allows for more efficient post-processing and enables memory-intensive tasks, such as computing the modal decomposition of flow snapshots. The enhanced version of $S^3$ is tested and evaluated on the scale-resolving simulations of the flow past a tandem configuration of airfoils in the transonic regime, the incompressible turbulent flow past a circular cylinder, and the flow around an aircraft half-model at high Reynolds and Mach numbers. $S^3$ significantly reduces the number of mesh cells by $35 \%$ to $98\%$ for all test cases while accurately preserving the dominant flow dynamics, enabling post-processing of CFD data on a local workstation rather than HPC resources for many cases.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{CRLS}$: Convolutional Regularized Least Squares Framework for Reduced Order Modeling of Transonic Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a convolutional regularized least squares ($\texttt{CRLS}$) framework for reduced-order modeling of transonic flows with shocks. Conventional proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) based reduced models are attractive because of their optimality and low online cost; however, but they perform poorly when snapshots contain parameter-dependent discontinuities, leading to smeared shocks, stair-stepping, or non-physical oscillations. In $\texttt{CRLS}$, we first map each full-order snapshot to a smoother representation by applying a one-dimensional Gaussian convolution with reflect padding along the flow field coordinates. The convolution hyperparameters (kernel width and support) are selected automatically by Bayesian optimization on a held-out set of snapshots. POD bases are then extracted from the smoothed data, and the parametric dependence of the POD coefficients is learned via radial basis function interpolation. To recover sharp shock structures, we introduce an efficient deconvolution step formulated as a regularized least squares problem, where the regularization centers the reconstruction around a nearest-neighbor reference snapshot in parameter space. The resulting $\texttt{CRLS}$ surrogate is evaluated on inviscid transonic flow over the RAE2822 airfoil, modeled by the steady compressible Euler equations solved with SU2 over a Latin hypercube sample of Mach number and angle of attack. Compared with standard POD and smoothed-POD baselines, $\texttt{CRLS}$ yields markedly improved shock location and strength, lower surface-pressure and field-level errors, and a $42$\% reduction in the number of POD modes required to capture a fixed fraction of snapshot energy. These results demonstrate that $\texttt{CRLS}$ provides an accurate, data-efficient, and largely automated route to shock-aware reduced order models for high-speed aerodynamic design.</description>

      <title>The metastability of lipid vesicle shapes in uniaxial extensional flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the elastic properties of deflated vesicles and their shape dynamics in uniaxial extensional flow. By analysing the Helfrich bending energy and viscous flow stresses in the limit of highly elongated shapes, we demonstrate that all stationary vesicle configurations are metastable. For vesicles with small reduced volume, we identify the type of bifurcation at which the stationary state is lost, leading to unbounded vesicle elongation in time. We show that the stationary vesicle length remains finite at the critical extension rate. The critical behaviour of the stationary vesicle length and of the growth rates of small perturbations is obtained analytically and confirmed by direct numerical computations. The beginning stage of the unbounded elongation dynamics is simulated numerically, in agreement with the analytical predictions.</description>

      <title>Relation between extensional viscosity and polymer conformation in dilute polymer solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate extensional viscosity and polymer conformation in dilute polymer solutions under uniaxial extensional flow using dissipative particle dynamics simulations. At high extension rates, polymers are significantly stretched by extensional flows, and the extensional viscosity growth function exhibits strain hardening. To reveal their quantitative relation, we adopt an analysis method based on the Rouse-type model. We demonstrate that the extensional viscosity growth function is determined by the instantaneous gyration radii in the parallel and perpendicular directions to the extensional direction and their time derivatives. Our approach also provides a unified description of the steady-state extensional viscosity of dilute polymer solutions for various chain lengths and concentrations in terms of the polymer gyration radius.</description>

      <title>When barchan dunes move over craters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possible outcomes of a subaqueous barchan moving over a crater-like depression in the bed. For that, we carried out experiments where we varied the dune size, crater and grain diameters, and flow velocities. We found that subaqueous barchans can be blocked, destroyed, or pass over craters, with transitional situations, and that strong instabilities take place under some conditions. Based on a dune-crater size ratio and a modified Stokes number, we propose a map that classifies the different outcomes of interactions. If used with caution, the map can serve as a reference for understanding the much slower behavior of dunes migrating over or near craters on the surface of Mars.</description>

      <title>A p-adaptive high-order mesh-free framework for fluid simulations in complex geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel p-adaptive, high-order mesh-free framework for the accurate and efficient simulation of fluid flows in complex geometries. High-order differential operators are constructed locally for arbitrary node distributions using linear combinations of anisotropic basis functions, formulated to ensure the exact reproduction of polynomial fields up to the specified p order. A dynamic p-refinement strategy is developed to refine (increase) or de-refine (decrease) the polynomial order used to approximate derivatives at each node. A new refinement indicator for mesh-free methods is proposed, based on local error estimates of the Laplacian operator, and is incorporated into the solution procedure at minimal added computational cost. Based on this error indicator, a refinement criterion is established to locally adjust the polynomial order p for the solution. The proposed adaptive mesh-free scheme is then applied to a range of canonical PDEs, and its potential is demonstrated in two-dimensional simulations of a compressible reacting flow in porous media. For the test cases studied, the proposed method exhibits potential to save up to 50% of computational costs while maintaining the specified level of accuracy. The results confirm that the developed p-adaptive high-order mesh-free method effectively captures highly non-linear regions where high-order approximation is necessary and reduces computational costs compared to the non-adaptive method, preserving high accuracy and solution stability.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Physics-Neural Models enable Learning of Non-Markovian Closures for Accelerated Coarse-Grained Physics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulations provide key insights into many physical, real-world problems. However, while these simulations are solved on a full 3D domain, most analysis only require a reduced set of metrics (e.g. plane-level concentrations). This work presents a hybrid physics-neural model that predicts scalar transport in a complex domain orders of magnitude faster than the 3D simulation (from hours to less than 1 min). This end-to-end differentiable framework jointly learns the physical model parameterization (i.e. orthotropic diffusivity) and a non-Markovian neural closure model to capture unresolved, 'coarse-grained' effects, thereby enabling stable, long time horizon rollouts. This proposed model is data-efficient (learning with 26 training data), and can be flexibly extended to an out-of-distribution scenario (with a moving source), achieving a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.96 at the final simulation time. Overall results show that this differentiable physics-neural framework enables fast, accurate, and generalizable coarse-grained surrogates for physical phenomena.</description>

      <title>PINNs4Drops: Video-conditioned physics-informed neural networks for two-phase flow reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15949v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-phase flow phenomena underpin critical technologies such as hydrogen fuel cells, spray cooling, and combustion, where droplet dynamics govern performance and efficiency. Conventional optical diagnostics, including shadowgraphy and particle image velocimetry, provide valuable insights but are limited to two-dimensional projections of inherently three-dimensional flows. We employ a specialized optical technique that encodes droplet surface information through color-coded glare points, enabling enhanced reconstruction of gas-liquid interfaces. To interpret these measurements, we introduce video-conditioned physics-informed neural networks (VcPINNs), which integrate experimental observations with governing fluid dynamics equations. This hybrid framework leverages the strengths of both data-driven learning and physical constraints, allowing accurate volumetric flow reconstruction from limited input images. Applied to droplet impingement experiments, our method yields highly resolved and physically consistent 3D interface and flow dynamics. The combined imaging and PINN reconstruction strategy provides a powerful platform for advancing multiphase-flow analysis, with broad potential impact across energy, cooling, and propulsion applications.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Generative Learning Methods for Turbulence Surrogates</title>

Abstract: Numerical simulations of turbulent flows present significant challenges in fluid dynamics due to their complexity and high computational cost. High resolution techniques such as Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) are generally not computationally affordable, particularly for technologically relevant problems. Recent advances in machine learning, specifically in generative probabilistic models, offer promising alternatives as surrogates for turbulence. This paper investigates the application of three generative models - Variational Autoencoders (VAE), Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN), and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) - in simulating a von K\'arm\'an vortex street around a fixed cylinder projected into 2D, as well as a real-world experimental dataset of the wake flow of a cylinder array. Training data was obtained by means of LES in the simulated case and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) in the experimental case. We evaluate each model's ability to capture the statistical properties and spatial structures of the turbulent flow. Our results demonstrate that DDPM and DCGAN effectively replicate all flow distributions, highlighting their potential as efficient and accurate tools for turbulence surrogacy. We find a strong argument for DCGAN, as although they are more difficult to train (due to problems such as mode collapse), they show the fastest inference and training time, require less data to train compared to VAE and DDPM, and provide the results most closely aligned with the input stream. In contrast, VAE train quickly (and can generate samples quickly) but do not produce adequate results, and DDPM, whilst effective, are significantly slower at both, inference and training time.</description>

      <title>Eddy population based model for the wall-pressure spectrum at high Reynolds number</title>

Abstract: Wall-pressure fluctuations beneath turbulent boundary layers drive noise and structural fatigue through interactions between fluid and structural modes. Conventional predictive models for the spectrum--such as the widely accepted Goody model (\textit{AIAA Journal} 42 (9), 2004, 1788--1794)--fail to capture the energetic growth in the {low-frequency range} that occurs at high Reynolds number, while at the same time over-predicting the variance. To address these shortcomings, two semi-empirical models are proposed for the wall-pressure spectrum in canonical turbulent boundary layers, pipes and channels for friction Reynolds numbers $\delta^+$ ranging from 180 to 47 000. Consistent with the approach outlined modelling the streamwise Reynolds stress in the recent work of Gustenyov et al. (\textit{J. Fluid Mech.} 1016, 2025, A23), the models are based on consideration of two eddy populations that broadly represent the contributions to the wall pressure fluctuations from inner-scale motions and outer-scale motions. The first model expresses the pre-multiplied spectrum as the sum of two overlapping log-normal populations: an inner-scaled term that is $\delta^+$-invariant and an outer-scaled term whose amplitude broadens smoothly with $\delta^+$. The model reproduces the 1-D convective signature and the emergence of an outer-scaled peak at large $\delta^+$. The second model, developed around newly available pipe data, uses theoretical arguments to prescribe the spectral shapes of the inner and outer populations. Embedding the $\delta^+$-dependence in smooth asymptotic functions yields a formulation that varies continuously with $\delta^+$ {and generalises beyond the calibration range}. Both models capture the full spectrum and {recover} the observed logarithmic growth of its variance, laying the groundwork for more accurate engineering predictions of wall-pressure fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Computational Fluid Dynamics Validation of a Nonholonomically Constrained Two-Rigid-Body Swimming System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A simple nonholonomic dynamics model is developed as a low-order model for generating undulatory swim-like motions, validated through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The rigid-body-dynamics model generates swimming motion by imposing a nonholonomic (NH) constraint on the tail of a two-body system, requiring that tail-fin velocity aligns with the tail angle, while the head moves in a straight line through a slot constraint. The system has one degree of freedom, with equations of motion derived using Lagrange multipliers. Two-dimensional CFD simulations validate the model in an incompressible Newtonian fluid, where the resolved tail fin interacts with fluid through the immersed boundary method until steady-state swimming is achieved. The validation demonstrates excellent quantitative agreement between CFD and model predictions for body orientation angle and normal fluid force across variations in fin motion amplitude, period, and Reynolds number. While an exact NH constraint point does not exist, an effective period-averaged NH location can be identified for successful model predictions. At higher Reynolds numbers, the two-body kinematics displays independence from the Reynolds number variation. The CFD data reveal that the two-body model captures the type of power-law relationship between Reynolds and Strouhal numbers governing undulatory swimming from tadpoles to whales, indicating that the simplified two-link model is representative of swimming dynamics in continuous geometries at various scales. A key limitation is that the drag force model requires a priori CFD calibration to match steady-swim velocity, limiting standalone predictive capability. The results demonstrate that the low-order NH constraint-based model effectively captures essential swimming dynamics, offering a robust alternative to existing fluid-force models.</description>

      <title>Simulating droplet adhesion on superhydrophobic surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A numerical model is proposed to simulate the adhesion, compression, and subsequent detachment of a micro-liter droplet from a superhydrophobic surface composed of chemically homogeneous pillars arranged in a periodic fashion, replicating a typical force probe microscopy experiment. We observe that as the droplet is pulled away from the surface, the net vertical force varies in a typical sawtooth manner with peculiar peaks and troughs, characteristic of the surface. The force first reaches a maximum before the droplet detaches from the surface with a comparatively lower force. The force variation predicted by the numerical model is in good agreement with the experimental results of Kumar et al. [1]. We also studied the effect of evaporation on the variation in the adhesion force by simulating an evaporating droplet on a superhydrophobic surface. For an evaporating droplet, the numerically predicted maximum and detachment force magnitudes are in good agreement with those obtained experimentally when we take into account the change in the droplet weight as it evaporates. The proposed method will be useful for the quantitative analysis and design of a variety of superhydrophobic surfaces and will pave the way for more accurate surface characterization based on droplet adhesion force measurements.</description>

Abstract: Understanding contact line dynamics on superhydrophobic surfaces with microscopic structures is essential for designing materials with reduced drag, anti-icing, self-cleaning, and anti-fouling properties. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that forces on droplets receding over structured surfaces are governed by microscale deformations near the contact line. We present and experimentally validate an expression demonstrating that adhesion force increases logarithmically with pillar area fraction at constant droplet volume and pillar surface chemistry. Furthermore, we establish that the average tensile force measured in direct force measurements provides a more reliable indicator of surface structure than the commonly used maximum force. This newfound insight enables precise quantification of superhydrophobic surface structure using a droplet probe.</description>

      <title>A two-sided subgrid-scale model for mass transfer across fluid interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The occurrence of extremely thin concentration boundary layers at fluid interfaces for high local P\'eclet numbers is a severe obstacle for efficient and accurate numerical simulation of mass transfer processes in two-phase fluid systems. Especially challenging are liquid-liquid systems, in which thin concentration boundary layers can appear on both sides of the fluid interface under convection-dominated conditions. In those cases, the one-sided species concentrations at the interface are a-priori not even known approximately, but are determined by a conjugate mass transfer problem governed by interfacial jump conditions. To the best of the authors' knowledge we for the first time introduce a two-sided Subgrid-Scale (SGS) boundary layer model for conjugate mass transfer at fluid interfaces. It accurately computes the local mass transfer rates on moderate or coarse mesh resolutions even when very high concentration gradients in interface vicinity occur. For this purpose, SGS modeling is applied on both sides of an interface transmissive to passive scalars, such as the interface in a two-phase fluid system, enabling the accurate capture of conjugate mass transfer across thin boundary layer on one or on both sides of the interface. We implement our approach in the unstructured Finite-Volume Arbitrary Lagrangian / Eulerian Interface-Tracking (ALE-IT) OpenFOAM module twoPhaseInterTrackFoam. We have made twoPhaseInterTrackFoam publicly available in our previous publication (Schwarzmeier et al., 2025).</description>

      <title>Constructing Extreme Heatwave Storylines with Differentiable Climate Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10660v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the plausible upper bounds of extreme weather events is essential for risk assessment in a warming climate. Existing methods, based on large ensembles of physics-based models, are often computationally expensive or lack the fidelity needed to simulate rare, high-impact extremes. Here, we present a novel framework that leverages a differentiable hybrid climate model, NeuralGCM, to optimize initial conditions and generate physically consistent worst-case heatwave trajectories. Applied to the 2021 Pacific Northwest heatwave, our method produces heatwave intensity up to 3.7 $^\circ$C above the most extreme member of a 75-member ensemble. These trajectories feature intensified atmospheric blocking and amplified Rossby wave patterns-hallmarks of severe heat events. Our results demonstrate that differentiable climate models can efficiently explore the upper tails of event likelihoods, providing a powerful new approach for constructing targeted storylines of extreme weather under climate change.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the dynamical response of the free surface of an ultra-soft solid driven by a localized moving pressure disturbance. Experiments reveal a steady V-shaped wake analogous to a surface Mach wedge. A simple geometric argument provides a qualitative explanation consistent with observations. A theoretical framework combining elastodynamic, capillary, and gravitational effects yields a generalized dispersion relation that smoothly interpolates between Kelvin's theory of liquid interface wakes and Rayleigh's theory of elastic surface waves. Together, our experiments and theory reveal the existence of a soft wake regime that bridges fluid and solid surface wave physics, offering new routes for probing the dynamics of soft surfaces.</description>

      <title>How elasticity affects bubble pinch-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pinch-off of bubbles in viscoelastic liquids is a fundamental process that has received little attention compared to viscoelastic drop pinch-off. While these processes exhibit qualitative similarities, the dynamics of the pinch-off process are fundamentally different. When a drop of a dilute polymer solution pinches off, a thread is known to develop that prevents breakup due the diverging polymer stresses. Conversely, our experiments reveal that this thread is absent for bubble pinch-off in dilute polymer solutions. We show that a thread becomes apparent only for high polymer concentrations, where the pinch-off dynamics become very sensitive to the size of the needle from which the bubble detaches. The experiments are complemented by numerical simulations and analytical modeling using the Oldroyd-B model, which capture the dilute regime. The model shows that polymer stresses are still singular during bubble pinch-off, but the divergence is much weaker as compared to drop pinch-off. This explains why, in contrast to droplets, viscoelastic bubble-threads do not appear for dilute suspensions but require large polymer concentrations</description>
