      <title>Immobility of isolated swarmer cells due to local liquid depletion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bacterial swarming is a complex phenomenon in which thousands of self-propelled rod-shaped cells move coherently on surfaces, providing an excellent example of active matter. However, bacterial swarming is different from most studied examples of active systems because single isolated cells do not move, while clusters do. The biophysical aspects underlying this behavior are unclear. In this work we explore the case of low local cell densities, where single cells become temporarily immobile. We show that immobility is related to local depletion of liquid. In addition, it is also associated with the state of the flagella. Specifically, the flagellar bundles at (temporarily) liquid depleted regions are completely spread-out. Our results suggest that dry models of self-propelled agents, which only consider steric alignments and neglect hydrodynamic effects, are oversimplified and are not sufficient to describe swarming bacteria.</description>

      <title>Synchronization of two bacterial flagella as a stochastic process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchronization with noise is important for understanding biophysical processes at nano- and micro-meter scales, such as neuron firing and beating of cilia. To understand the energetics of these processes, stochastic thermodynamics approaches are useful. Due to large fluctuations in a small system, emsemble averages of thermodynamic quantities are not sufficient to characterize the energetics of an individual sample. In this paper, we use a model for synchronization of bacterial flagella as an example, and develop an approximation method for analyzing the phase and heat dissipation in trajectories for different noise realizations. We describe the time development of the phase difference and heat dissipation as stochastic processes, and verify the analytical results by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>High-throughput antibody screening with high-quality factor nanophotonics and bioprinting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Empirical investigation of the quintillion-scale, functionally diverse antibody repertoires that can be generated synthetically or naturally is critical for identifying potential biotherapeutic leads, yet remains burdensome. We present high-throughput nanophotonics- and bioprinter-enabled screening (HT-NaBS), a multiplexed assay for large-scale, sample-efficient, and rapid characterization of antibody libraries. Our platform is built upon independently addressable pixelated nanoantennas exhibiting wavelength-scale mode volumes, high-quality factors (high-Q) exceeding 5000, and pattern densities exceeding one million sensors per square centimeter. Our custom-built acoustic bioprinter enables individual sensor functionalization via the deposition of picoliter droplets from a library of capture antigens at rates up to 25,000 droplets per second. We detect subtle differentiation in the target binding signature through spatially-resolved spectral imaging of hundreds of resonators simultaneously, elucidating antigen-antibody binding kinetic rates, affinity constant, and specificity. We demonstrate HT-NaBS on a panel of antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A, and Influenza B antigens, with a sub-picomolar limit of detection within 30 minutes. Furthermore, through epitope binning analysis, we demonstrate the competence and diversity of a library of native antibodies targeting functional epitopes on a priority pathogen (H5N1 bird flu) and on glycosylated therapeutic Cetuximab antibodies against epidermal growth factor receptor. With a roadmap to image tens of thousands of sensors simultaneously, this high-throughput, resource-efficient, and label-free platform can rapidly screen for high-affinity and broad epitope coverage, accelerating biotherapeutic discovery and de novo protein design.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Effect of Bariatric Surgery on Gastric Digestion in the Stomach: Insights from Multiphase Flow Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The geometry and motility of the stomach play a critical role in the digestion of ingested liquid meals. Sleeve gastrectomy, a common type of bariatric surgery used to reduce the size of the stomach, significantly alters the stomach's anatomy and motility, which impacts gastric emptying and digestion. In this study, we use an imaging data-based computational model, StomachSim, to investigate the consequences of sleeve gastrectomy. The pre-operative stomach anatomy was derived from imaging data and the post-sleeve gastrectomy shapes were generated for different resection volumes. We investigate the effect of sleeve sizes and motility patterns on gastric mixing and emptying. Simulations were conducted using an immersed-boundary flow solver, modeling a liquid meal to analyze changes in gastric content mixing and emptying rates. The results reveal that different degrees of volume reduction and impaired gastric motility have complex effects on stomach's mixing and emptying functions, which are important factors in gastric health of the patient. These findings provide insights into the biomechanical effects of sleeve gastrectomy on gastric digestion and emptying functions, highlighting the potential of computational models to inform surgical planning and post-operative management.</description>

      <title>Design principles of transcription factors with intrinsically disordered regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11180v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transcription Factors (TFs) are proteins crucial for regulating gene expression. Effective regulation requires the TFs to rapidly bind to their correct target, enabling the cell to respond efficiently to stimuli such as nutrient availability or the presence of toxins. However, the search process is hindered by slow diffusive movement and the presence of `false' targets --DNA segments that are similar to the true target. In eukaryotic cells, most TFs contain an Intrinsically Disordered Region (IDR), which is a long, flexible polymeric tail composed of hundreds of amino acids. Recent experimental findings indicate that the IDR of certain TFs plays a pivotal role in the search process. However, the principles underlying the IDR's role remain unclear. Here, we reveal key design principles of the IDR related to TF binding affinity and search time. Our results demonstrate that the IDR significantly enhances both of these aspects. Furthermore, our model shows good agreement with experimental results, and we propose further experiments to validate the model's predictions.</description>

      <title>Chemotaxing E. coli do not count single molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding biological functions requires identifying the physical limits and system-specific constraints that have shaped them. In Escherichia coli chemotaxis, gradient-climbing speed is information-limited, bounded by the sensory information they acquire from real-time measurements of their environment. However, it remains unclear what limits this information. Past work conjectured that E. coli's chemosensing is limited by the physics of molecule arrivals at their sensors. Here, we derive the physical limit on behaviorally-relevant information, and then perform single-cell experiments to quantify how much information E. coli's signaling pathway encodes. We find that E. coli encode two orders of magnitude less information than the physical limit due to their stochastic signal processing. Thus, system-specific constraints, rather than the physical limit, have shaped the evolution of this canonical sensory-motor behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08664v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Living materials adapt their shape to signals from the environment, yet the impact of shape changes on signal processing and associated feedback dynamics remain unclear. We find that droplets with signal-responsive interfacial tensions exhibit shape bistability, excitable dynamics, and oscillations. The underlying critical points reveal novel mechanisms for physical signal processing through shape adaptation in soft active materials. We recover signatures of one such critical point in experimental data from zebrafish embryos, where it supports boundary formation.</description>

      <title>Topological transition in filamentous cyanobacteria: from motion to structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06314v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many active systems are capable of forming intriguing patterns at scales significantly larger than the size of their individual constituents. Cyanobacteria are one of the most ancient and important phyla of organisms that has allowed the evolution of more complex life forms. Despite its importance, the role of motility on the pattern formation of their colonies is not understood. Here, we investigate the large-scale collective effects and rich dynamics of gliding filamentous cyanobacteria colonies, while still retaining information about the individual constituents' dynamics and their interactions. We investigate both the colony's transient and steady-state dynamics and find good agreement with experiments. We furthermore show that the Peclet number and aligning interaction strength govern the system's topological transition from an isotropic distribution to a state of large-scale reticulate patterns. Although the system is topologically non-trivial, the parallel and perpendicular pair correlation functions provide structural information about the colony, and thus can be used to extract information about the early stages of biofilm formation. Finally, we find that the effects of the filaments' length cannot be reduced to a system of interacting points. Our model proves to reproduce both cyanobacteria colonies and systems of biofilaments where curvature is transported by motility.</description>

      <title>A stochastic field theory for the evolution of quantitative traits in finite populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Infinitely many distinct trait values may arise in populations bearing quantitative traits, and modeling their population dynamics is thus a formidable task. While classical models assume fixed or infinite population size, models in which the total population size fluctuates due to demographic noise in births and deaths can behave qualitatively differently from constant or infinite population models due to density-dependent dynamics. In this paper, I present a stochastic field theory for the eco-evolutionary dynamics of finite populations bearing one-dimensional quantitative traits. I derive stochastic field equations that describe the evolution of population densities, trait frequencies, and the mean value of any trait in the population. These equations recover well-known results such as the replicator-mutator equation, Price equation, and gradient dynamics in the infinite population limit. For finite populations, the equations describe the intricate interplay between natural selection, noise-induced selection, eco-evolutionary feedback, and neutral genetic drift in determining evolutionary trajectories. My work uses ideas from statistical physics, calculus of variations, and SPDEs, providing alternative methods that complement the measure-theoretic martingale approach that is more common in the literature.</description>
