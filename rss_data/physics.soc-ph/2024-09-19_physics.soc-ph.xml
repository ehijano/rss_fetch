      <title>Female representation across mythologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social groups have been studied throughout history to understand how different configurations impact those within them. Along with this came the interest in investigating social groups of both fictional and mythological works. Over the last decade these social groups have been studied through the lens of network science allowing for a new level of comparison between these stories. We use this approach to focus on the attributes of the characters within these networks, specifically looking at their gender. With this we review how the female populations within various narratives and to some extent the societies they are based in are portrayed. Through this we find that although there is not a trend of all narratives of the same origin having similar levels of representation some are noticeably better than others. We also observe which narratives overall prioritise important female characters and which do not.</description>

      <title>Continuity equation and fundamental diagram of pedestrians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the beginning of the century, capturing trajectories of pedestrian streams precisely from video recordings has been possible. To enable measurements at high density, the heads of the pedestrians are marked and tracked, thus providing a complete representation of the phase space. However, classical definitions and local measurements of flow, density, and velocity of pedestrian streams using trajectories are based on different segments in phase space (Lagrangian representation). The flow is defined as an average value over time, while the density is defined as the average value of an area. This leads to inconsistencies in central relations, such as the flow equation or the fundamental diagram. These have a particular effect in inhomogeneous states, such as the stop-and-go waves, where, in addition, the pedestrians do not change their position in the stop phase, but the head of the body moves. In order to obtain a local and spatio-temporally consistent measurement of the quantities flow, density, and velocity while ensuring particle number conservation fields (Euler representation) and the continuity equation could be used. To map trajectories of pedestrians heads parameter free and unambiguously to fields, this article introduces a method based on the Voronoi decomposition. These new definitions of flow, density, speed, and the particle number conserving flow equation are consistent with classical measurements. They are able to scrutinise inconsistencies in the state of the art of pedestrian fundamental diagrams.</description>

      <title>Crossing the disciplines -- a starter toolkit for researchers who wish to explore early Irish literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inspiration behind this paper came from both authors' long-term collaboration with our friend and colleague, Professor Ralph Kenna. This connection emerged initially through his interest in Rathcroghan and in our paper, `Exploring the Nature of the Fr\'aoch Saga', which we concluded with the statement that we believed it `presents a case that will hopefully ignite conversation between disciplines'. This led us to consider the potential value for researchers of compiling a template list of useful and reliable sources and resources to consult, in other words a type of starter toolkit or guide for any individual from an alternative discipline or background, who might possess, or, in time, develop a personal or professional interest in Early Ireland and Early Irish literature. In doing this, we decided for ease of illustration, to take the example of the location name Rathcroghan/Cruachan A\'i, (the prehistoric Royal Site of Connacht in the west of Ireland and the place that we both work in and interact with on a daily basis), as a case study in order to demonstrate an initial methodological approach to not only the types of resources and information available, but also to highlight some potential pitfalls that may arise in the course of an investigation.</description>

      <title>Anomalous behavior of Replicator dynamics for the Prisoner's Dilemma on diluted lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In diluted lattices, cooperation is often enhanced at specific densities, particularly near the percolation threshold for stochastic updating rules. However, the Replicator rule, despite being probabilistic, does not follow this trend. We find that this anomalous behavior is caused by structures formed by holes and defectors, which prevent some agents from experiencing fluctuations, thereby restricting the free flow of information across the network. As a result, the system becomes trapped in a frozen state, though this can be disrupted by introducing perturbations. Finally, we provide a more quantitative analysis of the relationship between the percolation threshold and cooperation, tracking its development within clusters of varying sizes and demonstrating how the percolation threshold shapes the fundamental structures of the lattice.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the role of supernatural entities and the effect of missing data in Irish sagas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For over a decade, complex networks have been applied to mythological texts in order to quantitatively compare them. This has allowed us to identify similarities between texts in different cultures, as well as to quantify the significance of some heroic characters. Analysing a full mythology of a culture requires gathering data from many individual myths which is time consuming and often impractical. In this work, we attempt to bypass this by analysing the network of characters in a dictionary of mythological characters. We show that the top characters identified by different centrality measures are consistent with central figures in the Irish sagas. Although much of Irish mythology has been lost, we demonstrate that these most central characters are highly robust to a large random removal of edges.</description>

      <title>Spectral clustering of time-evolving networks using the inflated dynamic Laplacian for graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex time-varying networks are prominent models for a wide variety of spatiotemporal phenomena. The functioning of networks depends crucially on their connectivity, yet reliable techniques for determining communities in spacetime networks remain elusive. We adapt successful spectral techniques from continuous-time dynamics on manifolds to the graph setting to fill this gap. We formulate an {\it inflated dynamic Laplacian} for graphs and develop a spectral theory to underpin the corresponding algorithmic realisations. We develop spectral clustering approaches for both multiplex and non-multiplex networks, based on the eigenvectors of the inflated dynamic Laplacian and specialised Sparse EigenBasis Approximation (SEBA) post-processing of these eigenvectors. We demonstrate that our approach can outperform the Leiden algorithm applied both in spacetime and layer-by-layer, and we analyse voting data from the US senate (where senators come and go as congresses evolve) to quantify increasing polarisation in time.</description>

      <title>Mitigating the risk of tanking in multi-stage tournaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.16054v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-stage tournaments consisting of a round-robin group stage followed by a knockout phase are ubiquitous in sports. However, this format is incentive incompatible if at least two teams from a group advance to the knockout stage where the brackets are predetermined. A model is developed to quantify the risk of tanking in these contests. The suggested approach is applied to the 2022 FIFA World Cup to uncover how its design could have been improved by changing group labelling (a reform that has received no attention before) and the schedule of group matches. Scheduling is found to be a surprisingly weak intervention compared to previous results on the risk of collusion in a group. The probability of tanking, which is disturbingly high around 25\%, cannot be reduced by more than 3 percentage points via these policies. Tournament organisers need to consider more fundamental changes against tanking.</description>

      <title>Centrality measures and opinion dynamics in two-layer networks with replica nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine two-layer networks and centrality measures defined on them. We propose two fast and accurate algorithms to approximate the game-theoretic centrality measures and examine connection between centrality measures and characteristics of opinion dynamic processes on such networks. As an example, we consider a Zachary's karate club social network and extend it by adding the second (internal) layer of communication. Internal layer represents the idea that individuals can share their real opinions with their close friends. The structures of the external and internal layers may be different. As characteristics of opinion dynamic processes we mean consensus time and winning rate of a particular opinion. We find significantly strong positive correlation between internal graph density and consensus time, and significantly strong negative correlation between centrality of authoritative nodes and consensus time.</description>

      <title>Mobility-GCN: a human mobility-based graph convolutional network for tracking and analyzing the spatial dynamics of the synthetic opioid crisis in the USA, 2013-2020</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09945v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synthetic opioids are the most common drugs involved in drug-involved overdose mortalities in the U.S. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that in 2018, about 70% of all drug overdose deaths involved opioids and 67% of all opioid-involved deaths were accounted for by synthetic opioids. In this study, we investigated the spread of synthetic opioids between 2013 and 2020 in the U.S. We analyzed the relationship between the spatiotemporal pattern of synthetic opioid-involved deaths and another key opioid, heroin, and compared patterns of deaths involving these two types of drugs during this period. Spatial connections and human mobility between counties were incorporated into a graph convolutional neural network model to represent and analyze the spread of synthetic opioid-involved deaths in the context of previous heroin-involved death patterns.</description>
