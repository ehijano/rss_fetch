      <title>Suppression of Collisionless Magnetic Reconnection in the High Ion $\beta$, Strong Guide Field Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In magnetic reconnection, the ion bulk outflow speed and ion heating have been shown to be set by the available reconnecting magnetic energy, i.e., the energy stored in the reconnecting magnetic field ($B_r$). However, recent simulations, observations, and theoretical works have shown that the released magnetic energy is inhibited by upstream ion plasma beta $\beta_{i}$ -- the relative ion thermal pressure normalized to magnetic pressure based on the reconnecting field -- for antiparallel magnetic field configurations. Using kinetic theory and hybrid particle-in-cell simulations, we investigate the effects of $\beta_{i}$ on guide field reconnection. While previous works have suggested that guide field reconnection is uninfluenced by $\beta_{i}$, we demonstrate that the reconnection process is modified and the outflow is reduced for sufficiently large $\beta_{i} &gt; B_g^2/(B_r^2 + B_g^2)$. We develop a theoretical framework that shows that this reduction is consistent with an enhanced exhaust pressure gradient, which reduces the outflow speed as $v_0 \propto 1/\sqrt{\beta_{i}}$. These results apply to systems in which guide field reconnection is embedded in hot plasmas, such as reconnection at the boundary of eddies in fully developed turbulence like the solar wind or the magnetosheath as well as downstream of shocks such as the heliosheath or the mergers of galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Non-thermal fusion burning processes, relevant collective modes and gained perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New tridimensional plasma structures, that are oscillatory and classified as non-separable ballooning modes, can emerge in inhomogeneous plasmas and undergo resonant mode-particle interactions, e.g., with a minority population, that can lead them to modify their spatial profiles. Thus, unlike the case of previously known ballooning modes their amplitudes are not separable functions of time and space. The relevant resonance conditions are intrinsically different from those of the well-known Landau conditions for (ordinary) plasma waves: they involve the mode geometry and affect different regions of the distribution in momentum space at different positions in configuration space. A process for a transfer of energy among different particle populations is envisioned</description>

      <title>Opportunities in Pulsed Magnetic Fusion Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fusion is a potentially transformational energy technology, which promises limitless clean energy. Yet, it requires continued scientific and technological development to realize its potential. The conditions necessary for fusion energy gain in terms of the product of plasma pressure $P$ and confinement time $\tau$ have been known for many decades. An underappreciated fact is that pulsed magnetic fusion has demonstrated $P \tau$ performance on par with laser-driven ICF and tokamaks despite receiving only a small fraction of investment relative to those concepts. In light of this demonstrated performance, well-established scaling relations, and opportunities for further innovations, here we advocate for pulsed magnetic fusion as the most attractive path towards commercialization of fusion energy.</description>

      <title>The Lake equation as a supercritical mean-field limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study so-called supercritical mean-field limits of systems of trapped particles moving according to Newton's second law with either Coulomb/super-Coulomb or regular interactions, from which we derive a $\mathsf{d}$-dimensional generalization of the Lake equation, which coincides with the incompressible Euler equation in the simplest setting, for monokinetic data. This supercritical mean-field limit may also be interpreted as a combined mean-field and quasineutral limit, and our assumptions on the rates of these respective limits are shown to be optimal. Our work provides a mathematical basis for the universality of the Lake equation in this scaling limit -- a new observation -- in the sense that the dependence on the interaction and confinement is only through the limiting spatial density of the particles. Our proof is based on a modulated-energy method and takes advantage of regularity theory for the obstacle problem for the fractional Laplacian.</description>

      <title>Response of a Relativistically Streaming Pulsar Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The response tensor is derived for a relativistically streaming, strongly magnetized, one-dimensional J\"uttner distribution of electrons and positrons, referred to as a pulsar plasma. This is used to produce a general treatment of wave dispersion in a pulsar plasma. Specifically, relativistic streaming, the spread in Lorentz factors in a pulsar rest frame, and cyclotron resonances are taken into account. Approximations to the response tensor are derived by making approximations to relativistic plasma dispersion functions appearing in the general form of the response tensor. The cold-plasma limit, the highly relativistic limit, and limits related to cyclotron resonances are considered. The theory developed in this paper has applications to generalised Faraday rotation in pulsars and magnetars.</description>

      <title>Interplanetary Causes and Impacts of the 2024 May Superstorm on the Geosphere: An Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent superstorm of 2024 May 10-11 is the second largest geomagnetic storm in the space age and the only one that has simultaneous interplanetary data (there were no interplanetary data for the 1989 March storm). The May superstorm was characterized by a sudden impulse (SI+) amplitude of +88 nT, followed by a three-step storm main phase development which had a total duration of ~9 hr. The cause of the first storm main phase with a peak SYM-H intensity of -183 nT was a fast forward interplanetary shock (magnetosonic Mach number Mms ~7.2) and an interplanetary sheath with southward interplanetary magnetic field component Bs of ~40 nT. The cause of the second storm main phase with a SYM-H intensity of -354 nT was a deepening of the sheath Bs to ~43 nT. A magnetosonic wave (Mms ~0.6) compressed the sheath to a high magnetic field strength of ~71 nT. Intensified Bs of ~48 nT was the cause of the third and most intense storm main phase with a SYM-H intensity of -518 nT. Three magnetic cloud events with Bs fields of ~25-40 nT occurred in the storm recovery phase, lengthening the recovery to ~2.8 days. At geosynchronous orbit, ~76 keV to ~1.5 MeV electrons exhibited ~1-3 orders of magnitude flux decreases following the shock/sheath impingement onto the magnetosphere. The cosmic ray decreases at Dome C, Antarctica (effective vertical cutoff rigidity &lt;0.01 GV) and Oulu, Finland (rigidity ~0.8 GV) were ~17% and ~11%, respectively relative to quite time values. Strong ionospheric current flows resulted in extreme geomagnetically induced currents of ~30-40 A in the sub-auroral region. The storm period is characterized by strong polar region field-aligned currents, with ~10 times intensification during the main phase, and equatorward expansion down to ~50 deg geomagnetic (altitude-adjusted) latitude.</description>

      <title>Simulating nonlinear optical processes on a superconducting quantum device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating plasma physics on quantum computers is difficult because most problems of interest are nonlinear, but quantum computers are not naturally suitable for nonlinear operations. In weakly nonlinear regimes, plasma problems can be modeled as wave-wave interactions. In this paper, we develop a quantization approach to convert nonlinear wave-wave interaction problems to Hamiltonian simulation problems. We demonstrate our approach using two qubits on a superconducting device. Unlike a photonic device, a superconducting device does not naturally have the desired interactions in its native Hamiltonian. Nevertheless, Hamiltonian simulations can still be performed by decomposing required unitary operations into native gates. To improve experimental results, we employ a range of error mitigation techniques. Apart from readout error mitigation, we use randomized compilation to transform undiagnosed coherent errors into well-behaved stochastic Pauli channels. Moreover, to compensate for stochastic noise, we rescale exponentially decaying probability amplitudes using rates measured from cycle benchmarking. We carefully consider how different choices of product-formula algorithms affect the overall error and show how a trade-off can be made to best utilize limited quantum resources. This study provides an example of how plasma problems may be solved on near-term quantum computing platforms.</description>

      <title>Sub-terahertz field emission transistors with selfpackaged microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08124v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the design of a vertical structure terahertz field emission transistor that utilizes a high-angle oblique deposition method to form a self-packaged vacuum microcavity. The simulation demonstrates that the self-packaged microcavity can effectively mitigate the potential impact of conventional field emission transistors on surrounding solid-state circuits, thereby improving the frequency performance and stability of the device. The proposed design exhibits a cutoff frequency at the sub-terahertz level.</description>
