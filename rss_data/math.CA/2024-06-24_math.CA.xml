      <title>A phase-space approach to weighted Fourier extension inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to expose and investigate natural phase-space formulations of two longstanding problems in the restriction theory of the Fourier transform. These problems, often referred to as the Stein and Mizohata--Takeuchi conjectures, assert that Fourier extension operators associated with rather general (codimension 1) submanifolds of euclidean space, may be effectively controlled by the classical X-ray transform via weighted $L^2$ inequalities. Our phase-space formulations, which expose close connections with a conjecture of Flandrin from time-frequency analysis, rest on the identification of an explicit ``geometric" Wigner transform associated with an arbitrary (smooth strictly convex) submanifold $S$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Our main results are certain natural ``Sobolev variants" of the Stein and Mizohata--Takeuchi conjectures, and involve estimating the Sobolev norms of such Wigner transforms by geometric forms of classical bilinear fractional integral operators. Our broad geometric framework allows us to explore the role of the curvature of the submanifold in these problems, and in particular we obtain bounds that are independent of any lower bound on the curvature; a feature that is uncommon in the wider restriction theory of the Fourier transform. Finally, we provide a further illustration of the effectiveness of our Sobolev norm approach by establishing a form of Flandrin's conjecture in the plane with an $\varepsilon$-loss. While our perspective comes primarily from euclidean harmonic analysis, the general procedure used for constructing phase-space representations of extension operators is well-known in optics.</description>

      <title>Quadratic spectral concentration of characteristic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the inequality \begin{align*}\int_{-W/2}^{W/2}|\widehat{f}(\xi)|^2d\xi\leq \int_{-W/2}^{W/2}|\widehat{|f|^*}(\xi)|^2d\xi \end{align*} between the quadratic spectral concentration of a function and that of its decreasing rearrangement holds for any function $f\in L^2,\;|\text{supp} f|=T,$ if and only if the product $WT$ does not exceed the critical value $\approx 0.884$. We show that by restricting ourselves to characteristic functions we can enlarge this range up to $WT\leq 4/3$. Besides, we establish various properties of minimizers of the difference $\int_{-W/2}^{W/2}|\widehat{\chi_A^*}(\xi)|^2d\xi-\int_{-W/2}^{W/2}|\widehat{\chi_A}(\xi)|^2d\xi$ over sets $A$ of finite measure and prove that this difference is non-negative for all $W,T&gt;0$ if $A$ is the union of two intervals. As a corollary, we obtain a sharp (up to a constant) estimate for the $L_2$-norms of non-harmonic trigonometric polynomials with alternating coefficients $\pm 1$.</description>

      <title>Passivity theorems for input-to-state stability of forced Lur'e inclusions and equations, and consequent entrainment-type properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A suite of input-to-state stability results are presented for a class of forced differential inclusions, so-called Lur'e inclusions. As a consequence, semi-global incremental input-to-state stability results for systems of forced Lur'e differential equations are derived. The results are in the spirit of the passivity theorem from control theory as both the linear and nonlinear components of the Lur'e inclusion (or equation) are assumed to satisfy passivity-type conditions. These results provide a basis for the analysis of forced Lur'e differential equations subject to (almost) periodic forcing terms and, roughly speaking, ensure the existence and attractivity of (almost) periodic state- and output-responses, comprising another focus of the present work. One ultimate aim of the study is to provide a robust and rigorous theoretical foundation for a well-defined and tractable ``frequency response'' of forced Lur'e systems.</description>

      <title>Analytic capacity and dimension of sets with plenty of big projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.05804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our main result marks progress on an old conjecture of Vitushkin. We show that a compact set in the plane with plenty of big projections (PBP) has positive analytic capacity, along with a quantitative lower bound. A higher dimensional counterpart is also proved for capacities related to the Riesz kernel, including the Lipschitz harmonic capacity. The proof uses a construction of a doubling Frostman measure on a lower content regular set, which may be of independent interest. Our second main result is the Analyst's Traveling Salesman Theorem for sets with plenty of big projections. As a corollary, we obtain a lower bound for the Hausdorff dimension of uniformly wiggly sets with PBP. The second corollary is an estimate for the capacities of subsets of sets with PBP, in the spirit of the quantitative solution to Denjoy's conjecture.</description>
