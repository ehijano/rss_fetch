      <title>Phase field modelling of the growth and detachment of bubbles in a hydrogen electrolyzer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop and implement numerically a phase field model for the growth and detachment of a gas bubble resting on an electrode and being filled with hydrogen produced by water electrolysis. The bubble is surrounded by a viscous liquid, has a prescribed static contact angle and is also subject to gravitational forces. We compute, as a function of the static contact angle, the time at which the bubble detaches from the substrate and what volume it has at that time. We also investigate de dependence of the detachment time on other parameters such as the applied voltage and the hydrogen ion concentration at the fluid bulk.</description>

      <title>Sequence-Defined Phase Behavior of Poly(N-Isopropylacrylamide-co-Acrylamide) in Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise arrangement of different chemical moieties in a polymer determines its thermophysical properties. How the sequence of moieties impacts the properties of a polymer is an outstanding problem in polymer science. Herein, we address this problem for the thermoresponsive property of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-acrylamide) in water using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Eight distinct copolymers, each with a different arrangement of NIPAM(N-isopropylacrylamide) and AM (acrylamide) monomers, are considered. The lower critical solution temperature (LCST) shows a strong correlation with the mean block length of the periodic sequences of the copolymer. We further identify copolymer sequences that exhibit both the LCST and upper critical solution temperature (UCST). Moreover, there are sequences that do not show any LCST or UCST for the temperature range explored in this study. This wide variability in thermorepsonsive property is found to be closely linked to the the extent of hydrongen bond formation in the system, which appears to have a significant correlation with the monomer sequence of the copolymer. These findings offer new directions in the design of structurally diverse thermoresponsive copolymers.</description>

      <title>A shear cell study on oral and inhalation grade lactose powders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shear cell tests have been conducted on twenty different lactose powders, most of which commercially available for oral or inhalation purposes, spanning a wide range of particle sizes, particle morphologies, production processes. The aims of the investigation were: i) to verify the reliability of the technique in evaluating and classifying the flowability of powders; ii) to understand the connection between the flowability of a powder and the morphological properties of its particles; iii) to find a general mathematical relationship able to predict the yield locus shape given the particle size, shape and consolidation state of a lactose powder. These aspects and their limitations are detailed in the manuscript together with other interesting findings on the stick-slip behavior observed in most of the lactose powders examined.</description>

      <title>Liquid-liquid phase separation enables highly selective viral genome packaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many viruses, hundreds of proteins assemble an outer shell (capsid) around the viral nucleic acid to form an infectious virion. How the assembly process selects the viral genome amidst a vast excess of diverse cellular nucleic acids is poorly understood. It has recently been discovered that many viruses perform assembly and genome packaging within liquid-liquid phase separated biomolecular condensates inside the host cell. However, the role of condensates in genome packaging is poorly understood. Here, we construct equilibrium and dynamical rate equation models for condensate-coupled assembly and genome packaging. We show that when the viral genome and capsid proteins favorably partition into the condensate, assembly rates, yields, and packaging efficiencies can increase by orders of magnitude. Selectivity is further enhanced by the condensate when capsid proteins are translated during assembly and packaging. Our results suggest that viral condensates provide a mechanism to ensure robust and highly selective assembly of virions around viral genomes. More broadly, our results may apply to other types of selective co-assembly processes that occur within biomolecular condensates, and suggest that liquid-liquid phase-separated condensates could be exploited for selective encapsulation of microscopic cargo in human-engineered systems.</description>

      <title>Thomson problem on a spherical cap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the low-energy configurations of N mutually repelling charges confined to a spherical cap and interacting via the Coulomb potential. In the continuum limit, this problem was solved by Lord Kelvin, who found a non-uniform charge distribution with an integrable singularity at the boundary. To explore the discrete analogue, we developed an efficient numerical method that enables energy minimization while maintaining the number of charges at the cap's edge fixed. Using this approach we have obtained numerical results for various values of N and cap angular widths. Based on these results, we analyze the emergence and behavior of topological defects as functions of both N and the cap's curvature.</description>

      <title>Effects of Near-Field Hydrodynamic Interactions on Bacterial Dynamics Near a Solid Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-field hydrodynamic interactions between bacteria and no-slip solid surfaces are the main mechanism underlying surface entrapment of bacteria. In this study, we employ a chiral two-body model to simulate bacterial dynamics near the surface. The simulation results show that as bacteria approach the surface, their translational and rotational velocities, as well as their diffusion coefficients, decrease. Under the combination of near-field hydrodynamic interactions and DLVO forces, bacteria reach a stable fixed point in the phase plane and follow circular trajectories at this point. Notably, bacteria with left-handed helical flagella exhibit clockwise circular motion on the surface. During this process, as the stable height increases, the translational velocity parallel to the surface increases while the rotational velocity perpendicular to the surface decreases, collectively increasing the radius of curvature. Ultimately, our findings demonstrate that near-field hydrodynamic interactions significantly prolong the surface residence time of bacteria. Additionally, smaller stable heights further amplify this effect, resulting in longer residence times and enhanced surface entrapment.</description>

      <title>Adhesion Control through Electric Field-Induced Water Adsorption at Oxidized Silicon Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adhesion plays a pivotal role in computer chip manufacturing, directly affecting the precision and durability of positioning components such as wafer stages. Electrical biasing is widely employed to eliminate floating potential and to enable electrostatic clamping. However, upon electrical grounding adhesion can persist and there is limited knowledge about the nature of this adhesion hysteresis. Here, we investigate potential causes underlying electric field-induced adhesion hysteresis at the interface between an n-type AFM tip and a p-type silicon sample using atomic force microscopy. Our findings reveal that neither charge trapping nor siloxane bond formation significantly impacts the measured adhesion. Surprisingly, we show that adhesion can be tuned through electric field-induced water adsorption under low relative humidity (RH &lt; 10%). Our results provide new insights into adhesion hysteresis and opportunities for adhesion control.</description>

      <title>How Machine Learning Predicts Fluid Densities under Nanoconfinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluids under nanoscale confinement differ -- and often dramatically -- from their bulk counterparts. A notorious feature of nanoconfined fluids is their inhomogeneous density profile along the confining dimension, which plays a key role in many fluid structural and transport phenomena in nanopores. Nearly five decades of theoretical efforts on predicting this phenomenon (fluid layering) have shown that its complexity resists purely analytical treatments; as a consequence, nearly all current approaches make extensive use of molecular simulations, and tend not to have generalizable predictive capabilities. In this work, we demonstrate that machine-learning-based models (in particular, a random forest model), trained upon large molecular simulation data sets, can serve as reliable surrogates in lieu of further molecular simulation. We show that this random forest model has excellent interpolative capabilities over a wide range of temperatures and confining lengthscales, and even has modest extrapolative ability. These results provide a promising pathway forward for developing models of nanoconfined fluid properties that are generalizable, lower cost than ``pure" molecular simulation, and sufficiently predictive for fluids-in-nanopores practitioners.}</description>

      <title>Amorphous $CaSO_{4}$ nanocrystal deposits for friction and wear reduction at silicon interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When an object is placed on a surface, friction and wear cause uncertainty in its exact position, and thus challenge precision manufacturing. Here, we explore the development of a sacrificial nanocrystal deposit that can suppress friction and wear. Amorphous \ce{CaSO4} nancrystals are deposited through salt solution droplet deposition followed by evaporation. During droplet drying, a precursor film of the aqueous \ce{CaSO4} solution spreads onto a hydrophilic silicon wafer, thus nucleating evenly spread unfaceted amorphous nanocrystals of \ce{CaSO4} on the wafer surface. We used atomic force microscopy to study the extent, topography, and friction and wear behavior of the deposited nanocrystals. We find that the sacrificial layer of nanocrystals is easy to apply and remove, spreads over large (few cm) areas with a constant thickness of about 8 nm, and has favorable friction and wear behavior.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic instabilities in driven chiral suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active Stokesian suspensions are conventionally understood to generate dipolar stresses that destabilize aligned states in the bulk and drive system-wide spatiotemporally chaotic flows. Here, we report dynamics in suspensions of torque-driven spinning chiral particles that exhibit a distinct and previously unrecognized route to collective dynamics. Using a mean-field kinetic theory, stability analysis, and nonlinear simulations, we demonstrate how flows driven by torque monopoles and self-propulsion resulting from microscopic chirality drive chaotic flows in three dimensions. Unlike the well-known alignment instability of dipolar active matter, the present dynamics is intrinsically tied to self-propulsion and relies on the emergent coupling between nematic and polar order. Our results establish a novel route to pattern formation, suggest strategies for designing torque-driven active suspensions, and provide a mechanistic framework to probe the rheology of chiral fluids.</description>

      <title>Physical Embodiment Enables Information Processing Beyond Explicit Sensing in Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Living microorganisms have evolved dedicated sensory machinery to detect environmental perturbations, processing these signals through biochemical networks to guide behavior. Replicating such capabilities in synthetic active matter remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we demonstrate that synthetic active particles can adapt to hidden hydrodynamic perturbations through physical embodiment alone, without explicit sensing mechanisms. Using reinforcement learning to control self-thermophoretic particles, we show that they learn navigation strategies to counteract unobserved flow fields by exploiting information encoded in their physical dynamics. Remarkably, particles successfully navigate perturbations that are not included in their state inputs, revealing that embodied dynamics can serve as an implicit sensing mechanism. This discovery establishes physical embodiment as a computational resource for information processing in active matter, with implications for autonomous microrobotic systems and bio-inspired computation.</description>

      <title>Driving a stimuli-responsive wedge in the packing of phospholipid membranes using bolaamphiphile intercalants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bolaamphiphilesamphiphilic molecules with polar groups at each of the two ends of a hydrophobic tail with pH-sensitive spontaneous molecular curvaturesendow membranes of extremophiles with an exquisite balance between stability (or robustness) and adaptability (or plasticity). But how the presence (or real-time insertion) of bolaamphiphiles influences lamellar lipid membranes is poorly understood. Using a combination of time-resolved confocal fluorescence microscopy, in situ small angle X-ray and neutron scattering (SAXS, SANS), and neutron spin echo (NSE) measurements, we monitor here the pH-dependent interactions of nanoscopic vesicles of a representative bolaamphiphilea glucolipid consisting of a single glucose headgroup and a C18:1 (oleyl) fatty acid tail (G-C18:1)with the membranes of an essentially cylindrical, fluid-phase phospholipid (dioleoylphosphatidylcholine, DOPC). We find that the two mesophases interact spontaneously at all pH values, producing large-scale morphological remodeling. Under neutral and acidic conditions, when the bolaamphiphile assumes a cylindrical shape, vesicles fuse with one another, producing invaginations, inner tubulation and vesicle-in-vesicle aggregates. Under basic pH, by contrast, when the carboxylic acid is deprotonated and the molecule is inverted-conical in shape, the bolaamphiphile causes phospholipid membranes to undergo poration, budding, and vesiculation. This pH-dependent, environmentally sensitive membrane remodeling without the disruption of the essential bilayer motif illustrates how local, molecular-level packing perturbations can translate into global system-level morphological changes, enabling membranes to acquire environmental sensitivity and real-time adaptability. These results support the notion that molecular fluxeswhich add (or remove) amphiphilic molecules to biological membranescan endow de novo functionalities (e.g., pH sensitivity) and influence global morphologies of cell-sized vesicles.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spring network model constitutes the backbone in the representations of a host of physical systems. In this work, we report the disturbance-driven microscopic dynamics of an isolated, closed spring network of spherical topology in mechanical equilibrium. The system permits self-intersection. We first show the lowest-energy configurations of the closed spring networks as packings of regular triangles. The dynamics of the disturbed spring network is analyzed from the multiple perspectives of energetics, structural instability, and speed distribution. We reveal the crumpling transition of strongly disturbed spring networks and the rapid convergence of the speed distribution toward the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. This work demonstrates the rich physics arising from the interplay of flexibility and dynamics. The results may yield insights into the shape fluctuation and structural instability of deformable membranes from the dynamical perspective.</description>

      <title>Cellular Flow Architecture Exposes the Hidden Mechanics of Biological Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how biomechanical reorganization governs key biological processes, such as morphogenesis and development, requires predictive insights into stress distributions and cellular behavior. While traditional approaches focused on cell motion as a response to stress, we demonstrate that Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs) -- robust attractors and repellers in cellular flows -- precede and drive long-term intercellular stress reorganization, physically governed by the mechanical properties of intercellular junctions. We show that this hidden flow skeleton correlates strongly with biomechanical metrics, bridging microscopic cell motion with mesoscopic biomechanics. Specifically, attractors and repellers mark hotspots of compressive and tensile stress enrichment (exceeding tenfold), alongside heterogeneities in cell packing. Notably, these connections remain robust across varying strengths of cell-cell and cell-substrate force transmission. Finally, by linking the attracting regions in the flow skeleton to future cell extrusion spots, we establish a direct link between cell motion and biologically significant outcomes. Together, these findings establish a framework for using cell motion to independently infer biomechanical metrics and bridge the scale mismatch between cell motion and biomechanics, potentially offering a new route to interpret mechanosensitive biological processes directly from cell trajectories.</description>

Abstract: We study flows induced in a two-dimensional corner by the chemical activity of the confining boundaries. A catalytic reaction on the surfaces drives the diffusiophoretic flow of viscous fluid in the whole domain. We show that phoretically active sectors can generate eddies in the corner, similar to Moffatt eddies, induced mechanically in a similar confinement. We analyse the exact solution of the diffusion problem in the wedge geometry, coupled to diffusiophoretic flow generation in the slip-velocity formulation, to ultimately arrive at the stream function of the flow. We discuss cases in which simple exact solutions for the flow are available. Our work can inspire the design of microscale mixing devices involving dead-end pores in microfluidic devices and can serve as benchmarks for numerical solutions for complex geometries in (diffusio)phoretic systems.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal topological solitons in active metamaterials</title>

Abstract: From protein motifs to black holes, topological solitons are pervasive nonlinear excitations that are robust and can be driven by external fields. So far, existing driving mechanisms all accelerate solitons and antisolitons in opposite directions. Here we introduce a local driving mechanism for solitons that accelerates both solitons and antisolitons in the same direction instead: non-reciprocal driving. To realize this mechanism, we construct an active mechanical metamaterial consisting of non-reciprocally coupled oscillators subject to a bistable potential. We find that such nonlinearity coaxes non-reciprocal excitations - so-called non-Hermitian skin waves, which are typically unstable - into robust oneway (anti)solitons. We harness such non-reciprocal topological solitons by constructing an active waveguide capable of transmitting and filtering unidirectional information. Finally, we illustrate this mechanism in another class of metamaterials that displays the breaking of 'supersymmetry' causing only antisolitons to be driven. Our observations and models demonstrate a subtle interplay between non-reciprocity and topological solitons, whereby solitons create their own driving force by locally straining the material. Beyond the scope of our study, non-reciprocal solitons might provide an efficient driving mechanism for robotic locomotion and could emerge in other settings, e.g. quantum mechanics, optics and soft matter.</description>

Abstract: Breathing solitons consist of a fast beating wave within a compact envelope of stable shape and velocity. They can propagate and carry information and energy in a variety of contexts such as plasmas, optical fibers and cold atoms, but propagating breathers have remained elusive when energy conservation is broken. Here, we report on the observation of breathing, unidirectional, arbitrarily long-lived solitons in non-reciprocal, non-conservative active metamaterials. Combining precision desktop experiments, numerical simulations and perturbation theory on generalizations of the sine-Gordon and nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations, we demonstrate that unidirectional breathers generically emerge in weakly nonlinear non-reciprocal materials, and that their dynamics are governed by an unstable fixed point. Crucially, breathing solitons can persist for arbitrarily long times provided: (i) this fixed point displays a bifurcation when a delicate balance between energy injection and dissipation is struck; (ii) the initial conditions allow the dynamics to reach this bifurcation point. Importantly, discrete effects tend to stabilize these non-reciprocal breathers over a wider range of initial conditions. Our work establishes non-reciprocity as a promising avenue to generate stable nonlinear unidirectional waves, and could be generalized beyond metamaterials to optics, soft matter and superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal patterns in Growing Bacterial Suspensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The field of active matter explores the behaviors of self propelled agents out of equilibrium, with active suspensions, such as swimming bacteria in solutions, serving as impactful models. These systems exhibit spatio-temporal patterns akin to active turbulence, driven by internal energy injection. While bacterial turbulence in dense suspensions is well studied, the dynamics in growing bacterial suspensions are less understood. This work presents a phenomenological coarse-grained model for growing bacterial suspensions, incorporating hydrodynamic equations for bacterial density, orientation, and fluid velocity, with birth and death terms for colony growth. Starting with low density and random orientations, the model shows the development of local ordering as bacterial density increases. As density continues to rise, the model captures four distinct phases; dilute, clustered, turbulent, and trapped based on structural patterns and dynamics, with the turbulent phase characterized by spatio-temporal vortex structures, aligning with observations in dense bacterial suspensions.</description>

      <title>Architecting mechanisms of damage in topological metamaterials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17100v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Architecting mechanisms of damage in metamaterials by leveraging lattice topology and geometry poses a vital yet complex challenge, essential for engineering desirable mechanical responses. Of these metamaterials, Maxwell lattices, which are on the verge of mechanical stability, offer significant potential for advanced functionality. By leveraging their robust topological features, they enable precise control of effective elastic properties, manipulation of stress localisation and delocalisation across specific domains, and targeted global damage that follows local fracture events. In this work, we identify topology and geometry-dependent parameters that establish a simple, yet precise, framework for designing the behaviour of non-idealised Maxwell lattices and their damage processes. We numerically explore the underlying phenomenology to demonstrate how this framework can guide or arrest damage in lattices, both with and without domain walls and additional boundary constraints. Our approach uncovers a robust way to manipulate the mechanisms of damage and the path they follow in metamaterials, with further insight into crack arrest, diversion, and shielding.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised classification of disordered patterns in an oppositely charged colloidal system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an unsupervised machine learning approach to classify disordered phases in a system of oppositely charged colloids. In this system, the interplay between Coulomb and van der Waals interactions leads to transitions in local structures, while the global structure remains disordered. Our method involves representing the local structures of the system as high-dimensional vectors and applying principal component analysis to identify distinct features of each phase. We demonstrate that our method results in a reasonable classification of disordered phases, which is consistent with that obtained from radial distribution functions. The interpretability of the method reveals the key characteristics of each phase and provides valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying the unconventional phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Effects of particle angularity on granular self-organization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies of two-dimensional poly-disperse disc systems revealed a coordinated self-organisation of cell stresses and shapes, with certain distributions collapsing onto a master form for many processes, size distributions, friction coefficients, and cell orders. Here we examine the effects of grain angularity on the indicators of self-organisation, using simulations of bi-disperse regular $N$-polygons and varying $N$ systematically. We find that: the strong correlation between local cell stresses and orientations, as well as the collapses of the conditional distributions of scaled cell stress ratios to a master Weibull form for all cell orders $k$, are independent of angularity and friction coefficient. In contrast, increasing angularity makes the collapses of the conditional distributions sensitive to changes in the friction coefficient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10593v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topology is an important determinant of the behavior of a great number of condensed-matter systems, but until recently has played a minor role in elasticity. We develop a theory for the deformations of a class of twisted non-Euclidean sheets which have a symmetry based on the celebrated Bonnet isometry. We show that non-orientability is an obstruction to realizing the symmetry globally, and induces a geometric phase that captures a memory analogous to a previously identified one in 2D metamaterials. However, we show that orientable ribbons can also obstruct realizing the symmetry globally. This new obstruction is mediated by how the unit normal vector winds around the centerline of the ribbon, and provides conditions for constructing soft modes of deformation compatible with the topology of multiply-twisted connected ribbons.</description>

      <title>Giant mobility of surface-trapped ionic charges following liquid tribocharging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sliding motion of aqueous droplets on hydrohobic surfaces leads to charge separation at the trailing edge, with implications from triple-line friction to hydrovoltaic energy generation. Charges deposited on the solid surface have been attributed to ions or electrons ripped off from the liquid drop. However, the dynamics and exact physicochemical nature of these surface-trapped charges remains poorly explored. Here, we take advantage of a scanning-based electrostatic mapping technique, to directly quantify the spatiotemporal dynamics of surface deposited charges in the wake of droplets sliding on hydrophobic surfaces. We confirm the ionic nature of these interfacially trapped charges, and evidence that they undergo very fast bidimensional diffusive transport, gliding with low friction at the solid/gas interface. We interpret our observations in the framework of molecular dynamics simulation of hydrated ions adsorbed on solid surfaces, revealing a peculiar transport mechanism limited by purely interfacial friction of the ionic solvation shell with the solid surface. By uncovering the unexpected dynamics of these ionic puddles - a distinct state of interfacial ionic matter - our findings have general implications for molecular-scale ionic transport, electrified matter and wetting dynamics at interfaces.</description>

      <title>Structure-Dynamics Correlation and Its Link to Fragility and Dynamic Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12773v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the connection between structure, dynamics, and fragility, the rate at which the relaxation time grows with decreasing temperature, is central to unravelling the glass transition. Fragility is often associated with dynamic heterogeneity, implying that if structure influences dynamics, more fragile systems should exhibit stronger structure dynamics correlations. In this study, we test the generality of this assumption using: Lennard Jones (LJ) and Weeks Chandler Andersen (WCA) systems, where fragility is tuned via density, and a modified LJ (q,p) system, where fragility is varied by changing the potential softness. We define a structural order parameter based on a mean field caging potential and analyse energy barriers at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. While the macroscopic free energy barrier slope correlates with fragility, the microscopic free energy barrier does not show a consistent trend. Instead, it exhibits a strong correlation with a structure dynamics correlation measure obtained from isoconfigurational ensemble simulations. Interestingly, the two systems showing the highest structure dynamics correlation, LJ at rho = 1.1 and the (8,5) model, are respectively the least and most fragile within their classes. These systems exhibit broad mobility distributions, large non Gaussian parameters, yet low four point susceptibilities, suggesting a decoupling between spatial correlation length and mobility contrast. Both systems lie in the enthalpy dominated regime and are close to the spinodal, pointing to mechanical instability as a source of heterogeneity. Our results reveal that structure dynamics correlation is more closely linked to the contrast in individual particle mobility than to the spatial extent of dynamic correlations that typically scale with fragility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The simulated self-assembly of molecular building blocks into functional complexes is a key area of study in computational biology and materials science. Self-assembly simulations of proteins, driven by short-range non-polar interactions, can find the biologically correct assembly as the energy minimizing state. Short-ranged potentials produce rugged energy landscapes however, which lead to simulations becoming trapped in non-functional, local minimizers.
  Successful self-assembly simulations depend both on the physical realism of the driving potentials as well as their ability to efficiently explore the configuration space.
  We introduce a long-range topological potential, quantified via weighted total persistence, and combine it with the morphometric approach to solvation-free energy. This combination improves the assembly success rate in simulations of the tobacco mosaic virus dimer and other protein complexes by up to sixteen-fold compared with the morphometric model alone. It further enables successful simulation in systems that don't otherwise assemble during the examined timescales.
  Compared to previous topology-based work, which has been primarily descriptive, our approach uses topological measures as an active energetic bias that is independent of electrostatics or chemical specificity and depends only on atomic coordinates. Therefore the method can, in principle, be applied to arbitrary systems where such coordinates are optimized. Integrating topological descriptions into an energy function offers a general strategy for overcoming kinetic barriers in molecular simulations, with potential applications in drug design, materials development, and the study of complex self-assembly processes.</description>

      <title>Kinetic roughening transition of ice crystals and its implications during recrystallization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypothesis Roughening transitions at solid-liquid interfaces govern crystal morphology in diverse systems. In ice crystallization, these transitions control interfacial faceting and surface kinetics. Faceted morphologies are often associated with ice-active molecules, which inhibit recrystallization and are essential for cryopreservation. We hypothesize that kinetic roughening transitions can induce faceting even in the absence of ice-active agents, particularly at high solute concentrations with depressed melting points, potentially complicating the interpretation of crystal morphology as an indicator of ice activity.
  Experiments We investigated the kinetic roughening transition of ice in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and proline-water solutions using cryomicroscopy and real-time image analysis. Crystals grew in microdroplets, maintaining near-equilibrium conditions as solute concentration increased during growth due to conversion of liquid water to ice. Antifreeze protein type III (AFPIII) was applied to distinguish intrinsic roughening from adsorption-mediated effects.
  Findings A distinct kinetic roughening transition temperature (TR = -16.0 +/- 0.2 oC) was identified, marking a shift from rounded disks at higher temperatures to faceted hexagonal plates at lower temperatures, independent of solute type. Recrystallization below TR revealed asymmetry between growth and melting interfaces. AFPIII promoted faceting even above TR, consistent with stabilization of step edges and elevation of the roughening transition temperature. These results clarify the interplay between intrinsic interface kinetics and molecular adsorption, with implications for interpreting ice morphology, surface roughening, and cryopreservation design.</description>

      <title>Translation Groups for arbitrary Gauge Fields in Synthetic Crystals with real hopping amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Cayley-crystals introduced in [F. R. Lux and E. Prodan, Annales Henri Poincar\'e 25(8), 3563 (2024)] are a class of lattices endowed with a Hamiltonian whose translation group $G$ is generic and possibly non-commutative. We show that these systems naturally realize the generalization of the so-called magnetic translation groups to arbitrary discrete gauge groups. A one-body dynamics emulates that of a particle carrying a superposition of charges, each coupled to distinct static gauge-field configuration. The possible types of gauge fields are determined by the irreducible representations of the commutator subgroup $C \subset G$, while the Wilson-loop configurations - which need not be homogeneous - are fixed by the embedding of $C$ in $G$. The role of other subgroups in shaping both the lattice geometry and the dynamics is analyze in depth assuming $C$ finite. We discuss a theorem of direct engineering relevance that, for any cyclic gauge group, yields all compatible translation groups. We then construct two-dimensional examples of Cayley-crystals equivalent to square lattices threaded by inhomogeneous magnetic fluxes. Importantly, Cayley-crystals can be realized with only real hopping amplitudes and in scalable geometries that can fit higher-than-3D dynamics, enabling experimental exploration and eventual exploitation in metamaterials, cQED, and other synthetic platforms.</description>
