      <title>Superior Polymeric Gas Separation Membrane Designed by Explainable Graph Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gas separation using polymer membranes promises to dramatically drive down the energy, carbon, and water intensity of traditional thermally driven separation, but developing the membrane materials is challenging. Here, we demonstrate a novel graph machine learning (ML) strategy to guide the experimental discovery of synthesizable polymer membranes with performances simultaneously exceeding the empirical upper bounds in multiple industrially important gas separation tasks. Two predicted candidates are synthesized and experimentally validated to perform beyond the upper bounds for multiple gas pairs (O2/N2, H2/CH4, and H2/N2). Notably, the O2/N2 separation selectivity is 1.6-6.7 times higher than existing polymer membranes. The molecular origin of the high performance is revealed by combining the inherent interpretability of our ML model, experimental characterization, and molecule-level simulation. Our study presents a unique explainable ML-experiment combination to tackle challenging energy material design problems in general, and the discovered polymers are beneficial for industrial gas separation.</description>

      <title>Farthest Point Sampling in Property Designated Chemical Feature Space as a General Strategy for Enhancing the Machine Learning Model Performance for Small Scale Chemical Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning model development in chemistry and materials science often grapples with the challenge of small scale, unbalanced labelled datasets, a common limitation in scientific experiments. These dataset imbalances can precipitate overfit ting and diminish model generalization. Our study explores the efficacy of the farthest point sampling (FPS) strategy within target ed chemical feature spaces, demonstrating its capacity to generate well-distributed training datasets and consequently enhance model performance. We rigorously evaluated this strategy across various machine learning models, including artificial neural net works (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), and random forests (RF), using datasets encapsulating physicochemical properties like standard boiling points and enthalpy of vaporization. Our findings reveal that FPS-based models consistently surpass those trained via random sampling, exhibiting superior predictive accuracy and robustness, alongside a marked reduction in overfitting. This improvement is particularly pronounced in smaller training datasets, attributable to increased diversity within the training data's chemical feature space. Consequently, FPS emerges as a universally effective and adaptable approach in approaching high performance machine learning models by small and biased experimental datasets prevalent in chemistry and materials science.</description>

      <title>Precise Cosmological Constraints from BOSS Galaxy Clustering with a Simulation-Based Emulator of the Wavelet Scattering Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a reanalysis of the BOSS CMASS DR12 galaxy dataset using a simulation-based emulator for the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) coefficients. Moving beyond our previous works, which laid the foundation for the first galaxy clustering application of this estimator, we construct a neural net-based emulator for the cosmological dependence of the WST coefficients and the 2-point correlation function multipoles, trained from the state-of-the-art suite of \textsc{AbacusSummit} simulations combined with a flexible Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) galaxy model. In order to confirm the accuracy of our pipeline, we subject it to a series of thorough internal and external mock parameter recovery tests, before applying it to reanalyze the CMASS observations in the redshift range $0.46&lt;z&lt;0.57$. We find that a joint WST + 2-point correlation function likelihood analysis allows us to obtain marginalized 1$\sigma$ errors on the $\Lambda$CDM parameters that are tighter by a factor of $2.5-6$, compared to the 2-point correlation function, and by a factor of $1.4-2.5$ compared to the WST-only results. This corresponds to a competitive $0.9\%$, $2.3\%$ and $1\%$ level of determination for parameters $\omega_c$, $\sigma_8$ $\&amp;$ $n_s$, respectively, and also to a $0.7\%$ $\&amp;$ $2.5 \%$ constraint on derived parameters h and $f(z)\sigma_8(z)$, in agreement with the \textit{Planck} 2018 results. Our results reaffirm the constraining power of the WST and highlight the exciting prospect of employing higher-order statistics in order to fully exploit the power of upcoming Stage-IV spectroscopic observations.</description>

      <title>Detecting local perturbations of networks in a latent hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph theoretical approaches have been proven to be effective in the characterization of connected systems, as well as in quantifying their dysfunction due to perturbation. In this paper, we show the advantage of a non-Euclidean (hyperbolic) representation of networks to identify local connectivity perturbations and to characterize the induced effects on a large scale. We propose two perturbation scores based on representations of the networks in a latent geometric space, obtained through an embedding onto the hyperbolic Poincar\'e disk. We numerically demonstrate that these methods are able to localize perturbations in networks with homogeneous or heterogeneous degree connectivity. We apply this framework to identify the most perturbed brain areas in epileptic patients following surgery. This study is conceived in the effort of developing more powerful tools to represent and analyze brain networks, and it is the first to apply geometric network embedding techniques to the case of epilepsy.</description>
