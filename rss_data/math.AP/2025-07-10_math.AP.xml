      <title>Energetic Derivation and Geometric Reduction of Reaction-Diffusion Systems with Holling-Type Functional Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an energetic derivation of a class of multi-species reaction-diffusion systems incorporating various functional responses, with a focus on and application to ecological models. Starting point is a closed reaction network for which we apply the Energetic Variational Approach (EnVarA) to derive the corresponding reaction-diffusion system. This framework captures both diffusion and nonlinear reaction kinetics, and recovers Lotka-Volterra-type dynamics with species-dependent interactions. Moreover, we find an open subsystem embedded into the larger closed system, that contains the physical and ecological important quantities. By analyzing different asymptotic regimes in the reaction parameters of the resulting system, we formally derive classical Holling type I, II, and III functional responses. To rigorously justify these reductions and their dynamical properties, we apply the generalized geometric singular perturbation theory (GSPT) for PDEs and prove the existence of an attracting and invariant slow manifolds near the critical manifold of the reduced system. Our analysis not only bridges thermodynamic consistency with ecological modeling but also provides a robust framework to study the dynamics of slow manifolds in multi-scale reaction-diffusion systems.</description>

      <title>Three solutions for a double phase variable exponent Kirchhoff problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study a double phase variable exponent Kirchhoff problem. We employ a well-known critical point result by Bonanno and Chinn\`{\i} and show the existence of at least three solutions. We introduce a novel $n$-dimensional vector inequality, Proposition \ref{Prop:2.2}, which is a crucial auxiliary result to obtain the $C^{1}-$regularity of the energy functional.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation Analysis, Modulational Instability and Solitons Solutions for a Coupled Nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Type Equations with Variable Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding, predicting, and controlling physical processes often relies on the analysis of the dynamics of partial differential equations (PDEs). In this context, the present study offers an in-depth investigation into the nonlinear dynamics of a novel coupled nonlinear Schr\"odinger system with variable coefficients. To begin with, the dynamics of traveling-wave solutions is analyzed through bifurcation theory, which uncovers the presence of Jacobi elliptic functions and solitonic structures. Then, a sensitivity analysis is carried out to confirm the numerical relevance and stability of these solutions. However, when subjected to external perturbations, the system exhibits a tendency toward chaotic behavior. Finally, the results point to the emergence of modulational instability under specific configurations of the dispersion and nonlinearity parameters.</description>

      <title>Decay of small energy solutions in the ABCD Boussinesq model under the influence of an uneven bottom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Boussinesq $abcd$ system is a 4-parameter set of equations posed in $\mathbb{R}_t\times\mathbb{R}_x$, originally derived by Bona, Chen and Saut as first order 2-wave approximations of the incompressible and irrotational, two dimensional water wave equations in the shallow water wave regime, in the spirit of the original Boussinesq derivation. Among many particular regimes, depending each of them in terms of the value of the parameters $(a,b,c,d)$ present in the equations, the generic regime is characterized by the setting $b,d&gt;0$ and $a,c&lt;0$. If additionally $b=d$, the $abcd$ system is hamiltonian. Previously, sharp local in space $H^1\times H^1$ decay properties were proved in the case of a large class of $abcd$ model under the small data assumption. In this paper, we generalize [C. Kwak, et. al., The scattering problem for Hamiltonian ABCD Boussinesq systems in the energy space. J. Math. Pures Appl. (9) 127 (2019), 121--159] by considering the small data $abcd$ decay problem in the physically relevant variable bottom regime described by M. Chen. The nontrivial bathymetry is represented by a smooth space-time dependent function $h=h(t,x)$, which obeys integrability in time and smallness in space. We prove first the existence of small global solutions in $H^1\times H^1$. Then, for a sharp set of dispersive $abcd$ systems (characterized only in terms of parameters $a, b$ and $c$), all $H^1\times H^1$ small solutions must decay to zero in proper subset of the light cone $|x|\leq |t|$.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Reaction-Diffusion Predator-Prey System under Random Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the long-term dynamics of a reaction-diffusion predator-prey system subject to random environmental fluctuations modeled by Markovian switching. The model is formulated as a hybrid system of partial differential equations (PDEs), where the switching between different ecological regimes captures the randomness in environmental conditions. We derive a critical threshold parameter that determines whether the predator species will eventually go extinct or persist. We further characterize the system's asymptotic behavior by providing a detailed pathwise description of the omega-limit set of solutions. This analysis reveals how the effects of random switching shape the distribution and long-term coexistence of the species. Numerical simulations are provided to validate and illustrate the theoretical findings, highlighting transitions between different dynamical regimes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that rigorously analyzes a spatially diffusive predator-prey model under Markovian switching, thereby bridging the gap between spatial ecology and stochastic hybrid PDE systems.</description>

      <title>On the Gromov--Hausdorff stability of metric viscosity solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the stability of metric viscosity solutions to first-order Hamilton--Jacobi equations under Gromov--Hausdorff convergence. Our proof combines a characterization of metric viscosity solutions via quadratic distance functions with a doubling variable method adapted to epsilon-isometries, which allows us to pass to the Gromov--Hausdorff limit without embedding the spaces into a common ambient space. As a byproduct, we give a PDE-based proof of the stability of the dual Kantorovich problems under measured-Gromov--Hausdorff convergence.</description>

      <title>On the solution operators arising from the gas-liquid two-phase problem in unbounded domains with finite depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies some evolution equations arising from the sharp interface problem of the compressible-incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in unbounded domains in $\mathbb{R}^N (N\geq2)$, where the viscous gases initially occupy the upper half space and the viscous liquids below initially lie in the strip-like domain. In order to establish the maximal $L_p$-$L_q$ regularity estimates of the evolution problem, we construct the R-solver of the resolvent problem associated to the gas-liquid two-phase operator. The crucial part of our proof lies in the analysis of the explicit resolvent operators defined in the unbounded domains with flat boundaries.</description>

      <title>Unique and Stable Recovery of Space-Variable Order in Multidimensional Subdiffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the unique identifiability and stable recovery of a spatially dependent variable-order in the subdiffusion model from the boundary flux measurement. We establish several new unique identifiability results from the observation at one point on the boundary without / with the knowledge of medium properties, and a conditional Lipschitz stability when the observation is available on the whole boundary. The analysis crucially employs resolvent estimates in $L^r(\Omega)$, $r&gt;2$, spaces, solution representation in the Laplace domain and novel asymptotic expansions of the Laplace transform of the boundary flux at $p= 0$ and $p=1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article deals with the inverse problem of determining the unbounded real-valued electric potential of the Robin Laplacian on a bounded domain of dimension 3 or greater, by incomplete knowledge of its boundary spectral data. Namely, the main result establishes that the unknown potential can be H\"older stably retrieved from the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues and the sequence of the boundary measurements of the corresponding eigenfunctions where finitely many terms are missing.</description>

      <title>Difference estimate for weak solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations in a thin spherical shell and on the unit sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Navier-Stokes equations in a three-dimensional thin spherical shell and on the two-dimensional unit sphere, and estimate the difference of weak solutions on the thin spherical shell and the unit sphere. Assuming that the weak solution on the thin spherical shell is a Leray-Hopf weak solution satisfying the energy inequality, we derive difference estimates for the two weak solutions by the weak-strong uniqueness argument. The main idea is to extend the weak solution on the unit sphere properly to an approximate solution on the thin spherical shell, and to use the extension as a strong solution in the weak-strong uniqueness argument.</description>

      <title>Inverse problem for the abstract diffusion-wave equation with Caputo fractional derivative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the inverse problem of determining a potential coefficient in an abstract wave equation that includes a lower-order term. The equation incorporates a time-fractional derivative in the Caputo sense, as well as a fractional power of an abstract operator defined on a Hilbert space. Using the Fourier decomposition method, we analyze the solvability of the direct problem. Leveraging the properties of the solution to the direct problem, we conduct an examination of the inverse problem. By applying the fixed point theorem within a suitable Banach space, we derive results concerning the local existence, uniqueness, and stability of the solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider the 3D-rotating magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) system when the initial velocity and magnetic field both feature some 2D-part (i.-e. depending only on the horizontal space variables).  We prove for weak and strong solutions, that the limit system, when the Rossby number goes to zero (i.-e. for strong rotation), is a 2D-MHD system with three components. Moreover we are able to provide explicit global-in-time convergence rates thanks to adapted Strichartz estimates and with the help of an additional 3D magnetic field transported by the 2D limit velocity.</description>

      <title>Qualitative properties of solutions to parabolic anisotropic equations: Part I -- Expansion of positivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove expansion of positivity and reduction of the oscillation results to the local weak solutions to a doubly nonlinear anisotropic class of parabolic differential equations with bounded and measurable coefficients, whose prototype is \begin{equation*} u_t-\sum\limits_{i=1}^N \left( u^{(m_i-1)(p_i-1)} \ |u_{x_i}|^{p_i-2} \ u_{x_i} \right)_{x_i}=0 , \end{equation*} for a restricted range of $p_i$s and $m_i$s, that reflects their competition for the diffusion. The positivity expansion relies on an exponential shift and is presented separately for singular and degenerate cases. Finally we present a study of the local oscillation of the solution for some specific ranges of exponents, within the singular and degenerate cases.</description>

      <title>An optimal fractional Hardy inequality on the discrete half-line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of Hardy inequalities for the fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta_{\mathbb{N}})^{\sigma}$ on the discrete half-line $\mathbb{N}$, we provide an optimal Hardy-weight $W^{\mathrm{op}}_{\sigma}$ for exponents $\sigma\in\left(0,1\right]$. As a consequence, we provide an estimate of the sharp constant in the fractional Hardy inequality with the classical Hardy-weight $n^{-2\sigma}$ on $\mathbb{N}$. It turns out that for $\sigma =1$ the Hardy-weight $W^{\mathrm{op}}_{1}$ is pointwise larger than the optimal Hardy-weight obtained by Keller--Pinchover--Pogorzelski near infinity. As an application of our main result, we obtain unique continuation results at infinity for the solutions of some fractional Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <title>Classification of bifurcation structure for semilinear elliptic equations in a ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Gelfand problem with Sobolev supercritical nonlinearities $f$ in the unit ball. In the case where $f$ is a power type nonlinearity or the exponential nonlinearity, it is well-known that the bifurcation curve has infinitely many turning points when the growth rate of $f$ is smaller than that of the specific nonlinearity (called the Joseph-Lundgren critical nonlinearity), while the bifurcation curve has no turning point when the growth rate of $f$ is greater than or equal to that of the Joseph-Lundgren critical nonlinearity.
  In this paper, we give a new type of nonlinearity $f$ such that the growth rate is greater than or equal to that of the Joseph-Lundgren critical nonlinearity, while the bifurcation curve has infinitely many turning points. This result shows that the bifurcation structure is not determined solely by the comparison between the growth rate of $f$ and that of the Joseph-Lundgren critical nonlinearity. In fact, we find a general criterion which determines the bifurcation structure; and give a classification of the bifurcation structure.</description>

      <title>On surface energies in scaling laws for singular perturbation problems for martensitic phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of this article is to compare different surface energies for multi-well singular perturbation problems associated with martensitic phase transformations involving higher order laminates. We deduce scaling laws in the singular perturbation parameter which are robust in the choice of the surface energy (e.g., diffuse, sharp, an interpolation thereof or discrete). Furthermore, we show that these scaling laws do not require the presence of isotropic surface energies but that generically also highly anisotropic surface energies yield the same scaling results. More precisely, the presence of essentially generic partial directional derivatives in the regularization terms suffices to produce the same scaling behaviour as in the isotropic setting. The only sensitive directional dependences are directly linked to the lamination directions of the well structure -- and even for these only the ``inner-most'' lamination direction is of significance in determining the scaling law. In view of experimental applications, this shows that also for higher-order laminates, the precise structure of the surface energies -- which is often very difficult to determine experimentally -- does not have a crucial impact on the scaling behaviour of the investigated structures but only enters when considering finer properties.</description>

      <title>Renormalised Models for Variable Coefficient Singular SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we prove convergence of renormalised models in the framework of regularity structures [Hai14] for a wide class of variable coefficient singular SPDEs in their full subcritical regimes. In particular, we provide for the first time an extension of the main results of [CH16, HS24, BH23] beyond the translation invariant setting. In the non-translation invariant setting, it is necessary to introduce renormalisation functions rather than renormalisation constants. We show that under a very general assumption, which we prove covers the case of second order parabolic operators, these renormalisation functions can be chosen to be local in the sense that their space-time dependence enters only through a finite order jet of the coefficient field of the differential operator at the given space-time point. Furthermore we show that the models we construct depend continuously on the coefficient field.</description>

Abstract: We obtain improved remainder estimates in the Kuznecov sum formula for period integrals of Laplace eigenfunctions on a Riemannian manifold $M$. Building upon the two-term asymptotic expansion established in [arXiv:2204.13525], we prove that for a Baire-generic class of metrics, the oscillatory second term in the Kuznecov formula can be eliminated, yielding an improved remainder estimate.</description>

      <title>Free-surface Euler equations with density variations, and shallow-water limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the well-posedness in Sobolev spaces of the incompressible Euler equations in an infinite strip delimited from below by a non-flat bottom and from above by a free-surface. We allow the presence of vorticity and density variations, and in these regards the present system is an extension of the well-studied water waves equations. When the bottom is flat and with no density variations (but when the flow is not necessarily irrotational), our study provides an alternative proof of the already known large-time well-posedness results for the water waves equations. Our main contribution is that we allow for the presence of density variations, while also keeping track of the dependency in the shallow water parameter. This allows us to justify the convergence from the free-surface Euler equations towards the non-linear shallow water equations in this setting. Using an already established large time existence result for these latter equations, we also prove the existence of the free-surface Euler equations on a logarithmic time-scale, in a suitable regime.</description>

      <title>Long-Time Existence of Quasilinear Wave Equations Exterior to Star-shaped Obstacle in $2\mathbf{D}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the long-time existence result for small data solutions of quasilinear wave equations exterior to star-shaped regions in two space dimensions. The key novelty is that we establish a Morawetz type energy estimate for the perturbed inhomogeneous wave equation in the exterior domain, which yields $t^{-\frac12}$ decay inside the cone. In addition, two new weighted $L^2$ product estimates are established to produce $t^{-\frac12}$ decay close to the cone. We then show that the existence lifespan $T_\e$ for the quasilinear wave equations with general quadratic nonlinearity satisfies \begin{equation*} \varepsilon^2T_{\varepsilon}\ln^3T_{\varepsilon}=A, \end{equation*} for some fixed positive constant $A$, which is almost sharp (with some logarithmic loss) comparing to the known result of the corresponding Cauchy problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address extremum problems for spectral quantities associated with operators of the form $\Delta^2-\tau\Delta$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions, for non-negative values of $\tau$. The focus is on two shape optimisation problems: minimising the first eigenvalue; and maximising the torsional rigidity, both under volume constraint. We establish, on the one hand, a Szeg\H{o}-type inequality, that is, we show that among all domains having a first eigenfunction of fixed sign the ball minimises the corresponding first eigenvalue; on the other hand a Saint--Venant-type inequality, namely, a sharp upper bound on the torsional rigidity, again achieved by the ball. We further present other properties related to these operators and express the optimality condition associated with the minimisation of the first eigenvalue.</description>

Abstract: By leveraging a new Laplacian comparison theorem, we derive a Li-Yau type gradient estimate for a particular nonlinear parabolic equation, namely, the Finslerian logarithmic Schrodinger equation on a non-compact, complete Finsler manifold with mixed weighted Ricci curvature bounded from below. In our framework, all coefficients are time-dependent functions defined on the manifold. As applications, we establish both a Harnack inequality and an a priori estimate for the positive solutions of this specific equation</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct an explicit family of stable proper weak biharmonic maps from the unit ball $B^m$, $m\geq 5$, to Euclidean spheres. To the best of the authors knowledge this is the first example of a stable proper weak biharmonic map from at compact domain. To achieve our result we first establish the second variation formula of the bienergy for maps from the unit ball into a Euclidean sphere. Employing this result, we examine the stability of the proper weak biharmonic maps $q:B^m\to\mathbb{S}^{m^{\ell}}$, $m,\ell\in\mathbb{N}$ with $\ell\leq m$, which we recently constructed in \cite{BS25} and thus deduce the existence of an explicit family of stable proper biharmonic maps to Euclidean spheres.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral Barron spaces, constituting a specialized class of function spaces that serve as an interdisciplinary bridge between mathematical analysis, partial differential equations (PDEs), and machine learning, are distinguished by the decay profiles of their Fourier transform. In this work, we shift from conventional numerical approximation frameworks to explore advanced functional analysis and PDE theoretic perspectives within these spaces. Specifically, we present a rigorous characterization of the dual space structure of spectral Barron spaces, alongside continuous embedding in H\"older spaces established through real interpolation theory. Furthermore, we investigate applications to boundary value problems governed by the Schr\"odinger equation, including spectral analysis of associated linear operators. These contributions elucidate the analytical foundations of spectral Barron spaces while underscoring their potential to unify approximation theory, functional analysis, and machine learning.</description>

Abstract: We prove a splitting theorem for globally hyperbolic, weighted spacetimes with metrics and weights of regularity $C^1$ by combining elliptic techniques for the negative homogeneity $p$-d'Alembert operator from our recent work in the smooth setting with the concept of line-adapted curves introduced here. Our results extend the Lorentzian splitting theorem proved for smooth globally hyperbolic spacetimes by Galloway -- and variants of its weighted counterparts by Case and Woolgar--Wylie -- to this low regularity setting.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a parabolic analogue of the elliptic split-type Monge-Amp\`ere equation developed by Fang and the author, extending Streets' twisted Monge-Amp\`ere equation. The resulting equation is fully nonlinear and non-concave. We prove long-time existence for equations whose exponents are not too far apart and give conditions for convergence to the twisted Monge-Amp\`ere when the exponents approach each other. Applications include long-time convergence on K\"ahler backgrounds and reduction to the twisted Monge-Amp\`ere equation under curvature assumptions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04105v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the time-asymptotic stability of the Jin-Xin model and its diffusive relaxation limit toward viscous conservation laws in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for $d\geq 1$. First, we establish a priori estimates that are uniform with respect to both the time and the relaxation parameter $\varepsilon&gt;0$, for initial data in hybrid Besov spaces based on $L^{p}$-norms. This uniformity enables us to derive $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$ bounds on the difference between solutions of the viscous conservation law and its associated Jin-Xin approximation, thus justifying the strong convergence of the relaxation process. Furthermore, under an additional condition on the initial data, for instance, that the low frequencies belong to $L^{p/2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$, we show that the $L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^d)$-norm of the solution to the Jin-Xin model decays at the optimal rate $(1+t)^{-d/{2p}}$, and the $L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^d)$-norm of its difference with the solution of the associated viscous conservation law decays at the enhanced rate $\varepsilon(1+t)^{-d/{2p}-1/2}$.</description>

      <title>Long time regularity for 3d gravity waves with vorticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem for the full free boundary Euler equations in $3$d with an initial small velocity of size $O(\epsilon_0)$, in a moving domain which is initially an $O(\epsilon_0)$ perturbation of a flat interface. We assume that the initial vorticity is of size $O(\epsilon_1)$ and prove a regularity result up to times of the order $\epsilon_1^{-1+}$, independent of $\epsilon_0$. A key part of our proof is a normal form type argument for the vorticity equation; this needs to be performed in the full three dimensional domain and is necessary to effectively remove the irrotational components from the quadratic stretching terms and uniformly control the vorticity. Another difficulty is to obtain sharp decay for the irrotational component of the velocity and the interface; to do this we perform a dispersive analysis on the boundary equations, which are forced by a singular contribution from the rotational component of the velocity. As a corollary of our result, when $\epsilon_1$ goes to zero we recover the celebrated global regularity results of Wu (Invent. Math. 2012) and Germain, Masmoudi and Shatah (Ann. of Math. 2013) in the irrotational case.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Gradient Flows of MMD Functionals with Distance Kernel and Cauchy Problems on Quantile Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07498v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a comprehensive description of Wasserstein gradient flows of maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) functionals $\mathcal F_\nu := \text{MMD}_K^2(\cdot, \nu)$ towards given target measures $\nu$ on the real line, where we focus on the negative distance kernel $K(x,y) := -|x-y|$. In one dimension, the Wasserstein-2 space can be isometrically embedded into the cone $\mathcal C(0,1) \subset L_2(0,1)$ of quantile functions leading to a characterization of Wasserstein gradient flows via the solution of an associated Cauchy problem on $L_2(0,1)$. Based on the construction of an appropriate counterpart of $\mathcal F_\nu$ on $L_2(0,1)$ and its subdifferential, we provide a solution of the Cauchy problem. For discrete target measures $\nu$, this results in a piecewise linear solution formula. We prove invariance and smoothing properties of the flow on subsets of $\mathcal C(0,1)$. For certain $\mathcal F_\nu$-flows this implies that initial point measures instantly become absolutely continuous, and stay so over time. Finally, we illustrate the behavior of the flow by various numerical examples using an implicit Euler scheme, which is easily computable by a bisection algorithm. For continuous targets $\nu$, also the explicit Euler scheme can be employed, although with limited convergence guarantees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14779v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a series of regularity results for solutions to a degenerate or singular fully nonlinear integro-differential equation of the form
  $$- \big( \sigma_{1}(|Du|) + a(x) \sigma_{2}(|Du|) \big) \mathcal{I}_{\tau}(u,x) = f(x).$$
  In the degenerate case, we establish borderline regularity, provided the inverse of the degeneracy law $ \sigma_{2}$ is Dini-continuous. In addition, we show Schauder-type higher regularity at local extremum points for a specific non-local degenerate equation. In the singular case, we establish H\"{o}lder continuity of the gradient for solutions to a general non-local equation.
  It is noteworthy that these results are new even in the case $ a(x) \equiv 0 $. Finally, as a byproduct of the borderline regularity analysis, we demonstrate how our methods can be applied to study of the corresponding regularity for a class of degenerate non-local normalized $ p$-Laplacian equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an $\mathcal{M}$-operator approach to establish the uniqueness of continuous or bounded solutions for a broad class of Landau-type nonlinear kinetic equations. The specific $\mathcal{M}$-operator, originally developed in [3], acts as a negative fractional derivative in both spatial and velocity variables and interacts in a controllable manner with the kinetic transport operator. The novelty of this method is that it bypasses the need for bounds on the derivatives of the solution - an assumption typically required in uniqueness arguments for non-cutoff equations. As a result, the method enables working with solutions with low regularity.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Stabilization of Compressible Flows: Global Existence in 3D Inviscid Non-Isentropic MHD Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solutions to the compressible Euler equations in all dimensions have been shown to develop finite-time singularities from smooth initial data such as shocks and cusps. There is an extraordinary list of results on this subject. When the inviscid compressible flow is coupled with the magnetic field in the 3D inviscid non-isentropic compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations in $\mathbb{T}^3$, this paper rules out finite-time blowup and establishes the global existence of smooth and stable solutions near a suitable background magnetic field. This result rigorously confirms the stabilizing phenomenon observed in physical experiments involving electrically conducting fluids.</description>

      <title>Free boundary regularity for a tumor growth model with obstacle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an existence and regularity theory for solutions to a geometric free boundary problem motivated by models of tumor growth. In this setting, the tumor invades an accessible region $D$, its motion is directed along a constant vector $V$, and it cannot penetrate another region $K$ acting as an obstacle to the spread of the tumor. Due to the non variational structure of the problem, we show existence of viscosity solutions via Perron's method. Subsequently, we prove interior regularity for the free boundary near regular points by means of an improvement of flatness argument. We further analyze the boundary regularity and we prove that the free boundary meets the obstacle as a $C^{1,\alpha}$ graph. A key step in the analysis of the boundary regularity involves the study of a thin obstacle problem with oblique boundary conditions, for which we establish $C^{1,\alpha}$ estimates.</description>

      <title>Three bound states with prescribed angular momentum to the cubic-quintic NLS equations in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate bound states with prescribed angular momentum and mass for the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations (NLS) with the cubic-quintic nonlinearity in dimensions three. We demonstrate that there exist three solutions for the double constrained problem: a local minimizer, a mountain pass type solution, and a global minimizer. Moreover, by means of the minimax method, we construct a new mountain pass path and further obtain the geometric link among the three solutions as well as a comparison of their energy levels. This seems to be the first paper concerning three solutions, with the method also being applicable to the single constraint problem.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on a mathematical model for water flow in porous media with competition between transport and diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The contribution deals with the mathematical modelling of fluid flow in porous media, in particular water flow in soils, with the aim of describing the competition between transport and diffusion. The analysis is based on a mathematical model developed by B. Detmann, C. Gavioli, and P. Krej\v{c}\'i, in which the effects of gravity are included in a novel way. The model consists of a nonlinear partial differential equation describing both the diffusion and the gravitational transport of water. Although analytical solutions can be obtained for some special cases, only numerical solutions are available in more general situations. The solving algorithm is based on a time discretisation and the finite element method, and is written in Matlab. The results of the numerical simulations are shown and the behaviour of the model is discussed.</description>

      <title>SDEs with critical general distributional drifts: sharp solvability and blow ups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish weak well-posedness for SDEs having discontinuous diffusion coefficients and general distributional drifts that may introduce blow up effects. Our drifts satisfy minimal assumptions, i.e.\,we assume only that the Cauchy problem for the Kolmogorov backward equation is well-posed in the standard Hilbert triple $W^{1,2} \hookrightarrow L^2 \hookrightarrow W^{-1,2}$. By a result of Mazya and Verbitsky, these assumptions are precisely those drifts that can be represented as the sum of a form-bounded component (encompassing, for example, Morrey or Chang-Wilson-Wolff drifts) and a divergence-free distributional component in the ${\rm BMO}^{-1}$ space of Koch and Tataru.
  We apply our results to finite particle systems with strong attracting interactions immersed in a turbulent flow. This includes particle systems of Keller-Segel type. Crucially, in dimensions $d \geq 3$, we cover almost the entire admissible range of attraction strengths, reaching nearly to the blow-up threshold.
  As a further application of our results for SDEs and of the theory of Bessel processes, we obtain an improved upper bound on the constant in the many-particle Hardy inequality. Consequently, the lower bound previously derived by Hoffmann-Ostenhof, Hoffmann-Ostenhof, Laptev, and Tidblom is shown to be close to optimal.</description>

      <title>One sided orthogonal polynomials and a pointwise convergence result for $SU(2)$-valued nonlinear Fourier series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We elaborate on a connection between the $SU(2)$-valued nonlinear Fourier series and sequences of left and right orthogonal polynomials for complex measures on the unit circle. We show a convergence result for the associated reproducing kernel. This is a universality type result in the vein of Mate-Nevai-Totik, which turns out to be much simpler in the $SU(2)$ case than in the $SU(1,1)$ case. We then relate a.e. pointwise convergence of the product of left and right polynomials and their squares with both behavior of their zeros as well as behavior of some local parameters for these polynomials. We conclude by proving almost everywhere convergence along lacunary sequences of the functional $(a_n ^* +b_n)(a_n - b_n ^*)$ of the partial $SU(2)$-valued nonlinear Fourier series $(a_n, b_n)$ under the assumption that the nonlinear Fourier series $(a,b)$ itself satisfies both $\|b\|_{L^{\infty} (\mathbb{T})} &lt; 2^{- \frac 1 2}$ and $a^*$ is outer.</description>
