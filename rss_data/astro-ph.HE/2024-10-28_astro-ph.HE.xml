      <title>The role of magnetic and rotation axis alignment in driving fast radio burst phenomenology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a model that can describe the entire range of FRBs, from non-repeating to highly prolific repeaters. Coherent radio waves in these bursts are produced in the polar cap region of a magnetar, where magnetic field lines are open. The angle between the rotation and magnetic axes, relative to the angular size of the polar cap region, partially determines the repetition rate and polarization properties of FRBs. We discuss how many of the properties of repeating FRBs - such as their lack of periodicity, energetics, small PA swing, spectro-temporal correlation and inferred low source density are explained by this model. The systematic PA swing and the periodic modulation of long duration bursts from non-repeaters are also natural outcomes. We derive a lower limit of about 400 on the Lorentz factor of FRB sources using this model for bursts with a linear polarization degree greater than 95%.</description>

      <title>Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays from Neutrino-Emitting Tidal Disruption Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Ray (UHECRs) production in Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) in the light of recent neutrino-TDE associations. We use an isotropically emitting source-propagation model, which has been developed to describe the neutrino production in AT2019dsg, AT2019fdr, and AT2019aalc. These TDEs have strong dust echoes in the infrared range, which are potentially linked with the neutrino production. A mechanism where neutrinos originate from cosmic ray scattering on infrared photons implies cosmic rays in the ultra-high energy range, thus suggesting a natural connection with the observed UHECR. We extrapolate the three TDE associations to a population of neutrino- and UHECR-emitting TDEs, and postulate that these TDEs power the UHECRs. We then infer the source composition, population parameters, and local rates that are needed to describe UHECR data. We find that UHECR data point towards a mix of light to mid-heavy injection isotopes, which could be found, e.g., in oxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarfs, and to a contribution of at least two groups of TDEs with different characteristics, dominated by AT2019aalc-type events. The required local TDE rates of ${\mathcal O}(10^2)~\mathrm{Gpc^{-3} \, yr^{-1}}$, however, are more indicative of the disruption of main sequence stars. We propose an enhanced efficiency in the acceleration of heavier nuclei that could address this discrepancy. The predicted diffuse neutrino fluxes suggest a population of astrophysical neutrino sources that can be observed by future radio neutrino detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Particle Acceleration in Collisionless Magnetically Arrested Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first collisionless realization of black hole accretion consistent with a persistent magnetically arrested disk state. The accretion flow, consisting of an ion-electron disk plasma combined with magnetospheric pair creation effects, is simulated using first-principles general-relativistic particle-in-cell methods. The axisymmetric simulation is evolved over significant dynamical timescales during which a quasi-steady accretion state is reached with several magnetic flux eruption cycles. We include a realistic treatment of inverse Compton scattering and pair production, which allows for studying the interaction between the collisionless accretion flow and the pair-loaded jet. Our findings indicate that magnetic flux eruptions associated with equatorial magnetic reconnection within the black hole magnetosphere and the formation of spark gaps are locations of maximal particle acceleration. Flux eruptions, starting near the central black hole, can trigger Kelvin-Helmholtz-like vortices at the jet-disk interface that facilitate efficient mixing between disk and jet plasma. Transient periods of increased pair production following the magnetic flux eruptions and reconnection events are responsible for most of the highly accelerated particles.</description>

      <title>Limiting Rotation Rate of Neutron Stars from Crust Breaking and Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron stars are not observed to spin faster than about half their breakup rate. This limiting rotational frequency may be related to the strength of their crusts. As a star spins up from accretion, centrifugal forces stress the crust. We perform finite-element simulations of rotating neutron stars and find that the crust fails at rotation rates about half the breakup rate. We argue that this crust failure is asymmetric and produces a significant ellipticity (fractional difference in moments of inertia). A rotating star, with this ellipticity, radiates gravitational waves that limit further spin up. These stars may be promising sources for LIGO / VIRGO and next generation gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Observed Gravitational-Wave Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground-based gravitational-wave detectors like the Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo, and KAGRA experiments now regularly witness gravitational waves from compact binary mergers: the relativistic collisions of neutron stars and/or stellar-mass black holes. With hundreds of such events observed to date, gravitational-wave observations are enabling increasingly precise surveys of the demographics of merging compact binaries, including the distributions of their masses, rotation rates, and positions throughout the Universe. This article will provide an overview of our observational knowledge of the compact binary population, as it stands today. I will discuss, in turn, observations of binary black holes, binary neutron stars, and neutron star-black hole mergers, describing what is currently known (or not yet known) about these different gravitational-wave sources. I will highlight emerging classes of binaries that do not fall cleanly into any of these existing categories. And I will conclude by reviewing the methodology by which population analyses of gravitational-wave sources are performed.</description>

      <title>An independent hybrid imaging of Sgr A* from the data in EHT 2017 observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that the ring structure found by the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration (EHTC) as the black hole shadow of Sgr A*is an artifact by the bumpy PSF (Point Spread Function) of the EHT2017. The imaging using sparse u-v data requires detailed scrutiny of the PSF. The estimated shadow diameter (48.7 +- 7 muas) is equal to the spacing between the main beam and the first sidelobe of the PSF (49.09 muas), which immediately suggests a potential problem in the deconvolution of the PSF. We show that the ring image can be derived from non-ring simulated datasets (noise only; point source) with a narrow Field-of-View (FOV) and an assumed self-calibration suggesting the EHT2017's u-v coverage is insufficient for reliable imaging. The EHTC analysis, based on calibrations with assumptions about the source's size and properties, selected the final image by prioritizing appearance rate of the similar structure from a large imaging parameter space over data consistency. Our independent analysis with the conventional hybrid mapping reveals an elongated east-west structure, consistent with previous observations. We believe it to be more reliable than the EHTC image, due to half the residuals in normalized visibility amplitude. The eastern half is brighter, possibly due to a Doppler boost from the rapid rotating disk. We hypothesize our image shows a portion of the accretion disk about 2 to a few Rs away from the black hole, rotating with nearly 60 % of the speed of light viewed from an angle of 40 -45 degrees.</description>

      <title>A rigorous solution to the superluminal issue in the diffusion equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superluminal propagation is an intrinsic problem in the diffusion equation and has not been effectively addressed for a long time. In this work, a rigorous solution to this issue is obtained under the assumption that particles undergo a random flight process, where they move isotropically at a constant speed while experiencing random scatterings. We validate this solution by comparing it with comprehensive simulations of the random flight process and find that it significantly deviates from the solution derived from the J\"{u}ttner propagator. This solution is broadly applicable to various diffusion phenomena, such as cosmic-ray propagation. We emphasize that our rigorous solution is particularly crucial in scenarios involving burst-like particle injection, where previous phenomenological approaches to the superluminal diffusion problem may not yield accurate results.</description>

      <title>Binary neutron star merger offsets from their host galaxies. GW 170817 as a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. The locations of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers within their host galaxies encode the systemic kicks that these systems received in the supernova aftermath. We investigate how the galactic potential and the systemic kicks shape the offset distribution of BNS mergers with a case study of GW 170817 and its host NGC 4993. Methods. We derived dynamical constraints on the host potential from integral field spectroscopy with Jeans anisotropic modelling. We evolved the trajectories of synthetic BNSs from the BPASS code in the galactic potential, using two different kick prescriptions to investigate how the observed offsets might differentiate between these two possibilities. The simulation was repeated after swapping the host potential with that of a dwarf galaxy, to test the effect of the potential on the offsets. Results. The location of GW 170817 is entirely consistent with our predictions, regardless of large or small kicks, because the strong potential of NGC 4993 is only diagnostic of very large kicks. In galaxies of similar or greater mass, large offsets can constrain large kicks, while small offsets do not provide much information. In an old dwarf galaxy, on the other hand, small offsets can constrain small kicks, while large offsets would prevent host association.</description>

      <title>SNR G54.1+0.3, a PeVatron candidate unveiled by LHAASO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the LHAASO Collaboration presented the first very-high-energy gamma-ray catalog, containing 90 TeV sources. Among these sources, 1LHAASO J1929 +1846u* is located 0.3$^\circ$ west of SNR G54.1 +0.3 and it also lies inside a $+53 \, \text{km s}^{-1}$ cloud (the Western Cloud) which may be associate with SNR G54.1+0.3. Moreover, one of IceCube's HESE track events is found at 1.3$^\circ$ north of 1LHAASO J1929 +1846u*. SNR G54.1+0.3 is young, with a powerful PWN inside. The X-ray radiation from the regions of SNR shell and PWN can be distinguished clearly. The radio emission from the PWN region is also available. However, due to the low angular resolution, the gamma-ray emission at the SNR by Fermi, HESS and VERITAS are considered as point sources. In this work, we explore a scenario that SNR G54.1 +0.3 is indeed associated with the Western Cloud and we derive the emissions from the PWN, the SNR shell, and the nearby molecular cloud. Our results can explain the multi-messenger observations, indicating that 1LHAASO J1929 +1846u* might be the excellent candidate of Galactic PeVatron.</description>

      <title>The threshold for pulsar radio emission is determined by the Goldreich-Julian charge density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent phenomenological study of radio emission from normal and millisecond pulsars by Karastergiou et al has lead these authors to state that they are unable to exclude a common physics process as the source although the rotation periods and magnetic fields of these two classes are very different. This has bearing on the nature of that source and it is the purpose the present Letter to explore this problem further, specifically for the ion-proton model and for all those models that assume electron-positron pair creation above the polar cap. The ion-proton model satisfies this commonality whereas pair creation does not. We mention briefly some consequences of these findings.</description>

      <title>BRITE nascent binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nascent binaries (NBs) are binary systems with very low mass ratios, less than ~0.2, in which the more massive component is an O- or B-type main-sequence star, while the secondary is a star contracting onto the main sequence. NBs are of interest because they can help to understand the formation of small-mass ratio systems and shed light on the origin of low-mass X-ray binaries, millisecond pulsars and type Ia supernovae. In photometry, short-period NBs show a strong irradiation effect due to the large difference between the effective temperatures of the components and the strong irradiation of a cool secondary by a hot primary. In spectroscopy, they usually appear as single-lined spectroscopic binaries. In the present paper, we summarize the status of our knowledge of Galactic nascent binaries and characterize two new members of this group, c2 Sco and V390 Pup, for which photometric data were obtained by the BRIght Target Explorer (BRITE) nano-satellite mission.</description>

      <title>Absorption of a twisted photon by an electron in strong magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The work investigates absorption of a twisted photon, which possesses quantized total angular momentum (TAM), by a relativistic electron with the Lorentz factor $\gamma \sim 1-10$ in a strong magnetic field up to the Schwinger limit, $H_c = 4.4\cdot 10^{13}$ G. We examine the absorption cross sections and their dependence on the parameters of the incident photon and the initial Landau electron. It is found that total absorption cross sections decrease as angular momentum of the incident photon increases and increase as angular momentum of the initial electron grows. The process is also compared across different magnetic field strengths, and the contribution of various electron spin transitions to total absorption cross section is analyzed. We also find that the processes without an electron spin flip dominate and, on top of that, an asymmetry in the ``spin-down'' $\rightarrow$ ``spin-up'' and the ``spin-up'' $\rightarrow$ ``spin-down'' transitions is observed. Specifically, the cross sections for the ``spin-down'' $\rightarrow$ ``spin-up'' transition are larger, which can be interpreted as an analogy of the Sokolov-Ternov effect present for photon emission. Finally, the cross sections are found to be almost constant as the transverse momentum of the photon varies from $0.1$ eV to $100$ keV. Our findings can help to improve the understanding of the QED processes in critical fields, typical for astrophysical environments, e.g. magnetospheres of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Presolar Grains As Probes of Supernova Nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an overview of the isotopic signatures of presolar supernova grains, specifically focusing on 44Ti-containing grains with robustly inferred supernova origins and their implications for nucleosynthesis and mixing mechanisms in supernovae. Recent technique advancements have enabled the differentiation between radiogenic (from 44Ti decay) and nonradiogenic 44Ca excesses in presolar grains, made possible by enhanced spatial resolution of Ca-Ti isotope analyses with the Cameca NanoSIMS (Nano-scale Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometer) instrument. Within the context of presolar supernova grain data, we discuss (i) the production of 44Ti in supernovae and the impact of interstellar medium heterogeneities on the galactic chemical evolution of 44Ca/40Ca, (ii) the nucleosynthesis processes of neutron bursts and explosive H-burning in Type II supernovae, and (iii) challenges in identifying the progenitor supernovae for 54Cr-rich presolar nanospinel grains. Drawing on constraints and insights derived from presolar supernova grain data, we also provide an overview of our current understanding of the roles played by various supernova types - including Type II, Type Ia, and electron capture supernovae - in accounting for the diverse array of nucleosynthetic isotopic variations identified in bulk meteorites and meteoritic components. We briefly overview the potential mechanisms that have been proposed to explain these nucleosynthetic variations by describing the transport and distribution of presolar dust carriers in the protoplanetary disk. We highlight existing controversies in the interpretation of presolar grain data and meteoritic nucleosynthetic isotopic variations, while also outlining potential directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Magnetic massive stars: confirming the merger scenario for the magnetic field generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields are considered to be key components of massive stars, with a far-reaching impact on their evolution and ultimate fate. A magnetic mechanism was suggested for the collimated explosion of massive stars, relevant for long-duration gamma-ray bursts, X-ray flashes, and asymmetric core collapse supernovae. However, the origin of the observed stable, globally organized magnetic fields in massive stars is still a matter of debate: it has been argued that they can be fossil, dynamo generated, or generated by strong binary interactions or merging events. Taking into account that multiplicity is a fundamental characteristic of massive stars, observational evidence is accumulating that the magnetism originates through interaction between the system components, both during the initial mass transfer or when the stellar cores merge.</description>

      <title>Study of solar activity with AERA data</title>

Abstract: We investigate the effects of solar activity on the Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) data collected over 10 years. We report the observation of Solar Radio Burst signals in AERA data associated with intense solar flares accompanied by moderate and strong radio blackout levels recorded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Additionally, although in a frequency range different from AERA, the increased level of X-ray and extreme ultraviolet radiation during periods of larger solar activity also impacts the AERA data in a twofold way: (i) causing the atmosphere to bounce terrestrial radio waves emitted by sources far from the AERA site or (ii) causing radio signals to become degraded or completely absorbed (radio blackout) if the solar radiation results in larger ionization of the upper or lower layers of the ionosphere, respectively. We describe the identification of both cases in AERA data with a remarkable correlation between the Maximum Usable Frequency (MUF), that represents the highest frequency that can be used for radio communication between two points located on the Earth, modulated by the solar cycle, and the broadband noise observed in the frequency range of 30-40 MHz.</description>

      <title>Amoeba: An AGN Model of Optical Emissions Beyond steady-state Accretion discs</title>

Abstract: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are objects located in the heart of galaxies which emit powerful and complex radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum. Understanding AGN has become a topic of interest due to their importance in galactic evolution and their ability to act as a probe to the distant Universe. Within the next few years, wide-field surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Rubin Vera Observatory are expected to increase the number of known AGN to $\mathcal{O} (10^{7})$ and the number of strongly lensed AGN to $\mathcal{O} (10^{4})$. In this paper we introduce \texttt{Amoeba}: an AGN Model of Optical Emission Beyond steady-state Accretion discs. The goal of \texttt{Amoeba} is to provide a modular and flexible modelling environment for AGN, in which all components can interact with each other. Through this work we describe the framework for major AGN components to vary self-consistently and keep flux distributions to connect these components to spatial dependent processes. We model properties beyond traditional single-component models, such as the reverberation of the corona's bending power law power spectrum through the accretion disc and broad line region (BLR). We simulate obscuration by the dusty torus and differential magnification of the disc and BLR due to microlensing. These features are joined together to create some of the most realistic light curve simulations to date. \texttt{Amoeba} takes a step forward in AGN modelling by joining the accretion disc, BLR, torus, intrinsic signal, and microlensing into a coherent model.</description>

      <title>Planet Migration in Windy Discs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accretion of protoplanetary discs (PPDs) could be driven by MHD disc winds rather than turbulent viscosity. With a dynamical prescription for angular momentum transport induced by disc winds, we perform 2D simulations of PPDs to systematically investigate the rate and direction of planet migration in a windy disc. We find that the the strength of disc winds influences the corotation region similarly to the "desaturation" effect of viscosity. The magnitude and direction of torque depend sensitively on the hierarchy between the radial advection timescale across the horseshoe due to disc wind $\tau_{\rm dw}$, the horsehoe libration timescale $\tau_{\rm lib}$ and U-turn timescale $\tau_{\rm U-turn}$. Initially, as wind strength increases and the advection timescale shortens, a non-linear horseshoe drag emerges when $\tau_{\rm dw} \lesssim \tau_{\rm lib}$, which tends to drive strong outward migration. Subsequently, the drag becomes linear and planets typically still migrate inward when $\tau_{\rm dw} \lesssim \tau_{\rm U-turn} \sim \tau_{\rm lib}h$, where $h$ is the disc aspect ratio. For a planet with mass ratio of $\sim 10^{-5}$, the zone of outward migration sandwiched between inner and outer inward migration zones corresponds to $\sim $ 10-100 au in a PPD with accretion rates between $10^{-8}$ and $10^{-7}$ $M_\odot \text{yr}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Formation of Fast-spinning Neutron Stars in Close Binaries and Magnetar-driven Stripped-envelope Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe), including Type Ic superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I), broad-line Type Ic SNe (SNe Ic-BL), and fast blue optical transients (FBOTs), are widely believed to harbor a newborn fast-spinning highly-magnetized neutron star (``magnetar''), which can lose its rotational energy via spin-down processes to accelerate and heat the ejecta. The progenitor(s) of these magnetar-driven SESNe, and the origin of considerable angular momentum (AM) in the cores of massive stars to finally produce such fast-spinning magnetars upon core-collapse are still under debate. Popular proposed scenarios in the literature cannot simultaneously explain their event rate density, SN and magnetar parameters, and the observed metallicity. Here, we perform a detailed binary evolution simulation that demonstrates that tidal spin-up helium stars with efficient AM transport mechanism in close binaries can form fast-spinning magnetars at the end of stars' life to naturally reproduce the universal energy-mass correlation of these magnetar-driven SESNe. Our models are consistent with the event rate densities, host environments, ejecta masses, and energetics of these different kinds of magnetar-driven SESNe, supporting that the isolated common-envelope formation channel could be a major common origin of magnetar-driven SESNe. The remnant compact binary systems of magnetar-driven SESNe are progenitors of some gravitational-wave transients and galactic systems.</description>

      <title>On joint analysing XMM-NuSTAR spectra of active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recently released XMM-Newton technical note has revealed a significant calibration issue between NuSTAR and XMM-Newton EPIC, and provided an empirical correction to EPIC effective area. To quantify the bias caused by the calibration issue to joint analysis of XMM-NuSTAR spectra and verify the effectiveness of the correction, in this work we perform joint-fitting of NuSTAR and EPIC-pn spectra for a large sample of 104 observation pairs of 44 X-ray bright AGN. The spectra were extracted after requiring perfect simultaneity between XMM-Newton and NuSTAR exposures (merging GTIs from two missions) to avoid bias due to rapid spectral variability of AGN. Before the correction, the EPIC-pn spectra are systematically harder than corresponding NuSTAR spectra by $\Delta \Gamma \sim 0.1$, subsequently yielding significantly underestimated cutoff energy $E_{\rm cut} $ and the strength of reflection component R when performing joint-fitting. We confirm the correction is highly effective and can commendably erase the discrepancy in best-fit $\Gamma$, $E_{\rm cut} $ and R, and thus we urge the community to apply the correction when joint-fitting XMM-NuSTAR spectra. Besides, we show that as merging GTIs from two missions would cause severe loss of NuSTAR net exposure time, in many cases joint-fitting yields no advantage compared with utilizing NuSTAR data alone. We finally present a technical note on filtering periods of high background flares for XMM-Newton EPIC-pn exposures in the Small Window mode.</description>

      <title>Finding the Particularity of the Active Episode of SGR J1935+2154 during Which FRB 20200428 Occurred: Implication from Statistics of Fermi/GBM X-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11877v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By using the Fermi/Gamma-ray Burst Monitor data of the X-ray bursts (XRBs) of SGR J1935+2154, we investigate the temporal clustering of the bursts and the cumulative distribution of the waiting time and fluence/flux. It is found that the bursts occurring in the episode hosting FRB 20200428 have obviously shorter waiting times than those in the other episodes. The general statistical properties of the XRBs further indicate they could belong to a self-organized critical (SOC) system (e.g., starquakes), making them very similar to the earthquake phenomena. Then, according to a unified scaling law between the waiting time and energy of the earthquakes as well as their aftershocks, we implement an analogy analysis on the XRBs and find that the FRB episode owns more dependent burst events than the other episodes. It is indicated that the fast radio burst (FRB) emission could be produced by the interaction between different burst events, which could correspond to a collision between different seismic/Alfven waves or different explosion outflows. Such a situation could appear when the magnetar enters into a global intensive activity period.</description>

      <title>Intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals with general dynamical friction in dark matter minispikes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals (IMRIs) may be surrounded by dark matter (DM) minispikes. The dynamical friction from these DM minispike structures can affect the dynamics and the gravitational wave (GW) emission of the IMRIs. We analyze the effects of general dynamical friction, with a particular contribution from DM particles moving faster than the stellar-mass black hole in an eccentric IMRI. The results show that the dynamical friction caused by these DM particles tends to eccentricify the orbit, and the general dynamical friction is able to increase the eccentricity. We also analyze the effects of general dynamical friction on the GW characteristic strain. The results indicate that the peak value of the characteristic strain occurs at higher frequencies as the power law index of DM minispike $\gamma_\mathrm{sp}$ increases. For the first time, a general analytical relation between the frequency peak value of characteristic strain of GWs and $\gamma_\mathrm{sp}$ is established. Using the analytical relation, the presence of DM and its halo density may be determined potentially from future GW data.</description>

      <title>The Radius of the High-mass Pulsar PSR J0740+6620 with 3.6 yr of NICER Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report an updated analysis of the radius, mass, and heated surface regions of the massive pulsar PSR J0740+6620 using Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) data from 2018 September 21 to 2022 April 21, a substantial increase in data set size compared to previous analyses. Using a tight mass prior from radio timing measurements and jointly modeling the new NICER data with XMM-Newton data, the inferred equatorial radius and gravitational mass are $12.49_{-0.88}^{+1.28}$ km and $2.073_{-0.069}^{+0.069}$ $M_\odot$ respectively, each reported as the posterior credible interval bounded by the $16\,\%$ and $84\,\%$ quantiles, with an estimated systematic error $\lesssim 0.1$ km. This result was obtained using the best computationally feasible sampler settings providing a strong radius lower limit but a slightly more uncertain radius upper limit. The inferred radius interval is also close to the $R=12.76_{-1.02}^{+1.49}$ km obtained by Dittmann et al., when they require the radius to be less than $16$ km as we do. The results continue to disfavor very soft equations of state for dense matter, with $R&lt;11.15$ km for this high-mass pulsar excluded at the $95\,\%$ probability. The results do not depend significantly on the assumed cross-calibration uncertainty between NICER and XMM-Newton. Using simulated data that resemble the actual observations, we also show that our pipeline is capable of recovering parameters for the inferred models reported in this paper.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Reflection Modeling in AGN and Related Variability from PCA: A Brief Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray observations of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) reveal relativistic reflections from the innermost regions of accretion disks, which contain general-relativistic footprints caused by spinning supermassive black holes (SMBH). We anticipate the spin of a SMBH to be stable over the human timeframe, so brightness changes in the high-energy corona above the SMBH should slightly alter relativistic reflection. In this brief review, we discuss the latest developments in modeling relativistic reflection, as well as the rapid small variation in relativistic emission disclosed by the principal component analysis (PCA) of X-ray variability in AGN. PCA studies of X-ray spectra from AGNs have shown that relativistically blurred reflection has negligible fluctuations over the course of observations, which could originate from rapid (intrahour) intrinsic variations in near-horizon accretion flows and photon rings. The PCA technique is an effective way to disclose relativistic reflection from X-ray observations of AGNs, simplifying the complexity of largely variable X-ray data for automated spectral analysis with machine learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Vortex Avalanches and Collective Motion in Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We simulate the dynamics of about 600 quantum vortices in a spinning-down cylindrical container using a Gross--Pitaevskii model. For the first time, we find convincing spatial-temporal evidence of avalanching behaviour resulting from vortex depinning and collective motion. During a typical avalanche, about 10 to 20 vortices exit the container in a short period, producing a glitch in the superfluid angular momentum and a localised void in the vorticity. After the glitch, vortices continue to depin and circulate around the vorticity void in a similar manner to that seen in previous point-vortex simulations. We present evidence of collective vortex motion throughout this avalanche process. We also show that the effective Magnus force can be used to predict when and where avalanches will occur. Lastly, we comment on the challenge of extrapolating these results to conditions in real neutron stars, which contain many orders of magnitude more vortices.</description>

      <title>Efficient Bayesian inference and model selection for continuous gravitational waves in pulsar timing array data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding and characterizing gravitational waves from individual supermassive black hole binaries is a central goal of pulsar timing array experiments, which will require analysis methods that can be efficient on our rapidly growing datasets. Here we present a novel approach built on three key elements: i) precalculating and interpolating expensive matrix operations; ii) semi-analytically marginalizing over the gravitational-wave phase at the pulsars; iii) numerically marginalizing over the pulsar distance uncertainties. With these improvements the recent NANOGrav 15yr dataset can be analyzed in minutes after an $\mathcal{O}(1\ \mathrm{hour})$ setup phase, instead of an analysis taking days-weeks with previous methods. The same setup can be used to efficiently analyze the dataset under any sinusoidal deterministic model. In particular, this will aid testing the binary hypothesis by allowing for efficient analysis of competing models (e.g. incoherent, monopolar, or dipolar sine wave model) and scrambled datasets for false alarm studies. The same setup can be updated in minutes for new realizations of the data, which enables large simulation studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interacting binary star systems play a critical role in many areas of astrophysics. One interesting example of a binary merger product are Thorne-\.Zytkow Objects (T\.ZOs), stars that look like red supergiants but contain neutron stars at their cores. T\.ZOs were theorized nearly five decades ago, and significant work has gone into understanding the physics of their formation, evolution, and stability. Several searches for T\.ZO candidates have also been carried out. Whether or not T\.ZOs could even exist or if they would be stable after formation has also been investigated. Understanding the existence and possible prevalence of T\.ZOs would have important effects on our understanding of binary evolution, stellar mergers, and inform binary population synthesis models. In this chapter, we review the formation channels, evolution and structure, final fates, and observable signatures of T\.ZOs, as well as candidates in the literature, from the inception of T\.ZO theory to recent progress in the field.</description>
