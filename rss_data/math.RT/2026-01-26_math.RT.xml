      <title>Homomorphisms between Bott-Samelson bimodules corresponding to sequences of reflections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the space of all bimodule homomorphisms $R_x\otimes_R R(\underline{t})\otimes_R R_y\to R_z\otimes_R R(\underline{t}')\otimes_R R_w$ as a one-sided module, where $R_x,R_y,R_z,R_w$ are standard twisted bimodules and $R(\underline{t})$ and $R(\underline{t}')$ are the Bott-Samelson bimodules corresponding to sequences of reflections $\underline{t}$ and $\underline{t}'$ respectively. We prove that this module is always reflexive under some reasonable restrictions on the representation of the underlying Coxeter group.
  However, unlike the case where $\underline{t}$ and $\underline{t}'$ contain only simple reflections, this module does not need any longer to be free. We provide a series of counterexamples already for the symmetric groups $S_n$, where $n\ge4$. The projective dimension of the modules dual to them is $n-3$ and thus serves to measure the deviation from the free modules.
  When placed within a geometric framework, these examples show how to find fibers of points fixed by the compact torus in the Bott-Samelson resolutions (as in the original definition by Raoul Bott and Hans Samelson) with non-vanishing odd cohomology.</description>

      <title>On the computation of the canonical basis for irreducible highest weight $U_q (\mathfrak{gl}_{\infty})$-module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study canonical basis elements in higher-level Fock spaces associated with the quantum group $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}_\infty)$, which are conjecturally related to Calogero-Moser theory for complex reflection groups. We generalize the Leclerc-Miyachi formula to arbitrary levels by introducing new explicit constructions based on symbols, including a column removal theorem and closed formulas in several cases. These results provide explicit descriptions of canonical basis elements with applications to Calogero-Moser cellular characters and to the decomposition matrices of Ariki-Koike algebras.</description>

      <title>The geometry of tilting composition series via Richardson varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the (graded) Jordan-H\"{o}lder multiplicities of (mixed) tilting sheaves on flag varieties admit a geometric interpretation as the hypercohomology of certain sheaves on Richardson varieties in the Langlands dual flag variety. These sheaves are a motivic variant of geometric extensions, and provide a replacement for parity sheaves on the Richardson variety. We also provide an explicit formula for these multiplicities in terms of $\ell$-Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Phase Theory II: The Frobenius Heisenberg Phase and Boundary Rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the representation theory intrinsic to Algebraic Phase Theory (APT) in regimes where defect and canonical filtration admit faithful algebraic realisation. This extends the framework introduced in earlier work by incorporating a representation-theoretic layer that is compatible with defect and filtration. In this setting, algebraic phases act naturally on filtered module categories rather than on isolated objects, and classical irreducibility must be replaced by a filtration-compatible notion of indecomposability forced by defect.
  As a central application, we analyse the Frobenius Heisenberg algebraic phase, which occupies a rigid boundary regime within the broader APT landscape, and show that it satisfies the axioms of APT in a strongly admissible form. We study the representations realising this phase and show that their non-semisimplicity and rigidity properties are consequences of the underlying algebraic structure rather than analytic or semisimple hypotheses. In particular, we establish a Stone von Neumann type rigidity theorem for Heisenberg groups associated with finite Frobenius rings. For each such ring $R$, we construct a canonical Schr\"odinger representation of the Frobenius Heisenberg group $H_R$, and show that, for a fixed nontrivial central character, every centrally faithful representation of $H_R$ is equivalent to this model.
  The proof is entirely algebraic and uses no topology, unitarity, Fourier analysis, or semisimplicity. Instead, rigidity emerges as a boundary phenomenon governed by defect and canonical filtration. The Frobenius hypothesis is shown to be sharp: it precisely delineates the structural boundary within APT at which Heisenberg rigidity persists, and outside the Frobenius class this rigidity necessarily fails.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Geometry for Spin-Adapted Coupled Cluster Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop and numerically analyze an algebraic-geometric framework for spin-adapted coupled-cluster (CC) theory. Since the electronic Hamiltonian is SU(2)-invariant, physically relevant quantum states lie in the spin singlet sector. We give an explicit description of the SU(2)-invariant (spin singlet) many-body space by identifying it with an Artinian commutative ring, called the excitation ring, whose dimension is governed by a Narayana number. We define spin-adapted truncation varieties via embeddings of graded subspaces of this ring, and we identify the CCS truncation variety with the Veronese square of the Grassmannian. Compared to the spin-generalized formulation, this approach yields a substantial reduction in dimension and degree, with direct computational consequences. In particular, the CC degree of the truncation variety -- governing the number of homotopy paths required to compute all CC solutions -- is reduced by orders of magnitude. We present scaling studies demonstrating asymptotic improvements and we exploit this reduction to compute the full solution landscape of spin-adapted CC equations for water and lithium hydride.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct an explicit isomorphism between the HOMFLY-PT homology of $(n,n+1)$ torus knots and the direct sum of hook isotypic components of the space of diagonal coinvariants. As a consequence, we compute the action of tautological classes in HOMFLY-PT homology of $(n,n+1)$ torus knots and prove that it extends to an action of the Lie algebra of Hamiltonian vector fields on the plane. We also compute the action of differentials $d_N$ in Rasmussen spectral sequences from HOMLFY-PT to $\mathfrak{gl}(N)$ homology of $(n,n+1)$ torus knots.</description>

Abstract: We establish an algebra isomorphism between the center of the category $\mathcal{O}$ for a hybrid quantum group at a root of unity $\zeta$ and the cohomology of $\zeta$-fixed locus on affine Grassmannian. A deformed version of this isomorphism was established in the previous paper of the author. For the Steinberg block of $\mathcal{O}$, we construct an abelian equivalence to the category of equivariant sheaves on the Springer resolution.</description>

      <title>Quasi Regular Functions in Quaternionic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a new class of functions that arise naturally in quaternionic analysis, we call them "quasi regular functions". Like the well-known quaternionic regular functions, these functions provide representations of the quaternionic conformal group. However, unlike the regular functions, the quasi regular ones do not admit an invariant unitary structure but rather a pseudounitary equivalent. The reproducing kernels of these functions have an especially simple form: (Z-W)^{-1}. We describe the K-type bases of quasi regular functions and derive the reproducing kernel expansions. We also show that the restrictions of the irreducible representations formed from the quasi regular functions to the Poincare group have three irreducible components.
  Our interest in the quasi regular functions arises from an application to the study of conformal-invariant algebras of quaternionic functions. We also introduce a factorization of certain intertwining operators between tensor products of spaces of quaternionic functions. This factorization is obtained using fermionic Fock spaces constructed from the quasi regular functions.</description>

      <title>Interval Replacements of Persistence Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08308v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define two notions. The first one is a $rank\ compression\ system$ $\xi$ for a finite poset $\mathbf{P}$ that assigns each interval subposet $I$ to an order-preserving map $\xi_I \colon I^{\xi} \to \mathbf{P}$ satisfying some conditions, where $I^{\xi}$ is a connected finite poset. An example is given by the $total$ compression system that assigns each $I$ to the inclusion of $I$ into $\mathbf{P}$. The second one is an $I$-$rank$ of a persistence module $M$ under $\xi$, the family of which is called the $interval\ rank\ invariant$ of $M$ under $\xi$. A compression system $\xi$ makes it possible to define the $interval\ replacement$ (also called the interval-decomposable approximation) not only for 2D persistence modules but also for any persistence modules over any finite poset. We will show that the forming of the interval replacement preserves the interval rank invariant, which is a stronger property than the preservation of the usual rank invariant. Moreover, to know what is preserved by the replacement explicitly, we will give a formula of the $I$-rank of $M$ under $\xi$ in terms of the structure linear maps of $M$ for any compression system $\xi$. The formula leads us to a concept of essential cover, which gives us a sufficient condition for the $I$-rank of $M$ under $\xi$ to coincide with that under another compression system $\zeta$. This is applied to the case where $\xi = \mathrm{tot}$, the value of $I$-rank under which is equal to the generalized rank invariant introduced by Kim--M\'emoli, to give an alternative proof of the Dey--Kim--M\'emoli theorem computing the generalized rank invariant by using a zigzag path.</description>

Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime. For $p=2$, the fields of values of the complex irreducible characters of finite groups whose degrees are not divisible by $p$ have been classified; for odd primes $p$, a conjectural classification has been proposed. In this work, we extend this conjecture to characters whose degrees are divisible by arbitrary powers of $p$, and we provide some evidence supporting its validity.</description>

Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime number, $K$ a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ and $n$ an integer $\geq 2$. We completely and explicitly describe the global sections $\Omega^\bullet$ of the de Rham complex of the Drinfeld space over $K$ in dimension $n-1$ as a complex of (duals of) locally $K$-analytic representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n(K)$. Using this description, we construct an explicit section in the derived category of (duals of) finite length admissible locally $K$-analytic representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n(K)$ to the canonical morphism of complexes $\Omega^\bullet \twoheadrightarrow H^{n-1}(\Omega^\bullet)[-(n-1)]$.</description>

      <title>On the depth of subgroups of simple groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The depth of a subgroup $H$ of a finite group $G$ is a positive integer defined with respect to the inclusion of the corresponding complex group algebras $\mathbb{C}H \subseteq \mathbb{C}G$. This notion was originally introduced by Boltje, Danz and K\"{u}lshammer in 2011, and it has been the subject of numerous papers in recent years. In this paper, we study the depth of core-free subgroups, which allows us to apply powerful computational and probabilistic techniques that were originally designed for studying bases for permutation groups. We use these methods to prove a wide range of new results on the depth of subgroups of almost simple groups, significantly extending the scope of earlier work in this direction. For example, we establish best possible bounds on the depth of irreducible subgroups of classical groups and primitive subgroups of symmetric groups. And with the exception of a handful of open cases involving the Baby Monster, we calculate the exact depth of every subgroup of every almost simple sporadic group. We also present a number of open problems and conjectures.</description>

      <title>Intertwining periods, L-functions and local-global principles for distinction of automorphic representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a criterion for non-vanishing of period integrals on automorphic representations of a general linear group over a division algebra. We consider three different periods: linear periods, twisted-linear periods and Galois periods. Our criterion is a local-global principle, which is stated in terms of local distinction, a further local obstruction, and poles of certain global L-functions associated to the underlying involution via the Jacquet-Langlands correspondence. Our local-global principle follows from a new method, relying on the Maass-Selberg relations and a careful analysis of singularities of local and global intertwining periods. Our results generalize to inner forms, known results for split general linear groups. Moreover, our result for twisted linear periods is new even in the split situation. As a consequence of our local-global principle, we complete the proof of one direction of the Guo-Jacquet conjecture.</description>
