      <title>Visualization of spin-splitter effect in altermagnets via non-equilibrium Green functions on a lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a charge current is injected into an altermagnet along a suitable crystallographic direction, a transverse spin current can be generated. This so-called spin-splitter effect does not rely on spin-orbit coupling, and is thus distinct from the spin Hall effect. The spin-splitter effect was predicted by \textit{ab initio} calculations and has been experimentally confirmed. To utilize the spin-splitter effect for practical purposes in spintronic devices, it is important to understand (i) how the system parameters affect the transverse spin current, such as filling fraction, altermagnetic strength, interface parameters, spin-orbit interactions, and impurities and (ii) determine the properties of any associated spin accumulation, which is the measurable quantity. Here, we determine the answer to these questions and provide a real-space visualization of the spin flow and spin accumulation due to the spin-splitter effect. We utilize the non-equilibrium Keldysh Green function method on a 2D square lattice to this end. We find that the presence of edges induces oscillations in the spin accumulation and strongly modify the signal for small samples. At half-filling, the spin accumulation acquires an anomalous pattern and the spin-splitter effect vanishes. We prove analytically that this follows from a combined particle-hole and spin-reversal symmetry of the model used for the altermagnetic state. Increasing the altermagnetic strength leads to a larger spin accumulation, as expected. However, when adding Rashba spin-orbit interaction, providing an additional spin Hall signal, we find that the spin accumulation is not simply the sum of the spin Hall and spin-splitter contribution. Finally, we show that the spin-splitter effect is robust towards moderate impurity scattering with a potential of the same order as the hopping parameter, which facilitates its observation in real materials.</description>

      <title>Theory for Lattice Relaxation in Marginal Twist Moir\'es</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomically thin moir\'e materials behave like elastic membranes where at very small twist angles, the van der Waals adhesion energy much exceeds the strain energy. In this ``marginal twist" regime, regions with low adhesion energy expand, covering most of the moir\'e unit cell, while all the unfavorable energy configurations shrink to form topological defects linked by a periodic network of domain walls. We find analytical expressions that successfully capture this strong-coupling regime for both the triangular soliton network and the honeycomb soliton network matching predictions from LAMMPS molecular dynamics simulations, and numerical solutions of continuum elasticity theory. There is an emergent universality where the theory is characterized by a single twist-angle dependent parameter. Our formalism is essential to understand experiments on a wide-range of materials of current interest including twisted bilayer graphene, both parallel and antiparallel stacked tWSe2 and tMoTe2, and any other twisted homobilayer with the same stacking symmetry.</description>

      <title>A Matrix Quantum Kinetic Treatment of Impact Ionization in Avalanche Photodiodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix based quantum kinetic simulations have been widely used for the predictive modeling of electronic devices. Inelastic scattering from phonons and electrons are typically treated as higher order processes in these treatments, captured using mean-field approximations. Carrier multiplication in Avalanche Photodiodes (APDs), however, relies entirely on strongly inelastic impact ionization, making electron-electron scattering the dominant term requiring a rigorous, microscopic treatment. We go well beyond the conventional Born approximation for scattering to develop a matrix-based quantum kinetic theory for impact ionization, involving products of multiple Green's functions. Using a model semiconductor in a reverse-biased p-i-n configuration, we show how its calculated non-equilibrium charge distributions show multiplication at dead-space values consistent with energy-momentum conservation. Our matrix approach can be readily generalized to more sophisticated atomistic Hamiltonians, setting the stage for a fully predictive, `first principles' theory of APDs.</description>

      <title>Lorenz ratios of diagonal and Hall conductivities in a Dirac electron liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetotransport properties of a two-dimensional electron liquid in graphene are analyzed in the hydrodynamic limit under isothermal conditions. It is shown that the Wiedemann-Franz law does not hold in this regime and that the Lorenz ratios constructed from the diagonal and Hall conductivities generally differ from each other. The breakdown of the Wiedemann-Franz law is most pronounced near charge neutrality, where the Lorenz ratio can exceed its nominal universal Sommerfeld value by an order of magnitude. The corresponding Lorenz ratios exhibit a nonmonotonic dependence on the magnetic field, which is caused by emergent magnetic friction arising in liquids lacking Galilean invariance and possessing finite intrinsic conductivity.</description>

      <title>Circular Photon Drag Effect in Dirac electrons by Quantum Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum geometry is a well-established framework for understanding transport and optical responses in quantum materials. In this work, I study the photon drag effect in Dirac electrons using the quantum geometric interpretation of non-vertical optical transitions. Due to the particle-hole symmetry inherent in Dirac electrons, the shift photon-drag photocurrent is dominated by dissipationless Fermi surface contributions, connected to the dipole of quantum metric tensor. I find that this dipole is significantly enhanced by a small band gap in massive Dirac electrons and remains robust in the massless limit. I demonstrate the existence of a circular shift photon-drag current in the effective Hamiltonian at the L-point of bismuth, where the bands exhibit trivial topology, highlighting the ubiquity of the circular photon-drag effect in centrosymmetric materials.</description>

      <title>Robust spin-qubit control in a natural Si-MOS quantum dot using phase modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon quantum dots are one of the most promising candidates for practical quantum computers because of their scalability and compatibility with the well-established complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology. However, the coherence time is limited in industry-standard natural silicon because of the $^{29}$Si isotopes, which have non-zero nuclear spin. Here, we protect an isotopically natural silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor (Si-MOS) quantum dot spin qubit from environmental noise via electron spin resonance with a phase-modulated microwave (MW) drive. This concatenated continuous drive (CCD) method extends the decay time of Rabi oscillations from 1.2 $\mathrm{\mu s}$ to over 200 $\mathrm{\mu s}$. Furthermore, we define a protected qubit basis and propose robust gate operations. We find the coherence time measured by Ramsey sequence is improved from 143 ns to 40.7 $\mu$s compared to that of the bare spin qubit. The single qubit gate fidelity measured with randomized benchmarking is improved from 95% to 99%, underscoring the effectiveness of the CCD method. The method shows promise for improving control fidelity of noisy qubits, overcoming the qubit variability for global control, and maintaining qubit coherence while idling.</description>

      <title>Floquet-Nambu Theory of Electron Quantum Optics with Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive Floquet-Nambu theory to describe the time-dependent quantum transport in mesoscopic circuits involving superconductors. The central object of our framework is the first-order correlation function, which accounts for the excitations that are generated by a time-dependent voltage and their coherent scattering off the interface with a superconductor. We analyze the time-dependent current generated by periodic voltage pulses and how it depends on the excitation energies of the voltage drive compared to the gap of the superconductor. Our formalism allows us to identify the conditions for the excitations that are scattered off the superconductor to become coherent electron-hole superpositions. To this end, we consider the purity of the outgoing states, which characterizes their ability to carry quantum information. Our framework paves the way for systematic investigations of time-dependent scattering problems involving superconductivity, and it may help interpret future experiments in electron quantum optics with superconductors.</description>

      <title>Bleaching of the Terahertz Magneto-Photogalvanic Effect in CdHgTe Crystals with Kane Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the observation and comprehensive study of the complex nonlinear intensity dependence of the magneto-photogalvanic effect (MPGE) current induced by terahertz (THz) radiation in Cd$_{x}$Hg$_{1-x}$Te films with inverted ($x = 0.15$) and noninverted ($x = 0.22$) band structures. The nonlinearities are studied for the resonant MPGE caused by cyclotron resonance, interband transitions between Landau levels, and ionization impurities, as well as for nonresonant indirect Drude-like optical transitions. We show that all these processes lead to the saturation of the photocurrent caused by absorption bleaching. We develop a theoretical framework for each mechanism, which describes measured nonlinearities over an intensity range from 10$^{-3}$ to $4\times10^{4}$ W/cm$^2$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the saturation processes for these absorption channels differ significantly, allowing us to analyze them independently by considering different intensity regimes. The observed nonlinearities enable us to determine the energy relaxation times of Kane fermions excited by CR and interband optical transitions.</description>

      <title>Fundamentals of heterodyne wave mixing spectroscopy: a tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This tutorial provides a joint theoretical and experimental overview of heterodyne wave mixing spectroscopy, focusing mainly on four-wave mixing (FWM). This powerful and versatile time-resolved nonlinear optical spectroscopy technique enables the investigation of individual localized single photon emitters, as well as microscopy of extended samples, e.g., two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides. Starting with the fundamental theory of optically driven two-level systems, we motivate the utility of wave mixing spectroscopy via a discussion on homogeneous and inhomogeneous linewidths which can be independently measured using FWM. We then provide a detailed overview of the heterodyne wave mixing setup operated by one of the authors (JK) at Institut N\'eel in Grenoble, supported by theoretical modeling of the signal detection process. Throughout the paper we elaborate on important benefits of heterodyne wave mixing spectroscopy, e.g., background-free detection, measurement of the full signal field including amplitude and phase, and investigation of coupling mechanisms in few-level systems. Within the context of the latter point we discuss the significance of two-dimensional (2D) FWM spectra. This tutorial is dedicated to students, young researchers, as well as experts in the field of nonlinear spectroscopy in general and FWM in particular. It explains the fundamental concepts and building blocks required to operate a heterodyne wave mixing experiment both from the experimental and theoretical side. This joint approach is helpful for theoreticians who want to accurately and quantitatively model wave mixing signals, as well as for experimentalists who aim to interpret their recorded data.</description>

      <title>Vibrational Instabilities in Charge Transport through Molecular Nanojunctions: The Role of Nonconservative Current-Induced Electronic Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the current-induced vibrational dynamics in molecular nanojunctions is critical for gaining insight into the stability of such systems. While it is well known that Joule heating at higher bias voltages plays an important role for the stability of the nanojunction, a different mechanism caused by current-induced nonconservative forces has been reported to cause vibrational instabilities already at much lower voltages. In this paper, we apply a mixed quantum-classical approach based on electronic friction and Langevin dynamics to a model system for which vibrational instabilities have previously been reported. The electronic friction and other electronic forces can be calculated exactly using nonequilibrium Green's functions. We perform Langevin simulations of the vibrational dynamics to calculate the steady-state vibrational excitation and compare the results to a simplified eigenmode analysis, identifying the parameter regimes in which runaway modes appear.</description>

      <title>Magnetic domain wall curvature effects on the velocity in the creep regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of magnetic domain wall curvature on its dynamics in the creep regime in systems displaying Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). We first derive an extended creep model able to account for the finite curvature effect in magnetic bubble domain expansion. We then discuss the relative importance of this effect and discuss its dependence on the main magnetic and disorder parameters. We show this effect can be easily measured in Pt/Co multi layer samples, reporting a strong velocity reduction below a sample dependent threshold value of the magnetic bubble radius. We finally show, both theoretically and experimentally, how the radius of magnetic bubbles can have a strong impact on the reproducibility of DMI measurements.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic back-switching phenomenon in SOT-MRAM devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The writing process of SOT-MRAMs is considered deterministic when additional symmetry-breaking factors, such as the application of an external magnetic field aligned with the current, are present. Notably, the write probability exhibits a unique behavior as a function of the current: it drops to zero at high currents or even oscillates with the current. This phenomenon is attributed to back-switching, an intrinsic effect of magnetization reversal driven by spin-orbit torques. A systematic investigation of this back-switching phenomenon is conducted on sub-100 nm CoFeB magnetic pillars positioned at the center of $\beta$-W Hall crosses. Using a statistical approach, the study examines the impact of various parameters, including the amplitude of current pulses and the application of magnetic fields in different directions. The findings reveal that the back-switching phenomenon is not statistically random. Macrospin simulations, employing realistic magnetic parameter values, accurately replicate the experimental observations and provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of back-switching. These simulations also explore strategies to mitigate the phenomenon, such as optimizing the shape of the writing pulses. Applying this approach to complete SOT-MRAM single cells achieves a write error rate below $2 \times 10^{-6}$, demonstrating the effectiveness of this strategy in expanding the operational current range for write operations in SOT-MRAMs.</description>

      <title>Quadrupolar and Dipolar Excitons in Bilayer 2$H$-MoSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the experimental observation of quadrupolar exciton states in the reflectance contrast spectrum of 2$H$-stacked bilayer MoSe$_2$. The application of a vertical electric field results in a quadratic energy redshift of these quadrupolar excitons, in contrast to the linear energy splitting observed in the coexisting dipolar excitons within the bilayer MoSe$_2$. We perform helicity-resolved reflectance contrast measurements to investigate the spin and valley configurations of the quadrupolar exciton states as a function of applied vertical electric and magnetic fields. Comparing our results with a phenomenological coupled-oscillator model indicates that the electric- and magnetic-field dependence of the quadrupolar exciton states can be attributed to the intravalley and intervalley hybridization of spin-triplet interlayer excitons with opposite permanent dipole moments, mediated by interlayer hole tunneling. These results position naturally stacked MoSe$_2$ bilayers as a promising platform to explore electric-field-tunable many-body exciton phenomena.</description>

      <title>Predicted third-order sweet spots for phi-junction Josephson parametric amplifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire Josephson junctions exhibit skewed and phi-shifted current phase relations when an in-plane magnetic field is applied along the weak link's spin-orbit effective field direction. These junctions can have an asymmetric Josephson potential with odd-order nonlinearities. A dominant third-order nonlinearity can be achieved by tuning the magnetic field to a sweet spot. Sweet spots persist when higher order Josephson harmonics are included. This makes it possible to have a single Josephson junction dipole element with three-wave mixing capability, which is favorable for pump-efficient amplification. Electrostatic gate tunability of the semiconductor weak link can make it operable within an extended range of working frequencies, and the inclusion of micromagnets can facilitate near-zero magnetic field operation.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of Chern bands and Landau levels from projected Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a universal formulation of the generalized real space interactions with translational invariance, when projected into a single Landau level, can be equivalent to density-density interaction projected into any Chern bands (e.g. Landau levels, continuous moire Chern bands and discrete lattice Chern bands). By constructing a complete basis of generalized pseudopotentials, we define the projected interaction range that can be used to characterize important features of different Chern bands relevant to the robustness of interacting topological phases. The analytical construction allows us to study general Chern bands beyond the torus geometry, for example on the disk or spherical geometry where the edge dynamics and curvature effects can be explored. For moire systems (and lattice Chern bands with large incompressibility gap) one can see transparently the topological Hall viscosity for the fractional states are identical to those in the Landau levels. The physical unprojected interaction also provides a natural embedding for lattice systems, shedding light on the concerns of relying on quantum geometric tensor (varying with lattice embedding in real space) to understand the properties of interacting phases of matters.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian dynamics of a qubit due to accelerated light in a lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emission of a qubit weakly coupled to a one-band coupled-cavity array where, due to an engineered gradient in the cavity frequencies, photons are effectively accelerated by a synthetic force F. For strong F, a reversible emission described by an effective Jaynes-Cummings model occurs, causing a chiral time-periodic excitation of an extensive region of the array, either to the right or to the left of the qubit depending on its frequency. For weak values of F instead, a complex non-Markovian decay with revivals shows up. This is reminiscent of dynamics induced by mirrors in standard waveguides, despite the absence of actual mirrors, and can be attributed to the finite width of the energy band which confines the motion of the emitted photon. In a suitable regime, the decay is well described by a delay differential equation formally analogous to the one governing the decay of an atom in a multi-mode cavity where the cavity length and time taken by a photon to travel between the two mirrors are now embodied by the amplitude and period of Bloch oscillations, respectively.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle Spectroscopy of Chiral Charge Order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic interactions can give rise to novel charge density waves with unconventional ground states. Recent experiments report evidence for a chiral charge density wave (CDW) that breaks time-reversal symmetry in the kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K, Rb or Cs). Theoretical analyses propose a topologically nontrivial loop current phase that spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry as the favorable CDW ground state. However, spectroscopic insights into the quasiparticle excitations of chiral charge order in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ compounds are still missing and conflicting experimental results question the presence of a loop current phase. We employed individual magnetic atoms as local quantum sensors to examine the quasiparticle excitations of chiral charge order in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ with the scanning tunneling microscope (STM). Our spectroscopic measurements show that the magnetic moment of Co induces a spatially-localized low-energy state in the CDW phase. The distinct spectral signatures of this state are consistent with theoretical expectations for the quasiparticle excitation of a loop current order parameter, while control experiment rule out alternative scenario. Our work provides unique insights into the ground state of chiral charge order in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and introduces a novel method to examine other topological states, such as the fractional Chern insulators, with the STM.</description>

      <title>Ultralow-pressure mechanical-motion switching of ferroelectric polarization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ferroelectric polarization switching, achieved by mechanical forces, enables the storage of stress information in ferroelectrics, and holds promise for human-interfacing applications. The prevailing mechanical approach is locally induced flexoelectricity with large strain gradients. However, this approach usually requires huge mechanical pressures, which greatly impedes device applications. Here, we report an approach of using triboelectric effect to mechanically, reversibly switch ferroelectric polarization across {\alpha}-In2Se3 ferroelectric memristors. Through contact electrification and electrostatic induction effects, triboelectric units are used to sensitively detect mechanical forces and generate electrical voltage pulses to trigger {\alpha}-In2Se3 resistance switching. We realize multilevel resistance states under different mechanical forces, by which a neuromorphic stress system is demonstrated. Strikingly, we achieve the reversal of {\alpha}-In2Se3 ferroelectric polarization with a record-low mechanical pressure of ~ 10 kPa, and even with tactile touches. Our work provides a fundamental but pragmatic strategy for creating mechanical-tactile ferroelectric memory devices.</description>

      <title>Screening effect of a magnetically soft shell of single-domain ferromagnetic nanoparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The possible manifestations of magnetic screening effects were theoretically investigated for a particle with a ferromagnetic single-domain core and a magnetically soft shell. The exact solution of the Laplace equation gave analytical formulas for the magnetic field created by the particle placed in a uniform external magnetic field. The system of non-interacting randomly oriented particles was investigated in the Langevin model. The effects of the shell on individual and thermodynamically averaged magnetic properties of the particles were described in a single way using the screening factor A. The screening effects are appeared in a decrease in: (i) the demagnetization factor of the particle core; (ii) the total dipole moment and, accordingly, the external magnetic field created by the particle; (iii) the effective magnetic moment in isothermal magnetization curves and in the Curie law. The magnetically soft shell of the particle also changes the behavior of the particle system in high magnetic fields: the magnetization does not reach saturation, and the differential magnetic susceptibility tends to a non-zero value.</description>

      <title>Four-terminal Josephson junctions: diode effects, anomalous currents and transverse currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a multi-terminal Josephson junction consisting of a central spin-orbit-coupled region with an in-plane Zeeman field connected to four superconducting terminals. This setup allows for the simultaneous measurement of both longitudinal and transverse Josephson currents in response to a phase bias and provides a platform to probe the planar Hall effect in superconducting transport. We find that the system exhibits the anomalous Josephson effect (AJE) and the Josephson diode effect (JDE) when the symmetry between opposite momentum modes is broken. Specifically, breaking the symmetry between $k_x$ and $-k_x$ results in JDE and AJE in the longitudinal Josephson current, while breaking the symmetry between $k_y$ and $-k_y$ leads to a finite transverse Josephson current that also exhibits JDE and AJE. Furthermore, for specific parameter choices, the current-phase relation in the transverse direction supports unidirectional transport, highlighting its potential for superconducting circuit applications. Our setup offers a new route to engineering nonreciprocal superconducting transport.</description>

      <title>Rapid Vapor-Assisted Solution Process of Metal-Organic Chalcogenides for High-Performance Light-Emitting Diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal-organic chalcogenides (MOCs), robust crystalline assemblies composed of coinage metals, chalcogens and organic ligands, are typically synthesized via prolonged, high temperature tarnishing of vacuum-deposited metal films with organochalcogen precursors. The prolonged exposure to high temperatures and the necessity for direct vacuum deposition of silver can induce damage to the underlying films, posing significant challenges to the fabrication of optoelectronic devices, despite their cost-effectiveness and chemical robustness. This study introduces vapor-assisted solution processing, a novel chemical vapor deposition method, enabling remarkably rapid fabrication of luminescent MOC films. Furthermore, the first MOC-based light-emitting diodes (MOCLEDs) are realized, achieving an external quantum efficiency (EQE) approaching 0.1% and electroluminescence peaking at 633 nm. These results highlight the potential of MOCs as next-generation emitters for displays and solid-state lighting. This work offers a promising fabrication strategy and insights for advancing MOCLEDs and expanding their optoelectronic potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Second-order nonlinear optical processes are fundamental to photonics, spectroscopy, and information technologies, with material platforms playing a pivotal role in advancing these applications. Here, we demonstrate the exceptional nonlinear optical properties of the van der Waals crystal 3R-MoS$_2$, a rhombohedral polymorph exhibiting high second-order optical susceptibility ($\chi^{(2)}$) and remarkable second-harmonic generation (SHG) capabilities. By designing high quality factor resonances in 3R-MoS$_2$ metasurfaces supporting quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBIC), we first demonstrate SHG efficiency enhancement exceeding 10$^2$. Additionally, by using degenerate pump-probe spectroscopy, we harness the C$_{3v}$ system's symmetry to realize ultrafast SHG polarization switching with near-unity modulation depth. The operation speeds are limited only by the excitation pulse duration, allowing its characterization via the nonlinear autocorrelation function. These findings establish 3R-MoS$_2$ as a transformative platform for nanoscale nonlinear optics, offering large conversion efficiencies and ultrafast response times for advanced pulse measurement devices, integrated photonics, and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Tailoring nuclear spins order with defects: a Quantum-TCAD study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The full design of relevant systems for quantum applications, ranging from quantum simulation to sensing, is presented using a combination of atomistic methods. A prototypical system features a two-dimensional ordered distribution of spins interacting with out-of-plane spin drivers/probes. It could be realized in wide-bandgap semiconductors through open-volume point defects and functionalized surfaces with low Miller indexes. We study the case of defect electron spins (driver / probe) interacting via hyperfine coupling with $S=1/2$ nuclear spins of H atoms chemisorbed onto \hkl(001) and \hkl(111) 3C-SiC surfaces. We simulate the system fabrication processes with super lattice kinetic Monte Carlo, demonstrating that epitaxial growth under time-dependent conditions is a viable method for achieving controlled abundance or depletion of near-surface point defects. Quantum features are evaluated by means of extensive numerical analysis at a full quantum mechanical level based on calibrated models of interacting spin systems. This analysis includes both stationary (relative stability of ordered states) and time-dependent (protocols) conditions, achieved varying the model parameters (in our case the atomic structure and the external field). We identify a rich scenario of metastable spin-waves in the quantum simulation setting. The interaction between protocols and variable system configurations could hinder the effectiveness of the preparation/measurement phases.</description>

      <title>Biorthogonal basis approach to fractional Chern physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fractional Chern insulator is thought to emerge from the competition between one-particle band topology and strong repulsive interactions. As an attempt to study lattice models of fractional Chern insulators, we introduce a biorthogonal basis constructed from coherent-like states on the von Neumann lattice. Focusing on the fact that this basis is diagonal to the vortex attachment in the infinite-volume limit, we convert the original fermions into composite fermions by applying a two-dimensional Jordan-Wigner transformation to the creation and annihilation operators of the biorthogonal basis. Furthermore, we apply the Hartree-Fock mean-field approximation to handle the interaction Hamiltonian of composite fermions. Due to the biorthogonal nature, the representation of the new Hamiltonian is no longer Hermitian, which implies that the introduction of the approximation does not guarantee the reality of the energy spectrum. In fact, there are many self-consistent solutions with complex spectra. Nevertheless, we numerically find that it is possible to construct a self-consistent solution where the band dispersion is nearly real and the ground-state energy is lower than in other solutions.</description>

Abstract: Strong interaction between electrons in two-dimensional systems in the presence of a high magnetic field gives rise to fractional quantum Hall states that host quasiparticles with fractional charge and fractional exchange statistics. Here, we demonstrate high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy of fractional quantum Hall states in ultra clean Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene devices. Spectroscopy measurements show sharp excitations that have been predicted to emerge when electrons fractionalize into bound states of quasiparticles. We find energy gaps for candidate non-abelian fractional states that are larger by a factor of five than other related systems - for example semiconductor heterostructures - and this suggests bilayer graphene is an ideal platform for the manipulation of these quasiparticles and for the creation of a topological quantum bit. We also find previously unobserved fractional states in our very clean graphene samples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Berry curvature, a momentum space property, can manifest itself in current responses. The well-known anomalous Hall effect in time-reversal-breaking systems arises from a Berry curvature monopole. In time-reversal-invariant materials, a second-order Hall conductivity emerges from a Berry curvature dipole. Recently, it has been shown that a Berry curvature quadrupole induces a third-order ac Hall response in systems that break time reversal ($K$) and a fourfold rotational ($C_{4}$) symmetry, while remaining invariant under the combination of the two ($C_{4}K$). In this letter, we demonstrate that incident light can induce a $\rm dc$ Hall current in such systems, driven by the Berry curvature quadrupole. We consider a combination of a static $\rm dc$ electric field and an ac light-induced electric field. We calculate the current perpendicular to both the static electric field and the fourfold axis. Remarkably, the induced current is generically spin-polarized. A net charge current appears for light that is linearly or elliptically polarized, but not for circular polarization. In contrast, the spin current remains unchanged when the polarization of light is varied. This allows for rich possibilities such as generating a spin current by shining circularly polarized light on an altermagnetic material. We demonstrate this physics using a two-dimensional toy model for altermagnets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transport of Bloch electrons under strong fields is traditionally understood through two mechanisms: intraband Bloch oscillations and interband Zener tunneling. Here, we propose an oscillation mechanism induced by the interband quantum metric, which would significantly affect the electron dynamics under strong fields. By considering the multiband dynamics to the second order of the density matrix, we reveal that quantum metric induced oscillations (QMOs) persist regardless of band dispersion, even in exactly dispersionless flat bands. The resultant drift current can reach a magnitude comparable to the Bloch oscillation induced drift current in systems where interband tunneling is negligible. Notably, the QMO induced drift current increases linearly with electric field strength under the constraints of time-reversal or spatial-inversion symmetry, emerging as the primary delocalized current. We further show that both one-dimensional and two-dimensional superlattices are potential platforms for investigating QMO.</description>

Abstract: Optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) is a useful technique for studying interactions between local spins (magnetic ions) and carrier gas. We present the ODMR study of single (Cd,Mn)Te/(Cd,Mg)Te quantum wells (QWs) with the hole gas. We observe different characteristics of the ODMR signals obtained simultaneously using the optical signals of neutral and positively charged exciton. From that, we infer an existence of local fluctuations of carrier gas density resulting in separate populations of Mn$^{2+}$ ions. At the same time, the shape of the ODMR signal contains information about the temperature of the magnetic ions involved in the absorption of the MW. Studying it in detail provides even more information about the interactions with charge carriers. In the QW, two separate ensembles of ions are thermalized differently in the presence of carriers.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Based Real-Space Framework for Realizing Flat Bands and Unveiling Nodal-Line Touchings</title>

Abstract: Flat band (FB) systems provide ideal playgrounds for studying correlation physics, whereas multi-orbital characteristics in real materials are distinguished from most simple FB models. Here, we propose a systematic and versatile framework for FB constructions in tight-binding (TB) models based on symmetric compact localized states (CLSs), integrating lattice and orbital degrees of freedom. We first demonstrate that any CLS can be symmetrized into a representation of the point group, which remains valid for high orbitals with finite spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Second, we determine the candidate CLS sites according to lattice symmetry, and simplify the hopping as a linear mapping between two Hilbert spaces: one of CLS sites and another of their adjacent sites. The existence of FBs depends on a non-empty kernel of the mapping. Finally, we distinguish eigenstates in the kernel to qualify as a CLS. To illustrate the versatility of our framework, we construct three representative FB models: one in two dimensions (2D) and the rest in three dimensions (3D). All of them lack special lattice structures and incorporate high orbitals. Notably, the 3D FBs can exhibit not only band touchings at points but also along lines, a feature of significant physical interest. For a comprehensive understanding, we derive a concise criterion for determining band touchings, which provides a natural explanation for the occurrence of both gapped and gapless FBs. By unifying symmetry principles in real space, our work offers a systematic approach to constructing FBs across diverse lattice systems. This framework opens new avenues for understanding and engineering FB systems, with potential implications for correlated quantum phenomena and exotic phases of matter.</description>

      <title>From non-equilibrium Green's functions to Lattice Wigner: A toy model for quantum nanofluidics simulations</title>

Abstract: Recent experiments of fluid transport in nano-channels have shown evidence of a coupling between charge-fluctuations in polar fluids and electronic excitations in graphene solids, which may lead to a significant reduction of friction a phenomenon dubbed "negative quantum friction". In this paper, we present a semi-classical mesoscale Boltzmann-Wigner lattice kinetic model of quantum- nanoscale transport and perform a numerical study of the effects of the quantum interactions on the evolution of a one-dimensional nano-fluid subject to a periodic external potential. It is shown that the effects of quantum fluctuations become visible once the quantum length scale (Fermi wavelength) of the quasiparticles becomes comparable to the lengthscale of the external potential. Under such conditions, quantum fluctuations are mostly felt on the odd kinetic moments, while the even ones remain nearly unaffected because they are "protected" by thermal fluctuations. It is hoped that the present Boltzmann-Wigner lattice model and extensions thereof may offer a useful tool for the computer simulation of quantum-nanofluidic transport phenomena at scales of engineering relevance.</description>

      <title>Complex Frequency Detection in a Subsystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we systematically explore the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) and its associated complex-frequency detection in the context of a frequency-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. This Hamiltonian arises from the self-energy correction of the subsystem and can be calculated exactly within our theoretical model, without the need for any approximations. Additionally, complex frequency detection, which encompasses complex frequency excitation, synthesis, and fingerprint, enables us to detect the physical responses induced by the complex driving frequencies. Our calculations reveal that both complex frequency excitation and synthesis are incompatible with the non-Hermitian approximation and are unable to characterize the presence or abscence of the NHSE. In contrast, the complex-frequency fingerprint successfully detects the novel responses induced by the NHSE through the introduction of a double-frequency Green's function. Our work provides a platform for studying non-Hermitian physics and their novel response in quantum systems rigorously without relying on any approximations.</description>

      <title>Weak $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Supertopology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00042v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crystal symmetries can enforce all bands of a material to be topological, a property that is commonly referred to as ``supertopology". Here, we determine the symmetry-enforced $\mathbb{Z}_2$ supertopologies of non-magnetic centrosymmetric materials with weak and strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC). For weak (i.e., negligible) SOC, crystal symmetries can enforce Dirac nodal lines protected by a $\pi$-Berry phase, while for strong SOC, crystal symmetries can give rise to nontrival weak $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologies in 2D subplanes of the 3D Brillouin zone. We catalogue all centrosymmetric space groups whose symmetries enforce these $\mathbb{Z}_2$ supertopologies. Suitable material realizations are identified and experimental signatures of the supertopologies, such as quantum spin Hall states, are being discussed.</description>

      <title>Thermal Radiation Force and Torque on Moving Nanostructures with Anisotropic Optical Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nanoscale objects moving relative to a thermal radiation bath experience a drag force due to the imbalance in their interaction with the blue- and redshifted components of the electromagnetic field. Here, we show that, in addition to this drag force, moving nanostructures with an anisotropic optical response experience a lateral force and a torque that substantially modify their trajectory. These phenomena emerge from the additional coupling between the electromagnetic field components polarized parallel and perpendicular to the trajectory, enabled by the anisotropic response of the nanostructure. This work unveils the intricate dynamics of anisotropic nanostructures moving in a thermal radiation bath.</description>

      <title>Exact quantum critical states with a superconducting quantum processor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anderson localization physics features three fundamental types of eigenstates: extended, localized, and critical. Confirming the presence of critical states necessitates either advancing the analysis to the thermodynamic limit or identifying a universal mechanism which can rigorously determine these states. Here we report the unambiguous experimental realization of critical states, governed by a rigorous mechanism for exact quantum critical states, and further observe a generalized mechanism that quasiperiodic zeros in hopping couplings protect the critical states. Leveraging a superconducting quantum processor with up to 56 qubits, we implement a programmable mosaic model with tunable couplings and on-site potentials. By measuring time-evolved observables, we identify both delocalized dynamics and incommensurately distributed zeros in the couplings, which are the defining features of the critical states. We map the localized-to-critical phase transition and demonstrate that critical states persist until quasiperiodic zeros are removed by strong long-range couplings, highlighting a novel generalized mechanism discovered in this experiment and shown with rigorous theory. Finally, we resolve the energy-dependent transition between localized and critical states, revealing the presence of anomalous mobility edges.</description>

Abstract: H. Lamb considered the classical dynamics of a vibrating particle embedded in an elastic medium before the development of quantum theory. Lamb was interested in how the back-action of the elastic waves generated can damp the vibrations of the particle. We propose a quantum version of Lamb's model. We show that this model is exactly solvable by using a multimode Bogoliubov transformation. We find that the exact system ground state is a multimode squeezed vacuum state, and we obtain the exact Bogoliubov frequencies by numerically solving a nonlinear integral equation. A closed-form expression for the damping rate of the particle is obtained, and it agrees with the result obtained by perturbation theory. The model provides a solvable example of the damped quantum harmonic oscillator.</description>

      <title>Periodic phase slips and frequency comb generation at tunable microwave frequencies in superconducting diabolo structures</title>

Abstract: Superconductors are characterized by macroscopic phase coherence and have enabled cryogenic electronics and quantum technologies. Recent advances in 3D nanofabrication now offer possibilities for tuning functional properties relevant for on-chip 3D integration of superconductors. However, non-equilibrium phenomena in 3D nanostructures exposed to transport currents remain largeley unexplored. Here, we employ numerical simulations to investigate phase slips -- discrete $2\pi$ jumps in the phase of the superconducting order parameter -- in a tubular Nb superconductor with a central constriction, which is subjected to both direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) transport currents. We find that under DC drive, the system stabilizes periodic phase slips, resulting in GHz voltage oscillations. Introducing an additional AC frequency modulation generates microwave frequency combs which depend characteristically on the interaction between moving vortices and phase slips. Our findings open avenues for developing on-chip frequency comb generators in 3D cryoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Optomechanical quantum bus for donor spins in silicon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Silicon is the foundation of current information technology, and also a very promising platform for the future quantum information technology. This is because the silicon-based qubits exhibit some of the longest coherence times and silicon is the underlying material for advanced photonics. In addition, photonics structures in silicon can be used to define optomechanical cavities where the vibrations of nanoscale mechanical resonators can be probed down to the quantum level with laser light. Here, we propose to bring all these developments together by coupling silicon donor spins into optomechanical structures. We show theoretically and numerically that this allows telecom wavelength optical readout of the spin-qubits and implementing high-fidelity entangling two-qubit gates between donor spins that are spatially separated by tens of micrometers. We present an optimized geometry of the proposed device and discuss with the help of numerical simulations the predicted performance of the proposed quantum bus. We analyze the optomechanical spin readout fidelity find the optimal donor species for the strain and magnetic field gradient coupling. We also study the gate fidelity of a two-qubit gate for a universal gate set and discuss future developments.</description>
