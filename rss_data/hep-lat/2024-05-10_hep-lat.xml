      <title>On the mixing between flavor singlets in lattice gauge theories coupled to matter fields in multiple representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide the first extensive, numerical study of the non-trivial problem of mixing between flavor-singlet composite states emerging in strongly coupled lattice field theories with matter field content consisting of fermions transforming in different representations of the gauge group. The theory of interest is the minimal candidate for a composite Higgs model that also accommodates a mechanism for top partial compositeness: the $Sp(4)$ gauge theory coupled to two (Dirac) fermions transforming as the fundamental and three as the two-index antisymmetric representation of the gauge group, respectively. We apply an admixture of APE and Wuppertal smearings, as well as the generalized eigenvalue problem approach, to two-point functions involving flavor-singlet mesons, for ensembles having time extent longer than the space extent. We demonstrate that, in the region of lattice parameter space accessible to this study, both masses and mixing angles can be measured effectively, despite the presence of (numerically noisy) contributions from disconnected diagrams.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative determination of the $N_f=2+1$ QCD sphaleron rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strong sphaleron rate, i.e., the rate of real time QCD topological transitions, is a key phenomenological quantity, playing a fundamental role in several physical contexts. In heavy-ion collisions, a non-vanishing rate can lead to the so-called Chiral Magnetic Effect. In early-Universe cosmology, instead, it can be related to the rate of thermal production of QCD axions. In this talk, we present the first reliable fully non-perturbative computation of the strong sphaleron rate in $N_f=2+1$ QCD at the physical point by means of lattice simulations, in a range of temperatures going from 200 MeV to 600 MeV. Our strategy is based on the inversion of lattice correlators via a recently-proposed modified version of the Backus-Gilbert method.</description>

      <title>Optical Conductivity in Symmetric Mass Generation Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetric mass generation (SMG) insulators are interaction-driven, featureless Mott insulating states in quantum many-body fermionic systems. Recent advancements suggest that zeros in the fermion Green's function could lead to non-vanishing negative optical conductivity in SMG insulators, even below the charge excitation gap. This study explores the origin of this unusual behavior through the lens of pole-zero duality, highlighting a critical issue where the current operator becomes unbounded, rendering the response function unphysical. By employing a lattice model, we derive a well-behaved lattice regularization of the current operator, enabling a detailed study of optical conductivity in SMG insulators. Utilizing both analytical and numerical methods, including strong-coupling expansions, we confirm that SMG insulators exhibit no optical conductivity at low energies below the charge gap, effectively resolving the paradox. This work not only deepens our understanding of quantum many-body phenomena but also lays a robust theoretical groundwork for future experimental explorations of SMG materials.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chiral magnetic effect (CME) is a collective quantum phenomenon that arises from the interplay between gauge field topology and fermion chiral anomaly, encompassing a wide range of physical systems from semimetals to quark-gluon plasma. This review, with a focus on CME and related effects in heavy ion collisions, aims to provide an introductory discussion on its conceptual foundation and measurement methodology, a timely update on the present status in terms of experimental findings and theoretical progress, as well as an outlook into the open problems and future developments.</description>

      <title>VAIM - CFF: A variational autoencoder inverse mapper solution to Compton form factor extraction from deeply virtual exclusive reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a new methodology for extracting Compton form factors (CFFs) in from deeply virtual exclusive reactions such as the unpolarized DVCS cross section using a specialized inverse problem solver, a variational autoencoder inverse mapper (VAIM). The VAIM-CFF framework not only allows us access to a fitted solution set possibly containing multiple solutions in the extraction of all 8 CFFs from a single cross section measurement, but also accesses the lost information contained in the forward mapping from CFFs to cross section. We investigate various assumptions and their effects on the predicted CFFs such as cross section organization, number of extracted CFFs, use of uncertainty quantification technique, and inclusion of prior physics information. We then use dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis to visualize the missing physics information tracked in the latent space of the VAIM framework. Through re-framing the extraction of CFFs as an inverse problem, we gain access to fundamental properties of the problem not comprehensible in standard fitting methodologies: exploring the limits of the information encoded in deeply virtual exclusive experiments.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models as Stochastic Quantization in Lattice Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we establish a direct connection between generative diffusion models (DMs) and stochastic quantization (SQ). The DM is realized by approximating the reversal of a stochastic process dictated by the Langevin equation, generating samples from a prior distribution to effectively mimic the target distribution. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the DM can serve as a global sampler for generating quantum lattice field configurations in two-dimensional $\phi^4$ theory. We demonstrate that DMs can notably reduce autocorrelation times in the Markov chain, especially in the critical region where standard Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) algorithms experience critical slowing down. The findings can potentially inspire further advancements in lattice field theory simulations, in particular in cases where it is expensive to generate large ensembles.</description>

      <title>Leveraging neural control variates for enhanced precision in lattice field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Results obtained with stochastic methods have an inherent uncertainty due to the finite number of samples that can be achieved in practice. In lattice QCD this problem is particularly salient in some observables like, for instance, observables involving one or more baryons and it is the main problem preventing the calculation of nuclear forces from first principles. The method of control variables has been used extensively in statistics and it amounts to computing the expectation value of the difference between the observable of interest and another observable whose average is known to be zero but is correlated with the observable of interest. Recently, control variates methods emerged as a promising solution in the context of lattice field theories. In our current study, instead of relying on an educated guess to determine the control variate, we utilize a neural network to parametrize this function. Using 1+1 dimensional scalar field theory as a testbed, we demonstrate that this neural network approach yields substantial improvements. Notably, our findings indicate that the neural network ansatz is particularly effective in the strong coupling regime.</description>

      <title>Trace anomaly form factors from lattice QCD</title>

Abstract: The hadron mass can be obtained through the calculation of the trace of the energy-momentum tensor in the hadron which includes the trace anomaly and sigma terms. The anomaly due to conformal symmetry breaking is believed to be an important ingredient for hadron mass generation and confinement. In this work, we will present the calculation of the glue part of the trace anomaly form factors of the pion up to $Q^2\sim 4.3~\mathrm{GeV}^2$ and the nucleon up to $Q^2\sim 1~\mathrm{GeV}^2$. The calculations are performed on a domain wall fermion ensemble with overlap valence quarks at seven valence pion masses varying from $\sim 250$ to $\sim 540$ MeV, including the unitary point $\sim 340$ MeV. We calculate the radius of the glue trace anomaly for the pion and the nucleon from the $z$ expansion. By performing a two-dimensional Fourier transform on the glue trace anomaly form factors in the infinite momentum frame with no energy transfer, we also obtain their spatial distributions for several valence quark masses. The results are qualitatively extrapolated to the physical valence pion mass with systematic errors from the unphysical sea quark mass, discretization effects in the renormalization sum rule, and finite-volume effects to be addressed in the future. We find the pion's form factor changes sign, as does its spatial distribution, for light quark masses. This explains how the trace anomaly contribution to the pion mass approaches zero toward the chiral limit.</description>

      <title>Solving lattice gauge theories using the quantum Krylov algorithm and qubitization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08859v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing vacuum states of lattice gauge theories (LGTs) containing fermionic degrees of freedom can present significant challenges for classical computation using Monte-Carlo methods. Quantum algorithms may offer a pathway towards more scalable computation of groundstate properties of LGTs. However, a comprehensive understanding of the quantum computational resources required for such a problem is thus far lacking. In this work, we investigate using the quantum subspace expansion (QSE) algorithm to compute the groundstate of the Schwinger model, an archetypal LGT describing quantum electrodynamics in one spatial dimension. We perform numerical simulations, including the effect of measurement noise, to extrapolate the resources required for the QSE algorithm to achieve a desired accuracy for a range of system sizes. Using this, we present a full analysis of the resources required to compute LGT vacuum states using a quantum algorithm using qubitization within a fault tolerant framework. We develop of a novel method for performing qubitization of a LGT Hamiltonian based on a 'linear combination of unitaries' (LCU) approach. The cost of the corresponding block encoding operation scales as $\tilde{O}(N)$ with system size $N$. Including the corresponding prefactors, our method reduces the gate cost by multiple orders of magnitude when compared to previous LCU methods for the QSE algorithm, which scales as $\tilde{O}(N^2)$ when applied to the Schwinger model. While the qubit and single circuit T-gate cost resulting from our resource analysis is appealing to early fault-tolerant implementation, we find that the number of shots required to avoid numerical instability within the QSE procedure must be significantly reduced in order to improve the feasibility of the methodology we consider and discuss how this might be achieved.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian simulation of minimal holographic sparsified SYK model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The circuit complexity for Hamiltonian simulation of the sparsified SYK model with $N$ Majorana fermions and $q=4$ (quartic interactions) which retains holographic features (referred to as `minimal holographic sparsified SYK') with $k\ll N^{3}/24$ (where $k$ is the total number of interaction terms times 1/$N$) using second-order Trotter method and Jordan-Wigner encoding is found to be $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(k^{p}N^{3/2} \log N (\mathcal{J}t)^{3/2}\varepsilon^{-1/2})$ where $t$ is the simulation time, $\varepsilon$ is the desired error in the implementation of the unitary $U = \exp(-iHt)$, $\mathcal{J}$ is the disorder strength, and $p &lt; 1$. This complexity implies that with less than a hundred logical qubits and about $10^{6}$ gates, it will be possible to achieve an advantage in this model and simulate real-time dynamics up to scrambling time.</description>
