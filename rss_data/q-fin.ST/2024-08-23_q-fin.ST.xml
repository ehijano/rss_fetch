      <title>Enhancing Causal Discovery in Financial Networks with Piecewise Quantile Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial networks can be constructed using statistical dependencies found within the price series of speculative assets. Across the various methods used to infer these networks, there is a general reliance on predictive modelling to capture cross-correlation effects. These methods usually model the flow of mean-response information, or the propagation of volatility and risk within the market. Such techniques, though insightful, don't fully capture the broader distribution-level causality that is possible within speculative markets. This paper introduces a novel approach, combining quantile regression with a piecewise linear embedding scheme - allowing us to construct causality networks that identify the complex tail interactions inherent to financial markets. Applying this method to 260 cryptocurrency return series, we uncover significant tail-tail causal effects and substantial causal asymmetry. We identify a propensity for coins to be self-influencing, with comparatively sparse cross variable effects. Assessing all link types in conjunction, Bitcoin stands out as the primary influencer - a nuance that is missed in conventional linear mean-response analyses. Our findings introduce a comprehensive framework for modelling distributional causality, paving the way towards more holistic representations of causality in financial markets.</description>

      <title>EX-DRL: Hedging Against Heavy Losses with EXtreme Distributional Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for modeling loss distributions have shown promise in developing hedging strategies in derivatives markets. A common approach in DRL involves learning the quantiles of loss distributions at specified levels using Quantile Regression (QR). This method is particularly effective in option hedging due to its direct quantile-based risk assessment, such as Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR). However, these risk measures depend on the accurate estimation of extreme quantiles in the loss distribution's tail, which can be imprecise in QR-based DRL due to the rarity and extremity of tail data, as highlighted in the literature. To address this issue, we propose EXtreme DRL (EX-DRL), which enhances extreme quantile prediction by modeling the tail of the loss distribution with a Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD). This method introduces supplementary data to mitigate the scarcity of extreme quantile observations, thereby improving estimation accuracy through QR. Comprehensive experiments on gamma hedging options demonstrate that EX-DRL improves existing QR-based models by providing more precise estimates of extreme quantiles, thereby improving the computation and reliability of risk metrics for complex financial risk management.</description>

      <title>Large Investment Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional quantitative investment research is encountering diminishing returns alongside rising labor and time costs. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the Large Investment Model (LIM), a novel research paradigm designed to enhance both performance and efficiency at scale. LIM employs end-to-end learning and universal modeling to create an upstream foundation model capable of autonomously learning comprehensive signal patterns from diverse financial data spanning multiple exchanges, instruments, and frequencies. These "global patterns" are subsequently transferred to downstream strategy modeling, optimizing performance for specific tasks. We detail the system architecture design of LIM, address the technical challenges inherent in this approach, and outline potential directions for future research. The advantages of LIM are demonstrated through a series of numerical experiments on cross-instrument prediction for commodity futures trading, leveraging insights from stock markets.</description>

      <title>Defining and comparing SICR-events for classifying impaired loans under IFRS 9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03080v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The IFRS 9 accounting standard requires the prediction of credit deterioration in financial instruments, i.e., significant increases in credit risk (SICR). However, the definition of such a SICR-event is inherently ambiguous, given its current reliance on evaluating the change in the estimated probability of default (PD) against some arbitrary threshold. We examine the shortcomings of this PD-comparison approach and propose an alternative framework for generating SICR-definitions based on three parameters: delinquency, stickiness, and the outcome period. Having varied these framework parameters, we obtain 27 unique SICR-definitions and fit logistic regression models accordingly using rich South African mortgage and macroeconomic data. For each definition and corresponding model, the resulting SICR-rates are analysed at the portfolio-level on their stability over time and their responsiveness to economic downturns. At the account-level, we compare both the accuracy and dynamicity of the SICR-predictions, and discover several interesting trends and trade-offs. These results can help any bank with appropriately setting the three framework parameters in defining SICR-events for prediction purposes. We demonstrate this process by comparing the best-performing SICR-model to the PD-comparison approach, and show the latter's inferiority as an early-warning system. Our work can therefore guide the formulation, modelling, and testing of any SICR-definition, thereby promoting the timeous recognition of credit losses; the main imperative of IFRS 9.</description>
