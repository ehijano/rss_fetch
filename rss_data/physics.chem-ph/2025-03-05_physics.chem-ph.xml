      <title>Towards Environment-Sensitive Molecular Inference via Mixed Integer Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional QSAR/QSPR and inverse QSAR/QSPR methods often assume that chemical properties are dictated by single molecules, overlooking the influence of molecular interactions and environmental factors. In this paper, we introduce a novel QSAR/QSPR framework that can capture the combined effects of multiple molecules (e.g., small molecules or polymers) and experimental conditions on property values. We design a feature function to integrate the information of multiple molecules and the environment. Specifically, for the property Flory-Huggins $\chi$-parameter, which characterizes the thermodynamic properties between the solute and the solvent, and varies in temperatures, we demonstrate through computational experimental results that our approach can achieve a competitively high learning performance compared to existing works on predicting $\chi$-parameter values, while inferring the solute polymers with up to 50 non-hydrogen atoms in their monomer forms in a relatively short time. A comparison study with the simulation software J-OCTA demonstrates that the polymers inferred by our methods are of high quality.</description>

      <title>Direct detonation initiation and propagation in methane/air mixtures containing coal particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanisms of direct detonation initiation (DDI) in methane/air mixtures containing coal particles are investigated through simulations conducted using the Eulerian-Lagrangian method in a two-dimensional configuration. Methane-air combustion is modelled with a detailed chemical mechanism involving 36 species and 219 reactions, while coal particle surface reactions are computed using a kinetic/diffusion-limited rate model. The findings indicate that shock waves generated from the hotspot can initiate detonation through heterogeneous and homogeneous reactions, with contributions from both methane and particle combustion. Coal particle surface reactions provide the dominant energy for detonation initiation, whereas gas-phase reactions enhance detonation stability during propagation. The difficulty of achieving detonation initiation exhibits a non-linear dependence on particle concentrations and gas equivalence ratios. An optimal particle concentration and gas equivalence ratio for successful DDI is identified. Smaller particles are found to facilitate detonation initiation more effectively. Key processes in DDI of two-phase mixtures are identified, including particle heating, methane combustion, and particle burning. Three DDI modes, critical, stable, and cell-free, are observed based on particle concentration. As particle concentration increases, the temperatures of both particles and gas become close, initially rising and then decreasing with further increases in particle concentration. Additionally, the introduction of coal particles gives rise to two distinct stages in gas-phase reactions.</description>

      <title>A hybrid model of sulphation reactions: stochastic particles in a random continuum environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a hybrid stochastic-continuum model to study the sulphation of calcium carbonate and the consequent formation of gypsum, a key phenomenon driving marble deterioration. While calcium carbonate and gypsum are continuous random fields evolving according to random ordinary differential equations, the dynamics of sulfuric acid particles follows It\^o-type stochastic differential equations. The particle evolution incorporates both strong repulsion between particles via the Lennard-Jones potential, and non-local interactions with the continuum environment. The particle-continuum coupling is also achieved through the chemical reaction, modeled as a Poisson counting process. We simulate the spatiotemporal evolution of this corrosion process using the Euler-Maruyama algorithm with varying initial data combined with finite elements to take care of the spatial discretization. Despite symmetric initial data, our simulations highlight an uneven progression of corrosion due to the stochastic influences in the model.</description>

      <title>Density functional benchmark for quadruple hydrogen bonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen bonding is an important non-covalent interaction that plays a major role in molecular self-organization and supramolecular structures. It can be described accurately with ab initio quantum chemical wave function methods, which become computationally expensive for large molecular assemblies. Density functional theory (DFT) offers a better balance between accuracy and computational cost, and can be routinely applied to large systems. A large number of density functional approximations (DFAs) has been developed, but their accuracy depend on the application, necessitating benchmark studies to guide their selection for use in applications. Some of us have recently determined highly accurate hydrogen bonding energies of 14 quadruply hydrogen-bonded dimers by extrapolating coupled-cluster energies to the complete basis set limit as well as extrapolating electron correlation contributions with a continued-fraction approach [U. Ahmed et al, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2024, 26, 24470]. In this work, we study the reproduction of these bonding energies at the DFT level using 152 DFAs. The top ten functionals are composed of eight variants of the Berkeley functionals both with and without dispersion corrections, and two Minnesota 2011 functionals augmented with a further dispersion correction. We find the B97M-V functional with the non-local correlation functional replaced by an empirical D3BJ dispersion correction to be the best functional, while changes to the dispersion part in other Berkeley functionals lead to poorer performance in our study.</description>

      <title>Chemically resolved nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy by longitudinal magnetization detection with a diamond magnetometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-inductive magnetometers based on solid-state spins offer a promising solution for small-volume nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) detection. A remaining challenge is to operate at a sufficiently high magnetic field to resolve chemical shifts at the part-per-billion level. Here, we demonstrate a Ramsey-M_z protocol that uses Ramsey interferometry to convert an analyte's transverse spin precession into a longitudinal magnetization (M_z), which is subsequently modulated and detected with a diamond magnetometer. We record NMR spectra at B0=0.32 T with a fractional spectral resolution of ~350 ppb, limited by the stability of the electromagnet bias field. We perform NMR spectroscopy on a ~1 nL detection volume of ethanol and resolve the chemical shift structure with negligible distortion. Through simulation, we show that the protocol can be extended to fields up to B0=3 T, with minimal spectral distortion, using composite nuclear-spin inversion pulses. For sub-nanoliter analyte volumes, we estimate a resolution of ~1 ppb and concentration sensitivity of ~40 mM s^{1/2} is feasible with improvements to the sensor design. Our results establish diamond magnetometers as high-resolution NMR detectors in the moderate magnetic field regime, with potential applications in metabolomics and pharmaceutical research.</description>

      <title>Polymerization of environmentally stable 1D-NF chain with high-energy density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on first-principles calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics methods, the energies density, suitable precursor, and synthesis conditions of Cmca-type NF compound with 1D chain feature are investigated. We find that if using Al as reducing agent, it possesses an gravimetric energy density of 13.55 kJ/g higher than that of cg-N (9.70 kJ/g), since it has both polymerized nitrogen and strong oxidizing F atoms. The cis N2F2 molecules is a suitable precursor, and they can polymerize to cis NF chains above 90 GPa. Furthermore, the phase diagram of Cmca-type NF compound is established at conditions of 0-3000 K and 0-200 GPa. Importantly, NF chains polymerized under high temperature and pressure can be quenched to ambient conditions.</description>

      <title>New investigation of the electronic and structural properties of (Mg,Ti)-doped and co-doped ZnO structures: A DFT and DFT+U study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the novelty of the crystalline and electronic structure of (Mg,Ti)-doped ZnO and the co-doped Zn1-x-yMgxTiyO structures using Gaussian and plane-wave basis sets, as implemented in the CP2K code. The goal of incorporating low concentration of Mg and Ti into ZnO is to influence its electronic properties without significantly altering its geometrical and crystalline structure. Within the framework of density functional theory (DFT), we analyze various doped and co-doped configurations. Our results show that Ti-doped ZnO exhibits an indirect band gap, while Mg doping preserves the direct semiconductor behavior of ZnO structure, with an increase in band gap energy. Additionally, the co-doped Zn1-x-yMgxTiyO system, at varying concentrations of Ti and Mg, displays minimal lattice deformation. These findings suggest that this material could be a promising candidate for transparent electronic devices, highlighting the importance of understanding the electronic structure of ZnO to optimize its physical properties.</description>

      <title>Universal analytical modeling of coated plasmonic particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From a structural point of view, plasmonic nanoparticles are always at least two-layer structures with a dielectric layer of stabilizing, targeting, fluorescent, Raman, or other functional molecules, often embedded in a matrix such as porous silica. To optimize the optical properties of such bioconjugates, one needs efficient analytical models based on simple physical ideas and with reasonable accuracy comparable to rigorous numerical methods requiring significant computer resources. Here, we present such type models based on a combination of the modal expansion method (MEM) and the dipole equivalence method (DEM). The MEM+DEM approach makes it possible to use the MEM parameters of the original metal particles and does not require additional numerical calculations to build models for bilayered or multilayered conjugates. Our analytical solutions depend on the particle shape, the shell thickness, and the shell refractive index, regardless of the particle size and the metal's nature. To illustrate the universality of our method, we calculate extinction and scattering spectra of gold and silver nanorods, nanodiscs, triangle nanoprisms, bicones, and bipyramids with a dielectric coating thickness from 0 to 30 nm. For the main plasmonic peaks, we found excellent agreement between our analytical method and numerical simulations performed with COMSOL. Due to the simplicity and reasonable accuracy of the MEM+DEM analytical models, they can help apply machine learning to predict various plasmonic responses such as light absorption, scattering, SERS, and metal-enhanced fluorescence.</description>

      <title>Viscosity of polymer melts using non-affine theory based on vibrational modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Viscosity, a fundamental transport and rheological property of liquids, quantifies the resistance to relative motion between molecular layers and plays a critical role in understanding material behavior. Conventional methods, such as the Green-Kubo (GK) approach, rely on time integration of correlation functions, which becomes computationally intensive near the glass transition due to slow correlation decay. A recently proposed method based on non-affine lattice dynamics (NALD) and instantaneous normal mode analysis offers a promising alternative for estimating the viscosity. In this study, we apply the NALD approach to compute the viscosity of the Kremer-Grest polymer system over a range of temperatures and compare these results with those from the GK method and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings reveal that all vibration modes, including the instantaneous normal modes, contribute to the viscosity. This work presents an efficient framework for calculating viscosity across diverse systems, including near the glass transition where the GK method is no longer applicable. Also, it opens the avenue to understanding the role of different vibrational modes linked with structure, facilitating the design of materials with tunable rheological properties.</description>

Abstract: We use an exact Moreau-Yosida regularized formulation to obtain the exchange-correlation potential for periodic systems. We reveal a profound connection between rigorous mathematical principles and efficient numerical implementation, which marks the first computation of a Moreau-Yosida-based inversion for physical systems. We develop a mathematically rigorous inversion algorithm which is demonstrated for representative bulk materials, specifically bulk silicon, gallium arsenide, and potassium chloride. This inversion algorithm allows the construction of rigorous error bounds that we are able to verify numerically. This unlocks a new pathway to analyze Kohn-Sham inversion methods, which we expect in turn to foster mathematical approaches for developing approximate functionals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel multi-scale embedding scheme that links conventional QM/MM embedding and bootstrap embedding (BE) to allow simulations of large chemical systems on limited quantum devices. We also propose a mixed-basis BE scheme that facilitates BE calculations on extended systems using classical computers with limited memory resources. Benchmark data suggest the combination of these two strategies as a robust path in attaining the correlation energies of large realistic systems, combining the proven accuracy of BE with chemical and biological systems of interest in a lower computational cost method. Due to the flexible tunability of the resource requirements and systematic fragment construction, future developments in the realization of quantum computers naturally offer improved accuracy for multi-scale BE calculations.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive theory for relativistic polaritonic chemistry: a four components ab initio treatment of molecular systems coupled to quantum fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12757v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new ab initio approach to study molecules containing heavy atoms strongly interacting with quantum fields in optical devices. The theory has been derived from the relativistic quantum electrodynamics (QED) introducing the approximations needed to provide a formalism suitable for relativistic quantum chemistry. This framework represents the ideal starting point to extend the main quantum chemistry methods to relativistic polaritonic. The Polaritonic Dirac Hartree Fock (Pol-DHF) approach is the first method we propose based on this theory. Pol-DHF allows for the simulation of field induced effects on the ground and excited state properties of heavy transition metals molecular complexes. The method is able to include not only the effects of the photons, but can in principle be extended also to include explicit interactions with positrons. Application of Pol-DHF to three metal hydrides shows that the magnitude of both polaritonic and relativistic effects can be comparable when relativistic effects are getting more important. Due to an accurate description of spin-orbit coupling, the method is able to reproduce polaritonic effects happening at the crossing between singlet and triplet potential energy surfaces.</description>

      <title>Polarizable Water Model with Ab Initio Neural Network Dynamic Charges and Spontaneous Charge Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating water accurately has been a challenge due to the complexity of describing polarization and intermolecular charge transfer. Quantum mechanical (QM) electronic structures provide an accurate description of polarization in response to local environments, which is nevertheless too expensive for large water systems. In this study, we have developed a polarizable water model integrating Charge Model 5 atomic charges at the level of second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory, predicted by an accurate and transferable Charge Neural Network (ChargeNN) model. The spontaneous intermolecular charge transfer has been explicitly accounted for, enabling a precise treatment of hydrogen bonds and out-of-plane polarization. Our ChargeNN water model successfully reproduces various properties of water in gas, liquid and solid phases. For example, ChargeNN correctly captures the hydrogen-bond stretching peak and bending-libration combination band, which are absent in the spectra using fixed charges, highlighting the significance of accurate polarization and charge transfer. Finally, the molecular dynamical simulations using ChargeNN for liquid water and a large water droplet with a $\sim$4.5 nm radius reveal that the strong interfacial electric fields are concurrently induced by the partial collapse of the hydrogen-bond network and surface-to-interior charge transfer. Our study paves the way for QM-polarizable force fields, aiming for large-scale molecular simulations with high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Relevant, hidden, and frustrated information in high-dimensional analyses of complex dynamical systems with internal noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09412v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extracting from trajectory data meaningful information to understand complex molecular systems might be non-trivial. High-dimensional analyses are typically assumed to be desirable, if not required, to prevent losing important information. But to what extent such high-dimensionality is really needed/beneficial often remains unclear. Here we challenge such a fundamental general problem. As a representative case of a system with internal dynamical complexity, we study atomistic molecular dynamics trajectories of liquid water and ice coexisting in dynamical equilibrium at the solid/liquid transition temperature. To attain an intrinsically high-dimensional analysis, we use as an example the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) descriptor, obtaining a large dataset containing 2.56e6 576-dimensional SOAP vectors that we analyze in various ways. Our results demonstrate how the time-series data contained in one single SOAP dimension accounting only &lt;0.001 of the total dataset's variance (neglected and discarded in typical variance-based dimensionality-reduction approaches) allows resolving a remarkable amount of information, classifying/discriminating the bulk of water and ice phases, as well as two solid-interface and liquid-interface layers as four statistically distinct dynamical molecular environments. Adding more dimensions to this one is found not only ineffective but even detrimental to the analysis due to recurrent negligible-information/non-negligible-noise additions and "frustrated information" phenomena leading to information loss. Such effects are proven general and are observed also in completely different systems and descriptors' combinations. This shows how high-dimensional analyses are not necessarily better than low-dimensional ones to elucidate the internal complexity of physical/chemical systems, especially when these are characterized by non-negligible internal noise.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning Accelerated Descriptor Design for Catalyst Discovery: A CO$_2$ to Methanol Conversion Case Study</title>

Abstract: Transforming CO$_2$ into methanol represents a crucial step towards closing the carbon cycle, with thermoreduction technology nearing industrial application. However, obtaining high methanol yields and ensuring the stability of heterocatalysts remain significant challenges. Herein, we present a sophisticated computational framework to accelerate the discovery of novel thermal heterogeneous catalysts, using machine-learned force fields. We propose a new catalytic descriptor, termed adsorption energy distribution, that aggregates the binding energies for different catalyst facets, binding sites, and adsorbates. The descriptor is versatile and can easily be adjusted to a specific reaction through careful choice of the key-step reactants and reaction intermediates. By applying unsupervised machine learning and statistical analysis to a dataset comprising nearly 160 metallic alloys, we offer a powerful tool for catalyst discovery. Finally, we propose new promising candidate materials such as ZnRh and ZnPt$_3$, which to our knowledge, have not yet been tested, and discuss their possible advantage in terms of stability.</description>

      <title>Coupled-cluster pairing models for radicals with strong correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pairing hierarchy of perfect pairing (PP), perfect quadruples (PQ) and perfect hextuples (PH) are sparsified coupled cluster models that are exact in a pairing active space for 2, 4, and 6 electron clusters, respectively. We describe and implement three extensions for radicals. First is the trivial generalization that does not correlate radical orbitals. The second model (PQr, PHr) includes terms that entangle pair indices and radical indices such that their maximum total number is 2 for PQ and 3 for PH (like their closed-shell versions). The third family of extended radical models (PPxr, PQxr, and PHxr) include cluster amplitudes that entangle up to 1, 2, and 3 pair indices with up to 1, 2, and 3 radical indices. Notably, PPxr and PQxr are exact for (3e,3o) and (5e,5o), respectively, while still having only $O(N)$ and $O(N^{2}$) amplitudes like their parent models (for $N$ paired electrons). Orbital optimization is considered for PPxr. A series of large-scale numerical tests of these models are presented for spin gaps, and ionization energies of polyenes and polyenyl radicals, ranging in size from ethene and allyl radical up to C$_{22}$H$_{24}$ in full-valence active spaces up to (122e,122o). The xR models perform best.</description>
