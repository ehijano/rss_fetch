      <title>Microstructure-Dependent Particulate Filtration using Multifunctional Metallic Nanowire Foams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has shown the urgent need for the development of efficient, durable, reusable and recyclable filtration media for the deep-submicron size range. Here we demonstrate a multifunctional filtration platform using porous metallic nanowire foams that are efficient, robust, antimicrobial, and reusable, with the potential to further guard against multiple hazards. We have investigated the foam microstructures, detailing how the growth parameters influence the overall surface area and characteristic feature size, as well as the effects of the microstructures on the filtration performance. Nanogranules deposited on the nanowires during electrodeposition are found to greatly increase the surface area, up to 20 m$^{2}$/g. Surprisingly, in the high surface area regime, the overall surface area gained from the nanogranules has little correlation with the improvement in capture efficiency. However, nanowire density and diameter play a significant role in the capture efficiency of PM$_{0.3}$ particles, as do the surface roughness of the nanowire fibers and their characteristic feature sizes. Antimicrobial tests on the Cu foams show a &gt;99.9995% inactivation efficiency after contacting the foams for 30 seconds. These results demonstrate promising directions to achieve a highly efficient multifunctional filtration platform with optimized microstructures.</description>

      <title>Multifaceted thermal regulation in electrochemical batteries using cooling channels and foam-embedded phase change materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries are widely used in electric vehicles and grid energy storage systems. Compared to cylindrical batteries, prismatic cells are the primary choice because of their advantage for dense packing. However, thermal runaway and temperature inhomogeneities are the main thermal regulation problems that affect their reliability, safety, and useful life. Here, we propose and assess a multifaceted cooling system composed of water channels (active cooling) and metallic foam embedded with two types of phase-change materials or PCMs (passive cooling) with different melting points. We show that a multifaceted thermal regulation strategy can improve both cooling effectiveness and temperature homogeneity through a representative prismatic battery module. Our numerical results indicate that for a battery pack cooled with a water channel (3C discharge rate), a dual-PCM arrangement can reduce the maximum temperature by 1.3 $^\circ$C and 2.7 $^\circ$C compared to a mono-PCM arrangement and a battery pack without PCM. The maximum temperature difference within the cell is also 1.2 $^\circ$C. Therefore, multi-PCM thermal management systems show better performance than their mono-PCM predecessors in terms of lowering the maximum battery temperature and improving thermal homogeneity. This work motivates the development of multifaceted thermal management systems with active and passive cooling to improve the long-term performance of electrochemical battery cells.</description>

      <title>Harmonizing Material Quantity and Terahertz Wave Interference Shielding Efficiency with Metallic Borophene Nanosheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials with electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding in the terahertz (THz) regime, while minimizing the quantity used, are highly demanded for future information communication, healthcare and mineral resource exploration applications. Currently, there is often a trade-off between the amount of material used and the absolute EMI shielding effectiveness (EESt) for the EMI shielding materials. Here, we address this trade-off by harnessing the unique properties of two-dimensional (2D) beta12-borophene (beta12-Br) nanosheets. Leveraging beta12-Br's light weight and exceptional electron mobility characteristics, which represent among the highest reported values to date, we simultaneously achieve a THz EMI shield effectiveness (SE) of 70 dB and an EESt of 4.8E5 dB cm^2/g (@0.87 THz) using a beta12-Br polymer composite. This surpasses the values of previously reported THz shielding materials with an EESt less than 3E5 dB cm^2/g and a SE smaller than 60 dB, while only needs 0.1 wt.% of these materials to realize the same SE value. Furthermore, by capitalizing on the composite's superior mechanical properties, with 158% tensile strain at a Young's modulus of 33 MPa, we demonstrate the high-efficiency shielding performances of conformably coated surfaces based on beta12-Br nanosheets, suggesting their great potential in EMI shielding area.</description>

      <title>Dirac Equation for Photons: Origin of Polarisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.18196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin is a fundamental degree of freedom, whose existence was proven by Dirac for an electron by imposing the relativity to quantum mechanics, leading to the triumph to derive the Dirac equation. Spin of a photon should be linked to polarisation, however, the similar argument for an electron was not applicable to Maxwell equations, which are already Lorentz invariant. Therefore, the origin of polarisation and its relationship with spin are not completely elucidated, yet. Here, we discuss propagation of coherent rays of photons in a graded-index optical fibre, which can be solved exactly using the Laguerre-Gauss or Hermite-Gauss modes in a cylindrical or a Cartesian coordinate. We found that the energy spectrum is massive with the effective mass as a function of the confinement and orbital angular momentum. The propagation is described by the one-dimensional ($1D$) non-relativistic Schr\"odinger equation, which is equivalent to the $2D$ space-time Klein-Gordon equation by a unitary transformation. The probabilistic interpretation and the conservation law require the factorisation of the Klein-Gordon equation, leading to the $2D$ Dirac equation with spin. We applied the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)-Bogoliubov theory of superconductivity to a coherent ray from a laser and identified a radiative Nambu-Anderson-Higgs-Goldstone mode for recovering the broken symmetry. The spin expectation value of a photon corresponds to the polarisation state in the Poincar\'e sphere, which is characterised by fixed phases after the onset of lasing due to the broken $SU(2)$ symmetry, and it is shown that its azimuthal angle is coming from the phase of the energy gap.</description>

      <title>Metasurface Energy Harvesters: State-of-the-Art Designs and Their Potential for Energy Sustainable Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metasurface Energy Harvesters (MEHs) have emerged as a prominent enabler of highly efficient Radio Frequency (RF) energy harvesters. This survey delves into the fundamentals of the MEH technology, providing a comprehensive overview of their working principle, unit cell designs and prototypes over various frequency bands, as well as state-of-the art modes of operation. Inspired by the recent academic and industrial interest on Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs)for the upcoming sixth-Generation (6G) of wireless networks, we study the interplay between this technology and MEHs aiming for energy sustainable RISs power by metasurface-based RF energy harvesting. We present a novel hybrid unit cell design capable of simultaneous energy harvesting and 1-bit tunable reflection whose dual-functional response is validated via full-wave simulations. Then, we conduct a comparative collection of real-world measurements for ambient RF power levels and power consumption budgets of reflective RISs to unveil the potential for a self-sustainable RIS via ambient RF energy harvesting. The paper is concluded with an elaborative discussion on open design challenges and future research directions for MEHs and energy sustainable hybrid RISs.</description>

      <title>Pixelated Bayer Spectral Router Based on Sparse Meta-atom Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has long been a challenging task to improve the light collection efficiency of conventional image sensors built with color filters that inevitably cause the energy loss of out-of-band photons. Although various schemes have been proposed to address the issue, it is still very hard to make a reasonable tradeoff between device performance and practicability. In this work, we demonstrate a pixelated spectral router based on sparse meta-atom array, which can efficiently separate the incident R (600-700 nm), G (500-600 nm), and B (400-500 nm) band light to the corresponding pixels of a Bayer image sensor, providing over 56% signal enhancement above the traditional color filter scheme. The CMOS-compatible spectral router has superior characteristics of polarization insensitivity and high incident angle tolerance (over 30{\deg}), enabled by simple compound Si3N4 nanostructures which are very suitable for massive production. Imaging experiments are conducted to verify its potential for real applications. Our pixelated spectral router scheme is also found to be robust and could be freely adapted to image sensors of various pixel sizes, having great potential in building the new generation of high-performance image sensing components.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Electronic and Phononic Thermal Transport Across 2D Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrical and thermal transport across material interfaces is key for 2D electronics in semiconductor technology, yet their relationship remains largely unknown. We report a theoretical proposal to separate electronic and phononic contributions to thermal conductance at 2D interfaces, which is validated by non-equilibrium Green's function calculations and molecular dynamics simulations for graphene-gold contacts. Our results reveal that while metal-graphene interfaces are transparent for both electrons and phonons, non-covalent graphene interfaces block electronic tunneling beyond two layers but not phonon transport. This suggests that the Wiedemann-Franz law can be experimentally tested by measuring transport across interfaces with varying graphene layers.</description>

      <title>Double helical plasmonic antennas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic double helical antennas are a means to funnel circularly polarized states of light down to the nanoscale. Here, an existing design tool for single helices is extended to the case of double helices and used to design antennas that combine large chiroptical interaction strength with highly directional light emission. Full-field numerical modeling underpins the design and provides additional insight into surface charge distributions and resonance widths. The experimentally realized double helical antennas were studied regarding their polarization-dependent transmission behavior resulting in a large and broadband dissymmetry factor in the visible range. Since the polarization of light is an important tool for implementing logic functionality in photonic and quantum photonic devices, these helices are potential building blocks for future nanophotonic circuits, but also for chiral metamaterials or phase plates.</description>

      <title>First-principles study of structural and electronic properties of multiferroic oxide Mn3TeO6 under high pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mn3TeO6 (MTO) has been experimentally found to adopt a P21/n structure under high pressure, which exhibits a significantly smaller band gap compared to the atmospheric R-3 phase. In this study, we systematically investigate the magnetism, structural phase transition and electronic properties of MTO under high pressure through first-principles calculations. Both R-3 and P21/n phases of MTO are antiferromagnetic at zero temperature. The R-3 phase transforms to the P21/n phase at 7.58 GPa, accompanied by a considerable volume collapse of about 6.47%. Employing the accurate method that combines DFT+U and G0W0, the calculated band gap of R-3 phase at zero pressure is very close to the experimental values, while that of the P21/n phase is significantly overestimated. The main reason for this difference is that the experimental study incorrectly used the Kubelka-Munk plot for the indirect band gap to obtain the band gap of the P21/n phase instead of the Kubelka-Munk plot for the direct band gap. Furthermore, our study reveals that the transition from the R-3 phase to the P21/n phase is accompanied by a slight reduction in the band gap.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Study on the Structural and Thermodynamic Properties of U-He compounds under High Pressure</title>

Abstract: Uranium is considered as a very important nuclear energy material because of the huge amount of energy released. As the main products of spontaneous decay of uranium, helium is difficult to react with uranium for its chemical inertness. Therefore, bubbles will be formed inside uranium, which could greatly reduce the performance of uranium or cause the safety problems. Additionally, nuclear materials are usually operated in an environment of high-temperature and high-pressure, so it is necessary to figure out the exact state of helium inside uranium at extreme conditions. Here, we explored the structural stability of U-He system under high-pressure and high-temperature by using density functional theory calculations. Two metastable phases are found between 50 and 400 GPa: U4He with space group Fmmm and U6He with space group P-1. Both are metallic and adopt layered structures. Electron localization function calculation combined with charge density difference analysis indicate that there are covalent bonds between U and U atoms in both Fmmm-U4He and P-1-U6He. Compared with the elastic modulus of ${\alpha}$-U, the addition of helium has certain influence on the mechanical properties of uranium. Besides, first-principles molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to study the dynamical behavior of Fmmm-U4He and P-1-U6He at high-temperature. It is found that Fmmm-U4He and P-1-U6He undergo one-dimensional superionic phase transitions at 150 GPa. Our study revealed exotic structure of U-He compounds beyond the form of bubble under high-pressure and high-temperature, that might be relevant to the performance and safety issue of nuclear materials at extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Error correction for encoded quantum annealing revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: F. Pastawski and J. Preskill discussed error correction of quantum annealing (QA) based on a parity-encoded spin system, known as the Sourlas-Lechner-Hauke-Zoller (SLHZ) system. They pointed out that the SLHZ system is closely related to a classical low-density parity-check (LDPC) code and demonstrated its error-correcting capability through a belief propagation (BP) algorithm assuming independent random spin-flip errors. In contrast, Ablash et al. suggested that the SLHZ system does not receive the benefits of post-readout decoding. The reason is that independent random spin-flips are not the most relevant error arising from sampling excited states during the annealing process, whether in closed or open system cases. In this work, we revisit this issue: we propose a very simple decoding algorithm to eliminate errors in the readout of SLHZ systems and show experimental evidence suggesting that SLHZ system exhibits error-correcting capability in decoding annealing readouts. Our new algorithm can be thought of as a bit-flipping algorithm for LDPC codes. Assuming an independent and identical noise model, we found that the performance of our algorithm is comparable to that of the BP algorithm. The error correcting-capability for the sampled readouts was investigated using Monte Carlo calculations that simulate the final time distribution of QA. The results show that the algorithm successfully eliminates errors in the sampled readouts under conditions where error-free state or even code state is not sampled at all. Our simulation suggests that decoding of annealing readouts will be successful if the correctable states can be sampled by annealing, and annealing can be considered to play a role as a pre-process of the classical decoding process. This knowledge will be useful for designing and developing practical QA based on the SLHZ system in the near future.</description>

      <title>Optical Micromanipulation of Soft Materials: Applications in Devices and Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since its invention by Arthur Ashkin and colleagues at Bell Labs in the 1970s, optical micromanipulation, also known as optical tweezers or laser tweezers, has evolved remarkably to become one of the most convenient and versatile tools for studying soft materials, including biological systems. Arthur Ashkin received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2018 for enabling these extraordinary scientific advancements. Essentially, a focused laser beam is used to apply and measure minuscule forces from a few piconewtons to femtonewtons by utilizing light-matter interaction at mesoscopic length scales. Combined with advanced microscopy and position-sensing techniques, optical micromanipulations enable us to investigate diverse aspects of functional soft materials. These include studying mechanical responses through force-elongation measurements, examining the structural properties of complex fluids employing microrheology, analyzing chemical compositions using spectroscopy, and sorting cells through single-cell analysis. Furthermore, it is utilized in various soft-matter-based devices, such as laser scissors and optical motors in microfluidic channels. This chapter presents an overview of optical micromanipulation techniques by describing fundamental theories and explaining the design considerations of conventional single-trap and dual-trap setups as well as recent improvisations. We further discuss their capabilities and applications in probing exotic soft-matter systems and in developing widely utilized devices and technologies based on functional soft materials.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional quantum dot array integrated with charge sensors in an InAs nanowire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report an experimental study of a one-dimensional quintuple-quantum-dot array integrated with two quantum dot charge sensors in an InAs nanowire. The device is studied by measuring double quantum dots formed consecutively in the array and corresponding charge stability diagrams are revealed with both direct current measurements and charge sensor signals. The one-dimensional quintuple-quantum-dot array are then tuned up and its charge configurations are fully mapped out with the two charge sensors. The energy level of each dot in the array can be controlled individually by using a compensated gate architecture (i.e., "virtual gate"). After that, four dots in the array are selected to form two double quantum dots and ultra strong inter-double-dot interaction is obtained. A theoretical simulation based on a 4-dimensional Hamiltonian confirms the strong coupling strength between the two double quantum dots. The highly controllable one-dimensional quantum dot array achieved in this work is expected to be valuable for employing InAs nanowires to construct advanced quantum hardware in the future.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal symmetries and energy-momentum conservation in uniform spacetime metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spacetime metamaterials (ST-MMs) are opening new regimes of light-matter interactions based on the breaking of temporal and spatial symmetries, as well as intriguing concepts associated with synthetic motion. In this work, we investigate the continuous spatiotemporal translation symmetry of ST-MMs with uniform modulation velocity. Using Noether theorem, we demonstrate that such symmetry entails the conservation of the energy-momentum. We highlight how energy-momentum conservation imposes constraints on the range of allowed light-matter interactions within ST-MMs, as illustrated with examples of the collision of electromagnetic and modulation pulses. Furthermore, we discuss the similarities and differences between the conservation of energy-momentum and relativistic effects. We believe that our work provides a step forward in clarifying the fundamental theory underlying ST-MMs.</description>

      <title>Weight update in ferroelectric memristors with identical and non-identical pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJs) are a class of memristor which promise low-power, scalable, field-driven analog operation. In order to harness their full potential, operation with identical pulses is targeted. In this paper, several weight update schemes for FTJs are investigated, using either non-identical or identical pulses, and with time delays between the pulses ranging from 1 us to 10 s. Experimentally, a method for achieving non-linear weight update with identical pulses at long programming delays is demonstrated by limiting the switching current via a series resistor. Simulations show that this concept can be expanded to achieve weight update in a 1T1C cell by limiting the switching current through a transistor operating in sub-threshold or saturation mode. This leads to a maximum linearity in the weight update of 87%. The scaling behaviour of this scheme as devices are reduced to the sub-micron range is investigated, and the linearity slightly reduces in scaled devices to a maximum of 81%. The origin of the remaining non-linearity is discussed, as well as how this can be overcome.</description>

      <title>A blueprint for truncation resonance placement in elastic diatomic lattices with unit cell asymmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elastic periodic lattices act as mechanical filters of incident vibrations. By and large, they forbid wave propagation within bandgaps and resonate outside them. However, they often encounter "truncation resonances" (TRs) inside bandgaps when certain conditions are met. In this study, we show that the extent of unit cell asymmetry, its mass and stiffness contrasts, and the boundary conditions all play a role in the TR location and wave profile. The work is experimentally supported via two examples that validate the methodology, and a set of design charts is provided as a blueprint for selective TR placement in diatomic lattices.</description>

      <title>Alternating Bias Assisted Annealing of Amorphous Oxide Tunnel Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07415v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate a transformational technique for controllably tuning the electrical properties of fabricated thermally oxidized amorphous aluminum-oxide tunnel junctions. Using conventional test equipment to apply an alternating bias to a heated tunnel barrier, giant increases in the room temperature resistance, greater than 70%, can be achieved. The rate of resistance change is shown to be strongly temperature-dependent, and is independent of junction size in the sub-micron regime. In order to measure their tunneling properties at mK temperatures, we characterized transmon qubit junctions treated with this alternating-bias assisted annealing (ABAA) technique. The measured frequencies follow the Ambegaokar-Baratoff relation between the shifted resistance and critical current. Further, these studies show a reduction of junction-contributed loss on the order of $\approx 2 \times10^{-6}$, along with a significant reduction in resonant- and off-resonant-two level system defects when compared to untreated samples. Imaging with high-resolution TEM shows that the barrier is still predominantly amorphous with a more uniform distribution of aluminum coordination across the barrier relative to untreated junctions. This new approach is expected to be widely applicable to a broad range of devices that rely on amorphous aluminum oxide, as well as the many other metal-insulator-metal structures used in modern electronics.</description>

Abstract: This paper reports the results presented in an invited poster during the International Conference on Silicon Carbide and Related Materials (ICSCRM) 2023 held in Sorrento, Italy. The suitability of scanning probe methods based on atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements is explored to investigate with high spatial resolution the elementary cell of 4H-SiC power MOSFETs. The two-dimensional (2D) cross-sectional maps demonstrated a high spatial resolution of about 5 nm using the SSRM capabilities. Furthermore, the SCM capabilities enabled visualizing the fluctuations of charge carrier concentration across the different parts of the MOSFETs elementary cell.</description>

      <title>Electron localization function for non-collinear spins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding of bonding is key to modelling materials and predicting properties thereof. A widely adopted indicator of bonds and atomic shells is the electron localization function (ELF). The building blocks of the ELF are also used in the construction of modern density functional approximations. Here we demonstrate that the ELF breaks down when applied beyond regular non-relativistic quantum states. We show that for tackling general non-collinear open-shell solutions, it is essential to address both the U(1) gauge invariance -- i.e., invariance under a multiplication by a position dependent phase factor -- and SU(2) gauge invariance -- i.e. invariance under local spin rotations -- {\em conjointly}. Remarkably, we find that the extended ELF also improves the description of paradigmatic collinear states.</description>

      <title>Microscopic characteristics of SF6 partial discharge induced by a floating linear metal particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct current (DC) gas insulated transmission lines (GILs) have been widely used in power transmission, but might be threatened by partial discharge due to the presence of floating impurities (e.g., dust and metal particles) inside the sealed chamber. In this letter, by using a 2D fluid model we characterize the microscopic properties of the partial discharge induced by a floating linear metal particle in SF6 (both the discharge propagation and interaction between space charge and metal particle) under negative high voltage direct current (HVDC) conditions. Due to the strong electronegativity of SF6, the spatiotemporal distributions of the charged species (electrons, positive and negative ions), space charge, and reduced electric field are rather different from those in air. Notably, a negative ion region is observed around the top tip of the metal particle, and it plays an important role in the generation and propagation of primary and secondary streamers in SF6, which may lead to severe motion characteristics of the particle and aliasing of partial discharge signals. Additionally, we analyze the charging process and electric force reversal phenomenon, which may provide a more precise understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the firefly motion previously reported for DC GILs.</description>

      <title>Dynamic single-input control of multi-state multi-transition soft robotic actuator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Soft robotics is an attractive and rapidly emerging field, in which actuation is coupled with the elastic response of the robot's structure to achieve complex deformation patterns. A crucial challenge is the need for multiple control inputs, which adds significant complication to the system. We propose a novel concept of single-input control of an actuator composed of interconnected bi-stable elements. Dynamic response of the actuator and pre-designed differences between the elements are exploited to facilitate any desired multi-state transition, using a single dynamic input. We show formulation and analysis of the control system's dynamics and pre-design of its multiple equilibrium states, as well as their stability. Then we fabricate and demonstrate experimentally on single-input control of two- and four-element actuators, where the latter can achieve transitions between up to 48 desired states. Our work paves the way for next-generation soft robotic actuators with minimal actuation and maximal dexterity.</description>
