      <title>Intrinsic speed characteristics of a self-propelled camphor disk under repulsive perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Camphor is a well-studied material capable of generating self-propelled motion at a water surface, and the resulting dynamics can exhibit a wide range of behaviors. Here, we analyze a one-dimensional model describing a mobile camphor disk perturbed by a second localized camphor source. The interaction between the rotor and the perturbing disk is represented by a distance-dependent potential. The study is motivated by experiments in which a camphor rotor interacts with a fixed camphor disk placed on the water surface. Numerical simulations of the model reproduce the essential features of the experimentally observed position-dependent rotor velocity for all considered forms of the potential. For weak perturbations, we derive analytical solutions valid for arbitrary potential profiles. Both the simulations and the analytical results demonstrate a pronounced asymmetry in the rotor velocity depending on whether the rotor approaches or recedes from the perturbation.</description>

      <title>Metastability induced by non-reciprocal adaptive couplings in Kuramoto models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal couplings are frequently found in systems out-of-equilibrium such as neuronal networks. We consider generalized Kuramoto models with non-reciprocal adaptive couplings. The non-reciprocity refers to the type of couplings according to Hebbian or anti-Hebbian rules and to different time scales on which the couplings evolve. The main effect of this specific combination of deterministic dynamics is an induced metastability of anti-phase synchronized clusters of oscillators. Metastable switching is typical for neuronal networks and a characteristic of brain dynamics. We analyze the metastability as a function of the system parameters, in particular of the size and the network connectivity. The mechanism behind sudden changes in the order parameters is individual oscillators which change their cluster affiliation from time to time, providing ``weak ties" between clusters of synchronized oscillators, where an individual oscillator may represent an entire brain area. The time series exhibit random features but arise from deterministic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws for Function Diversity and Specialization Across Socioeconomic and Biological Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.06487v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Function diversity, the range of tasks individuals perform, and specialization, the distribution of function abundances, are fundamental to complex adaptive systems. In the absence of overarching principles, these properties have appeared domain-specific. Here, we introduce an empirical framework and a mathematical model for the diversification and specialization of functions across disparate systems, including bacteria, federal agencies, universities, corporations, and cities. We find that the number of functions grows sublinearly with system size, with exponents from 0.35 to 0.57, consistent with Heaps' Law. In contrast, cities exhibit logarithmic scaling. To explain these empirical findings, we generalize the Yule-Simon model by introducing two key parameters: a diversification parameter that characterizes how existing functions inhibit the creation of new ones, and a specialization parameter that describes how a function's attractiveness depends on its abundance. Our model enables cross-system comparisons, from microorganisms to metropolitan areas. The analysis suggests that what drives the creation of new functions depends on the system's goals and structure: federal agencies tend to ensure comprehensive coverage of necessary functions; cities tend to slow the creation of new occupations as existing ones expand; and cells occupy an intermediate position. Once functions are introduced, their growth follows a remarkably universal pattern across all systems.</description>

      <title>Modified Axelrod Model Showing Opinion Convergence And Polarization In Realistic Scale-Free Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axelrod model is an opinion dynamics model such that each agent on a square lattice has a finite number of possible nominal opinions on a finite number of issues that are usually called features in the field. Moreover, its dynamics between two agents is assimilative in the sense that the number of agreeing features between them never decreases upon interaction. Here we modify this model to study opinion convergence, polarization and more importantly to find ways to reduce opinion polarization in an already polarized population. We do so by changing or adding several elements from complex network and continuous opinion dynamics research.
  First, we put agents in a scale-free network. Second, we adopt the bounded confidence model by representing our agent's opinions by numbers in $[-1,1]$ those distances follow the standard Euclidean metric. Third, our rules allow both convergence and divergence of their resultant opinions after a pair of agents interacts. As a result, our modified model offers a more comprehensive exploration of opinion dynamics.
  Computer simulation results of our model show scaling behavior and a notable trend in opinion polarization on all features in the majority of reasonable simulation parameters. To mitigate this polarization, we introduce empathetic agents that work actively to reduce opinion differences. However, our findings indicate limited success in the approach for the most effective way is to change the behavior of a significant portion of highly connected agents. This research contributes to the understanding of opinion dynamics within society and highlights the nuanced complexities that arise when considering factors such as network structure and continuous opinion values. Our results prompt further exploration and open avenues for future investigations into effective methods of reducing opinion polarization.</description>

      <title>Information bounds production in replicator systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00396v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Environmental fluctuations can shape replicator dynamics, with important consequences for both prebiotic and modern ecosystems. However, it remains unclear how simple replicators can acquire and use information about fluctuating environments, given that such information processing is often assumed to require sophisticated mechanisms for sensing and control. Here, we show that even simple replicator networks can increase productivity by exploiting environmental information in a functional way. Using a model of autocatalytic replicators in a flow reactor, we derive an information-theoretic decomposition of productivity, with separate contributions from environmental uncertainty, side information, and distribution mismatch. We derive optimal strategies and universal bounds on the benefit of information and compare our findings with existing work, including ``Kelly gambling'' in information theory. By applying our framework to a model of real-world molecular replicators, we demonstrate the benefits of internal memory and propose an experimental setup for detecting functional information in a minimal chemical system.</description>
