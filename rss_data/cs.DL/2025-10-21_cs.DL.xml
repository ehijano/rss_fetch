      <title>Publication Trend Analysis and Synthesis via Large Language Model: A Case Study of Engineering in PNAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific literature is increasingly siloed by complex language, static disciplinary structures, and potentially sparse keyword systems, making it cumbersome to capture the dynamic nature of modern science. This study addresses these challenges by introducing an adaptable large language model (LLM)-driven framework to quantify thematic trends and map the evolving landscape of scientific knowledge. The approach is demonstrated over a 20-year collection of more than 1,500 engineering articles published by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), marked for their breadth and depth of research focus. A two-stage classification pipeline first establishes a primary thematic category for each article based on its abstract. The subsequent phase performs a full-text analysis to assign secondary classifications, revealing latent, cross-topic connections across the corpus. Traditional natural language processing (NLP) methods, such as Bag-of-Words (BoW) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), confirm the resulting topical structure and also suggest that standalone word-frequency analyses may be insufficient for mapping fields with high diversity. Finally, a disjoint graph representation between the primary and secondary classifications reveals implicit connections between themes that may be less apparent when analyzing abstracts or keywords alone. The findings show that the approach independently recovers much of the journal's editorially embedded structure without prior knowledge of its existing dual-classification schema (e.g., biological studies also classified as engineering). This framework offers a powerful tool for detecting potential thematic trends and providing a high-level overview of scientific progress.</description>

      <title>Institute Disambiguation using Author-Institution Co-Occurrence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we propose a novel method to perform unsupervised clustering of different forms of Institute names. We use only author and affiliation metadata to perform the clustering without any string or pattern matching. After analysing only 50000 articles from Crossref database, we see encouraging results which can be scaled up to provide even better results. We compare our clustering with what a well-known method using string matching does and found that the results were complementary. This can help perform institute disambiguation better when integrated with existing systems, especially to provide aliases for cases where traditional string matching fails. The code of this open-source methodology can be found at: https://github.com/Jeet009/Institute-Disambiguation-using-Author-Institution-Co-Occurrence</description>

      <title>Shifting 'AI Policy' Preprints and Citation Trends in the U.S., U.K and E.U., and South Korea (2015-2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study of literature focusing on 'AI Policy' over the past decade, found that citations of preprints, publications on platforms such as arXiv, have increased from five percent to forty percent across three major regions: the U.S., U.K. &amp; E.U., and South Korea. We compare regional responses of preprint citations across the global disruptions of COVID-19 and the release of ChatGPT. We discuss driving factors and risks of preprint normalization, which follows the trend in computer science.</description>

      <title>Code Contribution and Credit in Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Software development has become essential to scientific research, but its relationship to traditional metrics of scholarly credit remains poorly understood. We develop a dataset of approximately 140,000 paired research articles and code repositories, as well as a predictive model that matches research article authors with software repository developer accounts. We use this data to investigate how software development activities influence credit allocation in collaborative scientific settings. Our findings reveal significant patterns distinguishing software contributions from traditional authorship credit. We find that nearly 30% of articles include non-author code contributors- individuals who participated in software development but received no formal authorship recognition. While code-contributing authors show a modest $\sim$4.2% increase in article citations, this effect becomes non-significant when controlling for domain, article type, and open access status. First authors are significantly more likely to be code contributors than other author positions. Notably, we identify a negative relationship between coding frequency and scholarly impact metrics. Authors who contribute code more frequently exhibit progressively lower h-indices than non-coding colleagues, even when controlling for publication count, author position, domain, and article type. These results suggest a disconnect between software contributions and credit, highlighting important implications for institutional reward structures and science policy.</description>

      <title>Evolving interdisciplinary contributions to global societal challenges: A 50-year overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Addressing global societal challenges necessitates insights and expertise that transcend the boundaries of individual disciplines. In recent decades, interdisciplinary collaboration has been recognised as a vital driver of innovation and effective problem-solving, with the potential to profoundly influence policy and practice worldwide. However, quantitative evidence remains limited regarding how cross-disciplinary efforts contribute to societal challenges, as well as the evolving roles and relevance of specific disciplines in addressing these issues. To fill this gap, this study examines the long-term evolution of interdisciplinary contributions to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), drawing on extensive bibliometric data from OpenAlex. By analysing publication and citation trends across 19 research fields from 1970 to 2022, we reveal how the relative presence of different disciplines in addressing particular SDGs has shifted over time. Our results also provide unique evidence of the increasing interconnection between fields since the 2000s, coinciding with the United Nations' initiative to tackle global societal challenges through interdisciplinary efforts. These insights will benefit policymakers and practitioners as they reflect on past progress and plan for future action, particularly with the SDG target deadline approaching in the next five years.</description>

      <title>Generalization and the Rise of System-level Creativity in Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Innovation ecosystems require careful policy stewardship to drive sustained advance in human health, welfare, security and prosperity. We develop new measures that reliably decompose the influence of innovations in terms of the degree to which each represents a field-level foundation, an extension of foundational work, or a generalization that synthesizes and modularizes contributions from distant fields to catalyze combinatorial innovation. Using 23 million scientific works from OpenAlex and 19 million works from Web of Science, we demonstrate that while foundational and extensional work within fields has declined in recent years-a trend garnering much recent attention-generalizations across fields have increased and accelerated with the rise of the web, social media, and artificial intelligence, shifting the locus of innovation from within fields to across the system as a whole. We explore implications for science policy.</description>
