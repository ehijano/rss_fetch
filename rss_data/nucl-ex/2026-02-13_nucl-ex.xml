      <title>Elliptic flow of strange and multi-strange hadrons in isobar collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm {NN}}} = 200\mathrm{~GeV}$ at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a systematic measurement of elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) of $K_{s}^{0}$, $\Lambda$, $\overline{\Lambda}$, $\phi$, $\Xi^{-}$, $\overline{\Xi}^{+}$, and $\Omega^{-}$+$\overline{\Omega}^{+}$ at mid-rapidity ($|y| &lt; 1.0$) for isobar, $^{96}_{44}$Ru+$^{96}_{44}$Ru and $^{96}_{40}$Zr+$^{96}_{40}$Zr, collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm {NN}}}$ = 200 GeV. The transverse momentum ($p_\mathrm{T}$) dependence of $v_{2}$ is studied for various centrality classes. The number of constituent quark scaling of (multi-)strange hadrons is found to hold approximately within 20%, suggesting the development of partonic collectivity in isobar collisions similar to that observed in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm {NN}}}$ = 200 GeV. The average $v_{2}$ ratio shows $\sim$2% deviation from unity in central and mid-central collisions for strange hadrons, indicating a difference in nuclear structure and deformation between the isobars. The $v_{2}$ in isobaric collisions is compared to Cu+Cu, Au+Au, and U+U collisions at similar collision energies. We observe an increase in $v_{2}(p_\mathrm{T})$ with increasing system size. The difference in $v_{2}$ between the isobar and other collision systems increases with $p_\mathrm{T}$. The results are compared with a multi-phase transport model calculations with a deformed density profile to provide further insight into the nuclear structure of these isobars.</description>

      <title>One-, two-, and three-dimensional photon femtoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Femtoscopy with photon pairs is a particularly attractive tool for studying high-energy nuclear collisions. Proposed and extensively discussed in several influential theory articles, it has seen only few applications in experiment because of statistics limitations. With the progress of detectors and electronics, only now it is coming within reach. In this paper we discuss the choice of kinematic variables for two-photon correlation functions. In particular, we argue against $C(Q_{\rm inv})$ and in favor of $C(\Delta E,Q_{\rm inv})$.</description>

      <title>Pion $\beta$ decay and $\tau\to\pi\pi\nu_\tau$ beyond leading logarithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The consistent matching of short-distance contributions and hadronic matrix elements is crucial for precise predictions of weak processes involving hadrons. In this Letter, we address this point for charged-current processes involving two pions -- pion $\beta$ decay $\pi^\pm\to\pi^0 e^\pm\nu_e$ and hadronic $\tau$ decays $\tau^\pm\to\pi^\pm\pi^0\nu_\tau$ -- whose decay rates depend on the so-called $\gamma W$ box correction. Using recent results from lattice QCD, we show how to formulate the matching beyond leading-logarithmic accuracy, in particular, how to cancel the dependence on the scheme choice for evanescent operators. As main results, we obtain a prediction for the decay rate of pion $\beta$ decay with theory uncertainties improved by a factor of three, which renders theory uncertainties negligible for future determinations of $V_{ud}$ even beyond the reach of the PIONEER experiment, and an evaluation of isospin-breaking corrections to $\tau\to\pi\pi\nu_\tau$ with negligible uncertainty from the short-distance matching, as necessary for a future $\tau$-based determination of the hadronic-vacuum-polarization contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon.</description>

      <title>Nucleon Parton Distribution Functions from Boosted Correlations in the Coulomb gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a novel approach has been proposed to compute parton distributions through the use of boosted correlators fixed in the Coulomb gauge from lattice QCD, within the framework of Large-Momentum Effective Theory (LaMET). This approach circumvents the need for Wilson lines, potentially enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of lattice calculations. In this work, we present the first exploratory implementation of the Coulomb gauge method for calculating nucleon unpolarized, helicity, and transversity parton distribution functions (PDFs). The calculations are performed on a Highly-Improved-Staggered-Quark ensemble with lattice spacing $a = 0.06$ fm, volume $L_s^3 \times L_t=48^3\times 64$, and valence pion mass $m_\pi=300$ MeV, employing boosted nucleon states with momenta up to 3.04 GeV. Our lattice predictions for the valence-quark PDFs -- extracted from the real part of the correlators -- show good convergence with increasing nucleon momentum and are compatible with the most recent global analyses for all spin structures. On the other hand, the full-quark-channel PDFs obtained from the imaginary part of the correlators exhibit discrepancies between the two large nucleon momenta considered, although the results at the higher momentum are consistent with phenomenology. The discrepancies are likely driven by stronger excited-state contamination in the imaginary matrix elements, which is consistent with the observation in the literature. Overall, this work demonstrates the efficacy of the Coulomb gauge approach for nucleon PDFs and serves as a benchmark for its broader applications.</description>

      <title>Generalizing the Soffer Bound: Positivity Constraints on Parton Distributions of Spin-3/2 Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the complete set of positivity bounds for the leading-twist parton distribution functions (PDFs) of a spin-3/2 hadron for the first time. This work generalizes the Soffer bound, a fundamental constraint for spin-1/2 nucleons, to quark and gluon distribution functions in higher-spin systems. Expressing the antiparton-hadron scattering amplitudes in terms of the PDFs and the spin density matrix, we establish the connections between the PDFs and the scattering amplitudes in the tensor product space of the parton and hadron spins. Moreover, we obtain the definitions of the PDFs in terms of the helicity amplitudes. Positive definiteness of the scattering amplitude matrix yields a set of inequalities that define the physically allowed parameter space for the helicity amplitudes and a set of constraints for the PDFs.</description>
