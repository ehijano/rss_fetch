      <title>Do Observations Prefer Thawing Quintessence?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In light of recent observations, we study evidence for thawing quintessence over a cosmological constant as dark energy, with emphasis on the effect of the choice of priors. Working with a parametrization for the equation of state parameter motivated by the theory, we find a preference for thawing quintessence compared to a bare cosmological constant {\it only} if we use priors which are heavily informed by the data itself. If we extend the priors to physically better motivated ranges, the evidence for thawing quintessence disappears.</description>

      <title>Accurate Shear Estimation with Fourth-Order Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As imaging surveys progress in exploring the large-scale structure of the Universe through the use of weak gravitational lensing, achieving subpercent accuracy in estimating shape distortions caused by lensing, or shear, is imperative for precision cosmology. In this paper, we extend the \texttt{FPFS} shear estimator using fourth-order shapelet moments and combine it with the original second-order shear estimator to reduce galaxy shape noise. We calibrate this novel shear estimator analytically to a subpercent level accuracy using the \texttt{AnaCal} framework. This higher-order shear estimator is tested with realistic image simulations, and after analytical correction for the detection/selection bias and noise bias, the multiplicative shear bias $|m|$ is below $3\times10^{-3}$ ($99.7\%$ confidence interval) for both isolated and blended galaxies. Once combined with the second-order \texttt{FPFS} shear estimator, the shape noise is reduced by $\sim35\%$ for isolated galaxies in simulations with HSC and LSST observational conditions. However, for blended galaxies, the effective number density does not significantly improve with the combination of the two estimators. Based on these results, we recommend exploration of how this framework can further reduce the systematic uncertainties in shear due to PSF leakage and modelling error, and potentially provide improved precision in shear inference in high-resolution space-based images.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Constraints on Resonant Axion-Photon Conversions from CMB Spectral Distortions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) remain highly motivated extensions to the standard model due to their ability to address open questions such as the relic abundance of dark matter and the strong CP problem. Axions are also capable of undergoing a resonant mixing with photons when the masses of the two fields are roughly equal, producing a wide array of phenomenological consequences. Here, we revisit constraints coming from conversions of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) into axions, which will induce a distortion to the frequency spectrum of the background photons. We introduce a more detailed description for the modeling of the plasma mass of the photon, showcasing how the inclusion of Helium recombination can alter the conversion probability for photons in the Wien tail. Our results include an updated analytic framework, which allows us to define the precise spectral shape of the axion distortion, as well as a numeric component which utilized the code \texttt{CosmoTherm} to fully characterize the distortion, providing a slight increase in the constraining power over the analytics. We also treat for the first time the large-distortion regime for resonant axion-photon conversions. Under the assumption of large-scale primordial magnetic fields near the limit obtained from CMB observations, we find that spectral distortions can probe previously unexplored regions of the axion parameter space.</description>

      <title>Constraints on primordial black holes from the observed number of Icarus-like ultrahigh magnification events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Icarus is an individual star observed near the macro-critical curve of the MACS J1149 cluster, with the magnification factor estimated to be an order of thousands. Since microlenses near the macro-critical curve influence the number of such high-magnification events, the observed occurrence of Icarus-like events is expected to provide a useful constraint on the properties of microlenses. We first study the mass and mass fraction of microlenses consistent with the observed number of events assuming a single microlens component with a monochromatic mass function, finding that stars that contribute to the intracluster light (ICL) are consistent at the 95% confidence level. We then consider the contribution of primordial black holes (PBHs), which are one of the alternatives to the standard cold dark matter, as microlenses in addition to ICL stars. The derived parameter space indicates that a large abundance of PBHs with a mass around $1\ M_{\odot}$ and a fraction of PBHs to the total dark matter of $f_{\rm PBH} \gtrsim 0.2$ cannot explain the observed number of Icarus-like events and therefore is excluded. The methodology developed in this paper can be used to place tighter constraints on the fraction of PBHs from ongoing and future observations of ultrahigh magnification events.</description>

      <title>Determination of cosmic curvature independent of the sound horizon and $H_0$ using BOSS/eBOSS and DESI DR1 BAO observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an improved model-independent method for determining the cosmic curvature using the observations of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) and the Hubble parameter. The purpose of this work is to provide insights into late-universe curvature measurements using available observational data and techniques. Thus, we use two sources of BAO data sets, BOSS/eBOSS and latest DESI DR1, and two reconstruction methods, Gaussian process (GP) and artificial neural network (ANN). It is important to highlight that our method circumvents influence induced by the sound horizon in BAO observations and the Hubble constant. Combining BAO data from BOSS/eBOSS plus DESI DR1, we find that the constraint on the cosmic curvature results in $\Omega_K=-0.040^{+0.142}_{-0.145}$ with an observational uncertainty of $1\sigma$ in the framework of GP method. This result changes to $\Omega_K=-0.010^{+0.405}_{-0.424}$ when the ANN method is applied. Further comparative analysis of samples from two BAO data sources, we find that there is almost no difference between the two samples. Although the curvature values obtained from the data samples using DESI DR1 are on the slightly positive and the samples using BOSS/eBOSS are on the slightly negative, these results both report that our universe has a flat spatial curvature within uncertainties, and the precision of constraining the curvature with two BAO samples is almost equal.</description>

      <title>Reevaluating $H_0$ Tension with Non-Planck CMB and DESI BAO Joint Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $H_0$ tension in the spatially flat $\Lambda$CDM model is reevaluated by employing three sets of non-Planck CMB data, namely WMAP, WMAP+ACT, and WMAP+SPT, in conjunction with DESI BAO data and non-DESI BAO datasets including 6dFGS, SDSS DR7, and SDSS DR16. Our analysis yields $H_0 = 68.86\pm 0.68~\mathrm{km\ s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$ with WMAP+DESI BAO, $H_0 = 68.72\pm 0.51~\mathrm{km\ s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$ with WMAP+ACT+DESI BAO, and $H_0 = 68.62\pm 0.52~\mathrm{km\ s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$ with WMAP+SPT+DESI BAO. The results of non-Planck CMB+DESI BAO exhibit a $3.4\sigma$, $3.7\sigma$, and $3.8\sigma$ tension with the SH0ES local measurement respectively which are around $1 \sigma$ lower in significance for the Hubble tension compared to Planck CMB+DESI BAO. Moreover, by combining DESI BAO data+non-Planck CMB measurements, we obtain a more stringent constraint on the Hubble constant compared to non-DESI BAO data+non-Planck CMB data, as well as reducing the significance of the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>The constraining power of the Marked Power Spectrum: an analytical study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The marked power spectrum - a two-point correlation function of a transformed density field - has emerged as a promising tool for extracting cosmological information from the large-scale structure of the Universe. In this work, we present the first comprehensive analytical study of the marked power spectrum's sensitivity to primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) of the non-local type. We extend previous effective field theory frameworks to incorporate PNG, developing a complete theoretical model that we validate against the Quijote simulation suite. Through a systematic Fisher analysis, we compare the constraining power of the marked power spectrum against traditional approaches combining the power spectrum and bispectrum (P+B). We explore different choices of mark parameters to evaluate their impact on parameter constraints, particularly focusing on equilateral and orthogonal PNG as well as neutrino masses. Our analysis shows that while marking up underdense regions yields optimal constraints in the low shot-noise regime, the marked power spectrum's performance for discrete tracers with BOSS-like number densities does not surpass that of P+B analysis at mildly non-linear scales ($k \lesssim 0.25 \,h/\text{Mpc}$). However, the marked approach offers several practical advantages, including simpler estimation procedures and potentially more manageable systematic effects. Our theoretical framework reveals how the marked power spectrum incorporates higher-order correlation information through terms resembling tree-level bispectra and power spectrum convolutions. This work establishes a robust foundation for applying marked statistics to future large-volume surveys.</description>

      <title>Combining summary statistics with simulation-based inference for the 21 cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 21 cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization will be observed with the up-coming Square Kilometer Array (SKA). SKA should yield a full tomography of the signal which opens the possibility to explore its non-Gaussian properties. How can we extract the maximum information from the tomography and derive the tightest constraint on the signal? In this work, instead of looking for the most informative summary statistics, we investigate how to combine the information from two sets of summary statistics using simulation-based inference. To this purpose, we train Neural Density Estimators (NDE) to fit the implicit likelihood of our model, the LICORICE code, using the Loreli II database. We train three different NDEs: one to perform Bayesian inference on the power spectrum, one to do it on the linear moments of the Pixel Distribution Function (PDF) and one to work with the combination of the two. We perform $\sim 900$ inferences at different points in our parameter space and use them to assess both the validity of our posteriors with Simulation-based Calibration (SBC) and the typical gain obtained by combining summary statistics. We find that our posteriors are biased by no more than $\sim 20 \%$ of their standard deviation and under-confident by no more than $\sim 15 \%$. Then, we establish that combining summary statistics produces a contraction of the 4-D volume of the posterior (derived from the generalized variance) in 91.5 % of our cases, and in 70 to 80 % of the cases for the marginalized 1-D posteriors. The median volume variation is a contraction of a factor of a few for the 4D posteriors and a contraction of 20 to 30 % in the case of the marginalized 1D posteriors. This shows that our approach is a possible alternative to looking for sufficient statistics in the theoretical sense.</description>

      <title>Simulation-Based Inference with Quantile Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02413v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Neural Quantile Estimation (NQE), a novel Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) method based on conditional quantile regression. NQE autoregressively learns individual one dimensional quantiles for each posterior dimension, conditioned on the data and previous posterior dimensions. Posterior samples are obtained by interpolating the predicted quantiles using monotonic cubic Hermite spline, with specific treatment for the tail behavior and multi-modal distributions. We introduce an alternative definition for the Bayesian credible region using the local Cumulative Density Function (CDF), offering substantially faster evaluation than the traditional Highest Posterior Density Region (HPDR). In case of limited simulation budget and/or known model misspecification, a post-processing calibration step can be integrated into NQE to ensure the unbiasedness of the posterior estimation with negligible additional computational cost. We demonstrate that NQE achieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of benchmark problems.</description>

      <title>Underestimation of Hubble constant error bars: a historical analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An analysis of a historical compilation of Hubble-Lema\^itre constant values ($H_0$: 163 data points measured between 1976 and 2019) assuming the standard cosmological model gives a $\chi^2$ value of the dispersion with respect to the weighted average of 580, much larger than the number of points, which has an associated probability that is very low. This means that Hubble tensions were always present in the literature, due either to the underestimation of statistical error bars associated with the observed parameter measurements, or to the fact that systematic errors were not properly taken into account in many of the measurements.
  The fact that the underestimation of error bars for $H_0$ is so common might explain the apparent 4.4-sigma discrepancy by Riess et al. As a matter of fact, more recent precise $H_0$ measurements with JWST data by Freedman et al. using standard candles in galaxies find there is no tension with CMBR data, possibly indicating that previously Riess et al. had underestimated their errors.
  Here we have carried out a recalibration of the probabilities. The tension of 4.4-$\sigma $, estimated between the local Cepheid-supernova distance ladder and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, is indeed a 2.1-$\sigma $ tension in equivalent terms of a normal distribution, with an associated probability $P$ = 0.036 (1 in 28). This can be increased to an equivalent tension of 2.5-$\sigma $ in the worst cases of claimed 6-$\sigma $ tension, which may in any case happen as a random statistical fluctuation.
  If Hubble tensions were always present in the literature, and present day tensions are not more important than previous ones, why, then, is there so much noise and commotion surrounding Hubble tension after 2019? It is suggested here that this obeys a sociological phenomenon of ``groupthink''.</description>

      <title>Partition function approach to non-Gaussian likelihoods: information theory and state variables for Bayesian inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The significance of statistical physics concepts such as entropy extends far beyond classical thermodynamics. We interpret the similarity between partitions in statistical mechanics and partitions in Bayesian inference as an articulation of a result by Jaynes (1957), who clarified that thermodynamics is in essence a theory of information. In this, every sampling process has a mechanical analogue. Consequently, the divide between ensembles of samplers in parameter space and sampling from a mechanical system in thermodynamic equilibrium would be artificial. Based on this realisation, we construct a continuous modelling of a Bayes update akin to a transition between thermodynamic ensembles. This leads to an information theoretic interpretation of Jazinsky's equality, relating the expenditure of work to the influence of data via the likelihood. We propose one way to transfer the vocabulary and the formalism of thermodynamics (energy, work, heat) and statistical mechanics (partition functions) to statistical inference, starting from Bayes' law. Different kinds of inference processes are discussed and relative entropies are shown to follow from suitably constructed partitions as an analytical formulation of sampling processes. Lastly, we propose an effective dimension as a measure of system complexity. A numerical example from cosmology is put forward to illustrate these results.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Correlators at the Loop Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological correlators encode rich information about physics at the Hubble scale and may exhibit characteristic oscillatory signals due to the exchange of massive particles. Although many 1-loop processes, especially those that break de Sitter (dS) boosts, can generate significant leading signals for various particle models in cosmological collider physics, the precise results for these correlators or their full signals remain unknown due to the lack of symmetry. In this work, we apply the method of partial Mellin-Barnes (PMB) representation to the calculation of cosmological correlators at the loop level. As a first step, we use the PMB representation to calculate four-point cosmological correlators with bubble topology. We find that both the nonlocal and local signals arise from the factorized part, validating the cutting rules proposed in previous work, and are free from UV divergence. Furthermore, the UV divergence originates solely from the background piece and can be manifestly canceled by introducing the appropriate counterterm, similar to the procedure in flat spacetime. We also demonstrate how to renormalize the 1-loop correlators in Mellin space. After a consistency check with known results for the covariant case, we provide new analytical results for the signals generated from a nontrivial dS-boost-breaking bubble.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the bubble wall velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the bubble wall velocity in first-order phase transitions is a challenging task, requiring the solution of (coupled) equations of motion for the scalar field and Boltzmann equations for the particles in the plasma. The collision terms appearing in the Boltzmann equation present a prominent source of uncertainty as they are often known only at leading log accuracy. In this paper, we derive upper and lower bounds on the wall velocity, corresponding to the local thermal equilibrium and ballistic limits. These bounds are completely independent of the collision terms.
  For the ballistic approximation, we argue that the inhomogeneous plasma temperature and velocity distributions across the bubble wall should be taken into account. This way, the hydrodynamic obstruction previously observed in local thermal equilibrium is also present for the ballistic approximation. This is essential for the ballistic approximation to provide a lower bound on the wall velocity. We use a model-independent approach to study the behaviour of the limiting wall velocities as a function of a few generic parameters, and we test our developments in the singlet extended Standard Model.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the impact of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) on supermassive black holes (SMBHs) characterized by a spherical charge distribution. This work introduces a new class of spherically symmetric, self-gravitational relativistic charged models for FDM haloes, using the Einasto density model. This study enables the dark matter (DM) to appear as the matter ingredient, which constructs the black hole and extends the non-commutative mini black hole stellar solutions. By considering the charged anisotropic energy-momentum tensor with an equation of state (EoS) $p_{r}=-\rho$, we explore various black hole solutions for different values of the Einasto index and mass parameter. Our approach suggests that the central density of the resulting black hole model mimics the usual de Sitter core. Furthermore, we discuss the possibility of constructing a charged self-gravitational droplet by replacing the above-mentioned EoS with a non-local one. However, under these circumstances, the radial pressure is observed to be negative. Ultimately, we consider various possibilities of constructing DM black holes, featuring intermediate masses that could evolve into galaxies. Consequently, some of these theoretical models have the potential to replace the usual black hole solutions of the galactic core. Simultaneously, these models are physically beneficial for being comprised of the fundamental matter component of the cosmos. Due to the outcomes of this paper, we would be able to study the connection between BH and DM by formulating stable stellar structures featuring fuzzy mass distributions derived from the Einasto distribution of DM halos.</description>

      <title>Learning the Universe: Cosmological and Astrophysical Parameter Inference with Galaxy Luminosity Functions and Colours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform the first direct cosmological and astrophysical parameter inference from the combination of galaxy luminosity functions and colours using a simulation based inference approach. Using the Synthesizer code we simulate the dust attenuated ultraviolet--near infrared stellar emission from galaxies in thousands of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations from the CAMELS suite, including the Swift-EAGLE, Illustris-TNG, Simba &amp; Astrid galaxy formation models. For each galaxy we calculate the rest-frame luminosity in a number of photometric bands, including the SDSS $\textit{ugriz}$ and GALEX FUV &amp; NUV filters; this dataset represents the largest catalogue of synthetic photometry based on hydrodynamic galaxy formation simulations produced to date, totalling &gt;200 million sources. From these we compile luminosity functions and colour distributions, and find clear dependencies on both cosmology and feedback. We then perform simulation based (likelihood-free) inference using these distributions, and obtain constraints on both cosmological and astrophysical parameters. Both colour distributions and luminosity functions provide complementary information on certain parameters when performing inference. Most interestingly we achieve constraints on $\sigma_8$, describing the clustering of matter. This is attributable to the fact that the photometry encodes the star formation--metal enrichment history of each galaxy; galaxies in a universe with a higher $\sigma_8$ tend to form earlier and have higher metallicities, which leads to redder colours. We find that a model trained on one galaxy formation simulation generalises poorly when applied to another, and attribute this to differences in the subgrid prescriptions, and lack of flexibility in our emission modelling.

      <title>3D Localization of FRB 20190425A for Its Potential Host Galaxy and Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are high-energy, short-duration phenomena in radio astronomy. Identifying their host galaxies can provide insights into their mysterious origins. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to identifying potential host galaxies in three-dimensional space. We use FRB 20190425A and GW190425 as an example to illustrate our method. Recently, due to spatial and temporal proximity, the potential association of GW190425 with FRB 20190425A has drawn attention, leading to the identification of a likely host galaxy, UGC 10667, albeit without confirmed kilonova emissions. We search for the host galaxy of FRB 20190425A with a full CHIME localization map. Regardless of the validity of the association between GW190425 and FRB 20190425A, we identify an additional potential host galaxy (SDSS J171046.84+212732.9) from the updated GLADE galaxy catalog, supplementing the importance of exploring the new volume. We employed various methodologies to determine the most probable host galaxy of GW190424 and FRB 20190425A, including a comparison of galaxy properties and constraints on their reported observation limits using various Kilonova models. Our analysis suggests that current observations do not definitively identify the true host galaxy. Additionally, the Kilonova models characterized by a gradual approach to their peak are contradicted by the observational upper limits of both galaxies. Although the absence of optical emission detection raises doubts, it does not definitively disprove the connection between GW and FRB.</description>

      <title>Towards a precision calculation of $N_{\rm eff}$ in the Standard Model IV: Impact of positronium formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present in this work the first assessment of the previously unexplored effect of positronium formation on the value of the effective number of neutrino species in the Standard Model, $N_{\mathrm{eff}}^{\mathrm{SM}}$. We find that the expected impact on $N_{\mathrm{eff}}^{\mathrm{SM}}$ crucially depends on the temperature at which positronium equilibrates as well as the rate at which this equilibration happens. The dominant factor limiting the formation process is the melting of positronium at high temperatures driven by Debye screening of the electrostatic potential and scatterings with real photons. Using simple physical arguments, we estimate that positronium forms at temperatures around $50-80$ keV. If formation and equilibration were instantaneous, the resulting change in $N_{\mathrm{eff}}^{\mathrm{SM}}$ would be at most $|\Delta N_{\mathrm{eff}}| \sim 10^{-4}$, comparable to other uncertainties in the current benchmark value for $N_{\mathrm{eff}}^{\mathrm{SM}}$. A more gradual formation could however yield a larger change, necessitating in turn a more detailed investigation before we can conclusively neglect the effect of positronium formation on $N_{\mathrm{eff}}^{\mathrm{SM}}$.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave signatures from reheating in Chern-Simons running-vacuum cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the context of a Chern-Simons running-vacuum-model (RVM) cosmology, one expects an early-matter dominated (eMD) reheating period after RVM inflation driven by the axion field. Treating thus in this work Chern-Simons RVM cosmology as an effective $f(R)$ gravity theory characterized by logarithmic corrections of the spacetime curvature, we study the gravitational-wave (GW) signal induced by the nearly-scale invariant inflationary adiabatic curvature perturbations during the transition from the eMD era driven by the axion to the late radiation-dominated era. Remarkably, by accounting for the extra GW scalaron polarization present within $f(R)$ gravity theories, we find regions in the parameter space of the theory where one is met with a distinctive induced GW signal with a universal $f^6$ high-frequency scaling compared to the $f^7$ scaling present in general relativity (GR). Interestingly enough, for axion masses $m_a$ higher than 1 GeV and axion gauge couplings $f_a$ above $10^{-3}$ Planck mass, one can produce induced GW spectra within the sensitivity bands of future GW observatories such as the Einstein Telescope (ET), the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), the Big Bang Observer (BBO) and the Square Kilometer Arrays (SKA).</description>

      <title>The properties of the interstellar medium in dusty, star-forming galaxies at $z \sim 2-4$: The shape of the CO spectral line energy distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The molecular gas in the interstellar medium (ISM) of star-forming galaxy populations exhibits diverse physical properties. We investigate the $^{12}$CO excitation of twelve dusty, luminous star-forming galaxies at $z \sim 2-4$ by combining observations of the $^{12}$CO from $J_{\rm up} = 1$ to $J_{\rm up} = 8$. The spectral line energy distribution (SLED) has a similar shape to NGC 253, M82, and local ULIRGs, with much stronger excitation than the Milky Way inner disc. By combining with resolved dust continuum sizes from high-resolution $870$-$\mu$m ALMA observations and dust mass measurements determined from multi-wavelength SED fitting, we measure the relationship between the $^{12}$CO SLED and probable physical drivers of excitation: star-formation efficiency, the average intensity of the radiation field $\langle U\rangle$, and the star-formation rate surface density. The primary driver of high-$J_{\rm up}$ $^{12}$CO excitation in star-forming galaxies is star-formation rate surface density. We use the ratio of the CO($3-2$) and CO($6-5$) line fluxes to infer the CO excitation in each source and find that the average ratios for our sample are elevated compared to observations of low-redshift, less actively star-forming galaxies and agree well with predictions from numerical models that relate the ISM excitation to the star-formation rate surface density. The significant scatter in the line ratios of a factor $\approx 3$ within our sample likely reflects intrinsic variations in the ISM properties which may be caused by other effects on the excitation of the molecular gas, such as cosmic ray ionization rates and mechanical heating through turbulence dissipation.</description>

      <title>Modified gravity from Weyl connection and the $f(R,\cal{A})$ extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use Weyl connection and Weyl geometry in order to construct novel modified gravitational theories. In the simplest case where one uses only the Weyl-connection Ricci scalar as a Lagrangian, the theory recovers general relativity. However, by upgrading the Weyl field to a dynamical field with a general potential and/or general couplings constructed from its trace, leads to new modified gravity theories, where the extra degree of freedom is the Weyl field. Additionally, since the Weyl-connection Ricci scalar differs from the Levi-Civita Ricci scalar by terms up to first derivatives of the Weyl field, the resulting field equations for both the metric and the Weyl field are of second order, and thus the theory is free from Ostrogradsky ghosts. Finally, we construct the most general theory, namely the $f(\tilde{R},\cal{A})$ gravity, which is also ghost free and has $2+2$ degrees of freedom. Applying the above classes of theories at a cosmological framework we obtain an effective dark energy sector of geometrical origin. In the simplest class of theories we are able to obtain an effective cosmological constant, and thus we recover $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, nevertheless in more general cases we acquire a dynamical dark energy. These theories can reproduce the thermal history of the Universe, and the corresponding dark energy equation-of-state parameter presents a rich behavior.</description>

      <title>Not Just a Dot: the complex UV morphology and underlying properties of Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze 99 photometrically selected Little Red Dots (LRDs) at z ~ 4-8 in the GOODS fields, leveraging ultra-deep JADES NIRCam short-wavelength (SW) data. We examine the morphology of 30 LRDs; the remaining 69 are predominantly compact, i.e. are strongly dominated by sources &lt; 400 pc in diameter and lack extended components even in stacked SW band images. Among the LRDs selected for morphological analysis, 50% show at least two distinct, associated sources or galaxy components, while the others appear as single sources with highly asymmetric structures. We find median stellar masses of log10(M*/Msun) = 9.07(-0.08)(+0.11) for pure stellar models with Av ~ 1.16(+0.11)(-0.21) mag, and log10(M*/Msun) = 9.67(+0.17)(-0.27) for models including AGNs, where Av ~ 2.74(+0.55)(-0.71) mag, consistent with recent results showing LRDs tend to have high stellar masses and dust content when fitted with AGN models. NIRSpec spectra are available for 15 sources, 6 of which fall within the morphological analysis sample and show multiple components. Among these 15, broad H-alpha emission is detected in 40%, with full-width half-maximum (FWHM) ranging from 1200 to 2900 km/s. One source exhibits broad H-beta emission with FWHM = 2000 +/- 500 km/s. Analysis of line ratios probing the interstellar medium (ISM) reveals a composite nature, indicating AGN activity combined with stellar processes. These findings suggest LRDs have a mixed nature, with AGN signatures in some cases linked to disturbed morphologies observed at rest-frame UV wavelengths.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we calibrate the luminosity relation of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with the machine learning (ML) algorithms from the Pantheon+ sample of type Ia supernovae in a cosmology-independent way. By using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest (RF) selected with the best performance in the ML algorithms, we calibrate the Amati relation (\unboldmath{$E_{\rm p}$-$E_{\rm iso}$}) relation with the A219 sample to construct the Hubble diagram of GRBs. Via the Markov Chain Monte Carlo numerical method with GRBs at high redshift and latest observational Hubble data, we find the results of constraints on cosmological models by using KNN and RF algorithms are consistent with those obtained from GRBs calibrated by using the Gaussian Process.</description>

      <title>The Redshift-Space Momentum Power Spectrum III: measuring the growth rate from the SDSSv survey using auto- and cross- power spectrum of the galaxy density and momentum fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The large-scale structure of the Universe and its evolution over time contains an abundance of cosmological information. One way to unlock this is by measuring the density and momentum power spectrum from the positions and peculiar velocities of galaxies, and fitting the cosmological parameters from these power spectrum. In this paper, we will explore the cross power spectrum between the density and momentum fields of galaxies. We derive the estimator of the density-momentum cross power spectrum multipoles. The growth rate of the large-scale-structure, $f\sigma_8$ is measured from fitting the combined density monopole, momentum monopole and cross dipole power spectrum. The estimators and models of power spectrum as well as our fitting method have been tested using mock catalogues, and we find that they perform well in recovering the fiducial values of the cosmological parameters of the simulations, and we also find that the errors of the parameters can be largely reduced by including the cross-power spectrum in the fit. We measure the auto-density, auto-momentum and cross power spectrum using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 14 peculiar velocity catalogue. The fit result of the growth rate $f\sigma_8$ is $f\sigma_8=0.413^{+0.050}_{-0.058}$ at effective redshift $z_{\mathrm{eff}}=0.073$, and our measurement is consistent with the prediction of the $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter cosmological model assuming General Relativity.</description>

      <title>DESI 2024 VII: Cosmological Constraints from the Full-Shape Modeling of Clustering Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present cosmological results from the measurement of clustering of galaxy, quasar and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest tracers from the first year of observations with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI Data Release 1). We adopt the full-shape (FS) modeling of the power spectrum, including the effects of redshift-space distortions, in an analysis which has been validated in a series of supporting papers. In the flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model, DESI (FS+BAO), combined with a baryon density prior from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and a weak prior on the scalar spectral index, determines matter density to $\Omega_\mathrm{m}=0.2962\pm 0.0095$, and the amplitude of mass fluctuations to $\sigma_8=0.842\pm 0.034$. The addition of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data tightens these constraints to $\Omega_\mathrm{m}=0.3056\pm 0.0049$ and $\sigma_8=0.8121\pm 0.0053$, while further addition of the the joint clustering and lensing analysis from the Dark Energy Survey Year-3 (DESY3) data leads to a 0.4% determination of the Hubble constant, $H_0 = (68.40\pm 0.27)\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$. In models with a time-varying dark energy equation of state, combinations of DESI (FS+BAO) with CMB and type Ia supernovae continue to show the preference, previously found in the DESI DR1 BAO analysis, for $w_0&gt;-1$ and $w_a&lt;0$ with similar levels of significance. DESI data, in combination with the CMB, impose the upper limits on the sum of the neutrino masses of $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.071\,{\rm eV}$ at 95% confidence. DESI data alone measure the modified-gravity parameter that controls the clustering of massive particles, $\mu_0=0.11^{+0.45}_{-0.54}$, while the combination of DESI with the CMB and the clustering and lensing analysis from DESY3 constrains both modified-gravity parameters, giving $\mu_0 = 0.04\pm 0.22$ and $\Sigma_0 = 0.044\pm 0.047$, in agreement with general relativity.

      <title>Exploring HOD-dependent systematics for the DESI 2024 Full-Shape galaxy clustering analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the robustness of the DESI 2024 cosmological inference from fits to the full shape of the galaxy power spectrum to uncertainties in the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) model of the galaxy-halo connection and the choice of priors on nuisance parameters. We assess variations in the recovered cosmological parameters across a range of mocks populated with different HOD models and find that shifts are often greater than 20% of the expected statistical uncertainties from the DESI data. We encapsulate the effect of such shifts in terms of a systematic covariance term, $\mathsf{C}_{\rm HOD}$, and an additional diagonal contribution quantifying the impact of our choice of nuisance parameter priors on the ability of the effective field theory (EFT) model to correctly recover the cosmological parameters of the simulations. These two covariance contributions are designed to be added to the usual covariance term, $\mathsf{C}_{\rm stat}$, describing the statistical uncertainty in the power spectrum measurement, in order to fairly represent these sources of systematic uncertainty. This approach is more general and robust to choices of model free parameters or additional external datasets used in cosmological fits than the alternative approach of adding systematic uncertainties at the level of the recovered marginalised parameter posteriors. We compare the approaches within the context of a fixed $\Lambda$CDM model and demonstrate that our method gives conservative estimates of the systematic uncertainty that nevertheless have little impact on the final posteriors obtained from DESI data.</description>

      <title>Analytical and EZmock covariance validation for the DESI 2024 results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The estimation of uncertainties in cosmological parameters is an important challenge in Large-Scale-Structure (LSS) analyses. For standard analyses such as Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and Full Shape, two approaches are usually considered. First: analytical estimates of the covariance matrix use Gaussian approximations and (nonlinear) clustering measurements to estimate the matrix, which allows a relatively fast and computationally cheap way to generate matrices that adapt to an arbitrary clustering measurement. On the other hand, sample covariances are an empirical estimate of the matrix based on en ensemble of clustering measurements from fast and approximate simulations. While more computationally expensive due to the large amount of simulations and volume required, these allow us to take into account systematics that are impossible to model analytically. In this work we compare these two approaches in order to enable DESI's key analyses. We find that the configuration space analytical estimate performs satisfactorily in BAO analyses and its flexibility in terms of input clustering makes it the fiducial choice for DESI's 2024 BAO analysis. On the contrary, the analytical computation of the covariance matrix in Fourier space does not reproduce the expected measurements in terms of Full Shape analyses, which motivates the use of a corrected mock covariance for DESI's Full Shape analysis.</description>

      <title>The distribution and morphologies of Fornax Cluster dwarf galaxies suggest they lack dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.02265v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to their low surface brightness, dwarf galaxies are particularly susceptible to tidal forces. The expected degree of disturbance depends on the assumed gravity law and whether they have a dominant dark halo. This makes dwarf galaxies useful for testing different gravity models. In this project, we use the Fornax Deep Survey (FDS) dwarf galaxy catalogue to compare the properties of dwarf galaxies in the Fornax Cluster with those predicted by the Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) standard model of cosmology and Milgromian dynamics (MOND). We construct a test particle simulation of the Fornax system. We then use the MCMC method to fit this to the FDS distribution of tidal susceptibility $\eta$ (half-mass radius divided by theoretical tidal radius), the fraction of dwarfs that visually appear disturbed as a function of $\eta$, and the distribution of projected separation from the cluster centre. This allows us to constrain the $\eta$ value at which dwarfs should get destroyed by tides. Accounting for an $r'$-band surface brightness limit of 27.8 magnitudes per square arcsec, the required stability threshold is $\eta_{\textrm{destr}} = 0.25^{+0.07}_{-0.03}$ in $\Lambda$CDM and $ 1.88^{+0.85}_{-0.53}$ in MOND. The $\Lambda$CDM value is in tension with previous $\textit{N}$-body dwarf galaxy simulations, which indicate that $\eta_{\textrm{destr}} \approx 1$. Our MOND $\textit{N}$-body simulations indicate that $\eta_{\textrm{destr}} = 1.70 \pm 0.30$, which agrees well with our MCMC analysis of the FDS. We therefore conclude that the observed deformations of dwarf galaxies in the Fornax Cluster and the lack of low surface brightness dwarfs towards its centre are incompatible with $\Lambda$CDM expectations but well consistent with MOND.</description>

      <title>The conceptual design of the 50-meter Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18645v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The submillimeter and millimeter ((sub-)mm) sky contains a vast wealth of information that is both complementary and inaccessible to other wavelengths. Over half the light we receive is observable at (sub-)mm wavelengths, yet we have mapped only a small portion of the sky at sufficient spatial resolution and sensitivity to detect and resolve distant galaxies or star forming cores within their large-scale environments. For decades the astronomical community has highlighted the need for a large, high-throughput (sub-)mm ($\lambda\sim 0.35-10$ mm) single dish. The Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), with its 50-m aperture and $2^\circ$ maximal field of view, aims to be such a facility. We present here the preliminary design concept for AtLAST, developed through an EU Horizon 2020-funded design study. Our design approach begins with a long lineage of (sub-)mm telescopes, relies on calculations and simulations to realize the optics, and uses finite element analysis to optimize the designs for the mechanical structure and subsystems. The demanding technical requirements for AtLAST, set by transformative science goals, have motivated the design effort to combine novel concepts with lessons learned from the past experience of previous efforts. The result is an innovative rocking chair design with six instrument bays, two of which are mounted on Nasmyth platforms, inside a large receiver cabin. Ultimately, AtLAST aims to achieve a surface accuracy of $\leq 20~\mu$m root mean square half wavefront error, corresponding a Ruze efficiency $&gt;50\%$ at 950~GHz. We conclude that closed-loop metrology of the active primary surface will likely be required to achieve our surface accuracy goal. In the next phase of the project, we will prototype and test such metrology on existing platforms, with a goal of delivering a mature, construction-ready design by the end of this decade.</description>

      <title>Reconstructions of $f(\mathcal{P})$ and $f(\mathcal{Q})$ gravity models from $(m,n)$-type Barrow Holographic Dark Energy: Analysis and Observational Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this research, we have reconstructed the extended $f(\mathcal{P})$ cubic gravity and symmetric $f(\mathcal{Q})$ teleparallel gravity from the $(m,n)$-type Barrow Holographic Dark Energy (BHDE) model. We have derived the unknown functions $f(\mathcal{P})$ and $f(\mathcal{Q})$ in terms of $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$, assuming a flat, homogeneous, and isotropic universe. To constrain our model parameters, we employed cosmic chronometer datasets and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation datasets, utilizing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. We analysed the behaviour and stability of each model throughout the universe's evolution by studying crucial parameters such as the deceleration parameter, equation of state (EoS) parameter $\omega_{DE}$, density parameter $\Omega(z)$ and the square of the speed of sound $v_s^2$. Additionally, we explored the cosmographic behaviour by plotting the jerk parameter, snap parameter, and lerk parameter against the redshift. Furthermore, we examined the $\omega'_{DE}-\omega_{DE}$ phase plane, the $(r,s^*)$, $(r,q)$ statefinder parameters, and the $Om(z)$ parameter offers profound revelations about the dynamics of the universe and the distinctive features of dark energy. Our analyses indicated that our model could produce a universe undergoing accelerated expansion with quintessence-type dark energy. These findings contribute to our understanding of the nature of dark energy and the evolution of the cosmos.</description>

      <title>Cross-correlating IceCube neutrinos with a large set of galaxy samples around redshift z ~ 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The IceCube neutrino telescope has detected a diffuse flux of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos, but the sources of this flux have largely remained elusive. Using the 10-year IceCube public dataset, we search for correlations between neutrino events and tracers of large-scale structure (LSS). We conduct a combined cross-correlation analysis using several wide-area galaxy catalogs spanning a redshift range of z = 0.1 to z ~ 2.5 as well as maps of the cosmic infrared background. We do not detect a definitive signal, but find tantalizing hints of a potential positive correlation between neutrinos and the tracers of LSS. We additionally construct a simple model to interpret galaxy-neutrino cross-correlations in terms of the redshift distribution of neutrino sources. We put upper limits on the clustering amplitude of neutrinos based on the measured cross-correlations with galaxies and forecast the improvements on these constraints that can be obtained using future detectors. We show that, in the future, neutrino-galaxy cross-correlations should be a powerful probe to constrain properties of neutrino source populations.</description>

      <title>Bursty Star Formation in Dwarfs is Sensitive to Numerical Choices in Supernova Feedback Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulations of galaxy formation are mostly unable to resolve the energy-conserving phase of individual supernova events, having to resort to subgrid models to distribute the energy and momentum resulting from stellar feedback. However, the properties of these simulated galaxies, including the morphology, stellar mass formed and the burstiness of the star formation history, are highly sensitive to numerical choices adopted in these subgrid models. Using the {\small SMUGGLE} stellar feedback model, we compute idealized simulations of a $M_{\rm vir} \sim 10^{10} \, \msun$ dwarf galaxy, a regime where most simulation codes predict significant burstiness in star formation, resulting in strong gas flows that lead to the formation of dark matter cores. We find that by varying only the directional distribution of momentum imparted from supernovae to the surrounding gas, while holding the total momentum per supernova constant, bursty star formation may be amplified or completely suppressed, and the total stellar mass formed can vary by as much as a factor of $\sim 3$. In particular, when momentum is primarily directed perpendicular to the gas disk, less bursty and lower overall star formation rates result, yielding less gas turbulence, more disky morphologies and a retention of cuspy dark matter density profiles. An improved understanding of the non-linear coupling of stellar feedback into inhomogeneous gaseous media is thus needed to make robust predictions for stellar morphologies and dark matter core formation in dwarfs independent of uncertain numerical choices in the baryonic treatment.</description>

      <title>Detecting kHz gravitons from a neutron star merger with a multi-mode resonant mass detector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a multi-mode bar consisting of mass elements of decreasing size for the implementation of a gravitational version of the photo-electric effect through the stimulated absorption of up to kHz gravitons from a binary neutron star merger and post-merger. We find that the multi-mode detector has normal modes that retain the coupling strength to the gravitational wave of the largest mass-element, while only having an effective mass comparable to the mass of the smallest element. This allows the normal modes to have graviton absorption rates due to the tonne-scale largest mass, while the single graviton absorption process in the normal mode could be resolved through energy measurements of a mass-element in-principle smaller than pico-gram scale. We argue the feasibility of directly counting gravito-phonons in the bar through energy measurements of the end mass. This improves the transduction of the single-graviton signal, enhancing the feasibility of detecting single gravitons.</description>

      <title>Bubble wall velocity from number density current in (non)equilibrium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) serve as comprehensive probes into our early Universe with associated generations of stochastic gravitational waves and superhorizon curvature perturbations or even primordial black holes. In characterizing the FOPT, phenomenological parameters like transition temperatures, strength factors, bubble separations, and energy budgets can be easily extracted from the macroscopic equilibrium features of the underlying particle physics models except for the terminal wall velocity of the bubble expansion, making it the last key parameter to be determined most difficultly due to the non-equilibrium nature of the microscopic transition model. In this paper, we propose a new model-independent approach to calculate the bubble wall velocity by virtue of an extra junction condition from the conservation and violation of the total number density current across the shock front (if any) and bubble wall, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a scalar field theory with a Minkowski false vacuum and an unbounded (or very deep) true vacuum. We show compelling evidence that an AdS bubble of vanishing total energy, embedded in asymptotically flat spacetime, generically undergoes a spherical collapse which leads to a space-like curvature singularity after the formation of trapped surfaces and apparent horizons. The crunch singularity, which is hided behind an apparent horizon, occurs before the true vacuum is reached, and the existence of a lower bound of the scalar field potential is not a necessary condition for its formation.</description>
