      <title>Analyzing lump-type solutions in scalar field models through configurational information measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we employ a configurational information measure, specifically the differential configurational complexity (DCC), to quantify the information content of lump-type solutions in various scalar field models, including two modified inverted $\phi^{4}$ models, the modified $\phi^{3}$ model, as well as two additional families of lump models. Our objective is to complement previous studies by providing an informational perspective that distinguishes different solutions based on their energy configurations. We explore how the DCC measure relates to energy and its applicability in analyzing degenerate states. Our findings indicate that DCC effectively correlates with the energy parameters of the solutions, offering significant insights into their informational properties. This study underscores the value of using informational metrics like DCC to deepen our understanding of the structural and dynamic characteristics of complex systems in theoretical physics.</description>

      <title>Exponential and algebraic double-soliton solutions of the massive Thirring model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The newly discovered exponential and algebraic double-soliton solutions of the massive Thirring model in laboratory coordinates are placed in the context of the inverse scattering transform. We show that the exponential double-solitons correspond to double isolated eigenvalues in the Lax spectrum, whereas the algebraic double-solitons correspond to double embedded eigenvalues on the imaginary axis, where the continuous spectrum resides. This resolves the long-standing conjecture that multiple embedded eigenvalues may exist in the spectral problem associated with the massive Thirring model. To obtain the exponential double-solitons, we solve the Riemann--Hilbert problem with the reflectionless potential in the case of a quadruplet of double poles in each quadrant of the complex plane. To obtain the algebraic double-solitons, we consider the singular limit where the quadruplet of double poles degenerates into a symmetric pair of double embedded poles on the imaginary axis.</description>

      <title>Prediction and observation of topological modes in fractal nonlinear optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This item from the News &amp; Views category, to be published in Light: Science &amp; Applications, aims to provide a summary of theoretical and experimental results recently published in Ref. [24], which demonstrate the creation of corner modes in nonlinear optical waveguides of the higher-order topological-insulator (HOTI) type. Actually, these are second-order HOTIs, in which the transverse dimension of the topologically protected edge modes is smaller than the bulk dimension (it is 2, in the case of optical waveguide) by 2, implying zero dimension of the protected modes, that are actually realized as corner or defect ones. Work [24] reports prediction and creation of various forms of the corner modes in a HOTI with a fractal transverse structure, represented by the Sierpinski gasket (SG). The self-focusing nonlinearity of the waveguide's material transforms the corner modes into corner solitons, almost all of which are stable. The solitons may be attached to external or internal corners created by the underlying SG. This N&amp;V item offers an overview of these new findings reported in Ref. [24] and other recent works, and a brief discussion of directions for the further work on this topic.</description>

      <title>On a countable sequence of homoclinic orbits arising near a saddle-center point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exponential small splitting of separatrices in the singular perturbation theory leads generally to nonvanishing oscillations near a saddle--center point and to nonexistence of a true homoclinic orbit. It was conjectured long ago that the oscillations may vanish at a countable set of small parameter values if there exist a quadruplet of singularities in the complex analytic extension of the limiting homoclinic orbit. The present paper gives a rigorous proof of this conjecture for a particular fourth-order equation relevant to the traveling wave reduction of the modified Korteweg--de Vries equation with the fifth-order dispersion term.</description>

      <title>On smooth and peaked traveling waves in a local model for shallow water waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new model equation for Stokes gravity waves based on conformal transformations of Euler's equations. The local version of the model equation is relevant for dynamics of shallow water waves. It allows us to characterize the traveling periodic waves both in the case of smooth and peaked waves and to solve the existence problem exactly, albeit not in elementary functions. Spectral stability of smooth waves with respect to co-periodic perturbations is proven analytically based on the exact count of eigenvalues in a constrained spectral problem.</description>
