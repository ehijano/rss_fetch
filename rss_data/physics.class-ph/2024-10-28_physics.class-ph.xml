      <title>Local temperature measurement in molecular dynamics simulations with rigid constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constraining molecules in simulations (such as with constant bond lengths and/or angles) reduces their degrees of freedom (DoF), which in turn affects temperature calculations in those simulations. When local temperatures are measured, e.g. from a set of atoms in a subvolume or from velocities in one Cartesian direction, the result can appear to unphysically violate equipartition of the kinetic energy if the local DoF are not correctly calculated. Here we determine how to correctly calculate local temperatures from arbitrary Cartesian component kinetic energies, accounting for general geometric constraints, by self-consistently evaluating the DoF of atoms subjected to those constraints. The method is validated on a variety of test systems, including systems subject to a temperature gradient and those confined between walls. It is also shown to provide a sensitive test for the breakdown of kinetic energy equipartition caused by the approximate nature of numerical integration or insufficient equilibration times. As a practical demonstration, we show that kinetic energy equipartition between C and H atoms connected by rigid bonds can be violated even at the commonly-used time step of 2 fs, and that this equipartition violation appears to usefully indicate configurational overheating.</description>

      <title>The Verifications of No Bright and Dark Fringes In a Standing-wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: After Wiener's experiment, it had been widely accepted that only electric-field was the fundamental-factor for optical interference and believed that there were alternating bright and dark fringes in a light standing-wave field which was formed by a pair of parallel light-beams traveling in mutually opposite directions. While being supplied to the bright fringes, the light-energy from the beams must pass across the dark fringes or across the electric-field nodes, so that the electric-field would not keep zero at the nodes. However, it was inconsistent with the characteristic of electric-field nodes at which the electric-field was zero anytime. Therefore, this naturally led to a presumption that there were no bright and dark interference-fringes in a standing-wave field, which was consistent with zero of the electromagnetic energy-flux-density in a standing-wave field. In this paper, it was fully verified from several aspects, including an ideal experiment, comparing a standing-wave with an LC circuit, a group of experiments and theoretical deductions of formulas. An inclination factor was introduced into the previous common formula of two-beams-interference to rectify it back to the original meaning of its initial definition by energy-flux-density rather than electric-field energy-density. Given the angle between the two-beams to be 180 degrees as a validation, it was verified by the corrected formula that the light-intensities of the bright interference-fringes in a standing-wave were equal to zero. i.e., no interference-fringes existed in a standing-wave field.Thus, instead of electric-field energy-density alone from Wiener's conclusions, interference-energy-flux density was the fundamental-factor to form interference-fringes. The magnetic-field vector acts the same role as the electric-field vector on light interacting with substance.</description>
