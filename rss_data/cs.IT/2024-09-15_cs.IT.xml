      <title>Frequency Diverse RIS (FD-RIS) Enhanced Wireless Communications via Joint Distance-Angle Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conventional reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted far-field communication systems can only implement angle beamforming, which actually limits the capability for reconfiguring the wireless propagation environment. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a newly designed frequency diverse RIS (FD-RIS), which can achieve joint distance-angle beamforming with the assistance of the time modulation technology. The signal processing model for FD-RIS-aided wireless communications is first derived. Then, an optimization problem aimed at maximizing the achievable rate is formulated where the frequency-time modulations are jointly optimized to achieve distance-angle beamforming. Furthermore, a novel iterative algorithm based on the cross-entropy optimization (CEO) framework is proposed to effectively handle the non-convex optimization problem. The numerical results validate that the proposed FD-RIS assisted communication scheme can achieve a notable performance improvement compared with the baseline scheme utilizing traditional RIS. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed CEO algorithm is further verified by comparing with the benchmark using the genetic algorithm (GA).</description>

      <title>Secure Offloading in NOMA-Aided Aerial MEC Systems Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile edge computing (MEC) technology can reduce user latency and energy consumption by offloading computationally intensive tasks to the edge servers. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technology enable the MEC networks to provide offloaded computing services for massively accessed terrestrial users conveniently. However, the broadcast nature of signal propagation in NOMA-based UAV-MEC networks makes it vulnerable to eavesdropping by malicious eavesdroppers. In this work, a secure offload scheme is proposed for NOMA-based UAV-MEC systems with the existence of an aerial eavesdropper. The long-term average network computational cost is minimized by jointly designing the UAV's trajectory, the terrestrial users' transmit power, and computational frequency while ensuring the security of users' offloaded data. Due to the eavesdropper's location uncertainty, the worst-case security scenario is considered through the estimated eavesdropping range. Due to the high-dimensional continuous action space, the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm is utilized to solve the non-convex optimization problem. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Learning Short Codes for Fading Channels with No or Receiver-Only Channel State Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In next-generation wireless networks, low latency often necessitates short-length codewords that either do not use channel state information (CSI) or rely solely on CSI at the receiver (CSIR). Gaussian codes that achieve capacity for AWGN channels may be unsuitable for these no-CSI and CSIR-only cases. In this work, we design short-length codewords for these cases using an autoencoder architecture. From the designed codes, we observe the following: In the no-CSI case, the learned codes are mutually orthogonal when the distribution of the real and imaginary parts of the fading random variable has support over the entire real line. However, when the support is limited to the non-negative real line, the codes are not mutually orthogonal. For the CSIR-only case, deep learning-based codes designed for AWGN channels perform worse in fading channels with optimal coherent detection compared to codes specifically designed for fading channels with CSIR, where the autoencoder jointly learns encoding, coherent combining, and decoding. In both no-CSI and CSIR-only cases, the codes perform at least as well as or better than classical codes of the same block length.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-based Codes for Wiretap Fading Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wiretap channel is a well-studied problem in the physical layer security (PLS) literature. Although it is proven that the decoding error probability and information leakage can be made arbitrarily small in the asymptotic regime, further research on finite-blocklength codes is required on the path towards practical, secure communications systems. This work provides the first experimental characterization of a deep learning-based, finite-blocklength code construction for multi-tap fading wiretap channels without channel state information (CSI). In addition to the evaluation of the average probability of error and information leakage, we illustrate the influence of (i) the number of fading taps, (ii) differing variances of the fading coefficients and (iii) the seed selection for the hash function-based security layer.</description>

      <title>Generalized Nearest Neighbor Decoding: General Input Constellation and a Case Study of Interference Suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, generalized nearest neighbor decoding (GNND), a recently proposed receiver architecture, is studied for channels under general input constellations, and multiuser uplink interference suppression is employed as a case study for demonstrating its potential. In essence, GNND generalizes the wellknown nearest neighbor decoding, by introducing a symbol-level memoryless processing step, which can be rendered seamlessly compatible with Gaussian channel-based decoders. First, criteria of the optimal GNND are derived for general input constellations, expressed in the form of conditional moments matching, thereby generalizing the prior work which has been confined to Gaussian input. Then, the optimal GNND is applied to the use case of multiuser uplink, for which the optimal GNND is shown to be capable of achieving information rates nearly identical to the channel mutual information. By contrast, the commonly used channel linearization (CL) approach incurs a noticeable rate loss. A coded modulation scheme is subsequently developed, aiming at implementing GNND using off-the-shelf channel codes, without requiring iterative message passing between demodulator and decoder. Through numerical experiments it is validated that the developed scheme significantly outperforms the CL-based scheme.</description>

      <title>Turbo Equalization with Coarse Quantization using the Information Bottleneck Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a turbo equalizer for intersymbol interference channels (ISI) that uses coarsely quantized messages across all receiver components. Lookup tables (LUTs) carry out compression operations designed with the information bottleneck method aiming to maximize relevant mutual information. The turbo setup consists of an equalizer and a decoder that provide extrinsic information to each other over multiple turbo iterations. We develop simplified LUT structures to incorporate the decoder feedback in the equalizer with significantly reduced complexity. The proposed receiver is optimized for selected ISI channels. A conceptual hardware implementation is developed to compare the area efficiency and error correction performance. A thorough analysis reveals that LUT-based configurations with very coarse quantization can achieve higher area efficiency than conventional equalizers. Moreover, the proposed turbo setups can outperform the respective non-turbo setups regarding area efficiency and error correction capability.</description>

      <title>Towards Definition of Higher Order Causality in Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The description of the dynamics of complex systems, in particular the capture of the interaction structure and causal relationships between elements of the system, is one of the central questions of interdisciplinary research. While the characterization of pairwise causal interactions is a relatively ripe field with established theoretical concepts and the current focus is on technical issues of their efficient estimation, it turns out that the standard concepts such as Granger causality or transfer entropy may not faithfully reflect possible synergies or interactions of higher orders, phenomena highly relevant for many real-world complex systems. In this paper, we propose a generalization and refinement of the information-theoretic approach to causal inference, enabling the description of truly multivariate, rather than multiple pairwise, causal interactions, and moving thus from causal networks to causal hypernetworks. In particular, while keeping the ability to control for mediating variables or common causes, in case of purely synergetic interactions such as the exclusive disjunction, it ascribes the causal role to the multivariate causal set but \emph{not} to individual inputs, distinguishing it thus from the case of e.g. two additive univariate causes. We demonstrate this concept by application to illustrative theoretical examples as well as a biophysically realistic simulation of biological neuronal dynamics recently reported to employ synergetic computations.</description>

      <title>Scientific and technological knowledge grows linearly over time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The past few centuries have witnessed a dramatic growth in scientific and technological knowledge. However, the nature of that growth - whether exponential or otherwise - remains controversial, perhaps partly due to the lack of quantitative characterizations. We evaluated knowledge as a collective thinking structure, using citation networks as a representation, by examining extensive datasets that include 213 million publications (1800-2020) and 7.6 million patents (1976-2020). We found that knowledge - which we conceptualize as the reduction of uncertainty in a knowledge network - grew linearly over time in naturally formed citation networks that themselves expanded exponentially. Moreover, our results revealed inflection points in the growth of knowledge that often corresponded to important developments within fields, such as major breakthroughs, new paradigms, or the emergence of entirely new areas of study. Around these inflection points, knowledge may grow rapidly or exponentially on a local scale, although the overall growth rate remains linear when viewed globally. Previous studies concluding an exponential growth of knowledge may have focused primarily on these local bursts of rapid growth around key developments, leading to the misconception of a global exponential trend. Our findings help to reconcile the discrepancy between the perceived exponential growth and the actual linear growth of knowledge by highlighting the distinction between local and global growth patterns. Overall, our findings reveal major science development trends for policymaking, showing that producing knowledge is far more challenging than producing papers.</description>

      <title>Foundation of Calculating Normalized Maximum Likelihood for Continuous Probability Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The normalized maximum likelihood (NML) code length is widely used as a model selection criterion based on the minimum description length principle, where the model with the shortest NML code length is selected. A common method to calculate the NML code length is to use the sum (for a discrete model) or integral (for a continuous model) of a function defined by the distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator. While this method has been proven to correctly calculate the NML code length of discrete models, no proof has been provided for continuous cases. Consequently, it has remained unclear whether the method can accurately calculate the NML code length of continuous models. In this paper, we solve this problem affirmatively, proving that the method is also correct for continuous cases. Remarkably, completing the proof for continuous cases is non-trivial in that it cannot be achieved by merely replacing the sums in discrete cases with integrals, as the decomposition trick applied to sums in the discrete model case proof is not applicable to integrals in the continuous model case proof. To overcome this, we introduce a novel decomposition approach based on the coarea formula from geometric measure theory, which is essential to establishing our proof for continuous cases.</description>

      <title>Inter Observer Variability Assessment through Ordered Weighted Belief Divergence Measure in MAGDM Application to the Ensemble Classifier Feature Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A large number of multi-attribute group decisionmaking (MAGDM) have been widely introduced to obtain consensus results. However, most of the methodologies ignore the conflict among the experts opinions and only consider equal or variable priorities of them. Therefore, this study aims to propose an Evidential MAGDM method by assessing the inter-observational variability and handling uncertainty that emerges between the experts. The proposed framework has fourfold contributions. First, the basic probability assignment (BPA) generation method is introduced to consider the inherent characteristics of each alternative by computing the degree of belief. Second, the ordered weighted belief and plausibility measure is constructed to capture the overall intrinsic information of the alternative by assessing the inter-observational variability and addressing the conflicts emerging between the group of experts. An ordered weighted belief divergence measure is constructed to acquire the weighted support for each group of experts to obtain the final preference relationship. Finally, we have shown an illustrative example of the proposed Evidential MAGDM framework. Further, we have analyzed the interpretation of Evidential MAGDM in the real-world application for ensemble classifier feature fusion to diagnose retinal disorders using optical coherence tomography images.</description>

      <title>Entropy, cocycles, and their diagrammatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first part of the paper explains how to encode a one-cocycle and a two-cocycle on a group $G$ with values in its representation by networks of planar trivalent graphs with edges labelled by elements of $G$, elements of the representation floating in the regions, and suitable rules for manipulation of these diagrams. When the group is a semidirect product, there is a similar presentation via overlapping networks for the two subgroups involved.
  M. Kontsevich and J.-L. Cathelineau have shown how to interpret the entropy of a finite random variable and infinitesimal dilogarithms, including their four-term functional relations, via 2-cocycles on the group of affine symmetries of a line.
  We convert their construction into a diagrammatical calculus evaluating planar networks that describe morphisms in suitable monoidal categories. In particular, the four-term relations become equalities of networks analogous to associativity equations. The resulting monoidal categories complement existing categorical and operadic approaches to entropy.</description>

      <title>Pilot-Aided Simultaneous Communication And Localisation (PASCAL) Under Practical Imperfections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a system model called pilot-aided simultaneous communication and localisation (PASCAL) and illustrates its performance in the presence of practical gain and phase imperfections. Specifically, we consider the scenario where multiple single-antenna unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) transmit data packets to a multi-antenna base station (BS) that has the dual responsibility of detecting communication signals and localising UAVs using their pilot symbols. Two forms of receiver signal processing approaches are adopted, including disjoint localisation and communication by using maximum likelihood estimation and multiple signal classification (MUSIC), as well as joint localisation and data detection achieved by the newly proposed algorithms. To evaluate the asymptotic localisation performance in the presence of gain-phase imperfections, the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived, while for evaluating the communication's performance, the average sum data rate (SDR) for all the UAVs is derived in closed-form. It is shown that these derived expressions concur with simulations. The results reveal that while the proposed PASCAL system can be sensitive to gain-phase imperfections, it remains to be a powerful and efficient means to achieve reliable simultaneous localisation and communications.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient STAR-RIS Enhanced UAV-Enabled MEC Networks with Bi-Directional Task Offloading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05725v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel multi-user mobile edge computing (MEC) scheme facilitated by the simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) and the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Unlike existing MEC approaches, the proposed scheme enables bidirectional offloading, allowing users to concurrently offload tasks to the MEC servers located at the ground base station (BS) and UAV with STAR-RIS support. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem aiming at maximizing the energy efficiency of the system while ensuring the quality of service (QoS) constraints by jointly optimizing the resource allocation, user scheduling, passive beamforming of the STAR-RIS, and the UAV trajectory. A block coordinate descent (BCD) iterative algorithm designed with the Dinkelbach's algorithm and the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique is proposed to effectively handle the formulated non-convex optimization problem with significant coupling among variables. Simulation results indicate that the proposed STAR-RIS enhanced UAV-enabled MEC scheme possesses significant advantages in enhancing the system energy efficiency over other baseline schemes including the conventional RIS-aided scheme.</description>

Abstract: Efficient implementation of massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) transceivers is essential for the next-generation wireless networks. To reduce the high computational complexity of the massive MIMO transceiver, in this paper, we propose a new massive MIMO architecture using finite-precision arithmetic. First, we conduct the rounding error analysis and derive the lower bound of the achievable rate for single-input-multiple-output (SIMO) using maximal ratio combining (MRC) and multiple-input-single-output (MISO) systems using maximal ratio transmission (MRT) with finite-precision arithmetic. Then, considering the multi-user scenario, the rounding error analysis of zero-forcing (ZF) detection and precoding is derived by using the normal equations (NE) method. The corresponding lower bounds of the achievable sum rate are also derived and asymptotic analyses are presented. Built upon insights from these analyses and lower bounds, we propose a mixed-precision architecture for massive MIMO systems to offset performance gaps due to finite-precision arithmetic. The corresponding analysis of rounding errors and computational costs is obtained. Simulation results validate the derived bounds and underscore the superiority of the proposed mixed-precision architecture to the conventional structure.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transmit Signal Design for Multi-Target MIMO Sensing Exploiting Prior Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the transmit signal optimization in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar system for sensing the angle information of multiple targets via their reflected echo signals. We consider a challenging and practical scenario where the angles to be sensed are unknown and random, while their probability information is known a priori for exploitation. First, we establish an analytical framework to quantify the multi-target sensing performance exploiting prior distribution information, by deriving the posterior Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (PCRB) as a lower bound of the mean-squared error (MSE) matrix in sensing multiple unknown and random angles. Then, we formulate and study the transmit sample covariance matrix optimization problem to minimize the PCRB for the sum MSE in estimating all angles. Moreover, we propose a sum-of-ratios iterative algorithm which can obtain the optimal solution to the PCRB-minimization problem with low complexity. Numerical results validate our results and the superiority of our proposed design over benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Joint Energy and SINR Coverage Probability in UAV Corridor-assisted RF-powered IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07333v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter studies the joint energy and signal-to-interference-plus-noise (SINR)-based coverage probability in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted radio frequency (RF)-powered Internet of Things (IoT) networks. The UAVs are spatially distributed in an aerial corridor that is modeled as a one-dimensional (1D) binomial point process (BPP). By accurately capturing the line-of-sight (LoS) probability of a UAV through large-scale fading: i) an exact form expression for the energy coverage probability is derived, and ii) a tight approximation for the overall coverage performance is obtained. Among several key findings, numerical results reveal the optimal number of deployed UAV-BSs that maximizes the joint coverage probability, as well as the optimal length of the UAV corridors when designing such UAV-assisted IoT networks.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Design for Quickest Change Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14109</link>

Abstract: The field of quickest change detection (QCD) concerns design and analysis of algorithms to estimate in real time the time at which an important event takes place, and identify properties of the post-change behavior. It is shown in this paper that approaches based on reinforcement learning (RL) can be adapted based on any "surrogate information state" that is adapted to the observations. Hence we are left to choose both the surrogate information state process and the algorithm. For the former, it is argued that there are many choices available, based on a rich theory of asymptotic statistics for QCD. Two approaches to RL design are considered: (i) Stochastic gradient descent based on an actor-critic formulation. Theory is largely complete for this approach: the algorithm is unbiased, and will converge to a local minimum. However, it is shown that variance of stochastic gradients can be very large, necessitating the need for commensurately long run times; (ii) Q-learning algorithms based on a version of the projected Bellman equation. It is shown that the algorithm is stable, in the sense of bounded sample paths, and that a solution to the projected Bellman equation exists under mild conditions. Numerical experiments illustrate these findings, and provide a roadmap for algorithm design in more general settings.</description>

      <title>Quantum-secure multiparty deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Secure multiparty computation enables the joint evaluation of multivariate functions across distributed users while ensuring the privacy of their local inputs. This field has become increasingly urgent due to the exploding demand for computationally intensive deep learning inference. These computations are typically offloaded to cloud computing servers, leading to vulnerabilities that can compromise the security of the clients' data. To solve this problem, we introduce a linear algebra engine that leverages the quantum nature of light for information-theoretically secure multiparty computation using only conventional telecommunication components. We apply this linear algebra engine to deep learning and derive rigorous upper bounds on the information leakage of both the deep neural network weights and the client's data via the Holevo and the Cram\'er-Rao bounds, respectively. Applied to the MNIST classification task, we obtain test accuracies exceeding $96\%$ while leaking less than $0.1$ bits per weight symbol and $0.01$ bits per data symbol. This weight leakage is an order of magnitude below the minimum bit precision required for accurate deep learning using state-of-the-art quantization techniques. Our work lays the foundation for practical quantum-secure computation and unlocks secure cloud deep learning as a field.</description>
