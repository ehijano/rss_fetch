      <title>Real Time Magnetic Field Line Tracing In The Magnetosphere Via Adaptive Error Bounded Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Field line tracing is one of the fundamental computational tools used in the study of the magnetosphere, which helps in many areas including footprint mapping, connectivity analysis and real-time visualisation. This note describes an implementation approach to error-bounded adaptive integration of the field line differential equation (ODE), where an embedded Runge-Kutta pair is used in conjunction with event detection, allowing robust localisation of footprint locations on spacecraft. The method is validated against an analytic dipole field model as well as an international geomagnetic reference field (IGRF)-based geomagnetic configuration.</description>

      <title>Linear and nonlinear stability of rate-and-state faults</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models of faults incorporating slip rate- and state-dependent friction have reproduced phenomena from spontaneous slow, aseismic slip to earthquake-generating dynamic rupture. Exhaustive explorations of model parameter space regularly show sudden transitions in behavior. However these boundaries are poorly constrained analytically, with commonly used scalings derived assuming conditions that do not resemble those of the models. In this work, we demonstrate that an analysis of linear stability can reflect model conditions. We examine two scenarios that move beyond the classical case of the uniform sliding of an unbounded fault: an asperity driven by the steady creep of its surroundings, and a finite fault experiencing a constant rate of shear loading. We identify the critical fault dimension $L_c$ at which point linear stability is lost. Beyond this linear regime, the non-linear nature of friction law implies the loss of memory of loading conditions as instability progresses and the existence of universal solutions describing this process. We refine prior analyses of this non-linear instability and find the minimum fault size that can support self-sustaining, unstable acceleration towards dynamic rupture. We examine the role of the state evolution law and delineate conditions under which faults may be linearly stable but non-linearly unstable, requiring finitely large perturbations to trigger instability. On the basis of numerical solutions, approximate but accurate algebraic expressions for the transition boundaries are presented. These results provide a means for careful model design and to easily delimit plausible regions of parameter space when considering physical observations.</description>

      <title>Source quantification by mobile gamma-ray spectrometry systems: A Bayesian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately quantifying gamma-ray sources from mobile gamma-ray spectrometry surveys has remained a fundamentally elusive, long-standing inverse problem at the interface of nuclear and computational physics. Here, we present a full-spectrum Bayesian inference framework that resolves this inverse problem by combining high-fidelity, platform-dynamic Monte Carlo template generation with Bayesian inversion. Applying this methodology to airborne measurements benchmarked against laboratory and in-situ ground truths, we demonstrate accurate and robust quantification of both natural and anthropogenic radionuclides under field conditions. By improving activity estimates by an order of magnitude, providing principled uncertainty quantification, and rigorously accounting for overdispersion, this framework opens the way to a more statistically rigorous and physics-informed era of mobile gamma-ray spectrometry, unlocking enhanced inference capabilities in emergency response, environmental monitoring, nuclear security, and planetary exploration.</description>

      <title>Controllable Probabilistic Forecasting with Stochastic Decomposition Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI weather prediction ensembles with latent noise injection and optimized with the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) have produced both accurate and well-calibrated predictions with far less computational cost compared with diffusion-based methods. However, current CRPS ensemble approaches vary in their training strategies and noise injection mechanisms, with most injecting noise globally throughout the network via conditional normalization. This structure increases training expense and limits the physical interpretability of the stochastic perturbations. We introduce Stochastic Decomposition Layers (SDL) for converting deterministic machine learning weather models into probabilistic ensemble systems. Adapted from StyleGAN's hierarchical noise injection, SDL applies learned perturbations at three decoder scales through latent-driven modulation, per-pixel noise, and channel scaling. When applied to WXFormer via transfer learning, SDL requires less than 2\% of the computational cost needed to train the baseline model. Each ensemble member is generated from a compact latent tensor (5 MB), enabling perfect reproducibility and post-inference spread adjustment through latent rescaling. Evaluation on 2022 ERA5 reanalysis shows ensembles with spread-skill ratios approaching unity and rank histograms that progressively flatten toward uniformity through medium-range forecasts, achieving calibration competitive with operational IFS-ENS. Multi-scale experiments reveal hierarchical uncertainty: coarse layers modulate synoptic patterns while fine layers control mesoscale variability. The explicit latent parameterization provides interpretable uncertainty quantification for operational forecasting and climate applications.</description>

      <title>Monitoring of water volume in a porous reservoir using seismic data: Validation of a numerical model with a field experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14605v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As global groundwater levels continue to decline rapidly, there is a growing need for advanced techniques to monitor and manage aquifers effectively. This study focuses on validating a numerical model using seismic data from a small-scale experimental setup designed to estimate water volume in a porous reservoir. Expanding on previous work with synthetic data, we analyze seismic data acquired from a controlled experimental site in Laukaa, Finland. By employing neural networks, we directly estimate water volume from seismic responses, bypassing the traditional need for separate determinations, for example, of reservoir water-table level and porosity. The study models wave propagation through a coupled poroviscoelastic-viscoelastic medium using a three-dimensional discontinuous Galerkin method. The proposed methodology is validated against experimental data, aiming to improve precision in mapping current water volumes and contributing to the development of sustainable groundwater management practices.</description>

      <title>Full-spectrum modeling of mobile gamma-ray spectrometry systems in scattering media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mobile gamma-ray spectrometry (MGRS) systems are essential for localizing, identifying, and quantifying gamma-ray sources in complex environments. Full-spectrum template matching offers the highest accuracy and sensitivity for these tasks but is limited by the computational cost of generating the required spectral templates. Here, we present a generalized full-spectrum modeling framework for MGRS systems in scattering media, enabling near-real-time template generation through dynamic, anisotropic instrument response functions. Benchmarked against high-fidelity brute-force Monte Carlo simulations, our method yields a computational speedup by a factor of $\mathcal{O}(10^7)$, while achieving comparable accuracy with median spectral deviations below 6%. The methodology presented is platform-agnostic and applicable across marine, terrestrial, and airborne domains, unlocking new capabilities for MGRS in a variety of applications, such as environmental monitoring, geophysical exploration, nuclear safeguards, and radiological emergency response.</description>
