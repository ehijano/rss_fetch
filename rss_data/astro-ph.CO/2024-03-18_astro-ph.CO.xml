      <title>First evidence of a connection between cluster-scale diffuse radio emission in cool-core galaxy clusters and sloshing features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio observations of a few cool-core galaxy clusters have revealed the presence of diffuse emission on cluster scales, similar to what was found in merging clusters in the form of radio halos. These sources might suggest that a minor merger, while not sufficiently energetic to disrupt the cool core, could still trigger particle acceleration in the intracluster medium on scales of hundreds of kpc. We observed with LOFAR at 144 MHz a sample of twelve cool-core galaxy clusters presenting some level of dynamical disturbances, according to X-ray data. We also performed a systematic search of cold fronts in these clusters, re-analysing archival Chandra data. The clusters PSZ1G139.61+24, A1068 (new detection), MS 1455.0+2232, and RX J1720.1+2638 present diffuse radio emission on a cluster scale. This emission is characterised by a double component: a central mini-halo confined by cold fronts and diffuse emission on larger scales, whose radio power at 144 MHz is comparable to that of radio halos detected in merging systems. The cold fronts in A1068 are a new detection. We also found a candidate plasma depletion layer in this cluster. No sloshing features are found in the other eight clusters. Two of them present a mini-halo, with diffuse radio emission confined to the cluster core. We also found a new candidate mini-halo. Whereas, for the remaining five clusters, we did not detect halo-like emission. For clusters without cluster-scale halos, we derived upper limits to the radio halo power. We found that cluster-scale diffuse radio emission is not present in all cool-core clusters when observed at a low frequency, but it is correlated to the presence of cold fronts. This morphology requires a specific configuration of the merger and so it puts some constraints on the turbulence, which deserves to be investigated in the future with theoretical works.</description>

      <title>Sensitive 3mm Imaging of Discrete Sources in the Fields of tSZ-Selected Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present the results of a blind survey for compact sources in 243 Galaxy clusters that were identified using the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (tSZ). The survey was carried out at 90 GHz using MUSTANG2 on the Green Bank telescope and achieved a $5\sigma$ detection limit of 1 mJy in the center of each cluster. We detected 24 discrete sources. The majority (18) of these correspond to known radio sources, and of these, 5 show signs of significant variability, either with time or in spectral index. The remaining sources have no clear counterparts at other wavelengths. Searches for galaxy clusters via the tSZ effect strongly rely on observations at 90 GHz, and the sources found have the potential to bias mass estimates of clusters. We compare our results to the simulation Websky that can be used to estimate the source contamination in galaxy cluster catalogs. While the simulation showed a good match to our observations at the clusters' centers, it does not match our source distribution further out. Sources over 104" from a cluster's center bias the tSZ signal high, for some of our sources, by over 50%. When averaged over the whole cluster population the effect is smaller but still at a level of 1 to 2%. We also discovered that unlike previous measurements and simulations we see an enhancement of source counts in the outer regions of the clusters and fewer sources than expected in the centers of this tSZ selected sample.</description>

      <title>Consistent extinction model for type Ia supernovae in Cepheid-based calibration galaxies and its impact on $H_{0}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most recent SH0ES measurement of the Hubble constant, based on type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon+ compilation, employs corrections of supernova peak magnitudes which effectively accounts for extinction in the supernova host galaxies. These corrections are estimated using a probabilistic model which is trained on Hubble flow (z&gt;0.03) supernovae and extrapolated to the calibration galaxies (those with observed Cepheid distances). By comparing the corrected peak magnitudes to distance moduli from Cepheids, we show that this standard approach underestimates the brightness of reddened supernovae in the high stellar-mass ($M_{\star}&gt;10^{10}M_{\odot}$) calibration galaxies. This can be traced back to the fact that for these galaxies, a low total-to-selective extinction coefficient (R_B~3) is assumed, while for the low stellar-mass analogues a more standard R_B~4 is assumed. We propose a minimalistic modification of the Pantheon+ extinction model in order to alleviate this systematic effect. The modification is twofold and it involves: (i) the same, Milky Way-like distribution of R_B in all calibration galaxies (with mean R_B of 4.3 -- consistent with the extinction curve used for colour corrections of the Cepheids -- and scatter 0.4) and (ii) a modified shape of the E(B-V) reddening distribution while keeping the same effective slope of the supernova peak magnitude-colour relation and the same mean E(B-V) reddening as measured for supernovae in the Hubble flow. We show that this new approach yields a significantly better fit ($\Delta$BIC=-11) to the calibration data and results in a lower value of the derived Hubble constant through a stronger extinction correction of supernovae in the calibration galaxies. Our result is $H_{0}=70.5\pm1$ km/s/Mpc implying a reduction of the tension with the Planck $H_{0}$ measurement assuming a flat LCDM cosmology from $5.2\sigma$ to $2.8\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Does the Correlation between 2MRS Galaxies and the CMB Indicate an Unmodeled CMB Foreground?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the claimed detection of a new cosmic microwave background (CMB) foreground based on the correlation between low-redshift 2MASS Redshift Survey (2MRS) galaxies and CMB temperature maps from the Planck and WMAP missions. We reproduce the reported measurements but argue that the original analysis significantly underestimated the uncertainties. We cross-correlate the 2MRS galaxy positions with simulated CMB maps and show that the correlation measured with the real data for late-type spiral galaxies at angular scales $\theta\geq0.1^{\circ}$ and redshift $cz&lt;4500$ km s$^{-1}$ is consistent with zero at the $1.7\sigma$ level or less, depending on the exact CMB map and simulation construction. This was the sample that formed the basis for the original detection claim. For smaller angular separations the results are not robust to galaxy type or CMB cleaning method, and we are unable to draw firm conclusions. The original analysis did not propose a specific, falsifiable physical correlation mechanism, and it is impossible to rule out any contribution from an underlying physical effect. However, given our calculations, the lack of signal from expanding the redshift range, and the lack of corroboration from other galaxy surveys, we do not find the evidence for a new CMB foreground signal compelling.</description>

      <title>Classically and Quantum Stable Emergent Universe in a Jordan-Brans-Dicke Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.09524v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of Emergent Universe models is based on the assumption that the universe emerged from a past eternal Einstein Static (ES) state towards an inflationary phase and then evolves into a hot big bang era. These models are appealing since they provide specific examples of nonsingular (geodesically complete) inflationary universes. However, it has been pointed out by Mithani-Vilenkin that certain Emergent Universe scenarios which have a classically stable ES state could experience a semiclassical instability and collapse. In this paper, we investigate the classical and quantum stability of the ES regime of Emergent Universes within the framework of Jordan-Brans-Dicke theory. We demonstrate that when considering these models, it is possible to have both, classical and semiclassical stability of the ES state without addressing the instability highlighted by Mithani-Vilenkin.</description>

      <title>Stochastic gravitational wave background generated by domain wall networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study the power spectrum of the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background produced by standard and biased domain wall networks, using the Velocity-dependent One-Scale model to compute the cosmological evolution of their characteristic scale and root-mean-squared velocity. We consider a standard radiation + $\Lambda \rm CDM$ background and assume that a constant fraction of the energy of collapsing domain walls is emitted in the form of gravitational waves. We show that, in an expanding background, the total energy density in gravitational radiation decreases with cosmic time (after a short initial period of quick growth). We also propose a two parameter model for the scale-dependence of the frequency distribution of the gravitational waves emitted by collapsing domain walls. We determine the corresponding power spectrum of the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background generated by domain walls, showing that it is a monotonic decreasing function of the frequency for frequencies larger than that of the peak generated by the walls that have decayed most recently. We also develop an analytical approximation to this spectrum, assuming perfect linear scaling during both the radiation and matter eras, in order to characterize the dependence of the amplitude, peak frequency and slope of the power spectrum on the model parameters.</description>

      <title>Galactic disc heating by density granulation in fuzzy dark matter simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fuzzy dark matter (FDM), an attractive dark matter candidate comprising ultralight bosons (axions) with a particle mass $m_a\sim10^{-22}$ eV, is motivated by the small-scale challenges of cold dark matter and features a kpc-size de Broglie wavelength. Quantum wave interference inside an FDM halo gives rise to stochastically fluctuating density granulation; the resulting gravitational perturbations could drive significant disc thickening, providing a natural explanation for galactic thick discs. Here we present the first self-consistent simulations of FDM haloes and stellar discs, exploring $m_a=0.2-1.2\times10^{-22}$ eV and halo masses $M_\text{h} = 0.7-2.8\times10^{11}$ M$_\odot$. Disc thickening is observed in all simulated systems. The disc heating rates are approximately constant in time and increase substantially with decreasing $m_a$, reaching $dh/dt \simeq 0.04$ ($0.4$) kpc Gyr$^{-1}$ and $d\sigma_z^2/dt \simeq4$ ($150$) km$^2$s$^{-2}$Gyr$^{-1}$ for $m_a=1.2$ ($0.2$) $\times10^{-22}$ eV and $M_\text{h} =7\times10^{10} \text{M}_\odot$, where $h$ is the disc scale height and $\sigma_z$ is the vertical velocity dispersion. These simulated heating rates agree within a factor of two with the theoretical estimates of Chiang et al., confirming that the rough estimate of Church et al. overpredicts the granulation-driven disc heating rate by two orders of magnitude. However, the simulation-inferred heating rates scale less steeply than the theoretically predicted relation $d\sigma^2_z/dt \propto m_a^{-3}$. Finally, we examine the applicability of the Fokker-Planck approximation in FDM granulation modelling and the robustness of the $m_a$ exclusion bound derived from the Galactic disc kinematics.</description>

      <title>Probing Weyl-type $f(Q, T)$ gravity: Cosmological implications and constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the cosmological implications and constraints of Weyl-type $f(Q, T)$ gravity. This theory introduces a coupling between the non-metricity $Q$ and the trace $T$ of the energy-momentum tensor, using the principles of proper Weyl geometry. In this geometry, the scalar non-metricity $Q$, which characterizes the deviations from Riemannian geometry, is expressed in its standard Weyl form $\nabla _{\mu }g_{\alpha \beta }=-w_{\mu }g_{\alpha \beta }$ and is determined by a vector field $w_{\mu }$. To study the implications of this theory, we propose a deceleration parameter with a single unknown parameter $\chi$, which we constrain by using the latest cosmological data. By solving the field equations derived from Weyl-type $f(Q, T)$ gravity, we aim to understand the behavior of the energy conditions within this framework. In the present work, we consider two well-motivated forms of the function $f(Q, T)$: (i) the linear model represented by $f(Q, T) = \alpha Q + \frac{\beta}{6\kappa^2} T$, and (ii) the coupling model represented by $f(Q, T) = \frac{\gamma}{6H_0^2 \kappa^2} QT$, where $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ are free parameters. Here, $\kappa^2 = \frac{1}{16\pi G}$ represents the gravitational coupling constant. In both of the models considered, the strong energy condition is violated, indicating consistency with the present accelerated expansion. However, the null, weak, and dominant energy conditions are satisfied in these models.</description>

      <title>Angular and radial stabilities of spontaneously scalarized black holes in the presence of scalar-Gauss-Bonnet couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the linear stability of spontaneously scalarized black holes (BHs) induced by a scalar field $\phi$ coupled to a Gauss-Bonnet (GB) invariant $R_{\rm GB}^2$. For the scalar-GB coupling $\xi(\phi)=(\eta/8) (\phi^2+\alpha \phi^4)$, where $\eta$ and $\alpha$ are constants, we first show that there are no angular Laplacian instabilities of even-parity perturbations far away from the horizon for large multipoles $l \gg 1$. The deviation of angular propagation speeds from the speed of light is largest on the horizon, whose property can be used to put constraints on the model parameters. For $\alpha \gtrsim -1$, the region in which the scalarized BH is subject to angular Laplacian instabilities can emerge. Provided that $\alpha \lesssim -1$ and $-1/2&lt;\alpha \phi_0^2&lt;-0.1155$, where $\phi_0$ is the field value on the horizon with a unit of the reduced Planck mass $M_{\rm Pl}=1$, there are scalarized BH solutions satisfying all the linear stability conditions throughout the horizon exterior. We also study the stability of spontaneously scalarized BHs in scalar-GB theories with a nonminimal coupling $-\beta \phi^2 R/16$, where $\beta$ is a positive constant and $R$ is a Ricci scalar. As the amplitude of the field on the horizon approaches an upper limit $|\phi_0|=4/\sqrt{\beta}$, one of the squared angular propagation speeds $c_{\Omega-}^2$ enters the instability region $c_{\Omega-}^2&lt;0$. So long as $|\phi_0|$ is smaller than a maximum value determined for each $\beta$ in the range $\beta&gt;5$, however, the scalarized BHs are linearly stable in both angular and radial directions.</description>

      <title>Is Abell 3667 an offset merger?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abell 3667 is a near-by (z=0.056) merging cluster with the most prominent cold front and a pair of two bright radio relics. Assuming a face-to-face merger scenario, the origin of the cold front is often considered to be a remnant core of the cluster stripped of its surrounding ICM. Sarazin et al. (2016) proposed an offset merger scenario in which the sub-cluster cores rotate after the first core-crossing. To distinguish between these scenarios, we revisited the ICM distribution and measured the line-of-sight bulk ICM velocity using a calibration technique proposed by Sanders et al. (2020). In the unsharp masked image, we identified several ICM features, some of which we detected for the first time. There is an enhancement of the X-ray surface brightness extending from the 1st BCG to the cold front, which is named the "BCG-E tail". The notable feature is the "RG1 vortex", which is a clockwise vortex-like enhancement with a radius of about 250 kpc connecting the 1st BCG to the radio galaxy (RG1). It is particularly enhanced near the north of the 1st BCG, which is named the "BCG-N tail". The thermodynamic map shows that the ICM in the RG1 vortex has a relatively high abundance of 0.5-0.6 solar compared to the surrounding regions. The ICM of the BCG-E tail also has high abundance, and low pseudo-entropy, and can be interpreted as the remnant of the ICM of the cluster core. Including its arc-like shape, the RG1 vortex supports the idea that the ICM around the cluster center is rotating, which is natural in an offset merger scenario. The results of the line-of-sight bulk ICM velocity measurement show that the ICM around the BCG-N tail is redshifted with a velocity difference of 940$\pm$440 km s$^{-1}$ compared to the optical redshift of the 1st BCG. Other symptoms of diversity in the line-of-sight velocity of the ICM were also obtained and discussed in the context of the offset merger.</description>

      <title>Spatial Dependence of the Growth Factor in Scalar-Tensor Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalar-tensor theories have taken on a key role in attempts to confront the growing open questions in standard cosmology. It is important to understand entirely their dynamics at perturbative level including any possible spatial dependence in their growth of large scale structures. In this work, we investigate the spatial dependence of the growth rate of scalar-tensor theories through the M\'{e}sz\'{a}ros equation. We confirm that at subhorizon level this dependence does not play a major role for viable models. However, we establish conditions on which this criterion is met which may be important for developing new models. In our work, we consider three specific models that exhibit spatial dependence of the growth rate at superhorizon modes, which may also be important for early Universe models.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, non perfect fluid, tilted source solutions in both Einstein-Hilbert General Relativity (GR) and Quadratic Gravity (QG) for the anisotropic Bianchi V model are addressed. Since the excellent CMBR match of Starobinsky's inflation with Planck's team measurements data, QG has acquired a prominent status in the effective sense, for sufficiently strong gravity fields. The main interest is in the numeric time evolution to the past towards the singularity and the behavior of the kinematic variables, vorticity, acceleration, and the expansion of this source substance. In QG we found that for universes with higher and smaller matter densities fall into the Kasner or isotropic singularity attractors to the past, respectively. We also found that the Kasner singularity attractor to the past has always zero vorticity, for both GR and QG theories. While for QG the isotropic singularity attractor may have divergent vorticity. For the set of assumptions and conditions supposed in this work, the isotropic singularity attractor, favors QG as compared to GR. Only in QG we were able to find a geometric singularity with divergences in all of the kinematic variables of the substance, decreasing to finite values to the future, upon time reversing. That is, we obtained an initial kinematic singularity substance, that approaches a perfect fluid source.</description>

Abstract: We study the conformal invariance of inflationary non-Gaussianities associated with scalar fluctuations in a non-Bunch-Davies initial state, known as the $\alpha$-vacuum, in single-field slow-roll inflation. The $\alpha$-vacuum is a one-parameter family of states, including the Bunch-Davies one, that preserves the conformal symmetry of inflationary dynamics in a nearly de-Sitter space-time. Working within the leading slow-roll approximation, we compute the four-point scalar correlator (the trispectrum) in $\alpha$-vacuum using the in-in formalism. We check that the conformal Ward identities are met between the three and four-point scalar $\alpha$-vacua correlators. Surprisingly, this contrasts the previously reported negative result of the Ward identities being violated between the two and the three-point correlators. We have also extended the wave-functional method, previously used for correlators with Bunch-Davies initial condition, to compute the three and four-point scalar correlators in $\alpha$-vacua. The results obtained from the wave-function method match the corresponding in-in results, adding further justification to our check of Ward identities with $\alpha$-vacua correlators.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised component separation for the extragalactic submillimeter sky</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.02847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use a new approach based on self-supervised deep learning networks originally applied to transparency separation in order to simultaneously extract the components of the extragalactic submillimeter sky, namely the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the cosmic infrared background (CIB), and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. In this proof-of-concept paper, we test our approach on the WebSky extragalactic simulation maps in a range of frequencies from 93 to 545 GHz, and compare with one of the state-of-the-art traditional methods, MILCA, for the case of SZ. We first visually compare the images, and then statistically analyse the full-sky reconstructed high-resolution maps with power spectra. We study the contamination from other components with cross spectra, and particularly emphasise the correlation between the CIB and the SZ effect and compute SZ fluxes around positions of galaxy clusters. The independent networks learn how to reconstruct the different components with less contamination than MILCA. Although this is tested here in an ideal case (without noise, beams, or foregrounds), this method shows significant potential for application in future experiments such as the Simons Observatory (SO) in combination with the Planck satellite.</description>

      <title>Multi-tracer power spectra and bispectra: Formalism</title>

Abstract: The power spectrum and bispectrum of dark matter tracers are key and complementary probes of the Universe. Next-generation surveys will deliver good measurements of the bispectrum, opening the door to improved cosmological constraints and the breaking of parameter degeneracies, from the combination of the power spectrum and bispectrum. Multi-tracer power spectra have been used to suppress cosmic variance and mitigate the effects of nuisance parameters and systematics. We present a bispectrum multi-tracer formalism that can be applied to next-generation survey data. Then we perform a simple Fisher analysis to illustrate qualitatively the improved precision on primordial non-Gaussianity that is expected to come from the bispectrum multi-tracer. In addition, we investigate the parametric dependence of conditional errors from multi-tracer power spectra and multi-tracer bispectra, on the differences between the biases and the number densities of two tracers. Our results suggest that optimal constraints arise from maximising the ratio of number densities, the difference between the linear biases, the difference between the quadratic biases, and the difference between the products $b_1\,b_\Phi$ for each tracer, where $b_\Phi$ is the bias for the primordial potential.</description>

      <title>Constraining primordial non-Gaussianity from DESI quasar targets and Planck CMB lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.07650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We detect the cross-correlation between 2.7 million DESI quasar targets across 14,700 deg$^2$ (180 quasars deg$^{-2}$) and Planck 2018 CMB lensing at $\sim$30$\sigma$. We use the cross-correlation on very large scales to constrain local primordial non-Gaussianity via the scale dependence of quasar bias. The DESI quasar targets lie at an effective redshift of 1.51 and are separated into four imaging regions of varying depth and image quality. We select quasar targets from Legacy Survey DR9 imaging, apply additional flux and photometric redshift cuts to improve the purity and reduce the fraction of unclassified redshifts, and use early DESI spectroscopy of 194,000 quasar targets to determine their redshift distribution and stellar contamination fraction (2.6%). Due to significant excess large-scale power in the quasar autocorrelation, we apply weights to mitigate contamination from imaging systematics such as depth, extinction, and stellar density. We use realistic contaminated mocks to determine the greatest number of systematic modes that we can fit, before we are biased by overfitting and spuriously remove real power. We find that linear regression with one to seven imaging templates removed per region accurately recovers the input cross-power, $f_{\textrm{NL}}$ and linear bias. As in previous analyses, our $f_{\textrm{NL}}$ constraint depends on the linear primordial non-Gaussianity bias parameter, $b_{\phi} = 2(b - p)\delta_c$ assuming universality of the halo mass function. We measure $f_{\textrm{NL}} = -26^{+45}_{-40}$ with $p=1.6$ $(f_{\textrm{NL}} = -18^{+29}_{-27}$ with $p=1.0$), and find that this result is robust under several systematics tests. Future spectroscopic quasar cross-correlations with Planck lensing lensing can tighten the $f_{\textrm{NL}}$ constraints by a factor of 2 if they can remove the excess power on large scales in the quasar auto power spectrum.</description>

      <title>LimberJack.jl: auto-differentiable methods for angular power spectra analyses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08306v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present LimberJack.jl, a fully auto-differentiable code for cosmological analyses of 2 point auto- and cross-correlation measurements from galaxy clustering, CMB lensing and weak lensing data written in Julia. Using Julia's auto-differentiation ecosystem, LimberJack.jl can obtain gradients for its outputs up to an order of magnitude faster than traditional finite difference methods. This makes LimberJack.jl greatly synergistic with gradient-based sampling methods, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, capable of efficiently exploring parameter spaces with hundreds of dimensions. We first prove LimberJack.jl's reliability by reanalysing the DES Y1 3$\times$2-point data. We then showcase its capabilities by using a O(100) parameters Gaussian Process to reconstruct the cosmic growth from a combination of DES Y1 galaxy clustering and weak lensing data, eBOSS QSO's, CMB lensing and redshift-space distortions. Our Gaussian process reconstruction of the growth factor is statistically consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM Planck 2018 prediction at all redshifts. Moreover, we show that the addition of RSD data is extremely beneficial to this type of analysis, reducing the uncertainty in the reconstructed growth factor by $20\%$ on average across redshift. LimberJack.jl is a fully open-source project available on Julia's general repository of packages and GitHub.</description>

      <title>Pulsar timing residual induced by ultralight tensor dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight boson fields, with a mass around $10^{-23}\text{eV}$, are promising candidates for the elusive cosmological dark matter. These fields induce a periodic oscillation of the spacetime metric in the nanohertz frequency band, which is detectable by pulsar timing arrays. In this paper, we investigate the gravitational effect of ultralight tensor dark matter on the arrival time of radio pulses from pulsars. We find that the pulsar timing signal caused by tensor dark matter exhibits a different angular dependence than that by scalar and vector dark matter, making it possible to distinguish the ultralight dark matter signal with different spins. Combining the gravitational effect and the coupling effect of ultralight tensor dark matter with standard model matter provides a complementary way to constrain the coupling parameter $\alpha$. We estimate $\alpha \lesssim 10^{-6}\sim 10^{-5}$ in the mass range $m&lt;5\times 10^{-23}\mathrm{eV}$ with current pulsar timing array.</description>

      <title>WIMP constraints from black hole low-mass X-ray binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The abnormally fast orbital decay observed in the black hole (BH) Low-Mass X-ray binaries (BH-LMXB) A0620-00 and XTE J1118+480 can be explained by the dynamical friction between Dark Matter (DM) and the companion star orbiting around the low-mass BH (of a few $M_\odot$) of the system. In this case the value of the index $\gamma_{\rm sp}$ of the DM spike surrounding the BH can be pinned down with an accuracy of a few percent, way better than that for much bigger systems such as the super massive BHs (SMBHs) in the Galactic Center or in M87. We have used data from XTE J1118+480 to put bounds on the WIMP annihilation cross section times velocity $\langle \sigma v\rangle$, assuming that DM annihilation is driven by the $b\bar{b}$ annihilation channel and that it proceeds in $s$-wave. The bounds are driven by the radio synchrotron signal produced by $e^\pm$ final states propagating in the magnetic field near the BH. For DM masses $m_\chi$ up to the TeV scale XTE J1118+480 allows to constrain $\langle \sigma v\rangle$ well below $\langle\sigma v\rangle_{\rm thermal}$, corresponding to the observed DM relic density in the Universe for a thermal WIMP. On the other hand, for $m_\chi \gtrsim$ 15 GeV, the bounds from the SMBHs in the GC or in M87 do not reach $\langle\sigma v\rangle_{\rm thermal}$ when the very large uncertainties on the corresponding spike indices are taken into account, in spite of potentially producing much larger DM densities compared to XTE J1118+480. Our bounds for XTE J1118+480 have a mild sensitivity on spatial diffusion, but diffusion enhances the sensitivity of the results upon the intensity of the magnetic field. Taken at face value the bound from XTE J1118+480 on $\langle \sigma v\rangle$ is the most constraining compared to all others for $m_\chi\lesssim$ 1 TeV, unless the intensity of the magnetic field is significantly smaller than its equipartition estimation.</description>

      <title>Axion dark matter from inflation-driven quantum phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new mechanism to produce axion dark matter from inflationary fluctuations. Quantum fluctuations during inflation are strengthened by a coupling of the axion kinetic term to the inflaton, which we parametrize as an effective curvature $\kappa$ in the axion equation of motion. A nonvanishing curvature breaks the scale invariance of the axion power spectrum, driving a quantum phase transition with $\kappa$ as the order parameter. The axion power spectrum is proportional to the inverse comoving horizon to the power of $\kappa$. For positive $\kappa$ the spectrum gets a red tilt, leading to an exponential enhancement of the axion abundance as the comoving horizon shrinks during inflation. This enhancement allows sufficient axion production to comprise the entire dark matter relic abundance despite the ultralight mass. Our mechanism predicts a significantly different parameter space from the usual misalignment mechanism. It allows for axion-like particle dark matter with a much lower decay constant and thus a larger coupling to Standard Model particles. Much of the parameter space can be probed by future experiments including haloscopes, nuclear clocks, CASPEr, and CMB-S4. We can also generate heavier QCD axion dark matter than the misalignment mechanism.</description>
