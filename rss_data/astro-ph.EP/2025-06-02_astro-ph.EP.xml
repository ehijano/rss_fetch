      <title>Bridging Unstratified and Stratified Simulations of the Streaming Instability for $\tau_s=0.1$ Grains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The streaming instability (SI), driven by aerodynamic coupling between solids and the gas under a global radial pressure gradient, concentrates solids and facilitates planetesimal formation. Unstratified simulations are commonly used to study the SI, based on the assumption that they approximate conditions near the disk midplane. However, it remains unclear how accurately these unstratified simulations capture the midplane dust-gas dynamics in stratified disks. To address this, we examine the saturated state of the SI in stratified simulations and compare dust-gas dynamics to those in unstratified simulations across various radial pressure gradients. To this end, we consider a dimensionless dust stopping time ($\tau_s$) of 0.1 and perform 2D axisymmetric, stratified simulations. We find that the formation of dust filaments during dust settling exhibits morphological similarities to those in unstratified simulations. In the saturated state, we find that as the pressure gradient increases, the velocity dispersions of the gas and dust, as well as the strength of dust diffusion, increase. Most importantly, at any given pressure gradient, the velocity dispersions and density distributions of the gas and dust in our stratified simulations closely match those in unstratified simulations. While further exploration across the parameter space is needed, our results suggest that, for $\tau_s=0.1$, unstratified simulations represents well the midplane dust--gas dynamics in stratified disks before any strong clumping occurs. Consequently, our results confirm that in the saturated state, the streaming turbulence in stratified simulations behaves similarly to that in unstratified simulations for the parameter values explored here.</description>

      <title>Sodium and Potassium Linewidths as an Atmospheric Escape Diagnostic at Mercury</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial distribution and linewidth of Mercury's sodium and potassium exosphere were observed using a combination of long-slit and high-resolution point spectroscopy. Effective temperatures were estimated from emission line profiles by forward modeling their Doppler broadening. These serve as an energy metric for collisionless gas that is inherently nonthermal. The Na gas at low and mid-latitudes ranges from 1200-1300 K along the noon meridian, in agreement with MESSENGER scale heights, increasing by ~200 K at the poles and terminator. This increase is attributed to the loss of low energy atoms to the surface during photon-driven transport antisunward. An escaping potassium tail was measured for the first time, observed to a distance of 10.4 RM with Na/K ~95 at 5.8 RM. Emission linewidths increase sharply between the dayside and escaping tail, with Na growing from about 1200 to 7500 K, and K from 750 to 8500 K by the time the gas reaches 4.3 RM downtail. Na D line profiles down the exotail also evolve from Gaussian to boxcar in shape. Both characteristics are interpreted as filtering of the nascent velocity distribution function, wherein low energy atoms on gravitationally bound trajectories are removed from the gas population, while high energy escaping atoms are retained. Na linewidths become invariant past 3.5 RM, placing this altitude as the ballistic apex of bound trajectories. In this way, Mercury's emissions prototype a novel technique towards a broader understanding of atmospheric escape, using emission line morphology to probe the transition between bound and escaping gas.</description>

      <title>A tale of dynamical instabilities and giant impacts in the radius valley</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The size distribution of planets with radii between 1 and $4 R_\oplus$ peaks near 1.4 and $2.2R_\oplus$, with a dip around $1.8 R_\oplus$ -- the so-called "radius valley." Recent statistical analyses suggest that planets within this valley ($1.5 &lt; R &lt; 2R_\oplus$) tend to have slightly higher orbital eccentricities than those outside it. The origin of this dynamical signature remains unclear. We revisit the "breaking the chains" formation model and propose that late dynamical instabilities -- occurring after disk dispersal -- may account for the elevated eccentricities observed in the radius valley. Our simulations show that sub-valley planets ($R &lt; 2 R_\oplus$) are generally rocky, while those beyond the valley ($R &gt; 2 R_\oplus$) are typically water-rich. Rocky planets that undergo strong dynamical instabilities and numerous late giant impacts have their orbits excited and their radii increased, ultimately placing them into the radius valley. In contrast, the larger, water-rich planets just beyond the valley experience weaker instabilities and fewer impacts, resulting in lower eccentricities. This contrast leads to a peak in the eccentricity distribution within the valley. The extent to which planets in the radius valley are dynamically excited depends sensitively on the orbital architecture before the orbital instability. Elevated eccentricities among radius valley planets arise primarily in scenarios that form a sufficiently large number of rocky planets within 100 days (typically $\gtrsim 5$) prior to instability, and that also host external perturbers ($P &gt; 100$ days), which further amplify the strength of dynamical instabilities.</description>

      <title>Very-wide-orbit planets from dynamical instabilities during the stellar birth cluster phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gas giant planets have been detected on eccentric orbits several hundreds of astronomical units in size around other stars. It has been proposed that even the Sun hosts a wide-orbit planet of 5-10 Earth masses, often called Planet Nine, which influences the dynamics of distant Trans-Neptunian objects. However, the formation mechanism of such planets remains uncertain. Here we use numerical simulations to show that very wide-orbit planets are a natural byproduct of dynamical instabilities that occur in planetary systems while their host stars are still embedded in natal stellar clusters. A planet is first brought to an eccentric orbit with an apoastron of several hundred au by repeated gravitational scattering by other planets, then perturbations from nearby stellar flybys stabilise the orbit by decoupling the planet from the interaction with the inner system. In our Solar System, the two main events likely conducive to planetary scattering were the growth of Uranus and Neptune, and the giant planets instability. We estimate a 5-10% likelihood of creating a very wide-orbit planet if either happened while the Sun was still in its birth cluster, rising to 40% if both were. In our simulated exoplanetary systems, the trapping efficiency is 1-5\%. Our results imply that planets on wide, eccentric orbits occur at least $10^{-3}$ per star.</description>

      <title>JWST NIRISS Transmission Spectroscopy of the Super-Earth GJ 357b, a Favourable Target for Atmospheric Retention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a JWST NIRISS/SOSS transmission spectrum of the super-Earth GJ 357 b: the first atmospheric observation of this exoplanet. Despite missing the first $\sim$40 % of the transit due to using an out-of-date ephemeris, we still recover a transmission spectrum that does not display any clear signs of atmospheric features. We perform a search for Gaussian-shaped absorption features within the data but find that this analysis yields comparable fits to the observations as a flat line. We compare the transmission spectrum to a grid of atmosphere models and reject, to 3-$\sigma$ confidence, atmospheres with metallicities $\lesssim$100$\times$ solar ($\sim$4 g/mol) with clouds at pressures down to 0.01 bar. We analyse how the retention of a secondary atmosphere on GJ 357 b may be possible due to its higher escape velocity compared to an Earth-sized planet and the exceptional inactivity of its host star relative to other M2.5V stars. The star's XUV luminosity decays below the threshold for rapid atmospheric escape early enough that the volcanic revival of an atmosphere of several bars of CO$_2$ is plausible, though subject to considerable uncertainty. Finally, we model the feasibility of detecting an atmosphere on GJ 357 b with MIRI/LRS, MIRI photometry, and NIRSpec/G395H. We find that, with two eclipses, it would be possible to detect features indicative of an atmosphere or surface. Further to this, with 3-4 transits, it would be possible to detect a 1 bar nitrogen-rich atmosphere with 1000 ppm of CO$_2$.</description>

      <title>The Dynamics of Infall and Accretion Shocks in the Outer Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-spatial-resolution observations of disks around young stars suggest planetary systems begin forming early, during the protostellar phase (&lt; 1 Myr) when stars accrete most of their mass via infall from the surrounding cloud. During this era shocks are expected to be ubiquitous around the gaseous accretion disk due to supersonic infall that strikes the disk. We investigate the role of shocks using a theoretical and modeling framework we call the shock twist-angle Keplerian (STAK) disk, connecting the disk and infalling envelope gas via a shock using general physical principles. Briefly, at the shock, energy is dissipated while angular momentum is conserved, so that the infalling gas must change direction sharply, yielding a bend or twist in the streamlines. The model's pre-shock gas follows free-fall parabolic trajectories, while the post-shock gas is on lower-energy, elliptical orbits.
  We construct synthetic observations and find that the deviations from circular Keplerian orbits are detectable in Doppler-shifted molecular spectral lines using radio interferometers such as ALMA. Specifically, the STAK model leads to line emission intensity and velocity-moment maps that are asymmetric and offset with respect to the disk structure traced by the dust continuum. We examine archival ALMA data for the class 0/I protostar L1527 and find the C$^{18}$O velocity moment map has features resembling the disk plus envelope emission that naturally arise when the two are connected by a shock. Thus, spectral line observations having sub-km/s spectral resolution and angular resolution sufficient to fully resolve the disk can reveal protostars' envelope-disk shocks.</description>

      <title>Can a Dark Inferno Melt Earth's Core?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for dark matter is one of the crucial open problems in both particle physics and cosmology. If dark matter scatters with Standard Model particles, it could accumulate inside the Earth and begin to annihilate, producing heat within the Earth's core. While past work has been done on the effect that this heat would have once it reached the surface, we model the flow of heat through the Earth's core by numerically solving the heat equation to model dark matter's effect on the interior of the planet. We compute how long it takes for the core to come into thermal equilibrium and show that for a wide range of dark matter parameters, a substantial fraction of the inner core would be melted by dark matter annihilation. Our analysis produces new limits on dark matter annihilating in the Earth, points out important new effects that must be considered when studying planetary heating by dark matter, and suggests new dark matter observables that could be searched for in exoplanet populations.</description>

      <title>Minimising the numerical viscosity in Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics simulations of discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulations using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) technique typically include numerical viscosity to model shocks and maintain particle order on the kernel scale. This numerical viscosity is composed of linear and quadratic terms, with coefficients $\alpha_{\rm SPH}$ and $\beta_{\rm SPH}$ respectively. Setting these coefficients too high results in excessive numerical dissipation, whereas setting them too low may lead to unwanted effects such as particle penetration, which also leads to excess dissipation. In this study, we simulate accretion discs using the SPH code {\sc phantom} to investigate the effective disc viscosity arising from numerical viscosity. We model steady-state coplanar and circular discs with different values of $\alpha_{\rm SPH}$ and $\beta_{\rm SPH}$, from which we determine the coefficients that lead to minimum levels of numerical viscosity by maximising the steady-state disc surface density for the same mass input rate. We find that, for planar and circular discs, the default values of the numerical viscosity parameters in the {\sc phantom} code can be too high particularly for the quadratic term. As higher values of the coefficients are required to adequately capture strong shocks in the flow, we suggest that the coefficient of the quadratic term should be time-dependent in a similar manner to the presently used ``switches'' on the linear term. This can be simply achieved by setting $\beta_{\rm SPH}$ to be a constant multiple of $\alpha_{\rm SPH}$ with $\alpha_{\rm SPH}$ determined by an appropriate switch, as previously advocated in the literature.</description>

      <title>Benchmark brown dwarfs -- I. A blue M2 + T5 wide binary and a probable young M4 + [T7 + T8] hierarchical triple</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Benchmark brown dwarfs in wide binary systems are crucial for characterizing substellar objects and calibrating atmospheric and evolutionary models. However, brown dwarf benchmarks with subsolar metallicity, very cool temperatures, or suitability for dynamical mass measurements are rare, limiting our understanding across the full range of mass, age, and metallicity. We present the discovery of two new multiple systems containing T dwarf companions, identified through a targeted search using CatWISE and Gaia databases. L 122-88 AB is a wide binary comprising a mildly metal-poor M2 dwarf and a T5 dwarf, separated by 215.6 arcsec at a distance of 33.106+/-0.014 pc. Atmospheric model fitting to the near infrared spectrum of L 122-88 A suggests a mildly metal-poor composition ([Fe/H] = -0.2). UPM J1040-3551 AB is a candidate hierarchical triple system at 25.283+/-0.013 pc, consisting of an M4 dwarf and a probable unresolved spectral binary of T7 and T8 dwarfs, separated by 65.48 arcsec from the primary. The H-alpha emission detected in UPM J1040-3551 A indicates an age range of 0.3-2.0 Gyr. This age estimate suggests that the T8 component has a mass between 9 and 28 Jupiter masses, potentially classifying it as a planetary-mass object. These systems augment the sample of benchmark brown dwarfs, particularly in the underexplored regime of cool temperature, providing valuable opportunities for refining our understanding of substellar objects.</description>

      <title>Diversity of Cold Worlds: A Near Complete Spectral Energy Distribution for 2MASS J04151954-0935066 using JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the a near complete spectral energy distribution (SED) for an extrasolar world: the T8 brown dwarf 2MASS~J04151954$-$0935066. Spanning from optical to mid-infrared (0.7--20.4 micron) wavelengths, the SED for this substellar atmosphere is constructed from new JWST NIRSpec G395H ($R\sim$2700) and Magellan FIRE echelle ($R\sim$8000) near-infrared spectra, along with MIRI mid-infrared photometry complemented by spectra from Keck I, IRTF, Magellan, AKARI, Spitzer and photometry from various surveys and missions. The NIRSpec G395H spectrum reveals strong molecular absorptions from NH$_{3}$, CH$_{4}$, H$_{2}$S, CO$_{2}$ and H$_{2}$O at approximately 3.00, 3.35, 3.95, 4.25, and 5.00 micron respectively, along with the presence of a CO absorption feature detected mainly at $\sim$ 4.6 micron. We detect no absorption of near-infrared K I doublets in the $R\sim8000$ FIRE spectra. In the mid-infrared IRS spectrum, we tentatively identify a new CO$_{2}$ feature at 14--16 micron. The comprehensive SED allows us to empirically constrain bolometric luminosity, effective temperature, mass and radius. Additionally, we demonstrate that the NIRSpec G395H resolution, the highest allowable by JWST, enables a precise radial velocity measurement of $47.1\pm1.8$ km s$^{-1}$ for the object, in agreement with previous measurements.</description>

Abstract: By obtaining the assumption that planetary dust particles can escape from the gravitational attraction of a planet, we consider the possibility for the dust grains to leave the star's system by means of the radiation pressure. By taking the typical dust parameters into account, we consider their dynamics and show that they can reach the deep cosmos, taking part in panspermia. It has been shown that, during $5$ billion years, the dust grains will reach $10^5$ stellar systems, and by taking the Drake equation into account, it has been shown that the whole galaxy will be full of planetary dust particles.</description>

      <title>Dust-driven vortex cascades originating at water snow regions: A pathway to planetesimal formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of observed planetary systems, including our Solar System, as well as their diversity, is still an open question. Streaming instability (SI) is an important mechanism for the formation of gravitationally bound planetesimals, which can grow to form planetary embryos and eventually planets. Snow lines in a protoplanetary disk can assist this process, as they can form pressure maxima and promote both dust accumulation and growth. Since the sublimation of a volatile is gradual due to opacity changes, a snow line in a protoplanetary disk is in fact a radially extended "snow region" of constant temperature. It has been shown that dust can influence disk viscosity through the adsorption of charged particles, and even a minor perturbation in the gas can trigger the excitation of multiple small-scale Rossby vortices. Here, we investigate the possibility of Rossby vortex excitation and rapid planetesimal formation at temperature substructures associated with the snow regions, using global 2D gas-dust coupled hydrodynamic simulations that include dust feedback and self-gravity. We find that an initial temperature substructure in a protoplanetary disk can seed a rapid cascade of long-lived, self-sustaining Rossby vortices. The vortices accumulate significant amount of dust and the local conditions are favorable for SI as well as gravitational collapse. However, the vortex formation via this mechanism requires sufficient decoupling between dust and gas, and such conditions may not be met early on when the disk is gas-rich, resulting in a delayed onset of vortex formation. The self-sustaining Rossby vortices offer exceptionally favorable conditions for dust growth and the formation of planetesimals, as well as a possible pathway for the rapid formation of planetary cores.</description>

Abstract: Enceladus is among the most intriguing bodies in the solar system due to its astrobiological potential. Determining the extent and duration of sustainable habitability requires characterizing the interior properties, and in particular, the extent and distribution of the tidal heating. The intensity of any inferred geophysical activity in the core has direct implications for understanding the hydrothermal activity and the budget of biologically useful species. We build a statistical framework using an MCMC approach to constrain the interior based on currently available observations of libration, shape, heat budget, and mass. We use this framework to examine the extent that geodetic measurements can constrain the interior structure, with an emphasis on determining the partitioning of tidal dissipation between the shell and the core. We quantify plausible ranges of gravitational and displacement tidal Love numbers consistent with existing observations. We demonstrate that measuring the amplitude and phase of $k_2$ alone can only constrain the total tidally dissipated energy, without a sensitivity to the distribution of heat. However, measuring the amplitude and phase of $h_2$ or $l_2$ facilitates determination of the shell rheology. We provide the precisions required for measuring $k_2$, $h_2$, and/or $l_2$ that enable distinguishing between the two main scenarios of tidal heating, i.e., in the shell versus the core. We also investigate the effect of the structural heterogeneities of the shell on the tidal response. Lastly, we evaluate the efficacy of a suite of future geodetic measurements to constrain key interior properties essential to instantaneous and sustained habitability at Enceladus.</description>

      <title>On nonlinear transitions, minimal seeds and exact solutions for the geodynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nearly fifty years ago, Roberts (1978) postulated that Earth's magnetic field, which is generated by turbulent motions of liquid metal in its outer core, likely results from a subcritical (finite-amplitude) dynamo instability characterised by a dominant balance between Coriolis, pressure and Lorentz forces. Here we numerically explore subcritical convective dynamo action in a spherical shell, using techniques from optimal control and dynamical systems theory to uncover the nonlinear dynamics of magnetic field generation. Through nonlinear optimisation, via direct-adjoint looping, we identify the minimal seed - the smallest magnetic field that attracts to a nonlinear dynamo solution. Additionally, using the Newton-hookstep algorithm, we converge stable and unstable travelling wave solutions to the governing equations. By combining these two techniques, complex nonlinear pathways between attracting states are revealed, providing insight into a potential subcritical origin of the geodynamo. This paper showcases these methods on the widely studied benchmark of Christensen et al. (2001), laying the foundations for future studies in more extreme and realistic parameter regimes. We show that the minimal seed reaches a nonlinear dynamo solution by first approaching an unstable travelling wave solution, which acts as an edge state separating a hydrodynamic solution from a magnetohydrodynamic one. Furthermore, by carefully examining the choice of cost functional, we establish a robust optimisation procedure that can systematically locate dynamo solutions on short time horizons with no prior knowledge of its structure.</description>
