      <title>$\bf{S^1}$-index theory for the Lorentz force equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove that the $S^1$-invariance of the Poincar\'e action functional associated to the Lorentz force equation gives the existence of multiple critical points which are periodic solutions with a fixed period. To do this, we prove an abstract multiplicity result which is based upon the Lusternik-Schnirelman method with the $S^1$-index. The corresponding result in the context of the Fadell-Rabinowitz index is proved in Ekeland and Lasry (Ann. Math., 112 (1980)). The main feature of our abstract result is that it allows us to consider nonsmooth functionals satisfying only a weak compactness condition well adapted to the Poincar\'e functional.</description>

      <title>Painlev\'e Universality classes for the maximal amplitude solution of the Focusing Nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger Equation with randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish universality for extremal solutions of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation. Extremal solutions are $N$-soliton solutions that achieve the theoretical maximal amplitude and diverge as $N \to \infty$. We consider extremal solutions with the discrete eigenvalues randomly drawn from sub-exponential distributions, and identify two distinct universality classes, determined by the macroscopic structure of the spectrum: the Painlev\'e--III rogue-wave solution, where the eigenvalues take the form $\lambda_j = v_j + i \mu_j$, and the Painlev\'e--V rogue wave solution, where $\lambda_j = -\zeta \, j + v_j + i \mu_j$, with $0 &lt; \zeta &lt; 1$. (In both cases, $\mu_{j}$ and $v_{j}$ are subexponential random variables.) Universality can then be summarized as follows: independently of the specific distribution of the eigenvalues, the rescaled solutions converge locally to a deterministic profile governed by the Painlev\'e-III equation in the first regime, and the Painlev\'e-V equation in the second. These results demonstrate that the formation of Painlev\'e-type rogue waves is a universal phenomenon robust to randomness.</description>

      <title>Existence and symmetry of extremals for the high order Hardy-Sobolev-Maz'ya inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we establish the existence of an extremal function for the k-th order critical Hardy-Sobolev-Maz'ya (HSM) inequalities on the upper half space $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}_{+}$ when $k\ge 2$ and $n\geq 2k+2$:
  $$\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}_{+}}|\nabla^{k}u|^2dx-\prod_{i=1}^{k}\frac{\left(2i-1\right)^2}{4}\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}_{+}}\frac{u^2}{x_1^{2k}}dx\geq C_{n,k,\frac{2n}{n-2k}} \left(\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}_{+}}|u|^{\frac{2n}{n-2k}}dx\right)^{\frac{n-2k}{n}}. $$
  The analysis of this extremal problem is challenging due to the presence of the higher order derivatives, the lack of translation invariance, the inapplicability of rearrangement techniques on the upper half-space, and the presence of a Hardy singularity along the boundary. To overcome these difficulties, instead of directly considering the HSM inequality on the upper half space, we establish the existence of an extremal for its equivalent version: Poincar\'e-Sobolev inequality on the hyperbolic space. We develop a novel duality theory of the minimizing sequences, the concentration-compactness principle for radial functions in the hyperbolic setting, which combines with the Helgason-Fourier analysis and the Riesz rearrangement inequality on the hyperbolic space, to resolve the lack of compactness issue. As an application, we also obtain the existence of positive symmetric solutions for the high order Brezis-Nirenberg equation on the entire hyperbolic space associated with the GJMS operators $P_k$ (i.e., when $k\ge 2$): $$ P_{k}\left(f\right)-\alpha f=|f|^{p-2}f $$ at the critical situation $\alpha=\prod\limits_{i=1}^{k}\frac{\left(2i-1\right)^2}{4}$ when either $2k+2\leq n$ and $p=\frac{2n}{n-2k}$ or $2k&lt;n$ and $2&lt;p&lt;\frac{2n}{n-2k}$.</description>

      <title>Strong solutions to the initial-boundary-value problem of compressible MHD equations with degenerate viscosities and far field vacuum in 3D exterior domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the initial-boundary-value problem (IBVP) of the compressible Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations in 3D exterior domains with Navier-slip boundary conditions for the velocity and perfect conducting conditions for the magnetic field. For the case that the density approaches far-field vacuum initially and the viscosities are power functions of the density (\rho}{\delta} with 0 &lt; {\delta} &lt; 1), the local existence and uniqueness of strong solutions to the IBVP is established for regular large initial data. In particular, in contrast to the local theory of compressible Navier-Stokes equation Li-L\"u-Yuan [24], we show that the magnetic field maintains the initial quality of decaying faster rate than density throughout the time evolution, which reveals the role of the magnetic field in handling singularities arising from density-dependent viscosities.</description>

      <title>Infinitely many new solutions for a nonlinear coupled Schr\"odinger system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the following nonlinear Schr\"odinger system \begin{align*}\begin{cases} -\epsilon^{2}\Delta u +P(x) u= \mu_1 u^3 +\beta uv^2, &amp;~\text{in}\;\mathbb {R}^3,\\ -\epsilon^{2}\Delta v+Q(x) v= \mu_2 v^3 +\beta u^2v, &amp;~\text{in}\;\mathbb{ R}^3, \end{cases} \end{align*} where $\epsilon$ is a positive parameter, $P(x),\,Q(x)$ are the potential functions, $\mu_1&gt;0$, $\mu_2&gt;0$ and $\beta\in\mathbb R$ is a coupling constant. Employing the finite dimensional reduction method, we prove that there are new kind of synchronized and segregated solutions, which concentrate both in a bounded domain and near infinity, and present a special structure. Moreover, by applying the local Pohozaev identities and some point-wise estimates of the errors, we prove that the new kind of synchronized solutions are non-degenerate, which is of great interest independently. One of the main difficulties of Schr\"odinger system come from the interspecies interaction between the components, which never appear in the study of single equation. Secondly, prior to the construction of new solutions, we shall verify the non-degeneracy of the solutions established in [Peng-Pi, Discrete Contin. Dyn. Syst., 2016] for the Schr\"odinger systems.</description>

      <title>Precise propagation profile for some monostable free boundary problems in time-periodic media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider reaction-diffusion equations of the form \begin{equation*} u_t - d u_{xx} = f(t,u), \quad t&gt;0,\ \ x \in [g(t), h(t)], \end{equation*} where $f(t,u)$ is periodic in $t$ and monostable in $u$, and the interval $[g(t), h(t)]$ represents the one dimensional population range of a species with density $u(t,x)$ at time $t$ and spatial location $x$. The free boundaries $x=g(t)$ and $x=h(t)$ evolve subject to a ``preferred population density" condition at the habitat edges. Analogous to the traveling wave solutions in the corresponding Cauchy problem, semi-wave solutions play a fundamental role in understanding the propagation phenomena governed by the free boundary problem here. But in contrast to the Cauchy problem, where the KPP condition plays a subtle role in the precise approximation of its solution (with compactly supported initial function) by the traveling wave solution with minimal speed, here we prove the existence and uniqueness of a semi-wave in a general monostable setting, and obtain a precise description of the convergence of the solution toward the semi-wave as time goes to infinity, where the KPP condition plays no special role. Previously, such a sharp result was proved for a free boundary model only when $f$ is autonomous ($f=f(u)$, see \cite{D} or \cite{DL15} for a related free boundary model), or a less precise result was obtained in the time-periodic case under an extra strong KPP condition on $f$ (see \cite{MDW}, or \cite{DGP} for a related free boundary model). This work appears to be the first to prove the sharp convergence result for a general monostable free boundary problem in a heterogeneous environment, and we believe the methods developed here should have applications to related free boundary problems in heterogeneous media with nonlinearities more general than those of KPP type.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of a nonlocal epidemic model with a new free boundary condition, part 1: Spreading-vanishing dichotomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the long-time dynamics of a nonlocal epidemic model with free boundaries, where a pathogen with density $u(t,x)$ and the infected humans with density $v(t,x)$ evolve according to a reaction-diffusion system with nonlocal diffusion over a one dimensional interval $[g(t), h(t)]$, which represents the epidemic region expanding through its boundaries $x=g(t)$ and $x=h(t)$, known as free boundaries. Such a model with free boundary conditions based on those of Cao et al. \cite{fb27} was considered by several works. Inspired by recent works of Feng et al. \cite{fb20} and Long et al. \cite{fb5}, we propose a new free boundary condition, where the expansion rate of the epidemic region, determined by $h'(t)$ and $g'(t)$, is proportional to a linear combination of the outward flux of the pathogen \(u\) through the range boundary (as in \cite{fb27}) and the weighted total population of infected individuals \(v\) within the region (as in \cite{fb5}). We prove that the system under this new free boundary condition is well-posed, and its long-time dynamical behavior is characterized by a spreading-vanishing dichotomy. Moreover, we obtain sharp criteria for this dichotomy, including a sharp threshold in terms of the initial data $(u_0,v_0)$; and by studying a related eigenvalue problem, we also find a sharp threshold in terms of the diffusion rate, which complements related results in Nguyen and Vo \cite{fb7}. This is Part $1$ of a two part series. In Part $2$, we will determine the spreading speed of the model when spreading occurs, and for some typical classes of kernel functions, we will obtain the precise rates of accelerated spreading.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz regularity of harmonic quasiconformal maps between Lyapunov domains in $\mathbb{R}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every sense-preserving harmonic $K$--quasiconformal homeomorphism $f\colon D\to\Omega$ between Lyapunov domains (equivalently, bounded $C^{1,\alpha}$ domains) in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $\alpha\in(0,1]$, is globally Lipschitz on $\overline D$. The argument is based on a boundary iteration scheme: an initial H\"older modulus for the boundary trace (coming from quasiconformality) is improved via the $C^{1,\alpha}$ graph representation of $\partial\Omega$, yielding higher H\"older regularity for the normal component. This boundary gain is converted into a near-boundary gradient bound for harmonic functions through a basepoint boundary H\"older-to-gradient estimate obtained by flattening the boundary and using local harmonic-measure bounds. Quasiconformality then propagates the resulting control from one component to the full differential, and iteration gives boundedness of $|Df|$ up to the boundary. Along the way we briefly survey several standard tools from the theory of quasiconformal harmonic mappings (QCH), including boundary H\"older continuity, distortion of derivatives, and boundary-to-interior propagation principles that enter the iteration.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the PML method for thermoelastic wave scattering problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the thermoelastic obstacle scattering problem in three dimensions. A uniaxial perfectly matched layer (PML) method is firstly introduced to truncate the unbounded scattering problem, leading to a truncated PML problem in a bounded domain. Under certain constraints on model parameters, the well-posedness for the truncated PML problem is then proved except possibly for a discrete set of frequencies, based on the analytic Fredholm theory. Moreover, the exponential convergence of the uniaxial PML method is established in terms of the thickness and absorbing parameters of PML layer. The proof is based on the PML extension technique and the exponential decay properties of the modified fundamental solution. As far as we know, this is the first convergence result of the PML method for the time-harmonic thermoelastic scattering problem.</description>

      <title>Regularity results for linear parabolic equations on Carnot tori via mollifier kernel construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper first proves the existence, uniqueness and regularity of the solution to a class of linear backward parabolic equations on Carnot tori, namely the periodic linear parabolic equation on Carnot groups. Such groups are non-commutative and typical examples of sub-Riemannian manifolds. Moreover, we apply the results for this equation to its dual equation (i.e., the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation in the general form), and derive the existence, uniqueness and regularity of its weak solution. To obtain the regularity results for solutions to the linear parabolic equation and its dual equation, firstly, we construct several families of mollifiers adapted respectively to the H\"{o}rmander vector fields generating Carnot groups, Carnot tori and dual spaces of non-isotropic H\"{o}lder spaces; secondly, we use the theory of singular integral operators to establish stronger a priori regularity for the solutions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript is concerned with the system \begin{align*} \left\{ \begin{array}{l} u_{tt} = (\gamma(\Theta) u_{xt})_x + (a(x,t) u_x)_x +(f(\Theta))_x, \\[1mm] \Theta_t = D\Theta_{xx} + \gamma(\Theta) u_{xt}^2 + f(\Theta) u_{xt}, \end{array} \right. \end{align*} which is used to describe thermoviscoelastic developments in one-dimensional Kelvin-Voigt materials. \abs It is assumed that $a,\gamma$ and $f$ are sufficiently smooth functions that satisfy $$c_\gamma&lt;\gamma(\zeta)&lt;C_\gamma, \quad \gamma''(\zeta) \le 0,\quad f(0)=0, \quad |f'(\zeta)|\le C_f \quad \mbox{ and } |f(\zeta)|\le C_f(1+\zeta)^\alpha \quad \mbox{ for all }\zeta\ge 0 $$ and some positive constants $c_\gamma,C_\gamma,C_f&gt;0$ and $\alpha \in (0,5/6)$. Under these conditions, this study then establishes a result on the existence of global classical solutions for sufficiently smooth but arbitrarily large initial data.</description>

      <title>Large time existence in a thermoviscoelastic evolution problem with mildly temperature-dependent parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider \begin{align*} \label{HS} \left\{ \begin{array}{l} u_{tt} = (\gamma(\Theta) u_{xt})_x + a (\gamma(\Theta) u_x)_x +(f(\Theta))_x, \\[1mm] \Theta_t = D\Theta_{xx} + \Gamma(\Theta) u_{xt}^2 + F(\Theta) u_{xt}, \end{array}\right. \qquad \qquad (\star) \end{align*} under Neumann boundary conditions for $u$ and Dirichlet boundary conditions for $\Theta$ in a bounded interval $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}$. \abs This model is a generalization of the classical system for the description of strain and temperature evolution in a thermo-viscoelastic material following a Kelvin-Voigt material law, in which $\gamma\equiv \Gamma$ and $f\equiv F$. Different variations of this model have already been analyzed in the past and the present study draws upon a known result concerning the existence of classical solutions, which are local in time, for suitably smooth initial data, arbitrary $a&gt;0$, $D&gt;0$ and $\gamma,f\in C^2([0,\infty))$ as well as $\Gamma,F\in C^1([0,\infty))$ with $\gamma&gt;0,\Gamma\ge0$ and $F(0)=0$. Our work focuses on proving that existence times for classical solutions can be arbitrarily large, assuming sublinear temperature dependencies of $\gamma$ and $f$, and further $|F(s)|\le C_F(1+s)^\alpha$ for some $C_F&gt;0$ and $\alpha\in(0,1)$. In particular, for any given $T_\star$, initial mass $M$ and $0&lt;\underline\gamma&lt;\overline\gamma$, there exists a constant $\delta_\star(M,T_\star,a,D, \Omega, \underline\gamma, \overline\gamma,C_F,\alpha)&gt;0$, such that if $$\underline\gamma \le\gamma\le \overline\gamma\quad\mbox{ and }\quad 0\le \Gamma\le \overline\gamma \quad \mbox{ as well as } \quad\|\gamma'\|_{L^\infty([0,\infty))}\le \delta_\star \quad \mbox{ and }\quad \|f'\|_{L^\infty([0,\infty))}\le \delta_\star $$ hold, the maximal existence time of the classical solution to $(\star)$ surpasses $T_\star$.</description>

      <title>Fundamental solution for higher order homogeneous hypoelliptic operators structured on H\"{o}rmander vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a new class of higher order differential operators defined on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, which are built with H\"{o}rmander vector fields, homogeneous w.r.t. a family of dilations (but not left invariant w.r.t. any structure of Lie group) and have a structure such that a suitably lifted version of the operator is hypoelliptic. We call these operators ''generalized Rockland operators''. We prove that these operators are themselves hypoelliptic and, under a natural condition on the homogeneity degree, possess a global fundamental solution $\Gamma\left( x,y\right) $ which is jointly homogeneous in $\left( x,y\right) $ and satisfies sharp pointwise estimates. Our theory can be applied also to some higher order heat-type operators and their fundamental solutions.</description>

      <title>Weak and strong averaging principle for 2D Boussinesq equations with non-Lipschitz Poisson jump noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the averaging principle for 2D Boussinesq equations with non-Lipschitz Poisson jump noise. Precisely, we will first explore the well-posedness, regularity estimates and tightness of the vorticity variable. Then, we prove the ergodicity of the temperature variable. Next, we prove that the vorticity variable converge to the solution of the averaged equation in probability and $2p$th-mean, under different conditions, as time scale parameter $\varepsilon$ goes to zero. Finally, we present a specific case study and conduct numerical simulations to substantiate the main conclusions of this paper.</description>

      <title>Flow reversal of the Stokes system with localized boundary data in the half space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the unsteady Stokes system in the half-space with zero initial data and nonzero, space-time localized boundary data. We show that there exist boundary influxes for which the induced flow exhibits flow reversal, in the sense that at least one component of the velocity field changes its sign in the half-space. This phenomenon is demonstrated by a careful analysis of the representation formula for the Stokes system in the half-space, including pointwise estimates, based on the Green tensor with nonzero boundary data. We construct solutions of the Stokes system such that the tangential components of the velocity field exhibit at least one sign change, while the normal component exhibits at least two sign changes. Moreover, the normal component of the constructed velocity field has the opposite sign to the tangential components near the boundary, whereas it has the same sign as the tangential components sufficiently far from the boundary.</description>

      <title>Large bulk viscosity limit for compressible MHD equations in critical Besov spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the large bulk viscosity limit for the compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations in two and three dimensions. For arbitrarily large initial data in critical Besov spaces, we prove the global well-posedness of strong solutions and establish their convergence, with explicit quantitative rates, to solutions of the incompressible MHD system, as the bulk viscosity parameter tends to infinity. As an application of this singular-limit analysis, we construct global smooth solutions to the compressible MHD equations whose magnetic field undergoes reconnection, thereby extending to the compressible regime the reconnection scenarios previously identified for incompressible flows.</description>

      <title>Explicit representation of solutions to a linear wave equation with time delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops an explicit spectral representation for solutions of a one-dimensional linear wave equation with a constant time delay. The model is considered on a bounded interval with non-homogeneous Dirichlet boundary data and a prescribed history function. To accommodate the loss of global smoothness in time caused by delay terms, solutions are understood in a \textit{stepwise classical sense}, allowing jump discontinuities in the second time derivative at multiples of the delay while maintaining continuity of the solution and its first time derivative.
  By combining separation of variables with Sturm-Liouville expansions, the delayed PDE is reduced to a family of scalar second-order delay differential equations. Using delay-dependent fundamental solutions, we derive closed-form representation formulas for the modal dynamics and reconstruct the PDE solution as a Fourier series. Convergence conditions guaranteeing uniform convergence and admissibility of termwise differentiation in space are established. A numerical example demonstrates the practical computation of truncated series solutions and their visualization.</description>

      <title>Large time stabilization of rough-data solutions in one-dimensional nonlinear thermoelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an open bounded real interval $\Omega$, the model for one-dimensional thermoelasticity given by \[
  u_{tt} = u_{xx} - \big(f(\Theta)\big)_x,
  \qquad
  \Theta_t = \Theta_{xx} - f(\Theta) u_{xt}, \] is considered along with homogeneous boundary conditions of Dirichlet type for $u$ and of Neumann type for $\Theta$, under the assumption that $f\in C^1([0,\infty))$ satisfies $f(0)=0$, $f'\in L^\infty((0,\infty))$ and $f'&gt;0$ on $[0,\infty)$. The focus is on initial data which are merely required to be consistent with the fundamental principles of energy conservation and entropy nondecrease, by satisfying \[
  u_0\in W_0^{1,2}(\Omega),
  u_{0t} \in L^2(\Omega),
  0 \le \Theta_0\in L^1(\Omega), \Theta_0 \not\equiv 0. \] Despite an apparent lack of favorable compactness properties that have underlain previous related studies on more regular settings, it is shown that corresponding weak solutions stabilize in the sense that \[
  \lim_{t\to\infty} \|u(\cdot,t)\|_{L^\infty(\Omega)}=0 \] and \[
  {\rm ess} \lim_{\!\!\!\! t\to\infty} \|\Theta(\cdot,t)-\Theta_\infty\|_{L^\infty(\Omega)}=0 \] with some $\Theta_\infty&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>A simple model for one-dimensional nonlinear thermoelasticity: Well-posedness in rough-data frameworks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an open bounded interval $\Omega$, the problem \[
  u_{tt} = u_{xx} - \big(f(\Theta)\big)_x,
  \Theta_t = \Theta_{xx} - f(\Theta) u_{xt}, \] is considered under the boundary conditions $u|_{\partial\Omega}=\Theta_x|_{\partial\Omega}=0$, and for $f\in C^2([0,\infty))$ satisfying $f(0)=0$, $f'&gt;0$ on $[0,\infty)$ and $f'\in W^{1,\infty}((0,\infty))$.
  In the sense of unconditional global existence, uniqueness and continuous dependence, this problem is shown to be well-posed within ranges of initial data merely satisfying \[
  u_0\in W_0^{1,2}(\Omega),
  \quad
  u_{0t} \in L^2(\Omega)
  \quad \mbox{and} \quad
  \Theta_0 \in L^2(\Omega)
  \mbox{ with $\Theta\ge 0$ a.e.~in $\Omega$,} \] and in classes of solutions fulfilling \[
  u\in C^0([0,\infty);W_0^{1,2}(\Omega)),

      <title>Global solvability and stabilization in multi-dimensional small-strain nonlinear thermoviscoelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite considerable developments in the literature of the past decades, a standing open problem in the analysis of continuum mechanics appears to consist of determining how far the prototypical model for small-strain thermoviscoelastic evolution in Kelvin-Voigt materials with inertia, as given by \[
  u_{tt} = \mu \Delta u_t + (\lambda+\mu)\nabla\nabla\cdot u_t
  + \hat{\mu} \Delta u + (\hat{\lambda}+\hat{\mu}) \nabla\nabla\cdot u
  - B\nabla\Theta,
  \qquad \qquad
  \kappa \Theta_t = D\Delta\Theta + \mu |\nabla u_t|^2 + (\lambda+\mu) |{\rm div} \, u_t|^2 - B\Theta {\rm div} \, u_t,
  \qquad \qquad \qquad (\star) \] is globally solvable in multi-dimensional settings and for initial data of arbitrary size.
  The present manuscript addresses this in the context of an initial value problem in smoothly bounded $n$-dimensional domains with $n\ge 2$, posed under homogeneous boundary conditions of Dirichlet type for the displacement variable $u$, and of Neumann type for the temperature $\Theta$. Within suitably generalized concepts of solvability, global existence of solutions is shown without any size restrictions on the data, and for a system actually more general than ($\star$) by, inter alia, allowing the heat capacity $\kappa$ to depend on $\Theta$. Apart from that, results on large time behavior are derived which particularly assert stabilization of $\Theta$ toward a spatially homogeneous limit.
  Besides on standard features related to energy conservation and entropy production, in its core parts the analysis relies on an evolution property of certain logarithmic refinements of classical entropy functionals, to the best of our knowledge undiscovered in precedent literature and possibly of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Finite time singularities in the Landau equation with very hard potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the inhomogeneous Landau equation with $\gamma \in (\sqrt{3},2]$ and construct smooth, strictly positive initial data that develop a finite time singularity. The $C^{\alpha}$-norm of the distribution function blows up for every $\alpha&gt;0$, whereas its $L^{\infty}$-norm remains uniformly bounded. In self-similar variables, the solution becomes asymptotically hydrodynamic - the distribution function converges to a local Maxwellian, while the hydrodynamic fields develop an asymptotically self-similar implosion whose profile coincides with a smooth imploding profile of the compressible Euler equations. To our knowledge, this provides the first example of a collisional kinetic model which is globally well-posed in the homogeneous setting, but admits finite time singularities for inhomogeneous data.</description>

      <title>Radon--Wasserstein Gradient Flows for Interacting-Particle Sampling in High Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradient flows of the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence, such as the Fokker--Planck equation and Stein Variational Gradient Descent, evolve a distribution toward a target density known only up to a normalizing constant. We introduce new gradient flows of the KL divergence with a remarkable combination of properties: they admit accurate interacting-particle approximations in high dimensions, and the per-step cost scales linearly in both the number of particles and the dimension. These gradient flows are based on new transportation-based Riemannian geometries on the space of probability measures: the Radon--Wasserstein geometry and the related Regularized Radon--Wasserstein (RRW) geometry. We define these geometries using the Radon transform so that the gradient-flow velocities depend only on one-dimensional projections. This yields interacting-particle-based algorithms whose per-step cost follows from efficient Fast Fourier Transform-based evaluation of the required 1D convolutions. We additionally provide numerical experiments that study the performance of the proposed algorithms and compare convergence behavior and quantization. Finally, we prove some theoretical results including well-posedness of the flows and long-time convergence guarantees for the RRW flow.</description>

      <title>Strong local nondeterminism for stochastic time-fractional slow and fast diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of stochastic time-fractional equations on $\mathbb{R}^d$ driven by a centered Gaussian noise, involving a Caputo time derivative of order $\beta&gt;0$, a fractional (power) Laplacian of order $\alpha&gt;0$, and a Riemann-Liouville time integral of order $\gamma\ge0$ acting on the noise. The noise is fractional in time (index $H$) and Riesz-type in space (index $\ell$). We derive sharp Dalang-type necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a random field solution across almost full parameter range $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma;H,\ell)$. Under the Dalang-type conditions, we prove sharp variance bounds for temporal and spatial increments, as well as strong local nondeterminism in time in several regimes (two-sided version for $\beta=1$ and for parts of the case $\beta=2$; one-sided version for $0&lt;\beta&lt;2$) and strong local nondeterminism in space for the whole range of parameters. As applications, we derive exact uniform and local moduli of continuity, Chung-type laws of the iterated logarithm, and quantitative bounds on small ball probabilities. Along the way, we obtain sharp asymptotics for the fundamental solution kernels at $0$ and $\infty$, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On the Resistance Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give an affirmative answer to the resistance conjecture on characterization of parabolic Harnack inequalities in terms of volume doubling, upper capacity bounds and a Poincar\'e inequalities. The key step is to show that these three assumptions imply the so called cutoff Sobolev inequality, an important inequality in the study of anomalous diffusions, Dirichlet forms and re-scaled energies in fractals. This implication is shown in the general setting of $p$-Dirichlet Spaces introduced by the author and Murugan, and thus a unified treatment becomes possible to proving Harnack inequalities and stability phenomena in both analysis on metric spaces and fractals and for graphs and manifolds for all exponents $p\in (1,\infty)$. As an application, we also show that a Dirichlet space satisfying volume doubling, Poincar\'e and upper capacity bounds has finite martingale dimension and admits a type of differential structure similar to the work of Cheeger. In the course of the proof, we establish methods of extension and characterizations of Sobolev functions by Poincar\'e-inequalities, and extend the methods of Jones and Koskela to the general setting of $p$-Dirichlet spaces.</description>

      <title>Numerical stationary states for nonlocal Fokker-Planck equations via fixed points of consistency maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a fixed-point-based numerical framework for computing stationary states of nonlocal Fokker-Planck-type equations. Instead of discretising the differential operators directly, we reformulate the stationary problem as a nonlinear fixed-point map built from the original PDE and its nonlocal interaction terms, and solve the resulting finite-dimensional problem with a matrix-free Newton-Krylov method. We compare implementations using the analytic Frechet derivative of this map with a simple central-difference approximation. Because the method does not rely on time evolution, it is agnostic to dynamical stability and can detect both stable and unstable stationary states. Its accuracy is determined mainly by the numerical treatment of convolutions and quadrature, rather than by differentiation stencils. We apply the approach to three model problems with linear diffusion, use existing analytical results to verify the outputs, and reproduce known bifurcation diagrams, as well as new bifurcation behaviour not previously observed in this kind of problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact arithmetic hyperbolic surface, and let $\psi$ be an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass form on $X$ with sufficiently large spectral parameter $\lambda$. We give a new proof to obtain some power saving for the global $L^6$-norm $\|\psi\|_{L^6(X)}\lesssim_\epsilon\lambda^{\frac{1}{6}-\frac{1}{144}+\epsilon}$ over the local bound $\|\psi\|_{L^6(X)}\lesssim\lambda^{\frac16}$ of Sogge. Using the $L^\infty$-norm bound $\|\psi\|_{L^\infty(X)}\lesssim_\epsilon\lambda^{\frac{5}{12}+\epsilon}$ of Iwaniec and Sarnak and harmonic analysis tools, we reduce the $L^6$-norm problem to a microlocal $L^6$ Kakeya-Nikodym estimate for $\psi$. Finally, we establish an improved microlocal $L^6$ Kakeya-Nikodym estimate via arithmetic amplification developed by Iwaniec and Sarnak.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz stability for an inverse source problem of the wave equation with kinetic boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a refined approach to establish a global Lipschitz stability for an inverse source problem concerning the determination of forcing terms in the wave equation with mixed boundary conditions. It consists of boundary conditions incorporating a dynamic boundary condition and Dirichlet boundary condition on disjoint subsets of the boundary. The primary contribution of this article is the rigorous derivation of a sharp Carleman estimate for the wave system with a dynamic boundary condition. In particular, our findings complete and drastically improve the earlier results established by Gal and Tebou [SIAM J. Control Optim., 55 (2017), 324-364]. This is achieved by using a different weight function to overcome some relevant difficulties. As for the stability proof, we extend to dynamic boundary conditions a recent argument avoiding cut-off functions. Finally, we also show that our developed Carleman estimate yields a sharp boundary controllability result.</description>

      <title>Multiple positive solutions to a perturbed Gelfand problem involving mixed local-nonlocal operators and singular nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19694v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a perturbed Gelfand problem involving a mixed local-nonlocal $p$-Laplacian operator with singular nonlinearity: \begin{equation*} \begin{aligned}
  -\Delta_p u + (-\Delta_p)^s u = \lambda \frac{f(u)}{u^{\beta}}\ \text{in} \ \Omega\newline
  u &gt;0\ \text{in} \ \Omega,\ u =0\ \text{in} \ \mathbb{R}^N \setminus \Omega \end{aligned} \end{equation*} where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ is a smooth bounded domain, $\lambda &gt; 0 $ is a parameter, $0\leq \beta &lt;1$ and $f$ is a non-decreasing $C^1$-function with $f(0)&gt;0$. Using the method of sub- and supersolutions, we present a novel multiplicity result and, in specific cases, we also prove a three-solution theorem using Amann's fixed point theorem. Our construction of sub-supersolutions avoids the conventional reliance on ODE techniques and Green's function estimates, thereby making it more adaptable to the nonlinear and nonlocal framework. Additionally, we establish a Hopf-type Strong Comparison Principle for the linear operator with singular nonlinearity, marking the first result of its kind for mixed local-nonlocal operators. This result is crucial in deriving a third solution and holds broader mathematical significance.</description>

      <title>Mathematical modeling and simulation of coupled aqueous humor flow and temperature distribution in a realistic 3D human eye geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive computational model to simulate the coupled dynamics of aqueous humor flow and heat transfer in the human eye. To manage the complexity of the model, we make significant efforts in meshing and efficient solution of the discrete problem using high-performance resources. The model accurately describes the dynamics of the aqueous humor in the anterior and posterior chambers and accounts for convective effects due to temperature variations. Results for fluid velocity, pressure, and temperature distribution are in good agreement with existing numerical results in the literature. Furthermore, the effects of postural changes and wall shear stress behavior are analyzed, providing new insights into the mechanical forces acting on ocular tissues. Overall, the present contribution provides a detailed three-dimensional simulation that enhances the understanding of ocular physiology and may contribute to further progress in clinical research and treatment optimization in ophthalmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07987v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a functional calculus which allows one to apply functions to the matrix anti-commutator/commutator operator. The calculus is introduced in a straightforward manner if the operators act on symmetric matrices, and it leads to a coordinate-free version of Daleckii--Krein formula. In this sense, the proposed calculus provides symbolic formulae for the derivatives of matrix-valued functions that are explicit and easy to use. We discuss several applications of the newly introduced calculus in continuum mechanics (Hencky logarithmic strain, objective rates, spin tensors, viscoelastic fluids) and in the theory of partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>An Inverse Problem for the Prescribed Mean Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the recent study of inverse problems for minimal surfaces by considering the inverse source problem for the prescribed mean curvature equation \begin{equation*}
  \nabla \cdot \left[ \frac{\nabla u}{(1 + |\nabla u|^2)^{1/2}} \right] = H(x). \end{equation*} This work also represents the first treatment of inverse source problems for quasilinear equations. We prove that in two dimensions, the source function $H$ is uniquely determined by the associated Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. A notable feature of this problem is that although the equation is posed on an Euclidean domain, its linearization yields an anisotropic conductivity equation where the coefficient matrix corresponds to a Riemannian metric $g$ depending on the background solution.
  The main methodological contribution is the derivation of a coupled nonlinear system of algebraic and geometric partial differential equations from boundary measurements. Similar systems will naturally appear in other inverse problems for quasilinear equations. We solve the system using a Liouville type uniqueness result for conformal mappings, which recovers the source function uniquely.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a class of chemotaxis systems modeling lethal interactions in a smooth, bounded domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. We examine two distinct cases: (i) a fully parabolic system where both equations exhibit parabolic dynamics, and (ii) a parabolic-elliptic system featuring a parabolic first equation coupled with an elliptic second equation. Under appropriate parameter constraints, we establish the existence of unique globally bounded classical solutions for arbitrary spatial dimensions $n \geq 1$. Additionally, we employ carefully constructed Lyapunov functionals to analyze the long-term behavior of solutions, obtaining rigorous asymptotic stability results.</description>

      <title>Convergence to equilibrium of weak solutions to the Cahn--Hilliard equation with non-degenerate mobility and singular potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the classical initial and boundary value problem for the Cahn--Hilliard equation with non-degenerate mobility and singular (e.g., logarithmic) potential. We prove that any weak solution converges to a single equilibrium using only minimal assumptions, that is, the existence of a global weak solution which satisfies an energy inequality. This result appears to be new in the literature and also holds in the three-dimensional case, which was an open problem due to the lack of regularity results, especially when the mobility is just a continuous function. We then prove the same result for a Cahn--Hilliard-Navier--Stokes type system with unmatched densities and viscosities proposed by Abels, Garcke, and Gr\"un (Math. Models Methods Appl. Sci. 22, 2012), always assuming a non-degenerate mobility. We expect that this novel method can be used to analyze the same issue for other models where the regularization properties of the solutions are unknown or unlikely.</description>

      <title>On the proximal dynamics between integrable and non-integrable members of a generalized Korteweg-de Vries family of equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The distance between the solutions to the integrable Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation and a broad class of non-integrable generalized KdV (gKdV) equations is estimated in appropriate Sobolev spaces. This family of equations includes, as special cases, the standard gKdV equation with power nonlinearities as well as weakly nonlinear perturbations of the KdV equation. For initial data and nonlinearity parameters of arbitrary size, we establish distance estimates based on a crucial size estimate for local gKdV solutions that grows linearly with the norm of the initial data. Consequently, these estimates predict that the dynamics of the gKdV and KdV equations remain close over long time intervals for initial amplitudes approaching unity, while providing an explicit rate of deviation for larger amplitudes. These theoretical results are supported by numerical simulations of one-soliton and two-soliton initial conditions, which show excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that in the case of power nonlinearities and large solitonic initial data, the deviation between the integrable and non-integrable dynamics can be drastically reduced by incorporating suitable rotation effects via a rescaled KdV equation. As a result, the integrable dynamics stemming from the rescaled KdV equation may persist within the gKdV family of equations over remarkably long timescales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04018v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the three-dimensional relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell-Boltzmann system, where the speed of light $c$ is an arbitrary constant no less than 1, and we establish global existence and nonlinear stability of the vacuum for small initial data, with bounds that are uniform in $c$. The analysis is based on the vector field method combined with the Glassey-Strauss decomposition of the electromagnetic field, and does not require any compact support assumption on the initial data. A key ingredient of the proof is the derivation of a chain rule for the relativistic Boltzmann collision operator that is compatible with the commutation properties of the vector fields. These tools allow us to control the coupled kinetic and electromagnetic equations and to obtain global stability near vacuum.</description>

      <title>Sparsity and uniform regularity for regularised optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider regularised quadratic optimal transport with subquadratic polynomial or entropic regularisation. In both cases, we prove interior Lipschitz-estimates on a transport-like map and interior gradient Lipschitz-estimates on the potentials, under the assumption that the transport map solving the unregularised problem is bi-$C^{1,\alpha}$-regular. For strictly subquadratic and entropic regularisation, the estimates improve to interior $C^1$ and $C^2$ estimates for the transport-like map and the potentials, respectively. Our estimates are uniform in the regularisation parameter. As a consequence of this, we obtain convergence of the transport-like map (resp. the potentials) to the unregularised transport map (resp. Kantorovich potentials) in $C^{0,1-}_{\mathrm{loc}}$ (resp. $C^{1,1-}_{\mathrm{loc}}$).
  Central to our approach are sharp local bounds on the size of the support for regularised optimal transport which we derive for a general convex, superlinear regularisation term. These bounds are of independent interest and imply global bias bounds for the regularised transport plans. Our global bounds, while not necessarily sharp, improve on the best known results in the literature for quadratic regularisation.</description>

      <title>Time-fractional nonlinear evolution equations with time-dependent constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is devoted to developing an abstract theory of time-fractional gradient flow equations for time-dependent convex functionals in real Hilbert spaces. The main results concern the existence of strong solutions to time-fractional abstract evolution equations governed by subdifferential operators of time-dependent convex functionals. In the classical theory of gradient flow equations, chain-rule formulae play a crucial role in various analyses, and such formulae for subdifferentials of time-dependent functionals are also known in the case of first-order time derivatives. In contrast, in the present setting, the presence of time-fractional derivatives prevents the direct use of the usual chain-rule. To overcome this difficulty, fractional chain-rule formulae for subdifferentials of time-dependent convex functionals are established under a nonlocal variant of the so-called Kenmochi condition. Moreover, Gronwall-type lemmas for nonlinear Volterra integral inequalities are developed. Finally, the abstract results obtained are applied to initial-boundary value problems for time-fractional degenerate parabolic equations on moving domains.</description>

Abstract: Using a discrete Bakry-{\'E}mery method based on the JKO scheme, relying on the dissipation of entropy and Fisher information along a discrete flow, we establish new generalized logarithmic Sobolev inequality for log-concave measures of the form $e^{-V}$ under strict convexity assumptions on $V$ . We then show how this method recovers some well-known inequalities. This approach can be viewed as interpolating between the Bakry-{\'E}mery method and optimal transport techniques based on geodesic convexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.23115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we shall investigate the Nonlinear Magnetic Schr\"odinger Equation on noncompact metric graphs, focusing on the existence of ground states. We prove that the magnetic Hamiltonian is variationally equivalent to a non-magnetic operator with additional repulsive potentials supported on the graph's cycles. This effective potential is strictly determined by the Aharonov-Bohm flux through the topological loops. Leveraging this reduction, we extend classical existence criteria to the magnetic setting. As a key application, we characterize the ground state structure on the tadpole graph, revealing a mass-dependent phase transition. The ground states exist for sufficiently small repulsion in an intermediate regime of masses while sufficiently strong flux prevents the formation of ground states.</description>

Abstract: We study the small dispersion limit of the intermediate long wave (ILW) equation, specifically on a class of well-behaved initial conditions $u_0$ where the number of solitons in the solution increases without bound. First, we conduct a formal WKB-style analysis on the ILW direct scattering problem, generating approximate eigenvalues and norming constants. We then use this to define a modified set of scattering data and rigorously analyze the associated inverse scattering problem. The main results include demonstrating $L^2$-convergence of the solution at $t = 0$ to the original initial condition $u_0$ and for $0 &lt; t &lt; t_\mathrm{c}$ to the associated solution of invicid Burgers' equation, where $t_\mathrm{c}$ is the time of gradient catastrophe.</description>

      <title>1-stable fluctuations in branching Brownian motion at critical temperature II: general functionals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2103.10412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mu_t$ denote the critical derivative Gibbs measure of branching Brownian motion at time $t$. It has been proved by Madaule (Stochastic Process. Appl. 126 (2016), no. 2, 470--502) and Maillard and Zeitouni (Ann. Inst. Henri Poincar\'e Probab. Stat. 52 (2016), no. 3, 1144--1160) that $\mu_t$ converges weakly to the random measure $Z_\infty \sqrt{2/\pi} x^2 e^{-x^2/2} \boldsymbol 1_{x &gt;0} d x$, where $Z_\infty$ is the limit of the derivative martingale. In this paper, we are interested in the fluctuations that occur in this convergence and prove for a large class of functions $F$ that \begin{align*}
  \sqrt{t} \left(
  \int_{\mathbb R} F d \mu_t
  - Z_\infty \int_0^\infty F(x) \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} x^2 e^{-x^2/2} d x
  - \frac{c(F) \log t}{\sqrt{t}} Z_\infty \right)
  \to S(F), \end{align*} in law, as $t\to\infty$, where $c(F)$ is a constant depending on $F$ and, given $Z_\infty$, $S(F)$ has an explicit 1-stable distribution. Moreover, we extend this result to a functional convergence, and we identify precisely the particles responsible for the fluctuations. In particular, this proves the following result for the critical additive martingale $(W_t)_{t\geq 0}$: \[ \sqrt{t} \left( \sqrt{t} W_t - \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} Z_\infty \right) \xrightarrow[t\to\infty]{} C Z_\infty, \quad \text{in law}, \] where here $C$ is a Cauchy variable independent of $Z_\infty$, confirming a conjecture by Mueller and Munier (Phys. Rev. E 90 (2014), 042143) in the physics literature.</description>

Abstract: We investigate existence, stability, and instability of anchored rotating spiral waves in a model for geometric curve evolution. We find existence in a parameter regime limiting on a purely eikonal curve evolution. We study stability and instability theoretically, in the aforementioned limiting regime, and numerically. We find convective and absolute oscillatory instability, as well as saddle-node bifurcations. Our results in particular shed light on the instability of spiral waves in reaction-diffusion systems caused by an instability of wave trains against transverse modulations.</description>

      <title>Birkhoff-Kellogg type results in product spaces and their application to differential systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a new version of the well-known Birkhoff-Kellogg invariant-direction Theorem in product spaces. Our results concern operator systems and give the existence of component-wise eigenvalues, instead of scalar eigenvalues as in the classical case, that have corresponding eigenvectors with all components nontrivial and localized by their norm. We also show that, when applied to nonlinear eigenvalue problems for differential equations, this localization property of the eigenvectors provides, in turn, qualitative properties of the solutions. This is illustrated in two contexts of systems of PDEs and ODEs. We show the applicability of our theoretical results with two explicit examples.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz regularity of harmonic map heat flows into $CAT(0)$ spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1964, Eells and Sampson proved the celebrated long-time existence and convergence for the harmonic map heat flow into non-positively curved Riemannian manifolds. In 1992, Gromov and Schoen initiated the study of harmonic maps into $CAT(0) $ metric spaces. It naturally motivates the study of the harmonic map heat flow into singular metric spaces.
  In the 1990s, Mayer and Jost independently studied convex functionals on $CAT(0)$ spaces and extended Crandall-Liggett's theory of gradient flows from Banach spaces to $CAT(0) $ spaces to obtain the weak solutions for the harmonic map heat flow into $CAT(0)$ spaces. The weak solutions enjoy the favorable long-time existence, uniqueness and well-established long-time behaviors. It is a long-standing open question to ask if the weak solutions possess the Lipschitz regularity. Very recently, by using elliptic approximation method, Lin, Segatti, Sire, and Wang proved the weak solutions are Lipschitz in space and $1\over 2$-H\"older continuous in time, for a wide class of $CAT(0)$ spaces.
  In the present paper, we give a complete answer to the question. We show that every weak solution of the harmonic map heat flow into $CAT(0)$ spaces is Lipschitz continuous in both space and time. We also establish an Eells-Sampson-type Bochner inequality.</description>
