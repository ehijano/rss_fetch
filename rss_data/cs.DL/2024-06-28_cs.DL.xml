      <title>Documentation Practices of Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) faces persistent challenges in terms of transparency and accountability, which requires rigorous documentation. Through a literature review on documentation practices, we provide an overview of prevailing trends, persistent issues, and the multifaceted interplay of factors influencing the documentation. Our examination of key characteristics such as scope, target audiences, support for multimodality, and level of automation, highlights a dynamic evolution in documentation practices, underscored by a shift towards a more holistic, engaging, and automated documentation.</description>

      <title>Metrics to Detect Small-Scale and Large-Scale Citation Orchestration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Citation counts and related metrics have pervasive uses and misuses in academia and research appraisal, serving as scholarly influence and recognition measures. Hence, comprehending the citation patterns exhibited by authors is essential for assessing their research impact and contributions within their respective fields. Although the h-index, introduced by Hirsch in 2005, has emerged as a popular bibliometric indicator, it fails to account for the intricate relationships between authors and their citation patterns. This limitation becomes particularly relevant in cases where citations are strategically employed to boost the perceived influence of certain individuals or groups, a phenomenon that we term "orchestration". Orchestrated citations can introduce biases in citation rankings and therefore necessitate the identification of such patterns. Here, we use Scopus data to investigate orchestration of citations across all scientific disciplines. Orchestration could be small-scale, when the author him/herself and/or a small number of other authors use citations strategically to boost citation metrics like h-index; or large-scale, where extensive collaborations among many co-authors lead to high h-index for many/all of them. We propose three orchestration indicators: extremely low values in the ratio of citations over the square of the h-index (indicative of small-scale orchestration); extremely small number of authors who can explain at least 50% of an author's total citations (indicative of either small-scale or large-scale orchestration); and extremely large number of co-authors with more than 50 co-authored papers (indicative of large-scale orchestration). The distributions, potential thresholds based on 1% (and 5%) percentiles, and insights from these indicators are explored and put into perspective across science.</description>

      <title>Wikipedia Citations: Reproducible Citation Extraction from Multilingual Wikipedia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wikipedia is an essential component of the open science ecosystem, yet it is poorly integrated with academic open science initiatives. Wikipedia Citations is a project that focuses on extracting and releasing comprehensive datasets of citations from Wikipedia. A total of 29.3 million citations were extracted from English Wikipedia in May 2020. Following this one-off research project, we designed a reproducible pipeline that can process any given Wikipedia dump in the cloud-based settings. To demonstrate its usability, we extracted 40.6 million citations in February 2023 and 44.7 million citations in February 2024. Furthermore, we equipped the pipeline with an adapted Wikipedia citation template translation module to process multilingual Wikipedia articles in 15 European languages so that they are parsed and mapped into a generic structured citation template. This paper presents our open-source software pipeline to retrieve, classify, and disambiguate citations on demand from a given Wikipedia dump.</description>

      <title>On the Fast Track to Full Gold Open Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08313v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The world of scientific publishing is changing; the days of an old type of subscription-based earnings for publishers seem over, and we are entering a new era. It seems as if an ever-increasing number of journals from disparate publishers are going Gold, Open Access that is, yet have we rigorously ascertained the issue in its entirety, or are we touting the strengths and forgetting about constructive criticism and careful weighing of evidence? We will therefore present the current state of the art, in a compact review/bibliometrics style, of this more relevant than ever hot topic, including challenges and potential solutions that are most likely to be acceptable to all parties. Suggested solutions, as per the performed analysis, at least for the time being, represent an inclusive publishing environment where multiple publishing models are competing for a piece of the pie and thus inhibiting each other's flaws. The performed analysis also shows that there seems to be a link between trends in scientific publishing and tumultuous world events, which in turn has a special significance for the publishing environment in the current world stage -- implying that academy publishing has potentially now found itself at a tipping point of change.</description>

      <title>Where there's a will there's a way: ChatGPT is used more for science in countries where it is prohibited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11583v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Regulating AI is a key societal challenge, but which regulation methods are effective is unclear. This study measures the effectiveness of restricting AI services geographically, focusing on ChatGPT. OpenAI restricts ChatGPT access in several countries, including China and Russia. If restrictions are effective, ChatGPT use should be minimal in these countries. We measured use with a classifier based on distinctive word usage found in early versions of ChatGPT, e.g. "delve." We trained the classifier on pre- and post-ChatGPT "polished" abstracts and found it outperformed GPTZero and ZeroGPT on validation sets, including papers with self-reported AI use. Applying the classifier to preprints from Arxiv, BioRxiv, and MedRxiv showed ChatGPT was used in about 12.6% of preprints by August 2023, with 7.7% higher usage in restricted countries. The gap appeared before China's first major legal LLM became widely available. To test the possibility that, due to high demand, use in restricted countries would have been even higher without restrictions, we compared Asian countries with high expected demand (where English is not an official language) and found that use was higher in those with restrictions. ChatGPT use was correlated with higher views and downloads, but not citations or journal placement. Overall, restricting ChatGPT geographically has proven ineffective in science and possibly other domains, likely due to widespread workarounds.</description>
