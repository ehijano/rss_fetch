      <title>The stress-energy tensor of an Unruh-DeWitt detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a model for a finite-size particle detector, which allows us to derive its stress-energy tensor. This tensor is obtained from a covariant Lagrangian that describes not only the quantum field that models the detector, $\phi_{\text{d}}$, but also the systems responsible for its localization: a complex scalar field, $\psi_{\text{c}}$, and a perfect fluid. The local interaction between the detector and the complex field ensures the square integrability of the detector modes, while the fluid serves to define the spatial profile of $\psi_{\text{c}}$, localizing it in space. We then demonstrate that, under very general conditions, the resulting energy tensor -- incorporating all components of the system -- is physically reasonable and satisfies the energy conditions.</description>

      <title>Non-Variational ADAPT algorithm for quantum simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a non-variational quantum state preparation approach combined with the ADAPT operator selection strategy in the application of preparing the ground state of a desired target Hamiltonian. In this algorithm, energy gradient measurements determine both the operators and the gate parameters in the quantum circuit construction. We compare this non-variational algorithm with ADAPT-VQE and with feedback-based quantum algorithms in terms of the rate of energy reduction, the circuit depth, and the measurement cost in molecular simulation. We find that despite using deeper circuits, this new algorithm reaches chemical accuracy at a similar measurement cost to ADAPT-VQE. Since it does not rely on a classical optimization subroutine, it may provide robustness against circuit parameter errors due to imperfect control or gate synthesis.</description>

      <title>Optimal State Preparation for Logical Arrays on Zoned Neutral Atom Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing promises to solve problems previously deemed infeasible. However, high error rates necessitate quantum error correction for practical applications. Seminal experiments with zoned neutral atom architectures have shown remarkable potential for fault-tolerant quantum computing. To fully harness their potential, efficient software solutions are vital. A key aspect of quantum error correction is the initialization of physical qubits representing a logical qubit in a highly entangled state. This process, known as state preparation, is the foundation of most quantum error correction codes and, hence, a crucial step towards fault-tolerant quantum computing. Generating a schedule of target-specific instructions to perform the state preparation is highly complex. First software tools exist but are not suitable for the zoned neutral atom architectures. This work addresses this gap by leveraging the computational power of SMT solvers and generating minimal schedules for the state preparation of logical arrays. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that actively utilizing zones to shield idling qubits consistently results in higher fidelities than solutions disregarding these zones. The complete code is publicly available in open-source as part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT) at https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-qmap/tree/main/src/na/nasp.</description>

      <title>Analytical Expressions for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm and its Variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a near-term quantum algorithm aimed at solving combinatorial optimization problems. Since its introduction, various generalizations have emerged, spanning modifications to the initial state, phase unitaries, and mixer unitaries. In this work, we present an analytical study of broad families of QAOA variants. We begin by examining a family of QAOA with product mixers, which includes single-body mixers parametrized by multiple variational angles, and derive exact analytical expressions for the cost expectation on weighted problem graphs in the single-layer ansatz setting. We then analyze a family of QAOA that employs many-body Grover-type mixers, deriving analogous analytical expressions for weighted problem hypergraphs in the setting of arbitrarily many circuit ansatz layers. For both families, we allow individual phase angles for each node and edge (hyperedge) in the problem graph (hypergraph). Our results reveal that, in contrast to product mixers, the Grover mixer is sensitive to contributions from cycles of all lengths in the problem graph, exhibiting a form of non-locality. Our study advances the understanding of QAOA's behavior in general scenarios, providing a foundation for further theoretical exploration.</description>

      <title>Exclusivity principle, Ramsey theory, and $n$-cycle PR boxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exclusivity principle (E-principle) states that the sum of probabilities of pairwise exclusive events cannot exceed 1. Unlike other principles proposed to characterize quantum correlations, its intrinsically non-bipartite formulation enables its application in more general contextuality scenarios. Although equivalent to the no-signalling condition for any bipartite Bell scenario, this equivalence breaks down for two independent copies of the same scenario. Such violations of the E-principle due to multiple copies, known as its activation effect, was studied in [Nat Commun 4, 2263 (2013)] for the nonlocal extremal boxes of $(2,m,2)$, $(2,2,d)$, and $(3,2,2)$ Bell scenarios. The authors mapped the problem of exhibiting activation effects to finding certain cliques inside joint exclusivity graphs. In this work, we refine the joint exclusivity structure to be an edge-colored exclusivity multigraph. This allows us to draw a novel connection to Ramsey theory, which guarantees the existence of certain monochromatic subgraphs in sufficiently large edge-colored cliques, providing a powerful tool for ruling out E-principle violations. We then exploit this connection, drawing on Ramsey-theoretic results to study violations of the E-principle by multiple copies of the contextual extremal boxes of $n$-cycle scenarios, called $n$-cycle PR boxes, for the usual ($n=4$) PR box we show that the known E-principle violation of $5/4$ is the maximal achievable using two copies, and that this same upper bound applies to two copies of the KCBS ($n = 5$) PR box. We then prove that $n \geq 6$-cycle PR boxes, unlike the extremal boxes of the aforementioned Bell scenarios, do not exhibit activation effects with two or three copies. Finally, for any number of independent copies $k$, we establish a lower bound on $n$ above which $n$-cycle PR boxes do not exhibit activation effects with $k$ copies.</description>

      <title>Reinforced Disentanglers on Random Unitary Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We search for efficient disentanglers on random Clifford circuits of two-qubit gates arranged in a brick-wall pattern, using the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm \cite{schulman2017proximalpolicyoptimizationalgorithms}. Disentanglers are defined as a set of projective measurements inserted between consecutive entangling layers. An efficient disentangler is a set of projective measurements that minimize the averaged von Neumann entropy of the final state with the least number of total projections possible. The problem is naturally amenable to reinforcement learning techniques by taking the binary matrix representing the projective measurements along the circuit as our state, and actions as bit flipping operations on this binary matrix that add or delete measurements at specified locations. We give rewards to our agent dependent on the averaged von Neumann entropy of the final state and the configuration of measurements, such that the agent learns the optimal policy that will take him from the initial state of no measurements to the optimal measurement state that minimizes the entanglement entropy. Our results indicate that the number of measurements required to disentangle a random quantum circuit is drastically less than the numerical results of measurement-induced phase transition papers. Additionally, the reinforcement learning procedure enables us to characterize the pattern of optimal disentanglers, which is not possible in the works of measurement-induced phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Magnetic and phonon-induced effects on the non-Markovian dynamics of a single solid-state defect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electron-phonon interaction is one of the most fundamental mechanisms in condensed matter physics. Phonons can induce memory effects in solid-state platforms when localized electronic states interact with lattice vibrations in non-unitary dynamical maps. In this work, we demonstrate how single-mode and structured phonon environments can give rise to non-Markovian dynamics of an individual negatively charged silicon-vacancy center in diamond. Using trace distance as a quantifier via numerical simulations and theoretical calculations, we identify the physical conditions for emerging and understanding non-Markovian behavior in diverse scenarios. Most importantly, we investigate the influence of magnetic fields (longitudinal and transverse), phonon couplings, Fock states, and temperature to understand how these factors influence memory effects in this solid-state device.</description>

      <title>Towards quantum-centric simulations of extended molecules: sample-based quantum diagonalization enhanced with density matrix embedding theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing ground-state properties of molecules is a promising application for quantum computers operating in concert with classical high-performance computing resources. Quantum embedding methods are a family of algorithms particularly suited to these computational platforms: they combine high-level calculations on active regions of a molecule with low-level calculations on the surrounding environment, thereby avoiding expensive high-level full-molecule calculations and allowing to distribute computational cost across multiple and heterogeneous computing units. Here, we present the first density matrix embedding theory (DMET) simulations performed in combination with the sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) method. We employ the DMET-SQD formalism to compute the ground-state energy of a ring of 18 hydrogen atoms, and the relative energies of the chair, half-chair, twist-boat, and boat conformers of cyclohexane. The full-molecule 41- and 89-qubit simulations are decomposed into 27- and 32-qubit active-region simulations, that we carry out on the ibm_cleveland device, obtaining results in agreement with reference classical methods. Our DMET-SQD calculations mark a tangible progress in the size of active regions that can be accurately tackled by near-term quantum computers, and are an early demonstration of the potential for quantum-centric simulations to accurately treat the electronic structure of large molecules, with the ultimate goal of tackling systems such as peptides and proteins.</description>

      <title>Design fast Rydberg blockade SWAP gates with synthetic modulated driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cold atom qubit platform emerges as an attractive choice for the next stage of quantum computation research, where a special family of synthetic analytical pulses has considerably improved the experimental performance of Controlled-PHASE Rydberg blockade gates in recent studies. The success of Controlled-PHASE Rydberg blockade gates triggers the intriguing question of whether the two-qubit Rydberg blockade gate SWAP gate exists. Via investigating the transition linkage structure, we provide a definitive answer to this question and establish the method of fast SWAP Rydberg blockade gates with synthetic continuously-modulated driving. These gate protocols use careful analysis to properly generate coherent population transfer and phase accumulation of the wave function in the atom-laser interaction process. They can adapt to finite Rydberg blockade strengths and bear considerable resistance some major adverse effects such as laser fluctuations. Further examinations reveal that we can anticipate satisfying performances of the method with currently available experimental techniques in relevant research areas.</description>

      <title>How contextuality and antidistinguishability are related</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contextuality is a key characteristic that separates quantum from classical phenomena and an important tool in understanding the potential advantage of quantum computation. However, when assessing the quantum resources available for quantum information processing, there is no formalism to determine whether a set of states can exhibit contextuality and whether such proofs of contextuality indicate anything about the resourcefulness of that set. Introducing a well-motivated notion of what it means for a set of states to be contextual, we establish a relationship between contextuality and antidistinguishability of sets of states. We go beyond the traditional notions of contextuality and antidistinguishability and treat both properties as resources, demonstrating that the degree of contextuality within a set of states has a direct connection to its level of antidistinguishability. If a set of states is contextual, then it must be weakly antidistinguishable and vice-versa. However, maximal contextuality emerges as a stronger property than traditional antidistinguishability.</description>

      <title>GPU-accelerated Effective Hamiltonian Calculator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective Hamiltonian calculations for large quantum systems can be both analytically intractable and numerically expensive using standard techniques. In this manuscript, we present numerical techniques inspired by Nonperturbative Analytical Diagonalization (NPAD) and the Magnus expansion for the efficient calculation of effective Hamiltonians. While these tools are appropriate for a wide array of applications, we here demonstrate their utility for models that can be realized in circuit-QED settings. Our numerical techniques are available as an open-source Python package, ${\rm qCH_{eff}}$ (https://github.com/NVlabs/qCHeff), which uses the CuPy library for GPU-acceleration. We report up to 15x speedup on GPU over CPU for NPAD, and up to 42x speedup for the Magnus expansion (compared to QuTiP), for large system sizes.</description>

      <title>Virtual entanglement purification via noisy entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed quantum computation (DQC) offers a promising approach for scalable quantum computing, where high-fidelity non-local operations among remote devices are required for universal quantum computation. These operations are typically implemented through teleportation, which consumes high-fidelity entanglement prepared via entanglement purification. However, noisy local operations and classical communication (LOCC) limit the fidelity of purified entanglement, thereby degrading the quality of non-local operations. Here, we present a protocol utilizing virtual operations that purifies noisy entanglement at the level of expectation values. Our protocol offers the following advantages over conventional methods: surpassing the fidelity limit of entanglement purification in the presence of noise in LOCC, requiring fewer sampling shots than circuit knitting, and exhibiting robustness against infidelity fluctuations in shared noisy Bell states unlike probabilistic error cancellation. Our protocol bridges the gap between DQC with entanglement and with circuit knitting, thus providing a flexible way for further scalability in the presence of hardware limitations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores communication over a two-sender, two-receiver classical interference channel, enhanced by the availability of entanglement resources between transmitters. The central contribution are an inner and outer bound on the capacity region for a general interference channel with entangled transmitters. It addresses the persistent challenge of the lack of a general capacity formula, even in the purely classical case, and highlights the striking similarities in achievable rate expressions when assessing quantum advantages. Through a concrete example, it is shown that entanglement can significantly boost performance in certain types of channels.</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy dynamics of non-Gaussian states in free boson systems: random sampling approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a random sampling method for calculating the time evolution of the R\'{e}nyi entanglement entropy after a quantum quench from an insulating state in free boson systems. Because of the non-Gaussian nature of the initial state, calculating the R\'{e}nyi entanglement entropy calls for the exponential cost of computing a matrix permanent. We numerically demonstrate that a simple random sampling method reduces the computational cost of a permanent; for an $N_{\mathrm{s}}\times N_{\mathrm{s}}$ matrix corresponding to $N_{\mathrm{s}}$ sites at half filling, the sampling cost becomes $\mathcal{O}(2^{\alpha N_{\mathrm{s}}})$ with a constant $\alpha\ll 1$, in contrast to the conventional algorithm with the $\mathcal{O}(2^{N_{\mathrm{s}}})$ number of summations requiring the exponential-time cost. Although the computational cost is still exponential, this improvement allows us to obtain the entanglement entropy dynamics in free boson systems for more than $100$ sites. We present several examples of the entanglement entropy dynamics in low-dimensional free boson systems.</description>

      <title>Super-Heisenberg scaling of the quantum Fisher information using spin-motion states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a spin-motion state for high-precision quantum metrology with super-Heisenberg scaling of the parameter estimation uncertainty using a trapped ion system. Such a highly entangled state can be created using the Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonian which describes the interaction between a collective spin system and a single vibrational mode. Our method relies on an adiabatic evolution in which the initial motional squeezing is adiabatically transferred into collective spin squeezing. In the weak squeezing regime, we show that the adiabatic evolution creates a spin-squeezed state, which reduces the quantum projective noise to a sub-shot noise limit. For strong bosonic squeezing we find that the quantum Fisher information follows a super-Heisenberg scaling law $\propto N^{5/2}$ in terms of the number of ions $N$. Furthermore, we discuss the spin squeezing parameter which quantifies the phase sensitivity enhancement in Ramsey spectroscopic measurements and show that it also exhibits a super-Heisenberg scaling with $N$. Our work enables the development of high-precision quantum metrology based on entangled spin-boson states that lead to faster scaling of the parameter estimation uncertainty with the number of spins.</description>

      <title>Infinite series involving special functions obtained using simple one-dimensional quantum mechanical problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we analytically evaluate certain classes of infinite sums involving special functions such as generalized hypergeometric functions, associated Laguerre polynomials, Bessel and Struve functions. The calculations are founded on the basic quantum mechanical principles applied to simple quantum mechanical models, namely half harmonic oscillator and model of a particle trapped inside an infinite potential well. We also show that some classes of functions which are not regular wave functions allow evaluation of additional infinite sums.</description>

      <title>Bayesian and frequentist estimators for the transition frequency of a driven two-level quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formalism of quantum estimation theory with a specific focus on the classical postprocessing of data is applied to a two-level system driven by an external gyrating magnetic field. We employed both Bayesian and frequentist approaches to estimate the unknown transition frequency. In the frequentist approach, we have shown that reducing the distance between the classical and the quantum Fisher information does not necessarily mean that the estimators as functions of the data deliver an estimate with desirable precision. Due to the nonlinearity of the probability mass function of the data on the transition frequency, the minimum variance unbiased estimator may not exist. The maximum likelihood and the maximum a posteriori estimators often result in ambiguous estimates, which in certain cases can be made unambiguous upon changing the parameters of the external field. It is demonstrated that the most promising solution is given by the minimum mean-square error estimator of the Bayesian statistics, which is efficient even for finite data points. In the Bayesian approach, we have considered both informative and noninformative priors, including a uniform prior, Jeffrey's prior, and a Gaussian prior.</description>

      <title>Measuring Butterfly Velocity in the XY Model on Emerging Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The butterfly velocity is commonly used to understand information transport properties in quantum dynamical systems and is related to growth of operators. Here we utilise a quantum teleportation based protocol and Riemannian Trust-Region method to estimate the butterfly velocity via the operator averaged out-of-time-order correlation function. We particularly study the XY model and analytically find the maximum group velocity. We then report a proof-of-concept demonstration of this method to estimate the butterfly velocity on NISQ-devices. The numerical simulation results obtained here are compared with our analytical calculations and found to be in agreement. The quantum algorithmic methods presented here can be more generally utilised to study information transport properties in more complicated lattice models.</description>

      <title>Quantum sensing with duplex qubits of silicon vacancy centers in SiC at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The silicon vacancy center in Silicon Carbide (SiC) provides an optically addressable qubit at room temperature in its spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ electronic state. However, optical spin initialization and readout are less efficient compared to those of spin-1 systems, such as nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, under non-resonant optical excitation. Spin-dependent fluorescence exhibits contrast only between $|m=\pm 3/2\rangle$ and $|m=\pm 1/2\rangle$ states, and optical pumping does not create a population difference between $|+1/2\rangle$ and $|-1/2\rangle$ states. Thus, operating one qubit (e.g., $\left\{|+3/2\rangle, |+1/2\rangle \right\}$ states) leaves the population in the remaining state ($|-1/2\rangle$) unaffected, contributing to background in optical readout. To mitigate this problem, we propose a sensing scheme based on duplex qubit operation in the quartet, using microwave pulses with two resonant frequencies to simultaneously operate $\left\{ |+3/2\rangle, |+1/2\rangle \right\}$ and $\left\{ |-1/2\rangle, |-3/2\rangle \right\}$. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach doubles signal contrast in optical readout and improves sensitivity in AC magnetometry compared to simplex operation.</description>

      <title>Trading Datarate for Latency in Quantum Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low latency and high data rate performance are essential in wireless communication systems. This paper explores trade-offs between latency and data rates for optical wireless communication. We introduce a latency-optimized model utilizing compound codes as one corner case and a data rate-optimized model employing channel estimation via pilot signals and feedback before data transmission. Trade-offs between the two extremes are displayed. Most importantly, we detail operating points that can only be reached when the receiver side of the link employs optimal quantum measurement strategies. Furthermore, we propose an IoT application in a robot factory as an example scenario. Our findings reveal a trade-off between latency and data rate driven by two basic algorithms: compound codes reduce latency at the cost of data rates, while channel estimation enhances data rates at the cost of latency.</description>

      <title>Private Communication over a Bosonic Compound Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is a common belief that quantum key distribution systems are the one and only information-theoretically secure physical layer security protocol that enables secure data transmission without a need for the legitimate parties to have any channel knowledge. It is also known that this high security profile results in severe rate restrictions for the parties utilizing the quantum key distribution systems. This observation raises the question of whether quantifying the level of ignorance of the legitimate parties with regard to the channel parameters may enable us to navigate the large gray zone between insecure but highly performant systems on the one side and perfectly secure but highly non-performant systems on the other side. Indeed, by proving a capacity formula for the bosonic compound wiretap channel using the binary phase shift keying alphabet, we are able to quantify in this work exactly how channel uncertainty penalizes data transmission rates.</description>

      <title>Quantum-assisted Stacking Sequence Retrieval and Laminated Composite Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We, the QAIMS lab lab at the Aerospace Faculty of TU Delft, participated as finalists in the Airbus/BMW Quantum Computing Challenge 2024. Stacking sequence retrieval, a complex combinatorial task within a bi-level optimization framework, is crucial for designing laminated composites that meet aerospace requirements for weight, strength, and stiffness. This document presents the scientifically relevant sections of our submission, which builds on our prior research on applying quantum computation to this challenging design problem. For the competition, we expanded our previous work in several significant ways. First, we incorporated a full set of manufacturing constraints into our algorithmic framework, including those previously established theoretically but not yet demonstrated, thereby aligning our approach more closely with real-world manufacturing demands. We implemented the F-VQE algorithm, which enhances the probability shaping of optimal solutions, improving on simpler variational quantum algorithms. Our approach also demonstrates flexibility by accommodating diverse objectives as well as finer ply-angle increments alongside the previously demonstrated conventional ply angles. Scalability was tested using the DMRG algorithm, which, despite limitations in entanglement representation, enabled simulations with up to 200 plies. Results were directly compared to conventional stacking sequence retrieval algorithms with DMRG showing high competitiveness. Given DMRG's limited entanglement capabilities, it serves as a conservative baseline, suggesting potential for even greater performance on fully realized quantum systems. This document serves to make our competition results publicly available as we prepare a formal publication on these findings and their implications for aerospace materials design optimization.</description>

      <title>Local Clustering Decoder: a fast and adaptive hardware decoder for the surface code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To avoid prohibitive overheads in performing fault-tolerant quantum computation, the decoding problem needs to be solved accurately and at speeds sufficient for fast feedback. Existing decoding systems fail to satisfy both of these requirements, meaning they either slow down the quantum computer or reduce the number of operations that can be performed before the quantum information is corrupted. We introduce the Local Clustering Decoder as a solution that simultaneously achieves the accuracy and speed requirements of a real-time decoding system. Our decoder is implemented on FPGAs and exploits hardware parallelism to keep pace with the fastest qubit types. Further, it comprises an adaptivity engine that allows the decoder to update itself in real-time in response to control signals, such as heralded leakage events. Under a realistic circuit-level noise model where leakage is a dominant error source, our decoder enables one million error-free quantum operations with 4x fewer physical qubits when compared to standard non-adaptive decoding. This is achieved whilst decoding in under 1 us per round with modest FPGA resources, demonstrating that high-accuracy real-time decoding is possible, and reducing the qubit counts required for large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Quantum Correlations and Entanglement Generation in Electron-Molecule Inelastic Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics and processes involved in particle-molecule scattering, including nuclear dynamics, is described and analyzed by different quantum information quantities along the different stages of the scattering. The main process studied and characterized with the information quantities is the interatomic coulombic electronic capture (ICEC), an inelastic process that can lead to dissociation of the target molecule. The analysis is focused in a one-dimensional transversely confined $\text{NeHe}$ molecule model used to simulate the scattering between an electron $\text{e}^-$(particle) and a $\text{NeHe}^+$ ion (molecule). The time-independent Schr\"odinger equation (TISE) is solved using the Finite Element Method (FEM) with a self-developed Julia package FEMTISE to compute potential energy curves (PECs) and the parameters of the interactions between particles. The time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation (TDSE) is solved using the Multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) algorithm. The time dependent electronic and nuclear probability densities are calculated for different electron incoming energies, evidencing elastic and inelastic processes that can be correlated to changes in von Neumann entropy, conditional mutual information and Shannon entropies. The expectation value of the position of the particles, as well as their standard deviations, are analyzed along the whole dynamics and related to the entanglement during the collision and after the process is over, hence evidencing the dynamics of entanglement generation. It is shown that the correlations generated in the collision is partially retained only when the inelastic process is active.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superinductors have become a crucial component in the superconducting circuit toolbox, playing a key role in the development of more robust qubits. Enhancing the performance of these devices can be achieved by suspending the superinductors from the substrate, thereby reducing stray capacitance. Here, we present a fabrication framework for constructing superconducting circuits with suspended superinductors in planar architectures. To validate the effectiveness of this process, we systematically characterize both resonators and qubits with suspended arrays of Josephson junctions, ultimately confirming the high quality of the superinductive elements. In addition, this process is broadly compatible with other types of superinductors and circuit designs. Our results not only pave the way for scalable novel superconducting architectures but also provide the primitive for future investigation of loss mechanisms associated with the device substrate.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity-Driven Morphing and Control of Topological Modes in Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) and nonlinearity can each delocalize topological zero modes (TZMs) from the boundary. To overcome the challenge of precise parameter tuning imposed by the NHSE-induced delocalization and to enhance the capacity of TZMs limited by nonlinearity-induced partial delocalization in Hermitian systems, we develop non-Hermitian nonlinear topological interface models. This model consists of both Hermitian and non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chains, incorporating nonreciprocal hopping and nonlinearity. When the nonlinearity is applied to both chains, the TZM becomes fully delocalized, extending across the entire lattice of two chains without the need for precise parameter tuning. By adjusting nonlinear coefficients in both chains, the wavefunction profile and plateaus across the entire lattice can be effectively controlled and customized through inherent configuration and intensity of the nonlinearity. Furthermore, the spectral localizer is utilized to demonstrate the topological protection of these extended non-Hermitian TZMs, confirming their robustness against disorder. Their dynamical stability under external pumping is also validated. Our findings provide a deeper insight into how nonlinearity and NHSE affect the behavior of topological modes, opening new possibilities for enhancing their capacity and performance in compact devices.</description>

      <title>How to Build a Quantum Supercomputer: Scaling Challenges and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the span of four decades, quantum computation has evolved from an intellectual curiosity to a potentially realizable technology. Today, small-scale demonstrations have become possible for quantum algorithmic primitives on hundreds of physical qubits and proof-of-principle error-correction on a single logical qubit. Nevertheless, despite significant progress and excitement, the path toward a full-stack scalable technology is largely unknown. There are significant outstanding quantum hardware, fabrication, software architecture, and algorithmic challenges that are either unresolved or overlooked. These issues could seriously undermine the arrival of utility-scale quantum computers for the foreseeable future. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of these scaling challenges. We show how the road to scaling could be paved by adopting existing semiconductor technology to build much higher-quality qubits, employing system engineering approaches, and performing distributed quantum computation within heterogeneous high-performance computing infrastructures. These opportunities for research and development could unlock certain promising applications, in particular, efficient quantum simulation/learning of quantum data generated by natural or engineered quantum systems. To estimate the true cost of such promises, we provide a detailed resource and sensitivity analysis for classically hard quantum chemistry calculations on surface-code error-corrected quantum computers given current, target, and desired hardware specifications based on superconducting qubits, accounting for a realistic distribution of errors. Furthermore, we argue that, to tackle industry-scale classical optimization and machine learning problems in a cost-effective manner, distributed quantum-assisted probabilistic computing with custom-designed accelerators should be considered as a complementary path toward scalability.</description>

      <title>Unlocking multiphoton emission from a single-photon source through mean-field engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-photon emission from a two-level system offers promising perspectives for the development of quantum technologies, where multiphotons are generally regarded as accidental, undesired and should be suppressed. In quantum mechanics, however, multiphoton emission can turn out to be even more fundamental and interesting than the single-photon emission, since in a coherently driven system, the multiphoton suppression arises from quantum interferences between virtual multiphoton fluctuations and the mean field in a Poisson superposition of all number states. Here, we demonstrate how one can control the multiphoton dynamics of a two-level system by disrupting these quantum interferences through a precise and independent homodyne control of the mean field. We show that, counterintuitively, quantum fluctuations always play a major qualitative role, even and in fact especially, when their quantitative contribution is vanishing as compared to that of the mean field. Our findings provide new insights into the paradoxical character of quantum mechanics and open pathways for mean-field engineering as a tool for precision multiphoton control.</description>

      <title>Measuring Hall voltage and Hall resistance in an atom-based quantum simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hall effect has a paramount role in a wide range of disciplines, from applied sciences to the fundamental exploration of novel topological phases of matter. In the solid state, this effect describes the emergence of a voltage drop perpendicular to the current flow in the presence of a magnetic field, leading to a transverse Hall resistance. Despite its fundamental nature, a full understanding and control of the Hall effect in interacting quantum systems is still lacking. This has led to the development of quantum simulators based on neutral atoms, where strongly correlated and universal manifestations of the Hall effect were recently unveiled. However, a direct measurement of the Hall voltage and of the Hall resistance in those systems was not achieved so far. Here, we demonstrate a technique for the measurement of the Hall voltage in a neutral-atom-based quantum simulator. From that we provide the first direct measurement of the Hall resistance in a non-electron-based system and study its dependence on the carrier density, along with theoretical analyses. Our work closes a major gap between analog quantum simulations and measurements performed in real solid-state systems, providing a key tool for the exploration of the Hall effect in highly tunable and strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>A Strategy for Proving the Strong Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis : Chaotic Systems and Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) provides a sufficient condition for thermalization and equilibration. Although it is expected to hold in a wide class of highly chaotic theories, there are only a few analytic examples demonstrating the strong ETH in special cases, often through methods related to integrability. In this paper, we explore sufficient conditions for the strong ETH that may apply to a broad range of chaotic theories. These conditions are expressed as inequalities involving the long-time averages of real-time thermal correlators. Specifically, as an illustration, we consider simple toy examples which satisfy these conditions under certain technical assumptions. This toy models have same properties as holographic theories at least in the perturbation in large $N$. We give a few comments for more realistic holographic models.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Simulation of QCD Jets on the Light Front</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quark and gluon jets provide one of the best ways to probe the matter produced in ultrarelativistic high-energy collisions, from cold nuclear matter to hot quark-gluon plasma. In this work, we propose a unified framework for efficient quantum simulation of many-body dynamics using the (3+1)-dimensional QCD Hamiltonian on the light front, particularly suited for studying the scattering of quark and gluon jets on nuclear matter in heavy-ion collisions. We describe scalable methods for mapping physical degrees of freedom onto qubits and for simulating in-medium jet evolution. We then validate our framework by implementing an algorithm that directly maps second-quantized Fock states onto qubits and uses Trotterized simulation for simulating time dynamics. Using a classical emulator, we investigate the evolution of quark and gluon jets with up to three particles in Fock states, extending prior studies. These calculations enable the study of key observables, including jet momentum broadening, particle production, and parton distribution functions.</description>

      <title>Entanglement asymmetry and symmetry defects in boundary conformal field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A state in a quantum system with a given global symmetry, $G$, can be sensitive to the presence of boundaries, which may either preserve or break this symmetry. In this work, we investigate how conformal invariant boundary conditions influence the $G-$symmetry breaking through the lens of the entanglement asymmetry, a quantifier of the "distance" between a symmetry-broken state and its symmetrized counterpart. By leveraging 2D boundary conformal field theory (BCFT), we investigate the symmetry breaking for both finite and compact Lie groups. Beyond the leading order term, we also compute the subleading corrections in the subsystem size, highlighting their dependence on the symmetry group $G$ and the BCFT operator content. We further explore the entanglement asymmetry following a global quantum quench, where a symmetry-broken state evolves under a symmetry-restoring Hamiltonian. In this dynamical setting, we compute the entanglement asymmetry by extending the method of images to a BCFT with non-local objects such as invertible symmetry defects.</description>

      <title>Entangling color centers via magnon-antimagnon pair creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present how entanglement between a spatially separated pair of color centers can be created by letting them weakly interact with the quantum fluctuations of a nonequilibrium magnetic environment. To this end, we consider two coupled ferromagnets, one in the ground state and one in an inverted state with respect to an applied magnetic field. The resulting energetic instability leads to a quantum spin current in the vacuum state that is sustained by the creation of magnon-antimagnon pairs at the interface. We show that these quantum fluctuations imprint a steady-state entanglement onto the two dipole-coupled color centers through nonlocal dissipation. We derive conditions for establishing a maximally entangled Bell state. This entanglement is absent in thermal equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Distribution Function for $n \ge g$ Quantum Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new quantum mechanical distribution function $n^I(\varepsilon)$, is derived for the condition $n \ge g$, where in contrast to the exclusion principle $n \le g$ for fermions, each energy state must be populated by at least one particle. Although the particles share many features with bosons, the anomalous behavior of $n^I(\varepsilon)$ precludes Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) due to the required occupancy of the excited states, which creates a permanently pressurized background at $T=0$, similar to the degeneracy pressure of fermions. An exhaustive classification scheme is presented for both distinguishable and indistinguishable, particles and energy levels based on Richard Stanley's twelvefold way in combinatorics.</description>

      <title>Quantum similarity learning for anomaly detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomaly detection is a vital technique for exploring signatures of new physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The vast number of collisions generated by the LHC demands sophisticated deep learning techniques. Similarity learning, a self-supervised machine learning, detects anomalous signals by estimating their similarity to background events. In this paper, we explore the potential of quantum computers for anomaly detection through similarity learning, leveraging the power of quantum computing to enhance the known similarity learning method. In the realm of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, we employ a hybrid classical-quantum network to search for heavy scalar resonances in the di-Higgs production channel. In the absence of quantum noise, the hybrid network demonstrates improvement over the known similarity learning method. Moreover, we employ a clustering algorithm to reduce measurement noise from limited shot counts, resulting in $9\%$ improvement in the hybrid network performance. Our analysis highlights the applicability of quantum algorithms for LHC data analysis, where improvements are anticipated with the advent of fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Post-selection shifts the transition frequency of helium in an atomic beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Post-selecting output states in measurements can effectively amplify weak signals and improve precision. However, post-selection effects may also introduce unintended biases in precision measurements. Here, we investigate the influence of post-selection in the precision spectroscopy of the $2^3S - 2^3P$ transition of helium ($^4$He) using an atomic beam. We directly observe that post-selection based on atomic positions causes a shift in the measured transition frequency, amounting to approximately -55 kHz. After accounting for this post-selection shift, we obtain a corrected frequency of $276,764,094,712.45 \pm 0.86$ kHz for the $2^3S_1 - 2^3P_0$ transition. Combining this result with existing data for $^3$He, we derive a new value for the difference in squared nuclear charge radii, $\delta r^2 [r_{h}^{2} - r_{\alpha}^{2}] = 1.0733 \pm 0.0021$ fm$^2$. This value shows a $2.8\sigma$ deviation from measurements of muonic helium ions, potentially pointing to new physics that challenges lepton universality in quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As quantum computing continues to advance, its ability to compromise widely used cryptographic systems projects a significant challenge to modern cybersecurity. This paper outlines a strategic roadmap for industries to anticipate and mitigate the risks posed by quantum attacks. Our study explores the development of a quantum-resistant cryptographic solutioning framework for the industry, offering a practical and strategic approach to mitigating quantum attacks. We, here, propose a novel strategic framework, coined name STL-QCRYPTO, outlines tailored, industry-specific methodologies to implement quantum-safe security systems, ensuring long-term protection against the disruptive potential of quantum computing. The following fourteen high-risk sectors: Financial Services, Banking, Healthcare, Critical Infrastructure, Government &amp; Defence, E-commerce, Energy &amp; Utilities, Automotive &amp; Transportation, Cloud Computing &amp; Data Storage, Insurance, Internet &amp; Telecommunications, Blockchain Applications, Metaverse Applications, and Multiagent AI Systems - are critically assessed for their vulnerability to quantum threats. The evaluation emphasizes practical approaches for the deployment of quantum-safe security systems to safeguard these industries against emerging quantum-enabled cyber risks. Additionally, the paper addresses the technical, operational, and regulatory hurdles associated with adopting quantum-resistant technologies. By presenting a structured timeline and actionable recommendations, this roadmap with proposed framework prepares industries with the essential strategy to safeguard their potential security threats in the quantum computing era.</description>

      <title>Measurement and feed-forward correction of the fast phase noise of lasers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lasers are the workhorse of quantum engineering in the atomic-molecular-optic community. However, phase noise of the laser, which can be especially large in popular semiconductor-based lasers, can limit fidelity of operation. Here, we present a fully-fiberized instrument detecting and correcting the fast, sub-microsecond, phase fluctuations of lasers. We demonstrate a measurement noise floor of less than 0.1 Hz$^{2}$/Hz, and a noise suppression of more than 20 dB for Fourier frequencies in the 1 to 10 MHz region (reaching up to 30 dB at 3 MHz), where noise is critical for Rydberg-based quantum gates. Finally, we observe the improvement offered by this fast phase noise eater on a Raman transition driven by two such stabilized lasers. These measurement and correction techniques are important tools for high-fidelity manipulation of the excited electronic states of atoms and molecules.</description>

      <title>Quadratic versus Polynomial Unconstrained Binary Models for Quantum Optimization illustrated on Railway Timetabling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is one of the most short-term promising quantum-classical algorithm to solve unconstrained combinatorial optimization problems. It alternates between the execution of a parametrized quantum circuit and a classical optimization. There are numerous levers for enhancing QAOA performances, such as the choice of quantum circuit meta-parameters or the choice of the classical optimizer. In this paper, we stress on the importance of the input problem formulation by illustrating it with the resolution of an industrial railway timetabling problem. Specifically, we present a generic method to reformulate any polynomial problem into a Polynomial Unconstrained Binary Optimization (PUBO) problem, with a specific formulation imposing penalty terms to take binary values when the constraints are linear. We also provide a generic reformulation into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. We then conduct a numerical comparison between the PUBO with binary penalty terms and the QUBO formulations proposed on a railway timetabling problem solved with QAOA. Our results illustrate that the PUBO reformulation outperforms the QUBO one for the problem at hand.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg dressing traditionally refers to a technique where interactions between cold atoms are imprinted through the far off-resonant continuous-wave excitation of high-lying Rydberg states. Dipolar interactions between these electronic states are then translated into effective interactions among ground state atoms. Motivated by recent experiments, we investigate two dressing protocols, in which Rydberg atoms are resonantly excited in a stroboscopic fashion. The first one is non-adiabatic, meaning Rydberg states are excited by fast pulses. In this case, mechanical forces among Rydberg atoms result in electron-motion coupling, which generates effective multi-body interactions. In the second, adiabatic protocol, Rydberg states are excited by smoothly varying laser pulses. We show that also in this protocol substantial multi-body interactions emerge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate fermionic versions, for any number of spatial dimensions, of the van der Waals and Casimir-Polder interactions, and study their properties. In both cases, the systems we introduce contain localized `atoms': two-level systems, coupled to a vacuum Dirac field. This Dirac field plays here a role akin to the electromagnetic field in the van der Waals case. In this context, bag-model conditions for the Dirac field serve as the analog of the 'mirror' in the Casimir-Polder effect. We found that, in this case, the resulting interaction is repulsive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the behavior of the entanglement asymmetry in the ground state of a (1+1)-dimensional conformal field theory with a boundary condition that explicitly breaks a bulk symmetry. Our focus is on the asymmetry of a subsystem $A$ originating from the symmetry-breaking boundary and extending into a semi-infinite bulk. By employing the twist field formalism, we derive a universal expression for the asymmetry, showing that the asymptotic behavior for large subsystems is approached algebraically, with an exponent which is twice the conformal dimension of a boundary condition-changing operator. As a secondary result, we also establish a similar asymptotic behavior for the string order parameter. Our exact analytical findings are validated through numerical simulations in the critical Ising and 3-state Potts models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the onset of Anderson localization in three-dimensional systems with structural disorder in the form of lattice irregularities and in the absence of any on-site disordered potential. Analyzing two models with distinct types of lattice regularities, we show that the Anderson localization transition occurs when the strength of the structural disorder is smoothly increased. Performing finite-size scaling analysis of the results, we show that the transition belongs to the same universality class as regular Anderson localization induced by onsite disorder. Our work identifies a new class of structurally disordered lattice models in which destructive interference of matter waves may inhibit transport and lead to a transition between metallic and localized phases.</description>

      <title>Oxidation Kinetics of Superconducting Niobium and a-Tantalum in Atmosphere at Short and Intermediate Time Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of superconducting niobium and tantalum into superconducting quantum devices has been increasingly explored over the past few years. Recent developments have shown that two-level-systems (TLS) in the surface oxides of these superconducting films are a leading source of decoherence in quantum circuits, and understanding the surface oxidation kinetics of these materials is key to enabling scalability of these technologies. We analyze the nature of atmospheric oxidation of both niobium and a-tantalum surfaces at time scales relevant to fabrication, from sub-minute to two-week atmospheric exposure, employing a combination of x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy to monitor the growth of the surface oxides. The oxidation kinetics are modeled according to the Cabrera-Mott model of surface oxidation, and the model growth parameters are reported for both films. Our results indicate that niobium surface oxidation follows a consistent regime of inverse logarithmic growth for the entire time scale of the study, whereas a-Ta surface oxidation shows a clear transition between two inverse logarithmic growth regimes at time t = 1 hour, associated with the re-coordination of the surface oxide as determined by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. Our findings provide a more complete understanding of the differences in atmospheric surface oxidation between Nb and a-Ta, particularly at short time scales, paving the way for the development of more robust fabrication control for quantum computing architectures.</description>

Abstract: The nitrogen vacancy centre in diamond is a versatile color center widely used for magnetometry, quantum computing, and quantum communications. In this article, we develop a new magnetometer using an ensemble of nitrogen vacancy centers and the Faraday effect. The sensitivity of our magnetometer is $300~nT/ \sqrt{Hz}$. We argue that by using an optical cavity and a high purity diamond, sensitivities in the femtotesla level can be achieved.</description>

      <title>Secure multi-party quantum computation protocol for quantum circuits: the exploitation of triply-even quantum error-correcting codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.04871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Secure multi-party quantum computation (MPQC) protocol is a cryptographic primitive allowing error-free distributed quantum computation to a group of $n$ mutually distrustful quantum nodes even when some quantum nodes disobey the instructions of the protocol. Here we suggest a modified MPQC protocol that adopts unconventional quantum error-correcting codes and as a consequence reduces the number of qubits required for the protocol execution. In particular, the replacement of the self-dual Calderbank-Shor-Steane quantum error-correcting codes with triply-even ones permits us to avoid the previously indispensable but resource-intensive procedure of the ``magic'' state verification. Besides, since every extra qubit reduces the credibility of physical devices, our suggestion makes the MPQC protocol more accessible for the near-future technology by reducing the number of necessary qubits per quantum node from $n^2 + \Theta(r)n$, where $r$ is the security parameter, to $n^2 + 3n$.</description>

      <title>Characterising Determinism in MBQCs involving Pauli Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.09368v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new characterisation of determinism in Measurement-Based Quantum Computing. MBQC consists in performing local measurements over a large entangled state represented by a graph. The ability to perform an overall deterministic computation requires a correction strategy because of the non-determinism of each measurement. The existence of such correction strategy depends on the underlying open graph, which is a description of the resource state together with the basis of the performed measurements. GFlow is a well-known graphical characterisation of robust determinism in MBQC when every measurement is performed in some specific planes of the Bloch sphere. While Pauli measurements are ubiquitous in MBQC, GFlow fails to be necessary for determinism when a measurement-based quantum computation involves Pauli measurements. As a consequence, Pauli Flow was designed as a generalisation of GFlow to handle MBQC with Pauli measurements: Pauli flow guarantees robust determinism, however it has been shown more recently that it fails to be a necessary condition. Our contribution is twofold. First, we demonstrate that Pauli flow is actually necessary for robust determinism in a weaker sense: given an open graph, i.e. a resource state, a deterministic computation can be driven if only if it has a Pauli flow. However, the Pauli flows do not reflect all the possible correction strategies over a particular resource state, and properties like measurement order or computational depth are not necessarily reflected by a Pauli flow. Thus, to characterise determinism in full generality, we introduce a further extension called Shadow Pauli Flow that we prove necessary and sufficient for robust determinism: An MBQC is robustly deterministic if and only if its correction strategy is consistent with a Shadow Pauli flow. Furthermore, we show that Shadow Pauli flow can be computed in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Trustworthy Computing using Untrusted Cloud-Based Quantum Hardware</title>

Abstract: Security and reliability are primary concerns in any computing paradigm including quantum computing. Currently users can access quantum computers through a cloud based platform where they can run their programs on a suite of quantum computers. As the quantum computing ecosystem grows in popularity and utility it is reasonable to expect that more companies including untrusted or less trusted or unreliable vendors will begin offering quantum computers as hardware as a service at varied price or performance points. Since computing time on quantum hardware is expensive and the access queue could be long the users will be motivated to use the cheaper and readily available but unreliable or less trusted hardware. The less trusted vendors can tamper with the results providing a suboptimal solution to the user. In this paper we model this adversarial tampering and simulate its impact on a number of pure quantum and hybrid quantum classical workloads. To guarantee trustworthy computing for a mixture of trusted and untrusted hardware we propose distributing the total number of shots equally among the various hardware options. On average we note approx 30X and approx 1.5X improvement across the pure quantum workloads and a maximum improvement of approx 5X for hybrid classical algorithm in the chosen quality metrics. We also propose an intelligent run adaptive split heuristic leveraging temporal variation in hardware quality to users advantage allowing them to identify tampered or untrustworthy hardware at runtime and allocate more number of shots to the reliable hardware which results in a maximum improvement of approx 190X and approx 9X across the pure quantum workloads and an improvement of up to approx 2.5X for hybrid classical algorithm.</description>

      <title>Proposal of a quantum version of active particles via a nonunitary quantum walk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15319v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main aim of the present paper is to define an active particle in a quantum framework as a minimal model of quantum active matter and investigate the differences and similarities of quantum and classical active matter. Although the field of active matter has been expanding, most research has been conducted on classical systems. Here, we propose a truly deterministic quantum active-particle model with a nonunitary quantum walk as the minimal model of quantum active matter. We aim to reproduce results obtained previously with classical active Brownian particles; that is, a Brownian particle, with finite energy take-up, becomes active and climbs up a potential wall. We realize such a system with nonunitary quantum walks. We introduce new internal states, the ground state and the excited state, and a new nonunitary operator $N(g)$ for an asymmetric transition between the two states. The non-Hermiticity parameter $g$ promotes the transition to the excited state; hence, the particle takes up energy from the environment. For our quantum active particle, we successfully observe that the movement of the quantum walker becomes more active in a nontrivial manner as we increase the non-Hermiticity parameter $g$, which is similar to the classical active Brownian particle. We also observe three unique features of quantum walks, namely, ballistic propagation of peaks in one dimension, the walker staying on the constant energy plane in two dimensions, and oscillations originating from the resonant transition between the ground state and the excited state both in one and two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Efficient Pauli channel estimation with logarithmic quantum memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14326v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we revisit one of the prototypical tasks for characterizing the structure of noise in quantum devices: estimating every eigenvalue of an $n$-qubit Pauli noise channel to error $\epsilon$. Prior work [14] proved no-go theorems for this task in the practical regime where one has a limited amount of quantum memory, e.g. any protocol with $\le 0.99n$ ancilla qubits of quantum memory must make exponentially many measurements, provided it is non-concatenating. Such protocols can only interact with the channel by repeatedly preparing a state, passing it through the channel, and measuring immediately afterward.
  This left open a natural question: does the lower bound hold even for general protocols, i.e. ones which chain together many queries to the channel, interleaved with arbitrary data-processing channels, before measuring? Surprisingly, in this work we show the opposite: there is a protocol that can estimate the eigenvalues of a Pauli channel to error $\epsilon$ using only $O(\log n/\epsilon^2)$ ancilla and $\tilde{O}(n^2/\epsilon^2)$ measurements. In contrast, we show that any protocol with zero ancilla, even a concatenating one, must make $\Omega(2^n/\epsilon^2)$ measurements, which is tight.
  Our results imply, to our knowledge, the first quantum learning task where logarithmically many qubits of quantum memory suffice for an exponential statistical advantage. Our protocol can be naturally extended to a protocol that learns the eigenvalues of Pauli terms within any subset $A$ of a Pauli channel with $O(\log\log(|A|)/\epsilon^2)$ ancilla and $\tilde{O}(n^2/\epsilon^2)$ measurements.</description>

Abstract: Efficient preparation of arbitrary entangled quantum states is crucial for quantum computation. This is particularly important for noisy intermediate scale quantum simulators relying on variational hybrid quantum-classical algorithms. To that end, we propose symmetry-conserving modified quantum approximate optimization algorithm~(SCom-QAOA) circuits. The depths of these circuits depend not only on the desired fidelity to the target state, but also on the amount of entanglement the state contains. The parameters of the SCom-QAOA circuits are optimized using the quantum natural gradient method based on the Fubini-Study metric. The SCom-QAOA circuit transforms an unentangled state into a ground state of a gapped one-dimensional Hamiltonian with a circuit-depth that depends not on the system-size, but rather on the finite correlation length. In contrast, the circuit depth grows proportionally to the system size for preparing low-lying states of critical one-dimensional systems. Even in the latter case, SCom-QAOA circuits with depth less than the system-size were sufficient to generate states with fidelity in excess of 99\%, which is relevant for near-term applications. The proposed scheme enlarges the set of the initial states accessible for variational quantum algorithms and widens the scope of investigation of non-equilibrium phenomena in quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Atomique: A Quantum Compiler for Reconfigurable Neutral Atom Arrays</title>

Abstract: The neutral atom array has gained prominence in quantum computing for its scalability and operation fidelity. Previous works focus on fixed atom arrays (FAAs) that require extensive SWAP operations for long-range interactions. This work explores a novel architecture reconfigurable atom arrays (RAAs), also known as field programmable qubit arrays (FPQAs), which allows for coherent atom movements during circuit execution under some constraints. Such atom movements, which are unique to this architecture, could reduce the cost of long-range interactions significantly if the atom movements could be scheduled strategically.
  In this work, we introduce Atomique, a compilation framework designed for qubit mapping, atom movement, and gate scheduling for RAA. Atomique contains a qubit-array mapper to decide the coarse-grained mapping of the qubits to arrays, leveraging MAX k-Cut on a constructed gate frequency graph to minimize SWAP overhead. Subsequently, a qubit-atom mapper determines the fine-grained mapping of qubits to specific atoms in the array and considers load balance to prevent hardware constraint violations. We further propose a router that identifies parallel gates, schedules them simultaneously, and reduces depth. We evaluate Atomique across 20+ diverse benchmarks, including generic circuits (arbitrary, QASMBench, SupermarQ), quantum simulation, and QAOA circuits. Atomique consistently outperforms IBM Superconducting, FAA with long-range gates, and FAA with rectangular and triangular topologies, achieving significant reductions in depth and the number of two-qubit gates.</description>

      <title>Floquet Flux Attachment in Cold Atomic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flux attachment provides a powerful conceptual framework for understanding certain forms of topological order, including most notably the fractional quantum Hall effect. Despite its ubiquitous use as a theoretical tool, directly realizing flux attachment in a microscopic setting remains an open challenge. Here, we propose a simple approach to realizing flux attachment in a periodically-driven (Floquet) system of either spins or hard-core bosons. We demonstrate that such a system naturally realizes correlated hopping interactions and provides a sharp connection between such interactions and flux attachment. Starting with a simple, nearest-neighbor, free boson model, we find evidence -- from both a coupled wire analysis and large-scale density matrix renormalization group simulations -- that Floquet flux attachment stabilizes the bosonic integer quantum Hall state at $1/4$ filling (on a square lattice), and the Halperin-221 fractional quantum Hall state at $1/6$ filling (on a honeycomb lattice). At $1/2$ filling on the square lattice, time-reversal symmetry is instead spontaneously broken and bosonic integer quantum Hall states with opposite Hall conductances are degenerate. Finally, we propose an optical-lattice-based implementation of our model on a square lattice and discuss prospects for adiabatic preparation as well as effects of Floquet heating.</description>

Abstract: Quantum networks connect and supply a large number of nodes with multi-party quantum resources for secure communication, networked quantum computing and distributed sensing. As these networks grow in size, certification tools will be required to answer questions regarding their properties. In this work we demonstrate a general method to guarantee that certain correlations cannot be generated in a given quantum network. We apply quantum inflation methods to data obtained in quantum group encryption experiments, guaranteeing the impossibility of producing the observed results in networks with fewer optical elements. Our results pave the way for scalable methods of obtaining device-independent guarantees on the network structure underlying multipartite quantum protocols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we introduce a novel method for investigating dissipation (gain) and thermalization in an open quantum system. In this method, the quantum system is coupled linearly with a copy of itself or with another system described by a finite number of bosonic operators. The time-dependent coupling functions play a fundamental role in this scheme. To demonstrate the efficiency and significance of the method, we apply it to some ubiquitous open quantum systems. Firstly, we investigate a quantum oscillator in the presence of a thermal bath at the inverse temperature $\beta$, obtaining the reduced density matrix, the Husimi distribution function, and the quantum heat distribution function accurately. The results are consistent with existing literature by appropriate choices for the time-dependent coupling function. To illustrate the generalizability of this method to systems interacting with multiple thermal baths, we study the interaction of a quantum oscillator with two thermal baths at different temperatures and obtain compatible results. Subsequently, we analyze a two-level atom with energy or phase dissipation and derive the spontaneous emission and the pure dephasing processes consistently using the new method. Finally, we investigate the Markovianity in a dissipative two-level system.</description>

      <title>Optimal tradeoffs for estimating Pauli observables</title>

Abstract: We revisit the problem of Pauli shadow tomography: given copies of an unknown $n$-qubit quantum state $\rho$, estimate $\text{tr}(P\rho)$ for some set of Pauli operators $P$ to within additive error $\epsilon$. This has been a popular testbed for exploring the advantage of protocols with quantum memory over those without: with enough memory to measure two copies at a time, one can use Bell sampling to estimate $|\text{tr}(P\rho)|$ for all $P$ using $O(n/\epsilon^4)$ copies, but with $k\le n$ qubits of memory, $\Omega(2^{(n-k)/3})$ copies are needed.
  These results leave open several natural questions. How does this picture change in the physically relevant setting where one only needs to estimate a certain subset of Paulis? What is the optimal dependence on $\epsilon$? What is the optimal tradeoff between quantum memory and sample complexity?
  We answer all of these questions. For any subset $A$ of Paulis and any family of measurement strategies, we completely characterize the optimal sample complexity, up to $\log |A|$ factors. We show any protocol that makes $\text{poly}(n)$-copy measurements must make $\Omega(1/\epsilon^4)$ measurements. For any protocol that makes $\text{poly}(n)$-copy measurements and only has $k &lt; n$ qubits of memory, we show that $\widetilde{\Theta}(\min\{2^n/\epsilon^2, 2^{n-k}/\epsilon^4\})$ copies are necessary and sufficient.
  The protocols we propose can also estimate the actual values $\text{tr}(P\rho)$, rather than just their absolute values as in prior work. Additionally, as a byproduct of our techniques, we establish tight bounds for the task of purity testing and show that it exhibits an intriguing phase transition not present in the memory-sample tradeoff for Pauli shadow tomography.</description>

Abstract: Nonreciprocal microwave routing plays a crucial role for measuring quantum circuits, and allows for realizing cascaded quantum systems for generating and stabilizing entanglement between non-interacting qubits. The most commonly used tools for implementing directionality are ferrite-based circulators. These devices are versatile, but suffer from excess loss, a large footprint, and fixed directionality. For utilizing nonreciprocity in scalable quantum circuits it is desirable to develop efficient integration of low-loss and in-situ controllable directional elements. Here, we report the design and experimental realization of a minimal controllable directional interface that can be directly coupled to superconducting qubits. In the presented device, nonreciprocity is realized through a combination of interference and phase-controlled parametric pumping. We have achieved a maximum directionality of around 30\,dB, and the performance of the device is predicted quantitatively from independent calibration measurements. Using the excellent agreement of model and experiment, we predict that the circuit will be useable as a chiral qubit interface with inefficiencies at the one-percent level or below. Our work offers a promising route for realizing high-fidelity signal routing and entanglement generation in all-to-all connected microwave quantum networks, and provides a path for isolator-free qubit readout schemes.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer bootstrapping: A recipe for efficient agnostic tomography and magic estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the task of agnostic tomography: given copies of an unknown $n$-qubit state $\rho$ which has fidelity $\tau$ with some state in a given class $C$, find a state which has fidelity $\ge \tau - \epsilon$ with $\rho$. We give a new framework, stabilizer bootstrapping, for designing computationally efficient protocols for this task, and use this to get new agnostic tomography protocols for the following classes:
  Stabilizer states: We give a protocol that runs in time $\mathrm{poly}(n,1/\epsilon)\cdot (1/\tau)^{O(\log(1/\tau))}$, answering an open question posed by Grewal, Iyer, Kretschmer, Liang [43] and Anshu and Arunachalam [6]. Previous protocols ran in time $\mathrm{exp}(\Theta(n))$ or required $\tau&gt;\cos^2(\pi/8)$.
  States with stabilizer dimension $n - t$: We give a protocol that runs in time $n^3\cdot(2^t/\tau)^{O(\log(1/\epsilon))}$, extending recent work on learning quantum states prepared by circuits with few non-Clifford gates, which only applied in the realizable setting where $\tau = 1$ [33, 40, 49, 66].
  Discrete product states: If $C = K^{\otimes n}$ for some $\mu$-separated discrete set $K$ of single-qubit states, we give a protocol that runs in time $(n/\mu)^{O((1 + \log (1/\tau))/\mu)}/\epsilon^2$. This strictly generalizes a prior guarantee which applied to stabilizer product states [42]. For stabilizer product states, we give a further improved protocol that runs in time $(n^2/\epsilon^2)\cdot (1/\tau)^{O(\log(1/\tau))}$.
  As a corollary, we give the first protocol for estimating stabilizer fidelity, a standard measure of magic for quantum states, to error $\epsilon$ in $n^3 \mathrm{quasipoly}(1/\epsilon)$ time.</description>

      <title>Reliable Interval Estimation for the Fidelity of Entangled States in Scenarios with General Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fidelity estimation for entangled states constitutes an essential building block for quality control and error detection in quantum networks. Nonetheless, quantum networks often encounter heterogeneous and correlated noise, leading to excessive uncertainty in the estimated fidelity. In this paper, the uncertainty associated with the estimated fidelity under conditions of general noise is constrained by jointly employing random sampling, a thought experiment, and Bayesian inference, resulting in a credible interval for fidelity that is valid in the presence of general noise. The proposed credible interval incorporates all even moments of the posterior distribution to enhance estimation accuracy. Factors influencing the estimation accuracy are identified and analyzed. Specifically, the issue of excessive measurements is addressed, emphasizing the necessity of properly determining the measurement ratio for fidelity estimation under general noise conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The realization of fault-tolerant quantum computers hinges on effective quantum error correction protocols, whose performance significantly relies on the nature of the underlying noise. In this work, we directly study the structure of non-Markovian correlated errors and their impact on surface code memory performance. Specifically, we compare surface code performance under non-Markovian noise and independent circuit-level noise, while keeping marginal error rates constant. Our analysis shows that while not all temporally correlated structures are detrimental, certain structures, particularly multi-time "streaky" correlations affecting syndrome qubits and two-qubit gates, can severely degrade logical error rate scaling. Furthermore, we discuss our results in the context of recent quantum error correction experiments on physical devices. These findings underscore the importance of understanding and mitigating non-Markovian noise toward achieving practical, fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alkali-noble-gas comagnetometers have become an essential tool for tests of fundamental physics and offer a compact platform for precision gyroscopy. They are, however, limited by technical noise at low frequencies, commonly due to their limited suppression of magnetic noise. Here we investigate a new method for co-magnetometry between a single noble gas and alkali species. While similar to well-known devices using self-compensation, our scheme introduces magnetic pulses that controllably perturb the noble gas and pulsed optical pumping to polarise the alkali atoms. These applied pulses allow our scheme to measure, rather than just suppress, the effect of magnetic noise thereby offering reduced cross-talk. We show numerically that our scheme retrieves four signals (rotations and magnetic fields on two transverse axes) with similar sensitivity to a single axis device. We also present a proof-of-principle experiment based on a 87Rb-129Xe cell. Our data shows a low magnetic-rotation cross-talk of $0.2 \pm 0.1\mu$Hz$/$pT, which is already on par with the most sensitive devices relying on self-compensation.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the topological properties of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model under dissipative dynamics using the quantum trajectory approach. Our study explores the preservation or breakdown of topological edge states, particularly focusing on the effects of symmetry-preserving and symmetry-breaking dissipations. We employ the Disconnected Entanglement Entropy (DEE) as a marker for detecting topological phases in the system, which is subjected to Lindblad dynamics. The analysis reveals that, while dissipation in the bulk minimally affects the system's topological features, dissipation at the boundary leads to the destabilization of the edge modes, independently of the symmetry properties of the dissipation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The weighted MAX k-CUT problem involves partitioning a weighted undirected graph into k subsets to maximize the sum of the weights of edges between vertices in different subsets. This problem has significant applications across multiple domains. This paper explores encoding methods for MAX k-CUT on qubit systems, utilizing quantum approximate optimization algorithms (QAOA) and addressing the challenge of encoding integer values on quantum devices with binary variables. We examine various encoding schemes and evaluate the efficiency of these approaches. The paper presents a systematic and resource efficient method to implement phase separation for diagonal square binary matrices. When encoding the problem into the full Hilbert space, we show the importance of balancing the "bin sizes". We also explore the option to encode the problem into a suitable subspace, by designing suitable state preparations and constrained mixers (LX- and Grover-mixer). Numerical simulations on weighted and unweighted graph instances demonstrate the effectiveness of these encoding schemes, particularly in optimizing circuit depth, approximation ratios, and computational efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum information entropy is regarded as a measure of coherence between the observed system and the environment or between many-body. It is commonly described as the uncertainty and purity of a mixed state of a quantum system. Different from traditional information entropy, we introduce a new perspective, aiming to decompose the quantum state and focus on the total amount of information contained in the components that constitute the legal quantum state itself. Based on $\chi^2$ divergence, we define the posterior information content of quantum pure states. We analytically proved that the upper bound of the posterior information of a 2-qubit system is exactly equal to 2. At the same time, we found that when the number of qubits n&gt;2 in the quantum system, the process of calculating the upper bound of the posterior information can always be summarized as a standard semi-definite programming. Combined with numerical experiments, we generalized the previous hypothesis: A composite quantum system composed of n-qubits, the upper bound of the posterior information should be equal to n.</description>

      <title>A coupling prescription for post-Newtonian corrections in Quantum Mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between quantum theory and general relativity remains one of the main challenges of modern physics. A renewed interest in the low-energy limit is driven by the prospect of new experiments that could probe this interface. Here we develop a covariant framework for expressing post-Newtonian corrections to Schr\"odinger's equation on arbitrary gravitational backgrounds based on a $1/c^2$ expansion of Lorentzian geometry, where $c$ is the speed of light. Our framework provides a generic coupling prescription of quantum systems to gravity that is valid in the intermediate regime between Newtonian gravity and General Relativity, and that retains the focus on geometry. At each order in $1/c^2$ this produces a nonrelativistic geometry to which quantum systems at that order couple. By considering the gauge symmetries of both the nonrelativistic geometries and the $1/c^2$ expansion of the complex Klein--Gordon field, we devise a prescription that allows us to derive the Schr\"odinger equation and its post-Newtonian corrections on a gravitational background order-by-order in $1/c^2$. We also demonstrate that these results can be obtained from a $1/c^2$ expansion of the complex Klein--Gordon Lagrangian. We illustrate our methods by performing the $1/c^2$ expansion of the Kerr metric up to $\mathcal{O}(c^{-2})$, which leads to a special case of the Hartle--Thorne metric. The associated Schr\"odinger equation captures novel and potentially measurable effects.</description>

      <title>Insulator phases of Bose-Fermi mixtures induced by intraspecies next-neighbor interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05594v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional mixture of two-color fermions and scalar bosons at the hardcore limit, focusing on the effect that the intraspecies next-neighbor interactions have on the zero-temperature ground state of the system for different fillings of each carrier. Exploring the problem's parameters, we observed that the non-local interaction could favor or harm the well-known mixed Mott and spin-selective Mott insulators. We also found the emergence of three unusual insulating states with charge density wave (CDW) structures in which the orders of the carriers are out of phase with each other. For instance, the immiscible CDW appears only at half-filling bosonic density, whereas the mixed CDW state is characterized by equal densities of bosons and fermions. Finally, the spin-selective CDW couples the bosons and only one kind of fermions. Appropriate order parameters were proposed for each phase to obtain the critical parameters for the corresponding superfluid-insulator transition. Our results can inspire or contribute to understanding experiments in cold-atom setups with long-range interactions or recent reports involving quasiparticles in semiconductor heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Unifying view of fermionic neural network quantum states: From neural network backflow to hidden fermion determinant states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09450v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among the variational wave functions for Fermionic Hamiltonians, neural network backflow (NNBF) and hidden fermion determinant states (HFDS) are two prominent classes to provide accurate approximations to the ground state. Here we develop a unifying view of fermionic neural quantum states casting them all in the framework of NNBF. NNBF wave-functions have configuration-dependent single-particle orbitals (SPO) which are parameterized by a neural network. We show that HFDS with $r$ hidden fermions can be written as a NNBF with an $r \times r$ determinant Jastrow and a restricted low-rank $r$ additive correction to the SPO. Furthermore, we show that in NNBF wave-functions, such determinant Jastrow's can generically be removed at the cost of further complicating the additive SPO correction increasing its rank by $r$. We numerically and analytically compare additive SPO corrections generated by the product of two matrices with inner dimension $r$. We find that larger $r$ wave-functions span a larger space and give evidence that simpler and more direct updates to the SPO's tend to be more expressive and better energetically. These suggest the standard NNBF approach is preferred amongst other related choices. Finally, we uncover that the row-selection used to select single-particle orbitals allows significant sign and amplitude modulation between nearby configurations and is partially responsible for the quality of NNBF and HFDS wave-functions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we show that a possible relationship between the Hubble-Lema\^{i}tre constant $H_{0}$ and the universe's quantum complexity can be established in the context of a new proposal for quantum gravity, according to which spacetime must emerge from quantum correlations without correlata. Such a bridge between $H_{0}$ and the universe's complexity can represent an important step to understanding the Hubble tension by introducing a quantum gravity perspective for cosmological observations: regarding the degree of quantum complexity we measure around us.</description>

      <title>HEOM-QUICK2: a general-purpose simulator for fermionic many-body open quantum systems -- An Update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many-body open quantum systems (OQS) have a profound impact on various subdisciplines of physics, chemistry, and biology. Thus, the development of a computer program capable of accurately, efficiently, and versatilely simulating many-body OQS is highly desirable. In recent years, we have focused on the advancement of numerical algorithms based on the fermionic hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) theory. Being in-principle exact, this approach allows for the precise characterization of many-body correlations, non-Markovian memory, and non-equilibrium thermodynamic conditions. These efforts now lead to the establishment of a new computer program, HEOM for QUantum Impurity with a Correlated Kernel, version 2 (HEOM-QUICK2), which, to the best of our knowledge, is currently the only general-purpose simulator for fermionic many-body OQS. Compared with version 1, the HEOM-QUICK2 program features more efficient solvers for stationary states, more accurate treatment of non-Markovian memory, and improved numerical stability for long-time dissipative dynamics. Integrated with quantum chemistry software, HEOM-QUICK2 has become a valuable theoretical tool for the precise simulation of realistic many-body OQS, particularly the single atomic or molecular junctions. Furthermore, the unprecedented precision achieved by HEOM-QUICK2 enables accurate simulation of low-energy spin excitations and coherent spin relaxation. The unique usefulness of HEOM-QUICK2 is demonstrated through several examples of strongly correlated quantum impurity systems under non-equilibrium conditions. Thus, the new HEOM-QUICK2 program offers a powerful and comprehensive tool for studying many-body OQS with exotic quantum phenomena and exploring applications in various disciplines.</description>

      <title>Observation of electric field induced superradiance slowdown in ultracold Rydberg atomic gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atoms excited to electronically high-lying Rydberg states decay to low-energy states through spontaneous emission processes. We investigate the impact of a static electric field on the superradiant emission process between Rydberg $|60D_{5/2}\rangle$ and $|61P_{3/2}\rangle$ states in an ultracold Cesium Rydberg atom ensemble. We report experimental observations of a significant slowdown in superradiance upon applying an electric field. To understand the slowing down dynamics, we employ a discrete truncated Wigner approximation (DTWA) method to solve the corresponding master equation numerically. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that superradiance decoherence is caused by the Stark shifts of the Rydberg level. Our theoretical simulations qualitatively match the experimental observations. Our work provides new insights into controlling quantum critical behaviors, with implications for quantum many-body dynamics, and the study of quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Impact of micromotion on the excitation of Rydberg states of ions in a Paul trap</title>

Abstract: Trapped ions are among the most advanced platforms for quantum simulation and computation. Their capabilities can be further augmented by making use of electronically highly excited Rydberg states, which enable the realization of long-ranged electric dipolar interactions. Most experimental and theoretical studies so far focus on the excitation of ionic Rydberg states in linear Paul traps, which generate confinement by a combination of static and oscillating electric fields. These two fields need to be carefully aligned to minimize so-called micromotion, caused by the time-dependent electric field. The purpose of this work is to systematically understand the qualitative impact of micromotion on the Rydberg excitation spectrum, when the symmetry axes of the two electric fields do not coincide. Considering this scenario is not only important in the case of possible field misalignment, but becomes inevitable for Rydberg excitations in 2D and 3D ion crystals. We develop a minimal model describing a single trapped Rydberg ion, which we solve numerically via Floquet theory and analytically using a perturbative approach. We calculate the excitation spectra and analyze in which parameter regimes addressable and energetically isolated Rydberg lines persist, which are an important requirement for conducting coherent manipulations.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible duality and symmetry topological order of one-dimensional lattice models with spatially modulated symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between self-duality and spatially modulated symmetry of generalized $N$-state clock models, which include the transverse-field Ising model and ordinary $N$-state clock models as special cases. The spatially modulated symmetry of the model becomes trivial when the model's parameters satisfy a specific number-theoretic relation. We find that the duality is non-invertible when the spatially modulated symmetry remains nontrivial, and show that this non-invertibility is resolved by introducing a generalized $\mathbb{Z}_N$ toric code, which manifests ultraviolet/infrared mixing, as the bulk topological order. In this framework, the boundary duality transformation corresponds to the boundary action of a bulk symmetry transformation, with the endpoint of the bulk symmetry defect realizing the boundary duality defect. Our results illuminate not only a holographic perspective on dualities but also a relationship between spatially modulated symmetry and ultraviolet/infrared mixing in one higher dimension.</description>
