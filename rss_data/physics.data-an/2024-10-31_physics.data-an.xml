      <title>Machine learning models with different cheminformatics data sets to forecast the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT) regression models along with three cheminformatics data sets (RDkit, Mordred, Morgan) have been used to predict the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). The data consists of cheinformatics descriptors of the electron donor used in 433 OSCs for which the experimental PCE (target variable) is reported in the literature. The donor is either a polymer or a small organic molecule, and the acceptor the fullerene derivatives PCBM or PC71BM. Unlike previous methods, our ML approach considers the type of donor and the acceptor by adding four extra donor's features using the one-hot encoder tool. It is demonstrated that this additional information improves the prediction performance up to 34%. We have also exploited this feature to theoretically forecast the PCE of new OSCs by evaluating the ML model for a different acceptor. It is predicted that more than 50% of the OCSs obtained by exchanging the acceptor would have higher experimental PCE. The prediction accuracy of a given ML approach is analyzed for different PCE intervals. RF using RDkit descriptors resulted in the best ML approach with a Pearson's correlation coefficient for the training and testing sets equal to 0.96 and 0.62, respectively.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Event-Shape Methods in Search for the Chiral Magnetic Effect in Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) is a phenomenon in which electric charge is separated by a strong magnetic field from local domains of chirality imbalance and parity violation in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The CME-sensitive observable, charge-dependent three-point azimuthal correlator $\Delta\gamma$, is contaminated by a major physics background proportional to the particle's elliptic anisotropy $v_2$. Event-shape engineering (ESE) binning events in dynamical fluctuations of $v_2$ and event-shape selection (ESS) binning events in statistical fluctuations of $v_2$ are two methods to search for the CME by projecting $\Delta\gamma$ to the $v_2=0$ intercept. We conduct a systematic study of these two methods using physics models as well as toy model simulations. It is observed that the ESE method requires significantly more statistics than the ESS method to achieve the same statistical precision of the intercept. It is found that the intercept from the ESS method depends on the details of the event content, such as the mixtures of background contributing sources, and thus is not a clean measure of the CME.</description>

      <title>A Priori Uncertainty Quantification of Reacting Turbulence Closure Models using Bayesian Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18729v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While many physics-based closure model forms have been posited for the sub-filter scale (SFS) in large eddy simulation (LES), vast amounts of data available from direct numerical simulation (DNS) create opportunities to leverage data-driven modeling techniques. Albeit flexible, data-driven models still depend on the dataset and the functional form of the model chosen. Increased adoption of such models requires reliable uncertainty estimates both in the data-informed and out-of-distribution regimes. In this work, we employ Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) to capture both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in a reacting flow model. In particular, we model the filtered progress variable scalar dissipation rate which plays a key role in the dynamics of turbulent premixed flames. We demonstrate that BNN models can provide unique insights about the structure of uncertainty of the data-driven closure models. We also propose a method for the incorporation of out-of-distribution information in a BNN. The efficacy of the model is demonstrated by a priori evaluation on a dataset consisting of a variety of flame conditions and fuels.</description>
