      <title>Training Deep Normalization-Free Spiking Neural Networks with Lateral Inhibition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have garnered significant attention as a central paradigm in neuromorphic computing, owing to their energy efficiency and biological plausibility. However, training deep SNNs has critically depended on explicit normalization schemes, such as batch normalization, leading to a trade-off between performance and biological realism. To resolve this conflict, we propose a normalization-free learning framework that incorporates lateral inhibition inspired by cortical circuits. Our framework replaces the traditional feedforward SNN layer with a circuit of distinct excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) neurons that complies with Dale's law. The circuit dynamically regulates neuronal activity through subtractive and divisive inhibition, which respectively control the activity and the gain of excitatory neurons. To enable and stabilize end-to-end training of the biologically constrained SNN, we propose two key techniques: E-I Init and E-I Prop. E-I Init is a dynamic parameter initialization scheme that balances excitatory and inhibitory inputs while performing gain control. E-I Prop decouples the backpropagation of the E-I circuits from the forward propagation and regulates gradient flow. Experiments across several datasets and network architectures demonstrate that our framework enables stable training of deep SNNs with biological realism and achieves competitive performance without resorting to explicit normalizations. Therefore, our work not only provides a solution to training deep SNNs but also serves a computational platform for further exploring the functions of lateral inhibition in large-scale cortical computation.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Radar Gesture Recognition with Hybrid Spiking Neural Networks: Balancing Accuracy and Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radar-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) offers privacy and robustness over camera-based methods, yet remains computationally demanding for edge deployment. We present the first use of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for radar-based HAR on aircraft marshalling signal classification. Our novel hybrid architecture combines convolutional modules for spatial feature extraction with Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons for temporal processing, inherently capturing gesture dynamics. The model reduces trainable parameters by 88\% with under 1\% accuracy loss compared to baselines, and generalizes well to the Soli gesture dataset. Through systematic comparisons with Artificial Neural Networks, we demonstrate the trade-offs of spiking computation in terms of accuracy, latency, memory, and energy, establishing SNNs as an efficient and competitive solution for radar-based HAR.</description>

      <title>Network-Optimised Spiking Neural Network for Event-Driven Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks offer event-driven computation suited to time-critical networking tasks such as anomaly detection, local routing control, and congestion management at the edge. Classical units, including Hodgkin-Huxley, Izhikevich, and the Random Neural Network, map poorly to these needs. We introduce Network-Optimised Spiking (NOS), a compact two-variable unit whose state encodes normalised queue occupancy and a recovery resource. The model uses a saturating nonlinearity to enforce finite buffers, a service-rate leak, and graph-local inputs with delays and optional per link gates. It supports two differentiable reset schemes for training and deployment. We give conditions for equilibrium existence and uniqueness, local stability tests from the Jacobian trace and determinant, and a network threshold that scales with the Perron eigenvalue of the coupling matrix. The analysis yields an operational rule g* ~ k* rho(W) linking damping and offered load, shows how saturation enlarges the stable region, and explains finite-size smoothing of synchrony onsets. Stochastic arrivals follow a Poisson shot-noise model aligned with telemetry smoothing. Against queueing baselines, NOS matches M/M/1 mean by calibration while truncating deep tails under bursty input. In closed loop it gives, low-jitte with short settling. In zero-shot, label-free forecasting NOS is calibrated per node from arrival statistics. Its NOS dynamics yield high AUROC/AUPRC, enabling timely detection of congestion onsets with few false positives. Under a train-calibrated residual protocol across chain, star, and scale-free topologies, NOS improves early-warning F1 and detection latency over MLP, RNN, GRU, and tGNN. We provide guidance for data-driven initialisation, surrogate-gradient training with a homotopy on reset sharpness, and explicit stability checks with topology-aware bounds for resource constrained deployments.</description>

      <title>Accuracy-Robustness Trade Off via Spiking Neural Network Gradient Sparsity Trail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have attracted growing interest in both computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence, primarily due to their inherent energy efficiency and compact memory footprint. However, achieving adversarial robustness in SNNs, particularly for vision-related tasks, remains a nascent and underexplored challenge. Recent studies have proposed leveraging sparse gradients as a form of regularization to enhance robustness against adversarial perturbations. In this work, we present a surprising finding: under specific architectural configurations, SNNs exhibit natural gradient sparsity and can achieve state-of-the-art adversarial defense performance without the need for any explicit regularization. Further analysis reveals a trade-off between robustness and generalization: while sparse gradients contribute to improved adversarial resilience, they can impair the model's ability to generalize; conversely, denser gradients support better generalization but increase vulnerability to attacks.</description>

      <title>CaRe-BN: Precise Moving Statistics for Stabilizing Spiking Neural Networks in Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer low-latency and energy-efficient decision-making on neuromorphic hardware by mimicking the event-driven dynamics of biological neurons. However, due to the discrete and non-differentiable nature of spikes, directly trained SNNs rely heavily on Batch Normalization (BN) to stabilize gradient updates. In online Reinforcement Learning (RL), imprecise BN statistics hinder exploitation, resulting in slower convergence and suboptimal policies. This challenge limits the adoption of SNNs for energy-efficient control on resource-constrained devices. To overcome this, we propose Confidence-adaptive and Re-calibration Batch Normalization (CaRe-BN), which introduces (\emph{i}) a confidence-guided adaptive update strategy for BN statistics and (\emph{ii}) a re-calibration mechanism to align distributions. By providing more accurate normalization, CaRe-BN stabilizes SNN optimization without disrupting the RL training process. Importantly, CaRe-BN does not alter inference, thus preserving the energy efficiency of SNNs in deployment. Extensive experiments on continuous control benchmarks demonstrate that CaRe-BN improves SNN performance by up to $22.6\%$ across different spiking neuron models and RL algorithms. Remarkably, SNNs equipped with CaRe-BN even surpass their ANN counterparts by $5.9\%$. These results highlight a new direction for BN techniques tailored to RL, paving the way for neuromorphic agents that are both efficient and high-performing.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Layer-Wise ANN-SNN With Surrogate Spike Encoding-Decoding Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained significant traction in both computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence for their potential in energy-efficient computing. In contrast, artificial neural networks (ANNs) excel at gradient-based optimization and high accuracy. This contrast has consequently led to a growing subfield of hybrid ANN-SNN research. However, existing hybrid approaches often rely on either a strict separation between ANN and SNN components or employ SNN-only encoders followed by ANN classifiers due to the constraints of non-differentiability of spike encoding functions, causing prior hybrid architectures to lack deep layer-wise cooperation during backpropagation. To address this gap, we propose a novel hybrid ANN-SNN framework that integrates layer-wise encode-decode SNN blocks within conventional ANN pipelines. Central to our method is the use of surrogate gradients for a bit-plane-based spike encoding function, enabling end-to-end differentiable training across ANN and SNN layers. This design achieves competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art pure ANN and SNN models while retaining the potential efficiency and temporal representation benefits of spiking computation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of a surrogate gradient for bit plane coding specifically and spike encoder interface in general to be utilized in the context of hybrid ANN-SNN, successfully leading to a new class of hybrid models that pave new directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Enabling Physical AI through Biological Principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The introduction of large language models has significantly expanded global demand for computing; addressing this growing demand requires novel approaches that introduce new capabilities while addressing extant needs. Although inspiration from biological systems served as the foundation on which modern artificial intelligence (AI) was developed, many modern advances have been made without clear parallels to biological computing. As a result, the ability of techniques inspired by "natural intelligence" (NI) to inflect modern AI systems may be questioned. However, by analyzing remaining disparities between AI and NI, we argue that further biological inspiration is indeed necessary to diversify the capabilities of artificial systems and enable them to succeed in real-world environments and adapt to niche applications. To elucidate which NI mechanisms can contribute toward this goal, we review and compare elements of biological and artificial computing systems, emphasizing areas of NI that have not yet been effectively captured by AI. We then suggest areas of opportunity for NI-inspired mechanisms that can inflect AI hardware and software.</description>

      <title>PredNext: Explicit Cross-View Temporal Prediction for Unsupervised Learning in Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), with their temporal processing capabilities and biologically plausible dynamics, offer a natural platform for unsupervised representation learning. However, current unsupervised SNNs predominantly employ shallow architectures or localized plasticity rules, limiting their ability to model long-range temporal dependencies and maintain temporal feature consistency. This results in semantically unstable representations, thereby impeding the development of deep unsupervised SNNs for large-scale temporal video data. We propose PredNext, which explicitly models temporal relationships through cross-view future Step Prediction and Clip Prediction. This plug-and-play module seamlessly integrates with diverse self-supervised objectives. We firstly establish standard benchmarks for SNN self-supervised learning on UCF101, HMDB51, and MiniKinetics, which are substantially larger than conventional DVS datasets. PredNext delivers significant performance improvements across different tasks and self-supervised methods. PredNext achieves performance comparable to ImageNet-pretrained supervised weights through unsupervised training solely on UCF101. Additional experiments demonstrate that PredNext, distinct from forced consistency constraints, substantially improves temporal feature consistency while enhancing network generalization capabilities. This work provides a effective foundation for unsupervised deep SNNs on large-scale temporal video data.</description>

      <title>DelRec: learning delays in recurrent spiking neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are a bio-inspired alternative to conventional real-valued deep learning models, with the potential for substantially higher energy efficiency. Interest in SNNs has recently exploded due to a major breakthrough: surrogate gradient learning (SGL), which allows training SNNs with backpropagation, strongly outperforming other approaches. In SNNs, each synapse is characterized not only by a weight but also by a transmission delay. While theoretical works have long suggested that trainable delays significantly enhance expressivity, practical methods for learning them have only recently emerged. Here, we introduce ''DelRec'', the first SGL-based method to train axonal or synaptic delays in recurrent spiking layers, compatible with any spiking neuron model. DelRec leverages a differentiable interpolation technique to handle non-integer delays with well-defined gradients at training time. We show that trainable recurrent delays outperform feedforward ones, leading to new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on two challenging temporal datasets (Spiking Speech Command, an audio dataset, and Permuted Sequential MNIST, a vision one), and match the SOTA on the now saturated Spiking Heidelberg Digit dataset using only vanilla Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire neurons with stateless (instantaneous) synapses. Our results demonstrate that recurrent delays are critical for temporal processing in SNNs and can be effectively optimized with DelRec, paving the way for efficient deployment on neuromorphic hardware with programmable delays. Our code is available at : https://github.com/alexmaxad/DelRec.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Hardness of Zonotope Containment and Neural Network Verification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks with ReLU activations are a widely used model in machine learning. It is thus important to have a profound understanding of the properties of the functions computed by such networks. Recently, there has been increasing interest in the (parameterized) computational complexity of determining these properties. In this work, we close several gaps and resolve an open problem posted by Froese et al. [COLT '25] regarding the parameterized complexity of various problems related to network verification. In particular, we prove that deciding positivity (and thus surjectivity) of a function $f\colon\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}$ computed by a 2-layer ReLU network is W[1]-hard when parameterized by $d$. This result also implies that zonotope (non-)containment is W[1]-hard with respect to $d$, a problem that is of independent interest in computational geometry, control theory, and robotics. Moreover, we show that approximating the maximum within any multiplicative factor in 2-layer ReLU networks, computing the $L_p$-Lipschitz constant for $p\in(0,\infty]$ in 2-layer networks, and approximating the $L_p$-Lipschitz constant in 3-layer networks are NP-hard and W[1]-hard with respect to $d$. Notably, our hardness results are the strongest known so far and imply that the naive enumeration-based methods for solving these fundamental problems are all essentially optimal under the Exponential Time Hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Learning Enhances Language Model Based Cell Embeddings for Low-Sample Single Cell Transcriptomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong ability in generating rich representations across domains such as natural language processing and generation, computer vision, and multimodal learning. However, their application in biomedical data analysis remains nascent. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling is essential for dissecting cell subtype diversity in development and disease, but rare subtypes pose challenges for scaling laws. We present a computational framework that integrates single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with LLMs to derive knowledge-informed gene embeddings. Highly expressed genes for each cell are mapped to NCBI Gene descriptions and embedded using models such as text-embedding-ada-002, BioBERT, and SciBERT. Applied to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), which differ in vulnerability to glaucoma-related neurodegeneration, this strategy improves subtype classification, highlights biologically significant features, and reveals pathways underlying selective neuronal vulnerability. More broadly, it illustrates how LLM-derived embeddings can augment biological analysis under data-limited conditions and lay the groundwork for future foundation models in single-cell biology.</description>

      <title>From Frustration to Fun: An Adaptive Problem-Solving Puzzle Game Powered by Genetic Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores adaptive problem solving with a game designed to support the development of problem-solving skills. Using an adaptive, AI-powered puzzle game, our adaptive problem-solving system dynamically generates pathfinding-based puzzles using a genetic algorithm, tailoring the difficulty of each puzzle to individual players in an online real-time approach. A player-modeling system records user interactions and informs the generation of puzzles to approximate a target difficulty level based on various metrics of the player. By combining procedural content generation with online adaptive difficulty adjustment, the system aims to maintain engagement, mitigate frustration, and maintain an optimal level of challenge. A pilot user study investigates the effectiveness of this approach, comparing different types of adaptive difficulty systems and interpreting players' responses. This work lays the foundation for further research into emotionally informed player models, advanced AI techniques for adaptivity, and broader applications beyond gaming in educational settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NeuroAI is an emerging field at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence, where insights from brain function guide the design of intelligent systems. A central area within this field is synthetic biological intelligence (SBI), which combines the adaptive learning properties of biological neural networks with engineered hardware and software. SBI systems provide a platform for modeling neural computation, developing biohybrid architectures, and enabling new forms of embodied intelligence. In this review, we organize the NeuroAI landscape into three interacting domains: hardware, software, and wetware. We outline computational frameworks that integrate biological and non-biological systems and highlight recent advances in organoid intelligence, neuromorphic computing, and neuro-symbolic learning. These developments collectively point toward a new class of systems that compute through interactions between living neural tissue and digital algorithms.</description>

      <title>Toward Preference-aligned Large Language Models via Residual-based Model Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preference alignment is a critical step in making Large Language Models (LLMs) useful and aligned with (human) preferences. Existing approaches such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback or Direct Preference Optimization typically require curated data and expensive optimization over billions of parameters, and eventually lead to persistent task-specific models. In this work, we introduce Preference alignment of Large Language Models via Residual Steering (PaLRS), a training-free method that exploits preference signals encoded in the residual streams of LLMs. From as few as one hundred preference pairs, PaLRS extracts lightweight, plug-and-play steering vectors that can be applied at inference time to push models toward preferred behaviors. We evaluate PaLRS on various small-to-medium-scale open-source LLMs, showing that PaLRS-aligned models achieve consistent gains on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks while preserving baseline general-purpose performance. Moreover, when compared to DPO-aligned models, they perform better with huge time savings. Our findings highlight that PaLRS offers an effective, much more efficient and flexible alternative to standard preference optimization pipelines, offering a training-free, plug-and-play mechanism for alignment with minimal data.</description>

      <title>Evolution Strategies at Scale: LLM Fine-Tuning Beyond Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for down-stream tasks is a critical step in the AI deployment pipeline. Reinforcement learning (RL) is arguably the most prominent fine-tuning method, contributing to the birth of many state-of-the-art LLMs. In contrast, evolution strategies (ES), which once showed comparable performance to RL on models with a few million parameters, was neglected due to the pessimistic perception of its scalability to larger models. In this work, we report the first successful attempt to scale up ES for fine-tuning the full parameters of LLMs, showing the surprising fact that ES can search efficiently over billions of parameters and outperform existing RL fine-tuning methods in multiple respects, including sample efficiency, tolerance to long-horizon rewards, robustness to different base LLMs, less tendency to reward hacking, and more stable performance across runs. It therefore serves as a basis to unlock a new direction in LLM fine-tuning beyond what current RL techniques provide.

      <title>EOE: Evolutionary Optimization of Experts for Training Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an evolutionary framework for the training of large language models(LLM). The models are divided into several experts(sub-networks), which have the same structure but different parameter values. Only one expert is trained at each step. After the classical AdamW optimization, some evolutionary operators(crossover, PSO, and mutation) act on the tensor weights between the current expert and the best expert. So current expert would learn the experience of best expert. The direction of best expert would help current expert's loss decrease faster. Finally, only save the weight of the best expert. Experiments show that best expert would achieve nearly the same accuracy as the full model. This would greatly reduce the size of the model for inference. Since only one expert is trained at each step, the training needs much less memory and has much higher throughput. Experiments show that the throughput would accelerate more than ten times! Our source code is available. It's a pure c++/cu framework, which is suitable for easy deployment on PCs and edge computing devices.</description>

Abstract: We present proof-of-principle time-dependent neural quantum state (NQS) simulations to illustrate the ability of this approach to effectively capture key aspects of quantum dynamics in the continuum.

      <title>Evolution Meets Diffusion: Efficient Neural Architecture Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17827v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has gained widespread attention for its transformative potential in deep learning model design. However, the vast and complex search space of NAS leads to significant computational and time costs. Neural Architecture Generation (NAG) addresses this by reframing NAS as a generation problem, enabling the precise generation of optimal architectures for specific tasks. Despite its promise, mainstream methods like diffusion models face limitations in global search capabilities and are still hindered by high computational and time demands. To overcome these challenges, we propose Evolutionary Diffusion-based Neural Architecture Generation (EDNAG), a novel approach that achieves efficient and training-free architecture generation. EDNAG leverages evolutionary algorithms to simulate the denoising process in diffusion models, using fitness to guide the transition from random Gaussian distributions to optimal architecture distributions. This approach combines the strengths of evolutionary strategies and diffusion models, enabling rapid and effective architecture generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDNAG achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in architecture optimization, with an improvement in accuracy of up to 10.45%. Furthermore, it eliminates the need for time-consuming training and boosts inference speed by an average of 50 times, showcasing its exceptional efficiency and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>DEMO:Diffusion-based Evolutionary Optimization for 3D Multi-Objective Molecular Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11037v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimizing multiple objective properties while satisfying structural constraints is a major challenge in 3D molecular discovery. This difficulty arises because optimization objectives can be non-differentiable and the structure-property relationship is often unknown. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are widely used for multi-objective optimization to find Pareto fronts and can naturally handle structural constraints without any explicit modelling; however, in the 3D molecular space they lack mechanisms to guarantee chemical validity and are therefore prone to producing invalid structures. Conversely, diffusion models excel at generating chemically valid 3D molecules but typically require modifying the model and retraining to incorporate structural constraints. Moreover, diffusion models are not inherently designed for direct multi-objective optimization and struggle to explore the Pareto front of the learned property distribution - a critical capability for discovering novel, high-performing molecules. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel 3D molecular multi-objective evolutionary algorithm that leverages the generative power of a pretrained diffusion model. Instead of manipulating molecules directly in the complex chemical space, our method performs crossover operations in the noise space defined by the diffusion model's forward process, thereby enabling parental features or desired fragments to be fused into offspring. The pretrained model's denoising process then restores structural validity. The approach is highly composable and, requiring no retraining, can be readily integrated with existing guidance methods to improve discovery. Experimental results demonstrate strong performance on single-objective, multi-objective, and structurally constrained optimization tasks.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Cortical Computation: Manifold Disentanglement and Predictive Dynamics in VCNet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite their success, modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs) exhibit fundamental limitations, including data inefficiency, poor out-of-distribution generalization, and vulnerability to adversarial perturbations. These shortcomings can be traced to a lack of inductive biases that reflect the inherent geometric structure of the visual world. The primate visual system, in contrast, demonstrates superior efficiency and robustness, suggesting that its architectural and computational principles,which evolved to internalize these structures,may offer a blueprint for more capable artificial vision. This paper introduces Visual Cortex Network (VCNet), a novel neural network architecture whose design is informed by the macro-scale organization of the primate visual cortex. VCNet is framed as a geometric framework that emulates key biological mechanisms, including hierarchical processing across distinct cortical areas, dual-stream information segregation for learning disentangled representations, and top-down predictive feedback for representation refinement. We interpret these mechanisms through the lens of geometry and dynamical systems, positing that they guide the learning of structured, low-dimensional neural manifolds. We evaluate VCNet on two specialized benchmarks: the Spots-10 animal pattern dataset, which probes sensitivity to natural textures, and a light field image classification task, which requires processing higher-dimensional visual data. Our results show that VCNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 92.1\% on Spots-10 and 74.4\% on the light field dataset, surpassing contemporary models of comparable size. This work demonstrates that integrating high-level neuroscientific principles, viewed through a geometric lens, can lead to more efficient and robust models, providing a promising direction for addressing long-standing challenges in machine learning.</description>

      <title>The Physical Basis of Prediction: World Model Formation in Neural Organoids via an LLM-Generated Curriculum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The capacity of an embodied agent to understand, predict, and interact with its environment is fundamentally contingent on an internal world model. This paper introduces a novel framework for investigating the formation and adaptation of such world models within a biological substrate: human neural organoids. We present a curriculum of three scalable, closed-loop virtual environments designed to train these biological agents and probe the underlying synaptic mechanisms of learning, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). We detail the design of three distinct task environments that demand progressively more sophisticated world models for successful decision-making: (1) a conditional avoidance task for learning static state-action contingencies, (2) a one-dimensional predator-prey scenario for goal-directed interaction, and (3) a replication of the classic Pong game for modeling dynamic, continuous-time systems. For each environment, we formalize the state and action spaces, the sensory encoding and motor decoding mechanisms, and the feedback protocols based on predictable (reward) and unpredictable (punishment) stimulation, which serve to drive model refinement. In a significant methodological advance, we propose a meta-learning approach where a Large Language Model automates the generative design and optimization of experimental protocols, thereby scaling the process of environment and curriculum design. Finally, we outline a multi-modal evaluation strategy that moves beyond task performance to directly measure the physical correlates of the learned world model by quantifying synaptic plasticity at electrophysiological, cellular, and molecular levels. This work bridges the gap between model-based reinforcement learning and computational neuroscience, offering a unique platform for studying embodiment, decision-making, and the physical basis of intelligence.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Survey on Large Language Models for Evolutionary Optimization: From Modeling to Solving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), with their strong understanding and reasoning capabilities, are increasingly being explored for tackling optimization problems, especially in synergy with evolutionary computation. Despite rapid progress, however, the field still lacks a unified synthesis and a systematic taxonomy. This survey addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review of recent developments and organizing them within a structured framework. We classify existing research into two main stages: LLMs for optimization modeling and LLMs for optimization solving. The latter is further divided into three paradigms according to the role of LLMs in the optimization workflow: LLMs as stand-alone optimizers, low-level LLMs embedded within optimization algorithms, and high-level LLMs for algorithm selection and generation. For each category, we analyze representative methods, distill technical challenges, and examine their interplay with traditional approaches. We also review interdisciplinary applications spanning the natural sciences, engineering, and machine learning. By contrasting LLM-driven and conventional methods, we highlight key limitations and research gaps, and point toward future directions for developing self-evolving agentic ecosystems for optimization.

      <title>Improving the adaptive and continuous learning capabilities of artificial neural networks: Lessons from multi-neuromodulatory dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous, adaptive learning-the ability to adapt to the environment and improve performance-is a hallmark of both natural and artificial intelligence. Biological organisms excel in acquiring, transferring, and retaining knowledge while adapting to dynamic environments, making them a rich source of inspiration for artificial neural networks (ANNs). This study explores how neuromodulation, a fundamental feature of biological learning systems, can help address challenges such as catastrophic forgetting and enhance the robustness of ANNs in continuous learning scenarios. Driven by neuromodulators including dopamine (DA), acetylcholine (ACh), serotonin (5-HT) and noradrenaline (NA), neuromodulatory processes in the brain operate at multiple scales, facilitating dynamic responses to environmental changes through mechanisms ranging from local synaptic plasticity to global network-wide adaptability. Importantly, the relationship between neuromodulators, and their interplay in the modulation of sensory and cognitive processes are more complex than expected, demonstrating a "many-to-one" neuromodulator-to-task mapping. To inspire the design of novel neuromodulation-aware learning rules, we highlight (i) how multi-neuromodulatory interactions enrich single-neuromodulator-driven learning, (ii) the impact of neuromodulators at multiple spatial and temporal scales, and correspondingly, (iii) strategies to integrate neuromodulated learning into or approximate it in ANNs. To illustrate these principles, we present a case study to demonstrate how neuromodulation-inspired mechanisms, such as DA-driven reward processing and NA-based cognitive flexibility, can enhance ANN performance in a Go/No-Go task. By integrating multi-scale neuromodulation, we aim to bridge the gap between biological learning and artificial systems, paving the way for ANNs with greater flexibility, robustness, and adaptability.</description>

      <title>Optuna vs Code Llama: Are LLMs a New Paradigm for Hyperparameter Tuning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06006v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimal hyperparameter selection is critical for maximizing the performance of neural networks in computer vision, particularly as architectures become more complex. This work explores the use of large language models (LLMs) for hyperparameter optimization by fine-tuning a parameter-efficient version of Code Llama using LoRA. The resulting model produces accurate and computationally efficient hyperparameter recommendations across a wide range of vision architectures. Unlike traditional methods such as Optuna, which rely on resource-intensive trial-and-error procedures, our approach achieves competitive or superior Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) while substantially reducing computational overhead. Importantly, the models evaluated span image-centric tasks such as classification, detection, and segmentation, fundamental components in many image manipulation pipelines including enhancement, restoration, and style transfer. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based optimization not only rivals established Bayesian methods like Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE), but also accelerates tuning for real-world applications requiring perceptual quality and low-latency processing. All generated configurations are publicly available in the LEMUR Neural Network Dataset (https://github.com/ABrain-One/nn-dataset), which serves as an open source benchmark for hyperparameter optimization research and provides a practical resource to improve training efficiency in image manipulation systems.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) is an emerging field that harnesses advances in Quantum Computing (QC) to improve the scalability and efficiency of decentralized Federated Learning (FL) models. This paper provides a systematic and comprehensive survey of the emerging problems and solutions when FL meets QC, from research protocol to a novel taxonomy, particularly focusing on both quantum and federated limitations, such as their architectures, Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, and privacy preservation, so on. This work explores key developments and integration strategies, along with the impact of quantum computing on FL, keeping a sharp focus on hybrid quantum-classical approaches. The paper offers an in-depth understanding of how the strengths of QC, such as gradient hiding, state entanglement, quantum key distribution, quantum security, and quantum-enhanced differential privacy, have been integrated into FL to ensure the privacy of participants in an enhanced, fast, and secure framework. Finally, this study proposes potential future directions to address the identified research gaps and challenges, aiming to inspire faster and more secure QFL models for practical use.</description>

      <title>Sharpness-Aware Minimization with Z-Score Gradient Filtering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02369v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks achieve high performance across many domains but can still face challenges in generalization when optimization is influenced by small or noisy gradient components. Sharpness-Aware Minimization improves generalization by perturbing parameters toward directions of high curvature, but it uses the entire gradient vector, which means that small or noisy components may affect the ascent step and cause the optimizer to miss optimal solutions. We propose Z-Score Filtered Sharpness-Aware Minimization, which applies Z-score based filtering to gradients in each layer. Instead of using all gradient components, a mask is constructed to retain only the top percentile with the largest absolute Z-scores. The percentile threshold $Q_p$ determines how many components are kept, so that the ascent step focuses on directions that stand out most compared to the average of the layer. This selective perturbation refines the search toward flatter minima while reducing the influence of less significant gradients. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet with architectures including ResNet, VGG, and Vision Transformers show that the proposed method consistently improves test accuracy compared to Sharpness-Aware Minimization and its variants.

      <title>Optimization Strategies for Variational Quantum Algorithms in Noisy Landscapes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are a leading approach for near-term quantum computing but face major optimization challenges from noise, barren plateaus, and complex energy landscapes. We benchmarked more than fifty metaheuristic algorithms for the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) using a three-phase procedure: initial screening on the Ising model, scaling tests up to nine qubits, and convergence on a 192-parameter Hubbard model. Landscape visualizations revealed that smooth convex basins in noiseless settings become distorted and rugged under finite-shot sampling, explaining the failure of gradient-based local methods. Across models, CMA-ES and iL-SHADE consistently achieved the best performance, while Simulated Annealing (Cauchy), Harmony Search, and Symbiotic Organisms Search also showed robustness. In contrast, widely used optimizers such as PSO, GA, and standard DE variants degraded sharply with noise. These results identify a small set of resilient algorithms for noisy VQE and provide guidance for optimization strategies on near-term quantum devices.</description>
