      <title>On Weighted Monotone and Subadditive Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G(V,E)$ be a graph, and $\mathscr{H}:=\big\{H:H\subseteq G\big\}$ denote the collection of all possible subgraphs of $G$. Then for each non-negative function $w:\mathscr{H}\to\mathbb{R_+}$, the graph $G(V,E,w)$ is said to be a weighted graph.
  A weighted graph $G(V,E,w)$ is called monotone (increasing), if for any $H_1,H_2\subseteq G$ with $H_1\subset H_2$, the following inequality holds:
  $$w\big(H_1\big)\leq w\big(H_2\big). $$
  On the other hand, a weighted graph $G(V,E,{w})$ is termed subadditive, if for any $H_1,H_2\subseteq G$, the following discrete functional inequality is satisfied:
  $$ {w}\big(H_1\cup H_2\big)\leq {w}\big(H_1\big)+ {w}\big(H_2\big). $$
  Our main result demonstrates that for any graph $G(V,E,w)$, it is possible to construct both the largest monotone and the greatest subadditive minorants. In other words, it is feasible to formulate the largest increasing function $\overline{w}:\mathscr{H}\to\mathbb{R_+}$ and subadditive function $\widetilde{w}:\mathscr{H}\to\mathbb{R_+}$ such that $\overline{w}(H)\leq w(H)$ and $\widetilde{w}(H)\leq w(H)$ hold respectively for all $H\subseteq G$ .</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of the present study is to establish some properties for q-Bessel matrix polynomials such as several q-differential matrix equation, q-differential matrix relations and q-recurrence matrix relations, and integral representation, q-Laplace and q-Mellin transforms with the help of q-Analysis. Furthermore, we give connections between q-Horn's matrix functions of two variables and q-Bessel matrix polynomials are given.</description>

      <title>Extending Hridaya Kolam to Multiple Loops: A Study of Non-Coprime Dot--Arm Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends Hridaya Kolam patterns to cases where the number of dots ($m$) and arms ($n$) are not coprime, i.e., $\gcd(m, n) \ne 1$. Such configurations give rise to multiple disjoint closed loops. We propose a modular-arithmetic-based algorithm to systematically generate such patterns, and illustrative patterns for various non-coprime $(m, n)$ pairs are provided to demonstrate the resulting multi-loop structures. These multi-loop Kolam designs can inspire architectural motifs and ornamental patterns in floor plans, facades, and decorative elements.</description>

      <title>On Narayana numbers which are products of four $b$-repdigits with a consequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on Narayana numbers which can be written as a products of four repdigits in base $g$, where $g$ is an integer with $g\geq2$. We prove that for $g$ between $2$ and $12$, there are finitely many of these numbers. Moreover we have fully determined them.</description>

      <title>The Universal Property of the Henkin Construction: A Categorical Perspective on the Completeness Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a categorical framework to clarify the relationship between the completeness and compactness theorems in classical first-order logic. Rather than claiming that different model constructions yield naturally isomorphic results-a statement that generally fails without strong assumptions-we focus on a precise and provable reformulation. Specifically, we show that the model obtained via the Henkin construction satisfies a universal property: it serves as an initial object in an appropriate category of models. From this perspective, any other model of the extended theory admits a unique structure-preserving map from the Henkin model. We formalize this insight using the language of categories and functors, defining a rigorous correspondence between logical theories and their models. This universal characterization explains the power and generality of the completeness theorem while avoiding problematic claims of isomorphism. The framework we present offers a structured and conceptually transparent understanding of model existence in logic and sets the stage for further categorical analyses in related domains.</description>

      <title>A Natural Homomorphism between the Model Constructions of the Completeness and Compactness Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a categorical framework relating two canonical model constructions in first-order logic: the Henkin construction and compactness-based constructions via ultraproducts or saturation. By introducing a globally fixed set of Henkin witness constants, we define two functors from the category of consistent first-order theories to the category of models with elementary embeddings. The first functor assigns to each theory its Henkin term model in an expanded language, while the second assigns the Skolem closure generated by the witness constants within a fixed ultraproduct or saturated model. We construct a natural transformation such that each component is an isomorphism between the corresponding models. The key insight is that both constructions utilize the same global Henkin expansion scheme, ensuring functoriality and allowing the canonical interpretation map to be surjective onto the Skolem closure. We clarify that without the Skolem closure restriction, the map would only be an elementary embedding rather than an isomorphism, as an arbitrary saturated model may contain non-standard elements outside the range of the term model. For special classes of theories, including aleph-zero-categorical theories and atomic complete theories, the construction simplifies due to uniqueness properties of their countable models. We also correct previous claims regarding rigidity of natural transformations, noting that uniform permutations of Henkin constants yield non-trivial natural automorphisms. This work provides structural insight into the relationship between syntactic proof-theoretic and semantic model-theoretic approaches to first-order logic, with potential applications in automated theorem proving and formal verification.</description>
