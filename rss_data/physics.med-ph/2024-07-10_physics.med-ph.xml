      <title>Microstructure.jl: a Julia Package for Probabilistic Microstructure Model Fitting with Diffusion MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microstructure.jl is a Julia package designed for probabilistic microstructure imaging using diffusion and combined diffusion-relaxometry MRI techniques. It provides a flexible and extendable framework for compartment models and includes robust and unified estimators for parameter fitting and uncertainty quantification. The package incorporates several established models from the literature, such as the spherical mean technique and soma and neurite density imaging (SANDI), along with their extensions for analyzing combined diffusion and T2 mapping data acquired at multiple echo times. For parameter estimation, it features methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and Monte Carlo dropout with neural networks, which provide probabilistic estimates by approximating the posteriors of modelling parameters. Microstructure.jl is applicable to both in vivo and ex vivo imaging data. We are currently testing and optimizing the package and are pleased to share its major functionalities, design, and documentation progress.</description>

      <title>Low-dose, high-resolution CT of infant-sized lungs via propagation-based phase contrast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many lung diseases and abnormalities require detailed visualisation of the lungs for accurate diagnosis and treatment. High-resolution computed tomography (CT) is the gold-standard technique for non-invasive lung disease detection, but it presents a risk to the patient through the relatively high ionising radiation dose required. Utilising the X-ray phase information may allow improvements in image resolution at equal or lower radiation levels than current clinical imaging. Propagation-based phase-contrast imaging requires minimal adaption of existing medical systems, and is well suited to lung imaging due to the strong phase gradients introduced by the lung-air material interface. Herein, propagation-based phase contrast CT is demonstrated for large animals, namely lambs, as a model for paediatric patients, using monochromatic radiation and a photon-counting detector at the Imaging and Medical Beamline of the Australian Synchrotron. Image quality, normalised against radiation dose, was optimised as a function of the beam energy and propagation distance, with the optimal conditions used to test the available image quality at very low radiation dose. Noise-limited spatial resolution was measured using Fourier ring correlation, and dosimetry was performed through Monte Carlo simulation calibrated against air kerma. The resulting CT images demonstrate superior resolution to existing high-resolution CT systems, pushing dose to the quantum limit to comply with current Australian guidelines for infant chest CT exposure (&lt;2.5 mSv effective dose). Constituent raw projections are shown to have significant proportions of pixels with zero photon counts that would create severe information loss in conventional CT, which was prevented through phase retrieval.</description>

      <title>Predicting Mesoscopic Larmor Frequency Shifts in White Matter with Diffusion MRI -- An In-Silico Monte-Carlo Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to validate if MRI can measure anisotropic mesoscopic Larmor frequency shifts from white matter axonal microstructure relative to the B0 direction and if dMRI can estimate this anisotropy. Recent models describe how mesoscopic Larmor frequency shifts depend on induced magnetic fields by axons, described by an orientation distribution function. Using Monte-Carlo simulations of MRI signals in mesoscopic white matter axon substrates, we show MRI can estimate this mesoscopic frequency shift and dMRI can estimate its orientation dependence.</description>

      <title>Novel Models for High-Dimensional Imaging: High-Resolution fMRI Acceleration and Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goals of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) include high spatial and temporal resolutions with a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To simultaneously improve spatial and temporal resolutions and maintain the high SNR advantage of OSSI, we present novel pipelines for fast acquisition and high-resolution fMRI reconstruction and physics parameter quantification. We propose a patch-tensor low-rank model, a physics-based manifold model, and a voxel-wise attention network. With novel models for acquisition and reconstruction, we demonstrate that we can improve SNR and resolution simultaneously without compromising scan time. All the proposed models outperform other comparison approaches with higher resolution and more functional information.</description>

      <title>Swin UNETR segmentation with automated geometry filtering for biomechanical modeling of knee joint cartilage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulation studies, such as finite element (FE) modeling, offer insights into knee joint biomechanics, which may not be achieved through experimental methods without direct involvement of patients. While generic FE models have been used to predict tissue biomechanics, they overlook variations in population-specific geometry, loading, and material properties. In contrast, subject-specific models account for these factors, delivering enhanced predictive precision but requiring significant effort and time for development. This study aimed to facilitate subject-specific knee joint FE modeling by integrating an automated cartilage segmentation algorithm using a 3D Swin UNETR. This algorithm provided initial segmentation of knee cartilage, followed by automated geometry filtering to refine surface roughness and continuity. In addition to the standard metrics of image segmentation performance, such as Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and Hausdorff distance, the method's effectiveness was also assessed in FE simulation. Nine pairs of knee cartilage FE models, using manual and automated segmentation methods, were developed to compare the predicted stress and strain responses during gait. The automated segmentation achieved high Dice similarity coefficients of 89.4% for femoral and 85.1% for tibial cartilage, with a Hausdorff distance of 2.3 mm between the automated and manual segmentation. Mechanical results including maximum principal stress and strain, fluid pressure, fibril strain, and contact area showed no significant differences between the manual and automated FE models. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed automated segmentation method in creating accurate knee joint FE models.</description>
