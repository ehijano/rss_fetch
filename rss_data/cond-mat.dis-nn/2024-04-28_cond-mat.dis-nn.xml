      <title>Experimental evidence for the $\omega^4$ tail of the nonphononic spectra of glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is now established that glasses feature low-frequency, nonphononic excitations, in addition to phonons that follow Debye's vibrational density of state (VDoS). Extensive computer studies demonstrated that these nonphononic, glassy excitations follow a universal non-Debye VDoS ${\cal D}_{\rm G}(\omega)\!\sim\!\omega^4$, at low frequencies $\omega$. Yet, due to intrinsic difficulties in disentangling ${\cal D}_{\rm G}(\omega)$ from the total VDoS ${\cal D}(\omega)$, which is experimentally accessible through various scattering techniques, the $\omega^4$ tail of ${\cal D}_{\rm G}(\omega)$ lacked direct experimental support. We develop a procedure to extract ${\cal D}_{\rm G}(\omega)$ from the measured ${\cal D}(\omega)$, based on recent advances in understanding low-frequency excitations in glasses, and apply it to available datasets for diverse glasses. The resulting analysis shows that the $\omega^4$ tail of the nonphononic vibrational spectra of glasses is nontrivially consistent with a broad range of experimental observations. It also further supports that ${\cal D}_{\rm G}(\omega)$ makes an additive contribution to ${\cal D}(\omega)$.</description>

      <title>A tale of two localizations: coexistence of flat bands and Anderson localization in a photonics-inspired amorphous system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging experimental platforms use amorphousness, a constrained form of disorder, to tailor meta-material properties. We study localization under this type of disorder in a class of $2D$ models generalizing recent experiments on photonic systems. We explore two kinds of localization that emerge in these models: Anderson localization by disorder, and the existence of compact, macroscopically degenerate localized states as in many crystalline flat bands. We find localization properties to depend on the symmetry class within a family of amorphized kagom\'{e} tight-binding models, set by a tunable synthetic magnetic field. The flat-band-like degeneracy innate to kagom\'{e} lattices survives under amorphousness without on-site disorder. This phenomenon arises from the cooperation between the structure of the compact localized states and the geometry of the amorphous graph. For particular values of the field, such states emerge in the amorphous system that were not present on the kagom\'{e} lattice in the same field. For generic states, the standard paradigm of Anderson localization is found to apply as expected for systems with particle-hole symmetry (class D), while a similar interpretation does not extend to our results in the general unitary case (class A). The structure of amorphous graphs, which arise in current photonics experiments, allows exact statements about flat-band-like states, including such states that only exist in amorphous systems, and demonstrates how the qualitative behavior of a disordered system can be tuned at fixed graph topology.</description>

      <title>Time-domain interferometry of electron weak localization through terahertz nonlinear response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study theoretically the nonlinear optical response of disordered electrons in the regime of weak (anti)localization. Our analytical and numerical calculations reveal that, in orthogonal/symplectic class systems, two consecutive, phase coherent optical pulses generates an electric current echo that appears after the second pulse, and at a time equal to the pulse delay time. The current echo reflects the quantum interference between a self-intersecting electron path and its time reversal partner, and, therefore, provide a time-domain interferometry of weak (anti)localization. Our results can be potentially tested on disordered metal films by using terahertz two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy or ultrafast transport measurements.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of spin helices in the diluted one-dimensional $XX$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by discrepancies between recent cold atom experiments and the associated theory, we explore the effect of immobile holes on the quantum dynamics of $x$-$z$ spin helices in the one-dimensional $XX$ model. We calculate the exact spin dynamics by mapping onto a system of non-interacting fermions, averaging over the distribution of holes. At small hole densities we find that the helical spin pattern decays exponentially, with a pitch dependence that agrees with the experiments. At large hole densities we instead find persistent oscillations. While our analytic approach does not generalize to the $XXZ$ model with arbitrary anisotropies, we validate a matrix product state technique which might be used to model the experiments in those settings.</description>

      <title>An exactly solvable model for emergence and scaling laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models can exhibit what appears to be a sudden ability to solve a new problem as training time ($T$), training data ($D$), or model size ($N$) increases, a phenomenon known as emergence. In this paper, we present a framework where each new ability (a skill) is represented as a basis function. We solve a simple multi-linear model in this skill-basis, finding analytic expressions for the emergence of new skills, as well as for scaling laws of the loss with training time, data size, model size, and optimal compute ($C$). We compare our detailed calculations to direct simulations of a two-layer neural network trained on multitask sparse parity, where the tasks in the dataset are distributed according to a power-law. Our simple model captures, using a single fit parameter, the sigmoidal emergence of multiple new skills as training time, data size or model size increases in the neural network.</description>

      <title>Stable real-energy spectral dynamics with topological transitions and non-Hermitian many-body localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, the interplay between non-Hermiticity, quasi-disorder, and repulsive interaction is studied for hard-core bosons confined in a one-dimensional optical lattice, where non-Hermiticity is induced by the non-reciprocal hoppings and the on-site gain and loss breaking the time-reversal symmetry. Although the energy spectra of the static system are fully complex, with the evolution of the initial state, the real part of the expectation value of the Hamiltonian under the time-evolved wave function changes stably. By means of the entanglement entropy and its dynamical evolution, as well as the inverse participation ratio, the many-body localization (MBL) is found to play the key role in the stability of the dynamical behavior of the real part of the expectation value, independent of whether the spectrum of the static Hamiltonian is real or complex. In the delocalization phase, the dynamical evolution of the real part of the expectation value is unstable. Meanwhile, the nearest-neighbor level spacings statistics shows the MBL transition accompanied by the transition from the Ginibre distribution to the complex Poisson distribution, different from the one in the time-reversal invariant system. In addition, the dynamical stability of the real part of the energy and the MBL transition can be characterized by the winding number, indicating that the MBL transition and the topological transition occur simultaneously, and the realization of the Hamiltonian is discussed.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Localization in the Age of Classical Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Statistical mechanics provides a framework for describing the physics of large, complex many-body systems using only a few macroscopic parameters to determine the state of the system. For isolated quantum many-body systems, such a description is achieved via the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which links thermalization, ergodicity and quantum chaotic behavior. However, tendency towards thermalization is not observed at finite system sizes and evolution times in a robust many-body localization (MBL) regime found numerically and experimentally in the dynamics of interacting many-body systems at strong disorder. Although the phenomenology of the MBL regime is well-established, the central question remains unanswered: under what conditions does the MBL regime give rise to an MBL phase in which the thermalization does not occur even in the asymptotic limit of infinite system size and evolution time?
  This review focuses on recent numerical investigations aiming to clarify the status of the MBL phase, and it establishes the critical open questions about the dynamics of disordered many-body systems. Persistent finite size drifts towards ergodicity consistently emerge in spectral properties of disordered many-body systems, excluding naive single-parameter scaling hypothesis and preventing comprehension of the status of the MBL phase. The drifts are related to tendencies towards thermalization and non-vanishing transport observed in the dynamics of many-body systems, even at strong disorder. These phenomena impede understanding of microscopic processes at the ETH-MBL crossover. Nevertheless, the abrupt slowdown of dynamics with increasing disorder strength suggests the proximity of the MBL phase. This review concludes that the questions about thermalization and its failure in disordered many-body systems remain a captivating area open for further explorations.</description>
