      <title>Monotone representation and measurability of generalized $\psi$-estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the monotone representation and measurability of generalized $\psi$-estimators introduced by the authors in 2022. Our first main result, applying the unique existence of a generalized $\psi$-estimator, allows us to construct this estimator in terms of a function $\psi$, which is decreasing in its second variable. We then interpret this result as a bridge from a nonconvex optimization problem to a convex one. Further, supposing that the underlying measurable space (sample space) has a measurable diagonal and some additional assumptions on $\psi$, we show that the measurability of a generalized $\psi$-estimator is equivalent to the measurability of the corresponding function $\psi$ in its first variable.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Multiple Correlated Networks for Exact Community Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning latent community structure from multiple correlated networks, focusing on edge-correlated stochastic block models with two balanced communities. Recent work of Gaudio, R\'acz, and Sridhar (COLT 2022) determined the precise information-theoretic threshold for exact community recovery using two correlated graphs; in particular, this showcased the subtle interplay between community recovery and graph matching. Here we study the natural setting of more than two graphs. The main challenge lies in understanding how to aggregate information across several graphs when none of the pairwise latent vertex correspondences can be exactly recovered. Our main result derives the precise information-theoretic threshold for exact community recovery using any constant number of correlated graphs, answering a question of Gaudio, R\'acz, and Sridhar (COLT 2022). In particular, for every $K \geq 3$ we uncover and characterize a region of the parameter space where exact community recovery is possible using $K$ correlated graphs, even though (1) this is information-theoretically impossible using any $K-1$ of them and (2) none of the latent matchings can be exactly recovered.</description>

      <title>Identifiability implies consistency of MLE in partially observed diffusions on a torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a general partially observed diffusion model with periodic coefficients and with non-degenerate diffusion component. The coefficients of such a model depend on an unknown (static and deterministic) parameter which needs to be estimated based on the observed component of the diffusion process. We show that, under a minimal assumption of identifiability, and given enough regularity of the diffusion coefficients, a maximum likelihood estimator of the unknown parameter converges to the true parameter value as the sample size grows to infinity.</description>

      <title>Bounds in Wasserstein distance for locally stationary processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Locally stationary processes (LSPs) provide a robust framework for modeling time-varying phenomena, allowing for smooth variations in statistical properties such as mean and variance over time. In this paper, we address the estimation of the conditional probability distribution of LSPs using Nadaraya-Watson (NW) type estimators. The NW estimator approximates the conditional distribution of a target variable given covariates through kernel smoothing techniques. We establish the convergence rate of the NW conditional probability estimator for LSPs in the univariate setting under the Wasserstein distance and extend this analysis to the multivariate case using the sliced Wasserstein distance. Theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating the practical usefulness of the proposed estimators.</description>

      <title>Hyperdeterminantal Total Positivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a given positive integer $m$, the concept of {\it hyperdeterminantal total positivity} is defined for a kernel $K:\R^{2m} \to \R$, thereby generalizing the classical concept of total positivity. Extending the fundamental example, $K(x,y) = \exp(xy)$, $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$, of a classical totally positive kernel, the hyperdeterminantal total positivity property of the kernel $K(x_1,\ldots,x_{2m}) = \exp(x_1\cdots x_{2m})$, $x_1,\ldots,x_{2m} \in \mathbb{R}$ is established. A hyperdeterminantal Binet-Cauchy argument is applied to derive a generalization of Karlin's Basic Composition Formula, from which several examples of hyperdeterminantal totally positive kernels are constructed. Further generalizations of hyperdeterminantal total positivity by means of the theory of finite reflection groups are described and some open problems are posed.</description>

      <title>Consistent least squares estimation in population-size-dependent branching processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.10898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the first conditionally consistent estimators for a class of parametric Markov population models with logistic growth, which are suitable for modelling endangered populations in restricted habitats with a carrying capacity. We focus on discrete-time parametric population-size-dependent branching processes, for which we propose a new class of weighted least-squares estimators based on a single trajectory of population size counts. We establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of our estimators, conditional on non-extinction up to time $n$, as $n\to\infty$. Since Markov population models with a carrying capacity become extinct almost surely under general conditions, our proofs rely on arguments distinct from those in the existing literature.
  Our results are motivated by conservation biology, where endangered populations are often studied precisely because they are still alive, leading to an observation bias. Through simulated examples, we show that our conditionally consistent estimators generally reduce this bias for key quantities such as a habitat's carrying capacity. We apply our methodology to estimate the carrying capacity of the Chatham Island black robin, a population reduced to a single breeding female in the 1970's, which has since recovered but has yet to reach the island's carrying capacity.</description>

      <title>Stein's Method of Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19031v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stein operators allow to characterise probability distributions via differential operators. Based on these characterisations, we develop a new method of point estimation for marginal parameters of strictly stationary and ergodic processes, which we call \emph{Stein's Method of Moments} (SMOM). These SMOM estimators satisfy the desirable classical properties such as consistency and asymptotic normality. As a consequence of the usually simple form of the operator, we obtain explicit estimators in cases where standard methods such as (pseudo-) maximum likelihood estimation require a numerical procedure to calculate the estimate. In addition, with our approach, one can choose from a large class of test functions which allows to improve significantly on the moment estimator. Moreover, for i.i.d.\ observations, we retrieve data-dependent functions that result in asymptotically efficient estimators and give a sequence of explicit SMOM estimators that converge to the maximum likelihood estimator. Our simulation study demonstrates that for a number of important univariate continuous probability distributions our SMOM estimators possess excellent small sample behaviour, often outperforming the maximum likelihood estimator and other widely-used methods in terms of lower bias and mean squared error. We also illustrate the pertinence of our approach on a real data set related to rainfall modelisation.</description>

      <title>Winners with Confidence: Discrete Argmin Inference with an Application to Model Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of finding the index of the minimum value of a vector from noisy observations. This problem is relevant in population/policy comparison, discrete maximum likelihood, and model selection. We develop an asymptotically normal test statistic, even in high-dimensional settings and with potentially many ties in the population mean vector, by integrating concepts and tools from cross-validation and differential privacy. The key technical ingredient is a central limit theorem for globally dependent data. We also propose practical ways to select the tuning parameter that adapts to the signal landscape. Numerical experiments and data examples demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to achieve a favorable bias-variance trade-off in practical scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.07114v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the famous paper written by Kaplan and Meier in 1958, survival analysis has become one of the most important fields in statistics. Nowadays it is one of the most important statistical tools in analyzing epidemiological and clinical data including COVID-19 pandemic. This article reviews some of the most celebrated and important results and methods, including consistency, asymptotic normality, bias and variance estimation, in survival analysis and the treatment is parallel to the monograph Statistical Models Based on Counting Processes. Other models and results such as semi-Markov models and the Turnbull's estimator that jump out of the classical counting process martingale framework are also discussed.</description>

      <title>A path-norm toolkit for modern networks: consequences, promises and challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01225v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces the first toolkit around path-norms that fully encompasses general DAG ReLU networks with biases, skip connections and any operation based on the extraction of order statistics: max pooling, GroupSort etc. This toolkit notably allows us to establish generalization bounds for modern neural networks that are not only the most widely applicable path-norm based ones, but also recover or beat the sharpest known bounds of this type. These extended path-norms further enjoy the usual benefits of path-norms: ease of computation, invariance under the symmetries of the network, and improved sharpness on layered fully-connected networks compared to the product of operator norms, another complexity measure most commonly used.
  The versatility of the toolkit and its ease of implementation allow us to challenge the concrete promises of path-norm-based generalization bounds, by numerically evaluating the sharpest known bounds for ResNets on ImageNet.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the effectiveness of linear preconditioning in Markov chain Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study linear preconditioning in Markov chain Monte Carlo. We consider the class of well-conditioned distributions, for which several mixing time bounds depend on the condition number $\kappa$. First we show that well-conditioned distributions exist for which $\kappa$ can be arbitrarily large and yet no linear preconditioner can reduce it. We then impose two sets of extra assumptions under which a linear preconditioner can significantly reduce $\kappa$. For the random walk Metropolis we further provide upper and lower bounds on the spectral gap with tight $1/\kappa$ dependence. This allows us to give conditions under which linear preconditioning can provably increase the gap. We then study popular preconditioners such as the covariance, its diagonal approximation, the hessian at the mode, and the QR decomposition. We show conditions under which each of these reduce $\kappa$ to near its minimum. We also show that the diagonal approach can in fact \textit{increase} the condition number. This is of interest as diagonal preconditioning is the default choice in well-known software packages. We conclude with a numerical study comparing preconditioners in different models, and showing how proper preconditioning can greatly reduce compute time in Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.</description>
