      <title>Rational conjugacy classes and rational characters for some finite simple groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If $G$ is a finite group, an irreducible complex-valued character $\chi$ is called rational if $\chi(g)$ is rational for all $g\in G$. Also, a conjugacy class $x^G$ is called rational, if for all irreducible complex-valued character $\chi$, the value $\chi(x^G)$ is rational. We prove that for $q$, a power of prime, the group $\mathrm{PSL}_2(q)$ has same number of rational characters and rational conjugacy classes. Furthermore, we verify that this equality holds for all finite simple groups whose character tables appear in the $\textit{ATLAS of Finite Groups}$, except for the Tits group.</description>

      <title>Combination theorems for Wise's power alternative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that Wise's power alternative is stable under certain group constructions, use this to prove the power alternative for new classes of groups, and recover known results from a unified perspective.
  For groups acting on trees, we introduce a dynamical condition that allows us to deduce the power alternative for the group from the power alternative for its stabilisers of points. As an application, we reduce the power alternative for Artin groups to the power alternative for free-of-infinity Artin groups, under some conditions on their parabolic subgroups. We also introduce a uniform version of the power alternative and prove it, among other things, for a large family of two-dimensional Artin groups. As a corollary, we deduce that these Artin groups have uniform exponential growth.
  Finally, we prove that the power alternative is stable under taking relatively hyperbolic groups. We apply this to show that various examples, including all free-by-$\mathbb{Z}$ groups and a natural subclass of hierarchically hyperbolic groups, satisfy the uniform power alternative.</description>

      <title>Weighted Orlicz $*$-algebras on locally elliptic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a locally elliptic group, $(\Phi,\Psi)$ a complementary pair of Young functions, and $\omega: G \rightarrow [1,\infty)$ a weight function on $G$ such that the weighted Orlicz space $L^\Phi(G,\omega)$ is a Banach $*$-algebra when equipped with the convolution product and involution $f^*(x):=\overline{f(x^{-1})}$ ($f \in L^\Phi(G,\omega)$). Such a weight always exists on $G$ and we call it an $L^\Phi$-weight. We assume that $1/\omega \in L^\Psi(G)$ so that $L^\Phi(G,\omega) \subseteq L^1(G)$. This paper studies the spectral theory and primitive ideal structure of $L^\Phi(G,\omega)$. In particular, we focus on studying the Hermitian, Wiener and $*$-regularity properties on this algebra, along with some related questions on spectral synthesis. It is shown that $L^\Phi(G,\omega)$ is always quasi-Hermitian, weakly-Wiener and $*$-regular. Thus, if $L^\Phi(G,\omega)$ is Hermitian, then it is also Wiener. Although, in general, $L^\Phi(G,\omega)$ is not always Hermitian, it is known that Hermitianness of $L^1(G)$ implies Hermitianness of $L^\Phi(G,\omega)$ if $\omega$ is sub-additive. We give numerous examples of locally elliptic groups $G$ for which $L^1(G)$ is Hermitian and sub-additive $L^\Phi$-weights on these groups. In the weighted $L^1$ case, even stronger Hermitianness results are formulated.</description>

      <title>Quotients of Buildings by Non-uniform Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider quotients of the Bruhat-Tits building associated to the projective linear groups of dimension $d&gt;2$ over the function field $\mathbb F_q(t)$ by a non-uniform lattice $\Gamma$ which is a congruence subgroup in the non-uniform lattice $ PGL_{d}(R)$, where $R=\mathbb F_q[\frac{1}{t}]$. We determine a fundamental domain and demonstrate that the quotient, while not cofinite, is at least of finite covolume. We do the case $d=3$ in considerable detail.</description>

      <title>Galois representations with large image in the global Langlands correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02493v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The global Langlands conjecture for $\text{GL}_n$ over a number field $F$ predicts a correspondence between certain algebraic automorphic representations $\pi$ of $\text{GL}_n(\mathbb{A}_F)$ and certain families $\{ \rho_{\pi,\ell} \}_\ell$ of $n$-dimensional $\ell$-adic Galois representations of $\text{Gal}(\overline{F}/F)$. In general, it is expected that the image of the residual Galois representation $\overline{\rho}_{\pi,\ell}$ of $\rho_{\pi,\ell}$ should be as large as possible for almost all primes $\ell$, unless there is an automorphic reason for the image to be small.
  In this paper, we study the images of certain compatible systems of Galois representations $\{\rho_{\pi,\ell} \}_\ell$ associated to regular algebraic, polarizable, cuspidal automorphic representations $\pi$ of $\text{GL}_n(\mathbb{A}_F)$ by using only standard techniques and currently available tools (e.g., Fontaine-Laffaille theory, Serre's modularity conjecture, classification of the maximal subgroups of Lie type groups, and known results about irreducibility of automorphic Galois representations and Langlands functoriality). In particular, when $F$ is a totally real field and $n$ is an odd prime number $\leq 293$, we prove that (under certain automorphic conditions) the images of the residual representations $\overline{\rho}_{\pi,\ell}$ are as large as possible for infinitely many primes $\ell$. In fact, we prove the large image conjecture (i.e., large image for almost all primes $\ell$) when $F=\mathbb{Q}$ and $n=5$.</description>

      <title>Iterated magnitude homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnitude homology is an invariant of enriched categories which generalizes ordinary categorical homology -- the homology of the classifying space of a small category. The classifying space can also be generalized in a different direction: it extends from categories to bicategories as the geometric realization of the geometric nerve. This paper introduces a hybrid of the two ideas: an iterated magnitude homology theory for categories with a second- or higher-order enrichment. This encompasses, for example, groups equipped with extra structure such as a partial ordering or a bi-invariant metric. In the case of a strict 2-category, iterated magnitude homology recovers the homology of the classifying space; we investigate its content and behaviour when interpreted for partially ordered groups, normed groups, and strict $n$-categories for $n &gt; 2$.</description>

      <title>Continuous spectrum-shrinking maps and applications to preserver problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a positive integer $n$ let $\mathcal{X}_n$ be either the algebra $M_n$ of $n \times n$ complex matrices, the set $N_n$ of all $n \times n$ normal matrices, or any of the matrix Lie groups $\mathrm{GL}(n)$, $\mathrm{SL}(n)$ and $\mathrm{U}(n)$. We first give a short and elementary argument that for two positive integers $m$ and $n$ there exists a continuous spectrum-shrinking map $\phi : \mathcal{X}_n \to M_m$ (i.e.\ $\mathrm{sp}(\phi(X))\subseteq \mathrm{sp}(X)$ for all $X \in \mathcal{X}_n$) if and only if $n$ divides $m$. Moreover, in that case we have the equality of characteristic polynomials $k_{\phi(X)}(\cdot) = k_{X}(\cdot)^\frac{m}{n}$ for all $X \in \mathcal{X}_n$, which in particular shows that $\phi$ preserves spectra. Using this we show that whenever $n \geq 3$, any continuous commutativity preserving and spectrum-shrinking map $\phi : \mathcal{X}_n \to M_n$ is of the form $\phi(\cdot)=T(\cdot)T^{-1}$ or $\phi(\cdot)=T(\cdot)^tT^{-1}$, for some $T\in \mathrm{GL}(n)$. The analogous results fail for the special unitary group $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ but hold for the spaces of semisimple elements in either $\mathrm{GL}(n)$ or $\mathrm{SL}(n)$. As a consequence, we also recover (a strengthened version of) \v{S}emrl's influential characterization of Jordan automorphisms of $M_n$ via preserving properties.</description>

      <title>Random Lie bracket on $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbf{F}_p)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a random walk on the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbf{F}_p)$ where new elements are produced by randomly applying adjoint operators of two generators. Focusing on the generic case where the generators are selected at random, we analyze the limiting distribution of the random walk and the speed at which it converges to this distribution. These questions reduce to the study of a random walk on a cyclic group. We show that, with high probability, the walk exhibits a pre-cutoff phenomenon after roughly $p$ steps. Notably, the limiting distribution need not be uniform and it depends on the prime divisors of $p-1$. Furthermore, we prove that by incorporating a simple random twist into the walk, we can embed a well-known affine random walk on $\mathbf{F}_p$ into the modified random Lie bracket, allowing us to show that the entire Lie algebra is covered in roughly $\log p$ steps in the generic case.</description>
