      <title>Generation of sutured manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a compact, oriented, connected surface $F$, we show that the set of connected sutured manifolds $(M,\gamma)$ with $R_{\pm}(\gamma)\cong F$ is generated by the product sutured manifold $(F,\partial F)\times[0,1]$ through surgery triads. This result has applications in Floer theories of $3$--manifolds. The special case when $F=D^2$ or $S^2$ has been a folklore theorem, which has already been used by experts before.</description>

      <title>On grid homology for diagonal knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We partially determine grid homology for diagonal knots, a class of knots including Lorenz knots that can be represented by a good grid diagram in some sense. We compare diagonal knots to some class of knots such as positive braids, fibered positive knots, and $L$-space knots.</description>

      <title>Transposes in the $q$-deformed modular group and their applications to $q$-deformed rational numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The (right) $q$-deformed rational numbers was originally introduced by Morier-Genoud and Ovsienko, and its left variant by Bapat, Becker and Licata. These notions are based on continued fractions and the $q$-deformed modular group actions. For any matrix in this group, Leclere and Morier-Genoud showed that its trace is a palindromic polynomial whose coefficients are all non-negative (up to $\pm q^{N}$ times ). In this paper, we define the $q$-transpose for matrices in this group. Using this, we give new proofs of the above result and some others. We also give arithmetic properties on the left $q$-rational numbers. Finally, we show that the conjecture of \Oguz on circular fence posets implies a conjecture on the normalized Jones polynomials of rational links.</description>

      <title>Rewriting modulo in diagrammatic algebras and application to categorification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a rewriting theory suitable for diagrammatic algebras and lay down the foundations of a systematic study of their higher structures. In this paper, we focus on the question of finding bases. As an application, we give the first proof of a basis theorem for graded $\mathfrak{gl}_2$-foams, a certain diagrammatic algebra appearing in categorification and quantum topology. Our approach is algorithmic, combining linear rewriting, higher rewriting and rewriting modulo another set of rules -- for diagrammatic algebras, the modulo rules typically capture a categorical property, such as pivotality. In the process, we give novel approaches to the foundations of these theories, including to the notion of confluence. Other important tools include termination rules that depend on contexts, rewriting modulo invertible scalars, and a practical guide to classifying branchings modulo. This article is written to be accessible to experts on diagrammatic algebras with no prior knowledge on rewriting theory, and vice-versa.</description>

      <title>Dehn functions of subgroups of products of free groups. Part II: Precise computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Bridson-Dison group has quartic Dehn function, thereby providing the first precise computation of the Dehn function of a subgroup of a direct product of free groups with super-quadratic Dehn function. We also prove that coabelian subgroups of direct products of $n$ free groups of finiteness type $\mathcal{F}_{n-1}$ and of corank $r\leq n-2$ have quadratic Dehn functions.</description>

      <title>Points of quantum $\mathrm{SL}_n$ coming from quantum snakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.04471v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the quantized Fock-Goncharov monodromy matrices satisfy the relations of the quantum special linear group $\mathrm{SL}_n^q$. The proof employs a quantum version of the technology invented by Fock-Goncharov called snakes. This relationship between higher Teichm\"uller theory and quantum group theory is integral to the construction of a $\mathrm{SL}_n$-quantum trace map for knots in thickened surfaces, partially developed in a companion paper (arXiv:2101.06817).</description>

      <title>Connectedness of the Gromov boundary of fine curve graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15383v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fine curve graph was introduced to study homeomorphism group of surfaces. In this paper we study the topology of the Gromov boundary of this graph for closed surfaces with higher genus. We first prove a bounded geodesic image theorem for the fine curve graph, a consequence of which is the non-compactness of the Gromov boundary. Using this theorem, we are able to show that the Gromov boundary is linearly connected with respect to some visual metric.</description>

      <title>Homology growth of polynomially growing mapping tori</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that residually finite mapping tori of polynomially growing automorphisms of hyperbolic groups, groups hyperbolic relative to finitely many virtually polycyclic groups, right-angled Artin groups (when the automorphism is untwisted), and right-angled Coxeter groups have the cheap rebuilding property of Abert, Bergeron, Fraczyk, and Gaboriau. In particular, their torsion homology growth vanishes for every Farber sequence in every degree.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of Stability via Morse Limit Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Subgroup stability is a strong notion of quasiconvexity that generalizes convex cocompactness in a variety of settings. In this paper, we characterize stability of a subgroup by properties of its limit set on the Morse boundary. Given $H&lt;G$, both finitely generated, $H$ is stable exactly when all the limit points of $H$ are conical, or equivalently when all the limit points of $H$ are horospherical, as long as the limit set of $H$ is a compact subset of the Morse boundary for $G$. We also demonstrate an application of these results in the settings of the mapping class group for a finite type surface, $\text{Mod}(S)$.</description>
