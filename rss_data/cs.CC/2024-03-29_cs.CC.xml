      <title>Hardness of Learning Boolean Functions from Label Proportions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years the framework of learning from label proportions (LLP) has been gaining importance in machine learning. In this setting, the training examples are aggregated into subsets or bags and only the average label per bag is available for learning an example-level predictor. This generalizes traditional PAC learning which is the special case of unit-sized bags. The computational learning aspects of LLP were studied in recent works (Saket, NeurIPS'21; Saket, NeurIPS'22) which showed algorithms and hardness for learning halfspaces in the LLP setting. In this work we focus on the intractability of LLP learning Boolean functions. Our first result shows that given a collection of bags of size at most $2$ which are consistent with an OR function, it is NP-hard to find a CNF of constantly many clauses which satisfies any constant-fraction of the bags. This is in contrast with the work of (Saket, NeurIPS'21) which gave a $(2/5)$-approximation for learning ORs using a halfspace. Thus, our result provides a separation between constant clause CNFs and halfspaces as hypotheses for LLP learning ORs.
  Next, we prove the hardness of satisfying more than $1/2 + o(1)$ fraction of such bags using a $t$-DNF (i.e. DNF where each term has $\leq t$ literals) for any constant $t$. In usual PAC learning such a hardness was known (Khot-Saket, FOCS'08) only for learning noisy ORs. We also study the learnability of parities and show that it is NP-hard to satisfy more than $(q/2^{q-1} + o(1))$-fraction of $q$-sized bags which are consistent with a parity using a parity, while a random parity based algorithm achieves a $(1/2^{q-2})$-approximation.</description>

      <title>Cosystolic Expansion of Sheaves on Posets with Applications to Good 2-Query LTCs and Lifted Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study sheaves on posets, showing that cosystolic expansion of such sheaves can be derived from local expansion conditions of the sheaf and the poset (typically a high dimensional expander). When the poset at hand is a cell complex, a sheaf on it may be thought of as generalizing coefficient groups used for defining homology and cohomology, by letting the coefficient group vary along the cell complex. Previous works established local criteria for cosystolic expansion only for simplicial complexes and with respect to constant coefficients. Cosystolic expansion of sheaves is related to property testing. We use this relation and our local criterion for cosystolic expansion to give two applications to locally testable codes (LTCs).
  First, we show the existence of good $2$-query LTCs. These codes are related to the recent good $q$-query LTCs of Dinur et. al and Panteleev-Kalachev, being the formers' so-called line codes, but we get them from a new, more illuminating perspective, namely, by realizing them as cocycle codes of sheaves over posets. We then derive their good properties directly from our criterion for cosystolic expansion.
  Second, we give a local criterion for a a lifted code (with some auxiliary structure) to be locally testable. This improves on a previous work of Dikstein et. al, where it was shown that one can obtain local testability of lifted codes from a mixture of local and global conditions.</description>

      <title>Chemically Motivated Simulation Problems are Efficiently Solvable by a Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09268v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating chemical systems is highly sought after and computationally challenging, as the simulation cost exponentially increases with the system size. Quantum computers have been proposed as a computational means to overcome this bottleneck. Most efforts recently have been spent on determining the ground states of chemical systems. Hardness results and the lack of efficient heuristics for initial-state generation sheds doubt on the feasibility. Here we propose an inherently efficient approach for solving chemical simulation problems, meaning it requires quantum circuits of size scaling polynomially in relevant system parameters. If a set of assumptions can be satisfied, our approach finds good initial states by assembling initial states for dynamical simulation in a scattering tree. We discuss a variety of quantities of chemical interest that can be measured based on quantum simulation, e.g. of a reaction, succeeding the initial state preparation.</description>
