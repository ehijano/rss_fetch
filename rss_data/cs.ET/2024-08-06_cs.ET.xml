      <title>Solid-State Oxide-Ion Synaptic Transistor for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic hardware facilitates rapid and energy-efficient training and operation of neural network models for artificial intelligence. However, existing analog in-memory computing devices, like memristors, continue to face significant challenges that impede their commercialization. These challenges include high variability due to their stochastic nature. Microfabricated electrochemical synapses offer a promising approach by functioning as an analog programmable resistor based on deterministic ion-insertion mechanisms. Here, we developed an all-solid-state oxide-ion synaptic transistor employing $\text{Bi}_2\text{V}_{0.9}\text{Cu}_{0.1}\text{O}_{5.35}$ as a superior oxide-ion conductor electrolyte and $\text{La}_\text{0.5}\text{Sr}_\text{0.5}\text{F}\text{O}_\text{3-$\delta$}$ as a variable resistance channel able to efficiently operate at temperatures compatible with conventional electronics. Our transistor exhibits essential synaptic behaviors such as long- and short-term potentiation, paired-pulse facilitation, and post-tetanic potentiation, mimicking fundamental properties of biological neural networks. Key criteria for efficient neuromorphic computing are satisfied, including excellent linear and symmetric synaptic plasticity, low energy consumption per programming pulse, and high endurance with minimal cycle-to-cycle variation. Integrated into an artificial neural network (ANN) simulation for handwritten digit recognition, the presented synaptic transistor achieved a 96% accuracy on the MNIST dataset, illustrating the effective implementation of our device in ANNs. These findings demonstrate the potential of oxide-ion based synaptic transistors for effective implementation in analog neuromorphic computing based on iontronics.</description>

      <title>Delay Conditioned Generative Modelling of Resistive Drift in Memristors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modelling of memristive devices is an essential part of the development of novel in-memory computing systems. Models are needed to enable the accurate and efficient simulation of memristor device characteristics, for purposes of testing the performance of the devices or the feasibility of their use in future neuromorphic and in-memory computing architectures. The consideration of memristor non-idealities is an essential part of any modelling approach. The nature of the deviation of memristive devices from their initial state, particularly at ambient temperature and in the absence of a stimulating voltage, is of key interest, as it dictates their reliability as information storage media - a property that is of importance for both traditional storage and neuromorphic applications. In this paper, we investigate the use of a generative modelling approach for the simulation of the delay and initial resistance-conditioned resistive drift distribution of memristive devices. We introduce a data normalisation scheme and a novel training technique to enable the generative model to be conditioned on the continuous inputs. The proposed generative modelling approach is suited for use in end-to-end training and device modelling scenarios, including learned data storage applications, due to its simulation efficiency and differentiability.</description>

      <title>Configuring Safe Spiking Neural Controllers for Cyber-Physical Systems through Formal Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a subclass of neuromorphic models that have great potential to be used as controllers in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) due to their energy efficiency. They can benefit from the prevalent approach of first training an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and then translating to an SNN with subsequent hyperparameter tuning. The tuning is required to ensure that the resulting SNN is accurate with respect to the ANN in terms of metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE). However, SNN controllers for safety-critical CPSs must also satisfy safety specifications, which are not guaranteed by the conversion approach. In this paper, we propose a solution which tunes the $temporal$ $window$ hyperparameter of the translated SNN to ensure both accuracy and compliance with the safe range specification that requires the SNN outputs to remain within a safe range. The core verification problem is modelled using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and is solved with Gurobi. When the controller fails to meet the range specification, we compute tight bounds on the SNN outputs as feedback for the CPS developer. To mitigate the high computational cost of verification, we integrate data-driven steps to minimize verification calls. Our approach provides designers with the confidence to safely integrate energy-efficient SNN controllers into modern CPSs. We demonstrate our approach with experimental results on five different benchmark neural controllers.</description>

      <title>Evaluating and Enhancing Trustworthiness of LLMs in Perception Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Today's advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), like adaptive cruise control or rear collision warning, are finding broader adoption across vehicle classes. Integrating such advanced, multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) on board a vehicle, which are capable of processing text, images, audio, and other data types, may have the potential to greatly enhance passenger comfort. Yet, an LLM's hallucinations are still a major challenge to be addressed. In this paper, we systematically assessed potential hallucination detection strategies for such LLMs in the context of object detection in vision-based data on the example of pedestrian detection and localization. We evaluate three hallucination detection strategies applied to two state-of-the-art LLMs, the proprietary GPT-4V and the open LLaVA, on two datasets (Waymo/US and PREPER CITY/Sweden). Our results show that these LLMs can describe a traffic situation to an impressive level of detail but are still challenged for further analysis activities such as object localization. We evaluate and extend hallucination detection approaches when applying these LLMs to video sequences in the example of pedestrian detection. Our experiments show that, at the moment, the state-of-the-art proprietary LLM performs much better than the open LLM. Furthermore, consistency enhancement techniques based on voting, such as the Best-of-Three (BO3) method, do not effectively reduce hallucinations in LLMs that tend to exhibit high false negatives in detecting pedestrians. However, extending the hallucination detection by including information from the past helps to improve results.</description>

      <title>Qubernetes: Towards a Unified Cloud-Native Execution Platform for Hybrid Classic-Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: The emergence of quantum computing proposes a revolutionary paradigm that can radically transform numerous scientific and industrial application domains. The ability of quantum computers to scale computations beyond what the current computers are capable of implies better performance and efficiency for certain algorithmic tasks.
  Objective: However, to benefit from such improvement, quantum computers must be integrated with existing software systems, a process that is not straightforward. In this paper, we propose a unified execution model that addresses the challenges that emerge from building hybrid classical-quantum applications at scale.
  Method: Following the Design Science Research methodology, we proposed a convention for mapping quantum resources and artifacts to Kubernetes concepts. Then, in an experimental Kubernetes cluster, we conducted experiments for scheduling and executing quantum tasks on both quantum simulators and hardware.
  Results: The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed platform Qubernetes (or Kubernetes for quantum) exposes the quantum computation tasks and hardware capabilities following established cloud-native principles, allowing seamless integration into the larger Kubernetes ecosystem.
  Conclusion: The quantum computing potential cannot be realised without seamless integration into classical computing. By validating that it is practical to execute quantum tasks in a Kubernetes infrastructure, we pave the way for leveraging the existing Kubernetes ecosystem as an enabler for hybrid classical-quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This systematic review explores the viability of virtual reality (VR) technologies for enhancing learning outcomes and operational efficiency within the construction industry. This study evaluates the current integration of VR in construction education and practice. Employing the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, this review analyzed 36 peer-reviewed journal articles from databases such as the Web of Science, ERIC, and Scopus. The methodology focused on identifying, appraising, and synthesizing all relevant studies to assess the effectiveness of VR applications in construction-related fields. This review highlights that VR significantly enhances learning by providing immersive interactive simulations that improve the understanding of every complex construction process, such as structural elements or tunnel-boring machine operations. This review contributes by systematically compiling and evaluating evidence on using VR in construction, which has seen a limited comprehensive analysis. It provides practical examples of how VR can revolutionize education and work.</description>

      <title>Faculty Perspectives on the Potential of RAG in Computer Science Higher Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly impacted the field of Natural Language Processing and has transformed conversational tasks across various domains because of their widespread integration in applications and public access. The discussion surrounding the application of LLMs in education has raised ethical concerns, particularly concerning plagiarism and policy compliance. Despite the prowess of LLMs in conversational tasks, the limitations of reliability and hallucinations exacerbate the need to guardrail conversations, motivating our investigation of RAG in computer science higher education. We developed Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications for the two tasks of virtual teaching assistants and teaching aids. In our study, we collected the ratings and opinions of faculty members in undergraduate and graduate computer science university courses at various levels, using our personalized RAG systems for each course. This study is the first to gather faculty feedback on the application of LLM-based RAG in education. The investigation revealed that while faculty members acknowledge the potential of RAG systems as virtual teaching assistants and teaching aids, certain barriers and features are suggested for their full-scale deployment. These findings contribute to the ongoing discussion on the integration of advanced language models in educational settings, highlighting the need for careful consideration of ethical implications and the development of appropriate safeguards to ensure responsible and effective implementation.</description>

      <title>The Implications of Open Generative Models in Human-Centered Data Science Work: A Case Study with Fact-Checking Organizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calls to use open generative language models in academic research have highlighted the need for reproducibility and transparency in scientific research. However, the impact of generative AI extends well beyond academia, as corporations and public interest organizations have begun integrating these models into their data science pipelines. We expand this lens to include the impact of open models on organizations, focusing specifically on fact-checking organizations, which use AI to observe and analyze large volumes of circulating misinformation, yet must also ensure the reproducibility and impartiality of their work. We wanted to understand where fact-checking organizations use open models in their data science pipelines; what motivates their use of open models or proprietary models; and how their use of open or proprietary models can inform research on the societal impact of generative AI. To answer these questions, we conducted an interview study with N=24 professionals at 20 fact-checking organizations on six continents. Based on these interviews, we offer a five-component conceptual model of where fact-checking organizations employ generative AI to support or automate parts of their data science pipeline, including Data Ingestion, Data Analysis, Data Retrieval, Data Delivery, and Data Sharing. We then provide taxonomies of fact-checking organizations' motivations for using open models and the limitations that prevent them for further adopting open models, finding that they prefer open models for Organizational Autonomy, Data Privacy and Ownership, Application Specificity, and Capability Transparency. However, they nonetheless use proprietary models due to perceived advantages in Performance, Usability, and Safety, as well as Opportunity Costs related to participation in emerging generative AI ecosystems. Our work provides novel perspective on open models in data-driven organizations.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for an Efficient and Effective Malware Investigation during Cyber Incident Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research focused on enhancing post-incident malware forensic investigation using reinforcement learning RL. We proposed an advanced MDP post incident malware forensics investigation model and framework to expedite post incident forensics. We then implement our RL Malware Investigation Model based on structured MDP within the proposed framework. To identify malware artefacts, the RL agent acquires and examines forensics evidence files, iteratively improving its capabilities using Q Table and temporal difference learning. The Q learning algorithm significantly improved the agent ability to identify malware. An epsilon greedy exploration strategy and Q learning updates enabled efficient learning and decision making. Our experimental testing revealed that optimal learning rates depend on the MDP environment complexity, with simpler environments benefiting from higher rates for quicker convergence and complex ones requiring lower rates for stability. Our model performance in identifying and classifying malware reduced malware analysis time compared to human experts, demonstrating robustness and adaptability. The study highlighted the significance of hyper parameter tuning and suggested adaptive strategies for complex environments. Our RL based approach produced promising results and is validated as an alternative to traditional methods notably by offering continuous learning and adaptation to new and evolving malware threats which ultimately enhance the post incident forensics investigations.</description>

      <title>Vertiport Terminal Scheduling and Throughput Analysis for Multiple Surface Directions</title>

Abstract: Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) vehicles have gained immense popularity in the delivery drone market and are now being developed for passenger transportation in urban areas to efficiently enable Urban Air Mobility (UAM). UAM aims to utilize the urban airspace \hidetxt{vertical dimension} to address the problem of heavy road congestion in dense urban cities. VTOL vehicles require vertiport terminals for landing, take-off, passengers boarding or deboarding, refuelling (or charging), and maintenance. An efficient scheduling algorithm is essential to maximize the throughput of the vertiport terminal (vertiminal)\hidetxt{ as well as efficient use of airspace} while maintaining safety protocols to handle the UAM traffic. While traditional departure and taxiing operations can be applied in the context of vertiminal, specific algorithms are required for take-off and landing schedules. Unlike fixed-wing aircraft that require a runway to take-off and climb in a single direction, VTOL vehicles can approach and climb in several directions. We propose a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) formulation to schedule flights for taxiing, climbing (or approaching) using multiple directions after take-off (before landing) and turnaround on gates. We also derived equations to thoroughly analyze the throughput capacity of a vertiminal considering all its core elements. We have shown that our MILP can achieve the maximum throughput obtained through the equations. Given the input parameters, our analysis can be used to analyze the capacity of a vertiminal without running any simulation, while our MILP can be used to get the most efficient schedule.</description>

      <title>Robust Qubit Mapping Algorithm via Double-Source Optimal Routing on Large Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.01306v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Qubit Mapping is a critical aspect of implementing quantum circuits on real hardware devices. Currently, the existing algorithms for qubit mapping encounter difficulties when dealing with larger circuit sizes involving hundreds of qubits. In this paper, we introduce an innovative qubit mapping algorithm, Duostra, tailored to address the challenge of implementing large-scale quantum circuits on real hardware devices with limited connectivity. Duostra operates by efficiently determining optimal paths for double-qubit gates and inserting SWAP gates accordingly to implement the double-qubit operations on real devices. Together with two heuristic scheduling algorithms, the Limitedly-Exhausitive (LE) Search and the Shortest-Path (SP) Estimation, it yields results of good quality within a reasonable runtime, thereby striving toward achieving quantum advantage. Experimental results showcase our algorithm's superiority, especially for large circuits beyond the NISQ era. For example, on large circuits with more than 50 qubits, we can reduce the mapping cost on an average 21.75% over the virtual best results among QMAP, t|ket&gt;, Qiskit and SABRE. Besides, for mid-size circuits such as the SABRE-large benchmark, we improve the mapping costs by 4.5%, 5.2%, 16.3%, 20.7%, and 25.7%, when compared to QMAP, TOQM, t|ket&gt;, Qiskit, and SABRE, respectively.</description>

Abstract: Computing nonlinear functions over multilinear forms is a general problem with applications in risk analysis. For instance in the domain of energy economics, accurate and timely risk management demands for efficient simulation of millions of scenarios, largely benefiting from computational speedups. We develop a novel hybrid quantum-classical algorithm based on polynomial approximation of nonlinear functions, computed through Quantum Hadamard Products, and we rigorously assess the conditions for its end-to-end speedup for different implementation variants against classical algorithms. In our setting, a quadratic quantum speedup, up to polylogarithmic factors, can be proven only when forms are bilinear and approximating polynomials have second degree, if efficient loading unitaries are available for the input data sets. We also enhance the bidirectional encoding, that allows tuning the balance between circuit depth and width, proposing an improved version that can be exploited for the calculation of inner products. Lastly, we exploit the dynamic circuit capabilities, recently introduced on IBM Quantum devices, to reduce the average depth of the Quantum Hadamard Product circuit. A proof of principle is implemented and validated on IBM Quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Algorithm Landscape Reconstruction by Low-Rank Tensor Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are a broad class of algorithms with many applications in science and industry. Applying a VQA to a problem involves optimizing a parameterized quantum circuit by maximizing or minimizing a cost function. A particular challenge associated with VQAs is understanding the properties of associated cost functions. Having the landscapes of VQA cost functions can greatly assist in developing and testing new variational quantum algorithms, but they are extremely expensive to compute. Reconstructing the landscape of a VQA using existing techniques requires a large number of cost function evaluations, especially when the dimension or the resolution of the landscape is high. To address this challenge, we propose a low-rank tensor-completion-based approach for local landscape reconstruction. By leveraging compact low-rank representations of tensors, our technique can overcome the curse of dimensionality and handle high-resolution landscapes. We demonstrate the power of landscapes in VQA development by showcasing practical applications of analyzing penalty terms for constrained optimization problems and examining the probability landscapes of certain basis states.</description>

Abstract: The advent of immersive Virtual Reality applications has transformed various domains, yet their integration with advanced artificial intelligence technologies like Visual Language Models remains underexplored. This study introduces a pioneering approach utilizing VLMs within VR environments to enhance user interaction and task efficiency. Leveraging the Unity engine and a custom-developed VLM, our system facilitates real-time, intuitive user interactions through natural language processing, without relying on visual text instructions. The incorporation of speech-to-text and text-to-speech technologies allows for seamless communication between the user and the VLM, enabling the system to guide users through complex tasks effectively. Preliminary experimental results indicate that utilizing VLMs not only reduces task completion times but also improves user comfort and task engagement compared to traditional VR interaction methods.</description>

      <title>MunchSonic: Tracking Fine-grained Dietary Actions through Active Acoustic Sensing on Eyeglasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce MunchSonic, an AI-powered active acoustic sensing system integrated into eyeglasses to track fine-grained dietary actions. MunchSonic emits inaudible ultrasonic waves from the eyeglass frame, with the reflected signals capturing detailed positions and movements of body parts, including the mouth, jaw, arms, and hands involved in eating. These signals are processed by a deep learning pipeline to classify six actions: hand-to-mouth movements for food intake, chewing, drinking, talking, face-hand touching, and other activities (null). In an unconstrained study with 12 participants, MunchSonic achieved a 93.5% macro F1-score in a user-independent evaluation with a 2-second resolution in tracking these actions, also demonstrating its effectiveness in tracking eating episodes and food intake frequency within those episodes.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN) is a theoretical framework addressing data fragmentation and siloing challenges, enabling scalable AI through data sovereignty. It facilitates effective AI utilization within sovereign networks by overcoming barriers to accessing diverse data sources, leveraging: 1) personal data stores to ensure data sovereignty, where data remains securely within Participants' control; 2) a scalable federated learning protocol implemented on a public blockchain for decentralized AI training, where only model parameter updates are shared, keeping data within the personal data stores; and 3) a scalable, trustless cryptographic rewards mechanism on a public blockchain to incentivize participation and ensure fair reward distribution through a decentralized auditing protocol. This approach guarantees that no entity can prevent or control access to training data or influence financial benefits, as coordination and reward distribution are managed on the public blockchain with an immutable record. The framework supports effective AI training by allowing Participants to maintain control over their data, benefit financially, and contribute to a decentralized, scalable ecosystem that leverages collective AI to develop beneficial algorithms.</description>

      <title>Towards Enabling 5G-NTN Satellite Communications for Manned and Unmanned Rotary Wing Aircraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Satellite Communications (SatCom) are a backbone of worldwide development. In contrast with the past, when the GEO satellites were the only means for such connectivity, nowadays the multi-orbital connectivity is emerging, especially with the use of satellite constellations. Simultaneously, SatCom enabled the so-called In-Flight Connectivity, while with the advent of 5G-NTN, the development of this market is being accelerated. However, there are still various missing points before such a technology becomes mainstream, especially in the case of Rotary Wing Aircraft (RWA). Indeed, due to their particular characteristics, such as the low altitude flights and the blade interference, there are still open challenges. In this work, an End-to-End (E2E) analysis for the performance of SatCom under 5G-NTN for manned and unmanned RWA is performed. Various scenarios are examined, and related requirements are shown. The effects of blades and other characteristics of the RWA are established, and simulations for these cases are developed. Results along with related discussion are presented, while future directions for development are suggested. This work is part of the ESA ACROSS-AIR project.</description>

      <title>Sparks of Quantum Advantage and Rapid Retraining in Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16020v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of quantum computing holds the potential to revolutionize various fields by solving complex problems more efficiently than classical computers. Despite this promise, practical quantum advantage is hindered by current hardware limitations, notably the small number of qubits and high noise levels. In this study, we leverage adiabatic quantum computers to optimize Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, a powerful neural network architecture for representing complex functions with minimal parameters. By modifying the network to use Bezier curves as the basis functions and formulating the optimization problem into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problem, we create a fixed-sized solution space, independent of the number of training samples. This strategy allows for the optimization of an entire neural network in a single training iteration in which, due to order of operations, a majority of the processing is done using a collapsed version of the training dataset. This inherently creates extremely fast training speeds, which are validated experimentally, compared to classical optimizers including Adam, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Adaptive Gradient, and simulated annealing. Additionally, we introduce a novel rapid retraining capability, enabling the network to be retrained with new data without reprocessing old samples, thus enhancing learning efficiency in dynamic environments. Experiments on retraining demonstrate a hundred times speed up using adiabatic quantum computing based optimization compared to that of the gradient descent based optimizers, with theoretical models allowing this speed up to be much larger! Our findings suggest that with further advancements in quantum hardware and algorithm optimization, quantum-optimized machine learning models could have broad applications across various domains, with initial focus on rapid retraining.</description>

      <title>An Alternative to Multi-Factor Authentication with a Triple-Identity Authentication Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Every user authentication scheme involves three login credentials, i.e. a username, a password and a hash value, but only one of them is associated with a user identity. However, this single identity is not robust enough to protect the whole system and the login entries (i.e., the username and password forms) have not been effectively authenticated. Therefore, a multi-factor authentication service is utilized to help guarantee the account security by transmitting a second factor to the user to use. If more identities can be employed for the two login forms to associate with all login credentials, and if the corresponding identifiers are not transmitted via the network and operated by users, such a system can be more robust even without relying on a third-party service. To this end, a triple-identity authentication scheme is designed within a dual-password login-authentication system, which defines identities for the username and the login password, respectively. Therefore, in addition to the traditional server verification, the system can verify the identifiers at the username and password forms in succession. In the triple-identity authentication, the identifiers are entirely managed by the system without involvement of users or any third-party service, and they are concealed, incommunicable, inaccessible and independent of personal information. Thus, they are useless in online attacks.</description>

      <title>Nomadic Non-Public Networks for 6G: Use Cases and Key Performance Indicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The landscape of wireless communication systems is evolving rapidly, with a pivotal role envisioned for dynamic network structures and self-organizing networks in upcoming technologies like the 6G mobile communications standard. This evolution is fueled by the growing demand from diverse sectors, including industry, manufacturing, agriculture, and the public sector, each with increasingly specific requirements. The establishment of non-public networks in the current 5G standard has laid a foundation, enabling independent operation within certain frequencies and local limitations, notably for Internet of Things applications. This paper explores the progression from non-public networks to nomadic non-public networks and their significance in the context of the forthcoming 6G era.
  Building on existing work in dynamic network structures, non-public networks regulations, and alternative technological solutions, this paper introduces specific use cases enhanced by nomadic networks. In addition, relevant Key Performance Indicators are discussed on the basis of the presented use cases. These serve as a starting point for the definition of requirement clusters and thus for a evaluation metric of nomadic non-public networks. This work lays the groundwork for understanding the potential of nomadic non-public networks in the dynamic landscape of 6G wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Robust Implementation of Discrete-time Quantum Walks in Any Finite-dimensional Quantum System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Research has shown that quantum walks can accelerate certain quantum algorithms and act as a universal paradigm for quantum processing. The discrete-time quantum walk (DTQW) model, owing to its discrete nature, stands out as one of the most suitable choices for circuit implementation. Nevertheless, most current implementations are characterized by extensive, multi-layered quantum circuits, leading to higher computational expenses and a notable decrease in the number of confidently executable time steps on current quantum computers. Since quantum computers are not scalable enough in this NISQ era, we also must confine ourselves to the ancilla-free frontier zone. Therefore, in this paper, we have successfully cut down the circuit cost concerning gate count and circuit depth by half through our proposed methodology in qubit systems as compared to the state-of-the-art increment-decrement approach. Furthermore, for the engineering excellence of our proposed approach, we implement DTQW in any finite-dimensional quantum system with akin efficiency. To ensure an efficient implementation of quantum walks without requiring ancilla, we have incorporated an intermediate qudit technique for decomposing multi-qubit gates. Experimental outcomes hold significance far beyond the realm of just a few time steps, laying the groundwork for dependable implementation and utilization on quantum computers.</description>
