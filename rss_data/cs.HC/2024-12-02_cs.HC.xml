      <title>Embracing AI in Education: Understanding the Surge in Large Language Model Use by Secondary Students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impressive essay writing and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's ChatGPT have opened up new avenues in education. Our goal is to gain insights into the widespread use of LLMs among secondary students to inform their future development. Despite school restrictions, our survey of over 300 middle and high school students revealed that a remarkable 70% of students have utilized LLMs, higher than the usage percentage among young adults, and this percentage remains consistent across 7th to 12th grade. Students also reported using LLMs for multiple subjects, including language arts, history, and math assignments, but expressed mixed thoughts on their effectiveness due to occasional hallucinations in historical contexts and incorrect answers for lack of rigorous reasoning. The survey feedback called for LLMs better adapted for students, and also raised questions to developers and educators on how to help students from underserved communities leverage LLMs' capabilities for equal access to advanced education resources. We propose a few ideas to address such issues, including subject-specific models, personalized learning, and AI classrooms.</description>

      <title>OSU-Wing PIC Phase I Evaluation: Baseline Workload and Situation Awareness Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The common theory is that human pilot's performance degrades when responsible for an increased number of uncrewed aircraft systems (UAS). This theory was developed in the early 2010's for ground robots and not highly autonomous UAS. It has been shown that increasing autonomy can mitigate some performance impacts associated with increasing the number of UAS. Overall, the Oregon State University-Wing collaboration seeks to understand what factors negatively impact a pilot's ability to maintain responsibility and control over an assigned set of active UAS. The Phase I evaluation establishes baseline data focused on the number of UAS and the number of nests increase. This evaluation focuses on nominal operations as well as crewed aircraft encounters and adverse weather changes. The results demonstrate that the pilots were actively engaged and had very good situation awareness. Manipulation of the conditions did not result in any significant differences in overall workload. The overall results debunk the theory that increasing the number of UAS is detrimental to pilot's performance.</description>

      <title>The Collaborative Practices and Motivations of Online Communities Dedicated to Voluntary Misinformation Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Responding to misinformation online can be an exhausting and thankless task. It takes time and energy to write effective content, puts users at risk of online harassment, and strains personal relationships. Despite these challenges, there are people who voluntarily respond to misinformation online, and some have established communities on platforms such as Reddit, Discord, and X (formerly Twitter) dedicated to these efforts. In this work, we interviewed 8 people who participate in such communities to understand the type of support they receive from each other in these discussion spaces. Interviewees described that their communities helped them sustain motivation, save time, and improve their communication skills. Common practices included sharing sources and citations, providing emotional support, giving others advice, and signaling positive feedback. We present our findings as three case studies and discuss opportunities for future work to support collaborative practices in online communities dedicated to misinformation response. Our work surfaces how resource sharing, social motivation, and decentralization can make misinformation correction more sustainable, rewarding, and effective for online citizens.</description>

      <title>ArEEG_Words: Dataset for Envisioned Speech Recognition using EEG for Arabic Words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-Computer-Interface (BCI) aims to support communication-impaired patients by translating neural signals into speech. A notable research topic in BCI involves Electroencephalography (EEG) signals that measure the electrical activity in the brain. While significant advancements have been made in BCI EEG research, a major limitation still exists: the scarcity of publicly available EEG datasets for non-English languages, such as Arabic. To address this gap, we introduce in this paper ArEEG_Words dataset, a novel EEG dataset recorded from 22 participants with mean age of 22 years (5 female, 17 male) using a 14-channel Emotiv Epoc X device. The participants were asked to be free from any effects on their nervous system, such as coffee, alcohol, cigarettes, and so 8 hours before recording. They were asked to stay calm in a clam room during imagining one of the 16 Arabic Words for 10 seconds. The words include 16 commonly used words such as up, down, left, and right. A total of 352 EEG recordings were collected, then each recording was divided into multiple 250ms signals, resulting in a total of 15,360 EEG signals. To the best of our knowledge, ArEEG_Words data is the first of its kind in Arabic EEG domain. Moreover, it is publicly available for researchers as we hope that will fill the gap in Arabic EEG research.</description>

      <title>DuetML: Human-LLM Collaborative Machine Learning Framework for Non-Expert Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models have significantly impacted various domains in our everyday lives. While large language models (LLMs) offer intuitive interfaces and versatility, task-specific ML models remain valuable for their efficiency and focused performance in specialized tasks. However, developing these models requires technical expertise, making it particularly challenging for non-expert users to customize them for their unique needs. Although interactive machine learning (IML) aims to democratize ML development through user-friendly interfaces, users struggle to translate their requirements into appropriate ML tasks. We propose human-LLM collaborative ML as a new paradigm bridging human-driven IML and machine-driven LLM approaches. To realize this vision, we introduce \systemname, a framework that integrates multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as interactive agents collaborating with users throughout the ML process. Our system carefully balances MLLM capabilities with user agency by implementing both reactive and proactive interactions between users and MLLM agents. Through a comparative user study, we demonstrate that \systemname enables non-expert users to define training data that better aligns with target tasks without increasing cognitive load, while offering opportunities for deeper engagement with ML task formulation.</description>

      <title>Study on the Influence of Embodied Avatars on Gait Parameters in Virtual Environments and Real World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we compare the virtual and real gait parameters to investigate the effect of appearances of embodied avatars and virtual reality experience on gait in physical and virtual environments. We developed a virtual environment simulation and gait detection system for analyzing gait. The system transfers real-life scenarios into a realistic presentation in the virtual environment and provides look-alike same-age and old-age avatars for participants. We conducted an empirical study and used subjective questionnaires to evaluate participants' feelings about the virtual reality experience. Also, the paired sample t-test and neural network were implemented to analyze gait differences. The results suggest that there are disparities in gait between virtual and real environments. Also, the appearance of embodied avatars could influence the gait parameters in the virtual environment. Moreover, the experience of embodying old-age avatars affects the gait in the real world.</description>

      <title>A Unified Platform for At-Home Post-Stroke Rehabilitation Enabled by Wearable Technologies and Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At-home rehabilitation for post-stroke patients presents significant challenges, as continuous, personalized care is often limited outside clinical settings. Additionally, the absence of comprehensive solutions addressing diverse rehabilitation needs in home environments complicates recovery efforts. Here, we introduce a smart home platform that integrates wearable sensors, ambient monitoring, and large language model (LLM)-powered assistance to provide seamless health monitoring and intelligent support. The system leverages machine learning enabled plantar pressure arrays for motor recovery assessment (94% classification accuracy), a wearable eye-tracking module for cognitive evaluation, and ambient sensors for precise smart home control (100% operational success, &lt;1 s latency). Additionally, the LLM-powered agent, Auto-Care, offers real-time interventions, such as health reminders and environmental adjustments, enhancing user satisfaction by 29%. This work establishes a fully integrated platform for long-term, personalized rehabilitation, offering new possibilities for managing chronic conditions and supporting aging populations.</description>

      <title>ComViewer: An Interactive Visual Tool to Help Viewers Seek Social Support in Online Mental Health Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online mental health communities (OMHCs) offer rich posts and comments for viewers, who do not directly participate in the communications, to seek social support from others' experience. However, viewers could face challenges in finding helpful posts and comments and digesting the content to get needed support, as revealed in our formative study (N=10). In this work, we present an interactive visual tool named ComViewer to help viewers seek social support in OMHCs. With ComViewer, viewers can filter posts of different topics and find supportive comments via a zoomable circle packing visual component that adapts to searched keywords. Powered by LLM, ComViewer supports an interactive sensemaking process by enabling viewers to interactively highlight, summarize, and question any community content. A within-subjects study (N=20) demonstrates ComViewer's strengths in providing viewers with a more simplified, more fruitful, and more engaging support-seeking experience compared to a baseline OMHC interface without ComViewer. We further discuss design implications for facilitating information-seeking and sense making in online mental health communities.</description>

      <title>Habit Coach: Customising RAG-based chatbots to support behavior change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the iterative development of Habit Coach, a GPT-based chatbot designed to support users in habit change through personalized interaction. Employing a user-centered design approach, we developed the chatbot using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, which enables behavior personalization without retraining the underlying language model (GPT-4). The system leverages document retrieval and specialized prompts to tailor interactions, drawing from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and narrative therapy techniques. A key challenge in the development process was the difficulty of translating declarative knowledge into effective interaction behaviors. In the initial phase, the chatbot was provided with declarative knowledge about CBT via reference textbooks and high-level conversational goals. However, this approach resulted in imprecise and inefficient behavior, as the GPT model struggled to convert static information into dynamic and contextually appropriate interactions. This highlighted the limitations of relying solely on declarative knowledge to guide chatbot behavior, particularly in nuanced, therapeutic conversations. Over four iterations, we addressed this issue by gradually transitioning towards procedural knowledge, refining the chatbot's interaction strategies, and improving its overall effectiveness. In the final evaluation, 5 participants engaged with the chatbot over five consecutive days, receiving individualized CBT interventions. The Self-Report Habit Index (SRHI) was used to measure habit strength before and after the intervention, revealing a reduction in habit strength post-intervention. These results underscore the importance of procedural knowledge in driving effective, personalized behavior change support in RAG-based systems.</description>

      <title>Generative AI as a Tool or Leader? Exploring AI-Augmented Thinking in Student Programming Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) tools in education highlights the need to understand their influence on individuals' thinking processes and agency. This research explored 20 university students' interaction with GAI during programming. Participants completed surveys, recorded their screens during an hour-long programming session, and reflected on their GAI use. To analyse the data, we developed an AI-augmented thinking coding scheme with four dimensions: Question Formulation, Solution Development, Solution Analysis and Evaluation, and Solution Refinement. Participants were categorised into human-led and AI-led groups based on the time ratio of human-generating source code versus copying source code from GAI. T-tests indicated that the human-led group spent significantly more time on Solution Development and Solution Refinement than the AI-led group. Sequential pattern mining revealed distinct patterns of the two groups: the human-led group often refined GAI outputs, while the AI-led group frequently relied on direct answers from GAI. Correlation analyses found that positive attitudes towards AI, critical thinking, and programming self-efficacy positively correlated with Question Formulation; critical thinking was positively related to Solution Refinement; and programming self-efficacy was negatively associated with Solution Analysis and Evaluation. This study enhances understanding of the thinking process in GAI-supported programming.</description>

      <title>Protecting Multiple Types of Privacy Simultaneously in EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A brain-computer interface (BCI) enables direct communication between the brain and an external device. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is the preferred input signal in non-invasive BCIs, due to its convenience and low cost. EEG-based BCIs have been successfully used in many applications, such as neurological rehabilitation, text input, games, and so on. However, EEG signals inherently carry rich personal information, necessitating privacy protection. This paper demonstrates that multiple types of private information (user identity, gender, and BCI-experience) can be easily inferred from EEG data, imposing a serious privacy threat to BCIs. To address this issue, we design perturbations to convert the original EEG data into privacy-protected EEG data, which conceal the private information while maintaining the primary BCI task performance. Experimental results demonstrated that the privacy-protected EEG data can significantly reduce the classification accuracy of user identity, gender and BCI-experience, but almost do not affect at all the classification accuracy of the primary BCI task, enabling user privacy protection in EEG-based BCIs.</description>

      <title>Unimib Assistant: designing a student-friendly RAG-based chatbot for all their needs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural language processing skills of Large Language Models (LLMs) are unprecedented, having wide diffusion and application in different tasks. This pilot study focuses on specializing ChatGPT behavior through a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using the OpenAI custom GPTs feature. The purpose of our chatbot, called Unimib Assistant, is to provide information and solutions to the specific needs of University of Milano-Bicocca (Unimib) students through a question-answering approach. We provided the system with a prompt highlighting its specific purpose and behavior, as well as university-related documents and links obtained from an initial need-finding phase, interviewing six students. After a preliminary customization phase, a qualitative usability test was conducted with six other students to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the chatbot, with the goal of improving it in a subsequent redesign phase. While the chatbot was appreciated for its user-friendly experience, perceived general reliability, well-structured responses, and conversational tone, several significant technical and functional limitations emerged. In particular, the satisfaction and overall experience of the users was impaired by the system's inability to always provide fully accurate information. Moreover, it would often neglect to report relevant information even if present in the materials uploaded and prompt given. Furthermore, it sometimes generated unclickable links, undermining its trustworthiness, since providing the source of information was an important aspect for our users. Further in-depth studies and feedback from other users as well as implementation iterations are planned to refine our Unimib Assistant.</description>

      <title>ScaleViz: Scaling Visualization Recommendation Models on Large Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated visualization recommendations (vis-rec) help users to derive crucial insights from new datasets. Typically, such automated vis-rec models first calculate a large number of statistics from the datasets and then use machine-learning models to score or classify multiple visualizations choices to recommend the most effective ones, as per the statistics. However, state-of-the art models rely on very large number of expensive statistics and therefore using such models on large datasets become infeasible due to prohibitively large computational time, limiting the effectiveness of such techniques to most real world complex and large datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel reinforcement-learning (RL) based framework that takes a given vis-rec model and a time-budget from the user and identifies the best set of input statistics that would be most effective while generating the visual insights within a given time budget, using the given model. Using two state-of-the-art vis-rec models applied on three large real-world datasets, we show the effectiveness of our technique in significantly reducing time-to visualize with very small amount of introduced error. Our approach is about 10X times faster compared to the baseline approaches that introduce similar amounts of error.</description>

      <title>Examining Multimodal Gender and Content Bias in ChatGPT-4o</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates ChatGPT-4o's multimodal content generation, highlighting significant disparities in its treatment of sexual content and nudity versus violent and drug-related themes. Detailed analysis reveals that ChatGPT-4o consistently censors sexual content and nudity, while showing leniency towards violence and drug use. Moreover, a pronounced gender bias emerges, with female-specific content facing stricter regulation compared to male-specific content. This disparity likely stems from media scrutiny and public backlash over past AI controversies, prompting tech companies to impose stringent guidelines on sensitive issues to protect their reputations. Our findings emphasize the urgent need for AI systems to uphold genuine ethical standards and accountability, transcending mere political correctness. This research contributes to the understanding of biases in AI-driven language and multimodal models, calling for more balanced and ethical content moderation practices.</description>

      <title>Mapping Public Perception of Artificial Intelligence: Expectations, Risk-Benefit Tradeoffs, and Value As Determinants for Societal Acceptance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding public perception of artificial intelligence (AI) and the tradeoffs between potential risks and benefits is crucial, as these perceptions might shape policy decisions, influence innovation trajectories for successful market strategies, and determine individual and societal acceptance of AI technologies. Using a representative sample of 1100 participants from Germany, this study examines mental models of AI. Participants quantitatively evaluated 71 statements about AI's future capabilities (e.g., autonomous driving, medical care, art, politics, warfare, and societal divides), assessing the expected likelihood of occurrence, perceived risks, benefits, and overall value. We present rankings of these projections alongside visual mappings illustrating public risk-benefit tradeoffs. While many scenarios were deemed likely, participants often associated them with high risks, limited benefits, and low overall value. Across all scenarios, 96.4% ($r^2=96.4\%$) of the variance in value assessment can be explained by perceived risks ($\beta=-.504$) and perceived benefits ($\beta=+.710$), with no significant relation to expected likelihood. Demographics and personality traits influenced perceptions of risks, benefits, and overall evaluations, underscoring the importance of increasing AI literacy and tailoring public information to diverse user needs. These findings provide actionable insights for researchers, developers, and policymakers by highlighting critical public concerns and individual factors essential to align AI development with individual values.</description>

      <title>Knowledge-Data Fusion Based Source-Free Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation for Seizure Subtype Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based seizure subtype classification enhances clinical diagnosis efficiency. Source-free semi-supervised domain adaptation (SF-SSDA), which transfers a pre-trained model to a new dataset with no source data and limited labeled target data, can be used for privacy-preserving seizure subtype classification. This paper considers two challenges in SF-SSDA for EEG-based seizure subtype classification: 1) How to effectively fuse both raw EEG data and expert knowledge in classifier design? 2) How to align the source and target domain distributions for SF-SSDA? We propose a Knowledge-Data Fusion based SF-SSDA approach, KDF-MutualSHOT, for EEG-based seizure subtype classification. In source model training, KDF uses Jensen-Shannon Divergence to facilitate mutual learning between a feature-driven Decision Tree-based model and a data-driven Transformer-based model. To adapt KDF to a new target dataset, an SF-SSDA algorithm, MutualSHOT, is developed, which features a consistency-based pseudo-label selection strategy. Experiments on the public TUSZ and CHSZ datasets demonstrated that KDF-MutualSHOT outperformed other supervised and source-free domain adaptation approaches in cross-subject seizure subtype classification.</description>

      <title>A Review of LLM-based Explanations in Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as LLaMA and ChatGPT, has opened new opportunities for enhancing recommender systems through improved explainability. This paper provides a systematic literature review focused on leveraging LLMs to generate explanations for recommendations -- a critical aspect for fostering transparency and user trust. We conducted a comprehensive search within the ACM Guide to Computing Literature, covering publications from the launch of ChatGPT (November 2022) to the present (November 2024). Our search yielded 232 articles, but after applying inclusion criteria, only six were identified as directly addressing the use of LLMs in explaining recommendations. This scarcity highlights that, despite the rise of LLMs, their application in explainable recommender systems is still in an early stage. We analyze these select studies to understand current methodologies, identify challenges, and suggest directions for future research. Our findings underscore the potential of LLMs improving explanations of recommender systems and encourage the development of more transparent and user-centric recommendation explanation solutions.</description>

      <title>SoK: Detection and Repair of Accessibility Issues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is an increasing global emphasis on information accessibility, with numerous researchers actively developing automated tools to detect and repair accessibility issues, thereby ensuring that individuals with diverse abilities can independently access software products and services. However, current research still encounters significant challenges in two key areas: the absence of a comprehensive taxonomy of accessibility issue types, and the lack of comprehensive analysis of the capabilities of detection and repair tools, as well as the status of corresponding datasets. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the Accessibility Issue Analysis (AIA) framework. Utilizing this framework, we develop a comprehensive taxonomy that categorizes 55 types of accessibility issues across four pivotal dimensions: Perceivability, Operability, Understandability, and Robustness. This taxonomy has been rigorously recognized through a questionnaire survey (n=130). Building on this taxonomy, we conduct an in-depth analysis of existing detection and repair tools, as well as the status of corresponding datasets. In terms of tools, our findings indicate that 14 detection tools can identify 31 issue types, achieving a 56.3% rate (31/55). Meanwhile, 9 repair tools address just 13 issue types, with a 23.6% rate. In terms of datasets, those for detection tools cover 21 issue types, at a 38.1% coverage rate, whereas those for repair tools cover only 7 types, at a 12.7% coverage rate.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Tricks: Automated Detection of Dark Patterns in Mobile Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mobile apps bring us many conveniences, such as online shopping and communication, but some use malicious designs called dark patterns to trick users into doing things that are not in their best interest. Many works have been done to summarize the taxonomy of these patterns and some have tried to mitigate the problems through various techniques. However, these techniques are either time-consuming, not generalisable or limited to specific patterns. To address these issues, we propose UIGuard, a knowledge-driven system that utilizes computer vision and natural language pattern matching to automatically detect a wide range of dark patterns in mobile UIs. Our system relieves the need for manually creating rules for each new UI/app and covers more types with superior performance. In detail, we integrated existing taxonomies into a consistent one, conducted a characteristic analysis and distilled knowledge from real-world examples and the taxonomy. Our UIGuard consists of two components, Property Extraction and Knowledge-Driven Dark Pattern Checker. We collected the first dark pattern dataset, which contains 4,999 benign UIs and 1,353 malicious UIs of 1,660 instances spanning 1,023 mobile apps. Our system achieves a superior performance in detecting dark patterns (micro averages: 0.82 in precision, 0.77 in recall, 0.79 in F1 score). A user study involving 58 participants further shows that \tool{} significantly increases users' knowledge of dark patterns.</description>

      <title>User Interaction Patterns and Breakdowns in Conversing with LLM-Powered Voice Assistants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional Voice Assistants (VAs) rely on traditional language models to discern user intent and respond to their queries, leading to interactions that often lack a broader contextual understanding, an area in which Large Language Models (LLMs) excel. However, current LLMs are largely designed for text-based interactions, thus making it unclear how user interactions will evolve if their modality is changed to voice. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs can enrich VA interactions via an exploratory study with participants (N=20) using a ChatGPT-powered VA for three scenarios (medical self-diagnosis, creative planning, and discussion) with varied constraints, stakes, and objectivity. We observe that LLM-powered VA elicits richer interaction patterns that vary across tasks, showing its versatility. Notably, LLMs absorb the majority of VA intent recognition failures. We additionally discuss the potential of harnessing LLMs for more resilient and fluid user-VA interactions and provide design guidelines for tailoring LLMs for voice assistance.</description>

      <title>What is Beautiful is Still Good: The Attractiveness Halo Effect in the era of Beauty Filters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The impact of cognitive biases on decision-making in the digital world remains under-explored despite its well-documented effects in physical contexts. This study addresses this gap by investigating the attractiveness halo effect using AI-based beauty filters. We conduct a large-scale online user study involving 2,748 participants who rated facial images from a diverse set of 462 distinct individuals in two conditions: original and attractive after applying a beauty filter. Our study reveals that the same individuals receive statistically significantly higher ratings of attractiveness and other traits, such as intelligence and trustworthiness, in the attractive condition. We also study the impact of age, gender, and ethnicity and identify a weakening of the halo effect in the beautified condition, resolving conflicting findings from the literature and suggesting that filters could mitigate this cognitive bias. Finally, our findings raise ethical concerns regarding the use of beauty filters.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Agent Dual Dialogue System to Support Mental Health Care Providers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a general-purpose, human-in-the-loop dual dialogue system to support mental health care professionals. The system, co-designed with care providers, is conceptualized to assist them in interacting with care seekers rather than functioning as a fully automated dialogue system solution. The AI assistant within the system reduces the cognitive load of mental health care providers by proposing responses, analyzing conversations to extract pertinent themes, summarizing dialogues, and recommending localized relevant content and internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy exercises. These functionalities are achieved through a multi-agent system design, where each specialized, supportive agent is characterized by a large language model. In evaluating the multi-agent system, we focused specifically on the proposal of responses to emotionally distressed care seekers. We found that the proposed responses matched a reasonable human quality in demonstrating empathy, showing its appropriateness for augmenting the work of mental health care providers.</description>

      <title>Micro Hand Gesture Recognition System Using Ultrasonic Active Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00216</link>
      <description>arXiv:1712.00216v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a micro hand gesture recognition system and methods using ultrasonic active sensing. This system uses micro dynamic hand gestures for recognition to achieve human-computer interaction (HCI). The implemented system, called hand-ultrasonic gesture (HUG), consists of ultrasonic active sensing, pulsed radar signal processing, and time-sequence pattern recognition by machine learning. We adopt lower frequency (300 kHz) ultrasonic active sensing to obtain high resolution range-Doppler image features. Using high quality sequential range-Doppler features, we propose a state-transition-based hidden Markov model for gesture recognition. This method achieves a recognition accuracy of nearly 90\% by using symbolized range-Doppler features and significantly reduces the computational complexity and power consumption. Furthermore, to achieve higher classification accuracy, we utilize an end-to-end neural network model and obtain a recognition accuracy of 96.32\%. In addition to offline analysis, a real-time prototype is released to verify our method's potential for application in the real world.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.13397v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human mesh recovery (HMR) provides rich human body information for various real-world applications. While image-based HMR methods have achieved impressive results, they often struggle to recover humans in dynamic scenarios, leading to temporal inconsistencies and non-smooth 3D motion predictions due to the absence of human motion. In contrast, video-based approaches leverage temporal information to mitigate this issue. In this paper, we present DiffMesh, an innovative motion-aware Diffusion-like framework for video-based HMR. DiffMesh establishes a bridge between diffusion models and human motion, efficiently generating accurate and smooth output mesh sequences by incorporating human motion within the forward process and reverse process in the diffusion model. Extensive experiments are conducted on the widely used datasets (Human3.6M \cite{h36m_pami} and 3DPW \cite{pw3d2018}), which demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our DiffMesh. Visual comparisons in real-world scenarios further highlight DiffMesh's suitability for practical applications.</description>

      <title>A Computational Framework for Behavioral Assessment of LLM Therapists</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT has increased interest in their use as therapists to address mental health challenges and the widespread lack of access to care. However, experts have emphasized the critical need for systematic evaluation of LLM-based mental health interventions to accurately assess their capabilities and limitations. Here, we propose BOLT, a proof-of-concept computational framework to systematically assess the conversational behavior of LLM therapists. We quantitatively measure LLM behavior across 13 psychotherapeutic approaches with in-context learning methods. Then, we compare the behavior of LLMs against high- and low-quality human therapy. Our analysis based on Motivational Interviewing therapy reveals that LLMs often resemble behaviors more commonly exhibited in low-quality therapy rather than high-quality therapy, such as offering a higher degree of problem-solving advice when clients share emotions. However, unlike low-quality therapy, LLMs reflect significantly more upon clients' needs and strengths. Our findings caution that LLM therapists still require further research for consistent, high-quality care.</description>

Abstract: Digital education has gained popularity in the last decade, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic. With the improving capabilities of large language models to reason and communicate with users, envisioning intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) that can facilitate self-learning is not very far-fetched. One integral component to fulfill this vision is the ability to give accurate and effective feedback via hints to scaffold the learning process. In this survey article, we present a comprehensive review of prior research on hint generation, aiming to bridge the gap between research in education and cognitive science, and research in AI and Natural Language Processing. Informed by our findings, we propose a formal definition of the hint generation task, and discuss the roadmap of building an effective hint generation system aligned with the formal definition, including open challenges, future directions and ethical considerations.</description>

      <title>Scalable Exploration via Ensemble++</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13195v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalable exploration in high-dimensional, complex environments is a significant challenge in sequential decision making, especially when utilizing neural networks. Ensemble sampling, a practical approximation of Thompson sampling, is widely adopted but often suffers performance degradation due to {ensemble coupling} in shared layer architectures, leading to reduced diversity and ineffective exploration. In this paper, we introduce Ensemble++, a novel method that addresses these challenges through architectural and algorithmic innovations. To prevent ensemble coupling, Ensemble++ decouples mean and uncertainty estimation by separating the base network and ensemble components, employs a symmetrized loss function and the stop-gradient operator. To further enhance exploration, it generates richer hypothesis spaces through random linear combinations of ensemble components using continuous index sampling. Theoretically, we prove that Ensemble++ matches the regret bounds of exact Thompson sampling in linear contextual bandits while maintaining a scalable per-step computational complexity of $\tilde{O}( \log T)$. This provides the first rigorous analysis demonstrating that ensemble sampling can be an scalable and effective approximation to Thompson Sampling, closing a key theoretical gap in exploration efficiency. Empirically, we demonstrate Ensemble++'s effectiveness in both regret minimization and computational efficiency across a range of nonlinear bandit environments, including a language-based contextual bandits where the agents employ GPT backbones. Our results highlight the capability of Ensemble++ for real-time adaptation in complex environments where computational and data collection budgets are constrained. \url{https://github.com/szrlee/Ensemble_Plus_Plus}</description>

      <title>$\text{M}^\text{6}(\text{GPT})^\text{3}$: Generating Multitrack Modifiable Multi-Minute MIDI Music from Text using Genetic algorithms, Probabilistic methods and GPT Models in any Progression and Time signature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces the $\text{M}^\text{6}(\text{GPT})^\text{3}$ composer system, capable of generating complete, multi-minute musical compositions with complex structures in any time signature, in the MIDI domain from input descriptions in natural language. The system utilizes an autoregressive transformer language model to map natural language prompts to composition parameters in JSON format. The defined structure includes time signature, scales, chord progressions, and valence-arousal values, from which accompaniment, melody, bass, motif, and percussion tracks are created. We propose a genetic algorithm for the generation of melodic elements. The algorithm incorporates mutations with musical significance and a fitness function based on normal distribution and predefined musical feature values. The values adaptively evolve, influenced by emotional parameters and distinct playing styles. The system for generating percussion in any time signature utilises probabilistic methods, including Markov chains. Through both human and objective evaluations, we demonstrate that our music generation approach outperforms baselines on specific, musically meaningful metrics, offering a viable alternative to purely neural network-based systems.</description>

      <title>RadioActive: 3D Radiological Interactive Segmentation Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current interactive segmentation approaches, inspired by the success of META's Segment Anything model, have achieved notable advancements, however, they come with substantial limitations that hinder their practical application in 3D radiological scenarios. These include unrealistic human interaction requirements, such as slice-by-slice operations for 2D models on 3D data, a lack of iterative interactive refinement, and insufficient evaluation experiments. These shortcomings prevent accurate assessment of model performance and lead to inconsistent outcomes across studies. The RadioActive benchmark overcomes these challenges by offering a comprehensive and reproducible evaluation of interactive segmentation methods in realistic, clinically relevant scenarios. It includes diverse datasets, target structures, and interactive segmentation methods, and provides a flexible, extendable codebase that allows seamless integration of new models and prompting strategies. We also introduce advanced prompting techniques to enable 2D models on 3D data by reducing the needed number of interaction steps, enabling a fair comparison. We show that surprisingly the performance of slice-wise prompted approaches can match native 3D methods, despite the domain gap. Our findings challenge the current literature and highlight that models not specifically trained on medical data can outperform the current specialized medical methods. By open-sourcing RadioActive, we invite the research community to integrate their models and prompting techniques, ensuring continuous and transparent evaluation of interactive segmentation models in 3D medical imaging.</description>

      <title>The Hermeneutic Turn of AI: Are Machines Capable of Interpreting?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article aims to demonstrate how the approach to computing is being disrupted by deep learning (artificial neural networks), not only in terms of techniques but also in our interactions with machines. It also addresses the philosophical tradition of hermeneutics (Don Ihde, Wilhelm Dilthey) to highlight a parallel with this movement and to demystify the idea of human-like AI.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model-Brained GUI Agents: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: GUIs have long been central to human-computer interaction, providing an intuitive and visually-driven way to access and interact with digital systems. The advent of LLMs, particularly multimodal models, has ushered in a new era of GUI automation. They have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in natural language understanding, code generation, and visual processing. This has paved the way for a new generation of LLM-brained GUI agents capable of interpreting complex GUI elements and autonomously executing actions based on natural language instructions. These agents represent a paradigm shift, enabling users to perform intricate, multi-step tasks through simple conversational commands. Their applications span across web navigation, mobile app interactions, and desktop automation, offering a transformative user experience that revolutionizes how individuals interact with software. This emerging field is rapidly advancing, with significant progress in both research and industry.
  To provide a structured understanding of this trend, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of LLM-brained GUI agents, exploring their historical evolution, core components, and advanced techniques. We address research questions such as existing GUI agent frameworks, the collection and utilization of data for training specialized GUI agents, the development of large action models tailored for GUI tasks, and the evaluation metrics and benchmarks necessary to assess their effectiveness. Additionally, we examine emerging applications powered by these agents. Through a detailed analysis, this survey identifies key research gaps and outlines a roadmap for future advancements in the field. By consolidating foundational knowledge and state-of-the-art developments, this work aims to guide both researchers and practitioners in overcoming challenges and unlocking the full potential of LLM-brained GUI agents.</description>
