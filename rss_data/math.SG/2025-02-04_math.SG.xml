      <title>Floerfolds and Floer functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we introduce the notion of Floer function which has the property that the Hessian is a Fredholm operator of index zero in a scale of Hilbert spaces. Since the Hessian has a complicated transformation under chart transition, in general this is not an intrinsic condition. Therefore we introduce the concept of Floerfolds for which we show that the notion of Floer function is intrinsic.</description>

      <title>A remark on Hofer-like geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the flux group nullifies the influence of the flux homomorphism in the study of the Hofer-like geometry of the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms. Consequently, the Hofer-like norm and the usual Hofer norm coincide on the group of all Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms. This resolves Banyaga's conjecture and enhances the existing proofs of the conjecture. As a result, several findings within the theory of Hofer-like geometry can be derived directly from their Hamiltonian analogs, eliminating the need for any sophisticated tools.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Calabi-Yau Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to develop the theory of Courant algebroids with integrable para-Hermitian vector bundle structures by invoking the theory of Lie bialgebroids. We consider the case where the underlying manifold has an almost para-complex structure, and use this to define a notion of para-holomorphic algebroid. We investigate connections on para-holomorphic algebroids and determine an appropriate sense in which they can be para-complex. Finally, we show through a series of examples how the theory of exact para-holomorphic algebroids with a para-complex connection is a generalization of both para-K\"{a}hler geometry and the theory of Poisson-Lie groups.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian dynamics and geometry on the two-plectic six-sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the two-plectic geometry of the six-sphere induced by pulling back a canonical $G_2$-invariant three-form from $\mathbb{R}^7$ . Notably we explicitly prove non-flatness of this structure and show that its infinitesimal automorphisms are given by the exceptional Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}_2$. Several interesting classes of solutions of the dynamical Hamilton-de Donder-Weyl equations with one- and two-dimensional sources are exhibited.</description>

      <title>Microsheaves from Hitchin fibers via Floer theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.13571v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fix a non-stacky component of the moduli of stable Higgs bundles, on which the Hitchin fibration is proper. We show that any smooth Hitchin fiber determines a microsheaf on the global nilpotent cone, that distinct fibers give rise to orthogonal microsheaves, and that the endomorphisms of the microsheaf is isomorphic to the cohomology of the Hitchin fiber. These results are consequences of recent advances in Floer theory. Natural constructions on our microsheaves provide plausible candidates for Hecke eigensheaves for the geometric Langlands correspondence.</description>

      <title>A comparison of categorical and topological entropies on Weinstein manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.14597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $W$ be a symplectic manifold, and let $\phi:W \to W$ be a symplectic automorphism. Then, $\phi$ induces an auto-equivalence $\Phi$ defined on the Fukaya category of $W$. In this paper, we prove that the categorical entropy of $\Phi$ bounds the topological entropy of $\phi$ from below where $W$ is a Weinstein manifold and $\phi$ is compactly supported. Moreover, being motivated by the work of Cineli, Ginzburg, and Gurel, we propose a conjecture which generalizes a result in dynamical system.</description>

      <title>Recovering generalized homology from Floer homology: the complex oriented case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02776v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We associate an invariant called the completed Tate cohomology to a filtered circle-equivariant spectrum and a complex oriented cohomology theory. We show that when the filtered spectrum is the spectral symplectic cohomology of a Liouville manifold, this invariant depends only on the stable homotopy type of the underlying manifold. We make explicit computations for several complex oriented cohomology theories, including Eilenberg-Maclane spectra, Morava K-theories, their integral counterparts, and complex K-theory. We show that the result for Eilenberg-Maclane spectra depends only on the rational homology, and we use the computations for Morava K-theory to recover the integral homology (as an ungraded group). In a different direction, we use the completed Tate cohomology computations for the complex K-theory to recover the complex K-theory of the underlying manifold from its equivariant filtered Floer homotopy type. A key Floer theoretic input is the computation of local equivariant Floer theory near the orbit of an autonomous Hamiltonian, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Morse homology and equivariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop methods for calculating equivariant homology from equivariant Morse functions on a closed manifold with the action of a finite group. We show how to alter $G$-equivariant Morse functions to a stable one, where the descending manifold from a critical point $p$ has the same stabilizer group as $p$, giving a better-behaved cell structure on $M$. For an equivariant, stable Morse function, we show that a generic equivariant metric satisfies the Morse--Smale condition.
  In the process, we give a proof that a generic equivariant function is Morse, and that equivariant, stable Morse functions form a dense subset in the $C^0$-topology within the space of all equivariant functions.
  Finally, we give an expository account of equivariant homology and cohomology theories, as well as their interaction with Morse theory. We show that any equivariant Morse function gives a filtration of $M$ that induces a Morse spectral sequence, computing the equivariant homology of $M$ from information about how the stabilizer group of a critical point acts on its tangent space. In the case of a stable Morse function, we show that this can be further reduced to a Thom-Smale-Witten complex.</description>
