      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the notion of sectional number of a group homomorphism, leading to a generalization of the covering number of a group, and present several characterizations when the sectional number is finite, providing estimates for computing this invariant.</description>

      <title>On the structure and skeletals of principal ideal graphs of inverse semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The principal left ideal graph of a semigroup is a simple graph whose vertices are the non-zero elements of the semigroup, and two vertices are adjacent if their principal left ideals intersect non-trivially. In this paper, we study the structure of the principal ideal graphs of inverse semigroups, particularly symmetric inverse semigroups. We also introduce the concept of skeletal of a graph and show that the principal ideal graph of an inverse semigroup has a skeletal, which is a simple graph with vertex set as $\mathcal{L}$ classes of non-zero elements. It is also proved that the principal ideal graph of symmetric inverse semigroups has a skeletal which is isomorphic to the intersection graph on the power set of a non-empty set.</description>

      <title>Parabolic Normalizers in Finite Coxeter Groups as Subdirect Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the structure of the normalizer $N_W(P)$ of a parabolic subgroup $P$ in a finite Coxeter group $W$, originally described by Howlett. Building on Howlett's Lemma, which provides canonical complements for reflection subgroups, and inspired by a recent construction of Serre for involution centralizers, we refine this understanding by interpreting $N_W(P)$ as a subdirect product via Goursat's Lemma. Central to our approach is a Galois connection on the lattice of parabolic subgroups, which leads to a new decomposition \begin{align*} N_W(P) \cong (P \times Q) \rtimes ((A \times B) \rtimes C)\text, \end{align*} where each subgroup reflects a structural feature of the ambient Coxeter system. This perspective yields a more symmetric description of $N_W(P)$, organized around naturally associated reflection subgroups on mutually orthogonal subspaces of the reflection representation of $W$. Our analysis provides new conceptual clarity and includes a case-by-case classification for all irreducible finite Coxeter groups.</description>

      <title>How structure groups and monoids grow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure groups and monoids of set-theoretic solutions to the Yang-Baxter Equation can be regarded as deformations of free abelian groups resp. monoids. In this work, we obtain explicit formulae for the growth series of the structure groups and monoids of transposition and dihedral quandles, and of the structure groups of permutation quandles. These quandles provide important families of YBE solutions. The intricate nature of our formulae confirms that, while preserving many nice properties of free abelian groups, even the simplest structure groups and monoids are remarkably rich objects. We also establish some structural properties and easily computable normal forms for the monoids considered.</description>

      <title>Diameter bounds for finite simple Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove strong, explicit diameter bounds for finite simple Lie algebras that parallel Babai's conjecture for finite simple groups. Specifically, we show that any nonabelian finite simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ over $\mathbf{F}_p$ has diameter $O((\log{|\mathfrak{g}|})^D)$ for $D \approx 3.21$ with respect to any generating set. For absolutely simple classical Lie algebras over $\mathbf{F}_p$, we establish the sharper bound $O(\log{|\mathfrak{g}|})$ when the Lie type is fixed and generators are chosen uniformly at random.</description>

      <title>Real spectrum and oriented Gromov equivariant compactifications of character varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The character variety $\Xi$ of a finitely generated group $\Gamma$ in $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{R})$ has many compactifications. We construct a continuous surjection from the real spectrum compactification $\Xi^{\mathrm{RSp}}$ to the oriented Gromov equivariant compactification. Our construction is based on a geometric interpretation of the elements of $\partial \Xi^{\mathrm{RSp}}$ as $\Gamma$-actions by isometries on $\mathbb{R}$-trees. We endow these $\mathbb{R}$-trees with an orientation induced by the standard orientation on the circle, which we characterize by a semialgebraic equation. Moreover, we describe the $\Gamma$-actions by orientation preserving isometries on oriented $\mathbb{R}$-trees, which arise in both compactifications, as limits of $\Gamma$-actions on the oriented hyperbolic plane, via asymptotic cones endowed with an ultralimit orientation.</description>

      <title>BNSR-Invariants of Surface Houghton Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The surface Houghton groups $\mathcal{H}_{n}$ are a family of groups generalizing Houghton groups $H_n$, which are constructed as asymptotically rigid mapping class groups. We give a complete computation of the BNSR-invariants $\Sigma^{m}(P\mathcal{H}_{n})$ of their intersection with the pure mapping class group. To do so, we prove that the associated Stein--Farley cube complex is CAT(0), and we adapt Zaremsky's method for computing the BNSR-invariants of the Houghton groups. As a consequence, we give a criterion for when subgroups of $H_n$ and $P\mathcal{H}_{n}$ having the same finiteness length as their parent group are finite index. We also discuss the failure of some of these groups to be co-Hopfian.</description>

      <title>Homology and K-theory for self-similar actions of groups and groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nekrashevych associated to each self-similar group action an ample groupoid and a $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebra. We perform complete computations of the homology of the groupoid and the K-theory of the $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebra for a myriad of examples, including the Grigorchuk group, the Grigorchuk--Erschler group, Gupta--Sidki groups, and self-similar actions of free abelian groups and lamplighter groups. The key development is the construction, for arbitrary self-similar group actions, of long exact sequences which compute the homology and K-theory in terms of the homology of the group and K-theory of the group $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebra via the transfer map and the virtual endomorphism. Results are proved more generally for self-similar groupoids. As a consequence of our results and recent results of X.~Li, we are able to show that R\"over's simple group containing the Grigorchuk group and Thompson's group $V$ is rationally acyclic but has nontrivial Schur multiplier. We prove many more R\"over--Nekrashevych groups of self-similar groups are rationally acyclic.</description>

      <title>The Topology of the Unitary Dual of Crystallography Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a procedure for generating the irreducible representations of crystallography groups in any dimension. We also furnish a strategy to investigate the topology of the unitary dual of a crystallography group using sequences of matrices. All irreducible representations (up to unitary equivalence) of the dimension 3 crystallography group 90 and some calculations involving sequences of these irreducible representations are included as a proof of concept of this procedure and strategy.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Dimension and Rigidity Results for Virtually Abelian Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finitely generated virtually abelian group. We show that the Hirsch length, $h(G)$, is equal to the nuclear dimension of its group $C^*$-algebra, $\dim_{nuc}(C^*(G))$. We then specialize our attention to a generalization of crystallographic groups dubbed \textit{crystal-like}. We demonstrate that in this scenario a \textit{point group} is well defined and the order of this point group is preserved by $C^*$-isomorphism. We close by using these tools to demonstrate that crystallographic (as a group property) is preserved by $C^*$-isomorphism. These three tools combine to prove that $2D$ crystallographic groups are $C^*$-superrigid.</description>

      <title>Finite-dimensional model spaces invariant under composition operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finite-dimensional model spaces are quotient spaces of the Hardy space on the open unit disc, determined by finite Blaschke products. Composition operators, on the other hand, act by composing Hardy space functions with analytic self-maps of the open unit disc. Both are classical and well-studied objects in the theory of analytic function spaces. In this paper, we present a complete characterization of finite-dimensional model spaces that are invariant under composition operators. Finite cyclic groups and the prime factorizations of natural numbers play a crucial role in understanding the structure of such invariant subspaces and the associated analytic self-maps.</description>
