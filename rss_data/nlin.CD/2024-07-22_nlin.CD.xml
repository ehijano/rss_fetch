      <title>Field Theoretic Renormalization Group in an Infinite-Dimensional Model of Random Surface Growth in Random Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The influence of a random environment on the dynamics of a fluctuating rough surface is investigated using a field theoretic renormalization group. The environment motion is modelled by the stochastic Navier--Stokes equation, which includes both a fluid in thermal equilibrium and a turbulent fluid. The surface is described by the generalized Pavlik's stochastic equation. As a result of fulfilling the renormalizability requirement, the model necessarily involves an infinite number of coupling constants. The one-loop counterterm is derived in an explicit closed form. The corresponding renormalization group equations demonstrate the existence of three two-dimensional surfaces of fixed points in the infinite-dimensional parameter space. If the surfaces contain IR attractive regions, the problem allows for the large-scale, long-time scaling behaviour. For the first surface (advection is irrelevant) the critical dimensions of the height field $\Delta_{h}$, the response field $\Delta_{h'}$ and the frequency $\Delta_{\omega}$ are non-universal through the dependence on the effective couplings. For the other two surfaces (advection is relevant) the dimensions are universal and they are found exactly.</description>

      <title>Quantum-classical correspondence in quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum channels describe subsystem or open system evolution. Using the classical Koopman operator that evolves functions on phase space, 4 classical Koopman channels are identified that are analogs of the 4 possible quantum channels in a bipartite setting. Thus when the complete evolution has a quantum-classical correspondence the correspondence at the level of the subunitary channels can be studied. The channels, both classical and quantum can be interpreted as noisy single particle systems. Having parallel classical and quantum operators gives us new access to study fine details of these major limiting theories. Using a coupled kicked rotor as a generic example, we contrast and compare spectra of the quantum and classical channel. The largest nontrivial mode of the quantum channel is seen to be mostly determined by the stable parts of the classical phase space, even those that are surprisingly small in relation to the scale of an effective $\hbar$. In the case when the dynamics has a significant fraction of chaos the spectrum has a prominent annular density that is approximately described by the single-ring theorem of random matrix theory, and the ring shrinks in size when the classical limit is approached. However, the eigenvalues and modes that survive the classical limit seem to be either scarred by unstable manifolds or, if they exist, stable periodic orbits.</description>

      <title>Higher-order triadic percolation on random hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a comprehensive theoretical framework combining percolation theory with nonlinear dynamics in order to study hypergraphs with a time-varying giant component. We consider in particular hypergraphs with higher-order triadic interactions that can upregulate or downregulate the hyperedges. Triadic interactions are a general type of signed regulatory interaction that occurs when a third node regulates the interaction between two other nodes. For example, in brain networks, the glia can facilitate or inhibit synaptic interactions between neurons. However, the regulatory interactions may not only occur between regulator nodes and pairwise interactions but also between regulator nodes and higher-order interactions (hyperedges), leading to higher-order triadic interactions. For instance, in biochemical reaction networks, the enzymes regulate the reactions involving multiple reactants. Here we propose and investigate higher-order triadic percolation on hypergraphs showing that the giant component can have a non-trivial dynamics. Specifically, we demonstrate that, under suitable conditions, the order parameter of this percolation problem, i.e., the fraction of nodes in the giant component, undergoes a route to chaos in the universality class of the logistic map. In hierarchical higher-order triadic percolation, we extend this paradigm in order to treat hierarchically nested triadic interactions demonstrating the non-trivial effect of their increased combinatorial complexity on the critical phenomena and the dynamical properties of the process. Finally, we consider other generalizations of the model studying the effect of considering interdependencies and node regulation instead of hyperedge regulation.</description>

      <title>Hayden-Preskill recovery in chaotic and integrable unitary circuit dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03838v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hayden-Preskill protocol probes the capability of information recovery from local subsystems after unitary dynamics. As such it resolves the capability of quantum many-body systems to dynamically implement a quantum error-correcting code. The transition to coding behavior has been mostly discussed using effective approaches, such as entanglement membrane theory. Here, we present exact results on the use of Hayden-Preskill recovery as a dynamical probe of scrambling in local quantum many-body systems. We investigate certain classes of unitary circuit models, both structured Floquet (dual-unitary) and Haar-random circuits. We discuss different dynamical signatures corresponding to information transport or scrambling, respectively, that go beyond effective approaches. Surprisingly, certain chaotic circuits transport information with perfect fidelity. In integrable dual-unitary circuits, we relate the information transmission to the propagation and scattering of quasiparticles. Using numerical and analytical insights, we argue that the qualitative features of information recovery extend away from these solvable points. Our results suggest that information recovery protocols can serve to distinguish chaotic and integrable behavior, and that they are sensitive to characteristic dynamical features, such as long-lived quasiparticles or dual-unitarity.</description>
