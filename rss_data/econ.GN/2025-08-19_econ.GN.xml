      <title>Incorporating an economic approach to production in a health system model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As computational capacity increases, it becomes possible to model health systems in greater detail. Multi-disease health system models (HSMs) represent a new development, building on individual level epidemiological models of multiple diseases and capturing how healthcare delivery systems respond to population health needs. The Thanzi la Onse (TLO) model of Malawi is the first of its kind in these respects. In this article, we discuss how we have been bringing economic concepts into the TLO model, and how we are continuing to develop this line of research. This has involved incorporating more sophisticated approaches to account for the effects of the unavailability of healthcare workers, and we are working towards establishing the role of different forms of ownership of healthcare facilities and different management practices. Not only does this broad approach make the model more flexible as a tool for understanding the impact of resource constraints, it opens up the possibility of analysing considerably richer policy scenarios; for example establishing an estimate of the health gain that could be achieved through expanding the workforce or reducing healthcare worker absence.</description>

      <title>The European Union Deforestation Regulation: The Impact on Argentina</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the potential economic impacts in Argentina of the European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), which as of January 2026 will prohibit the export to the European Union of certain raw materials and related products if they involve the use of deforested land. We estimate that the EUDR would cover around 6 billion US dollars in exported value, but only 2.84% is not compliant with the EUDR, with soy and cattle being the most affected production chains. We use a dynamic computable general equilibrium model to simulate the impact of the EUDR on the Argentine economy. If the non-compliant production cannot enter the EU market because of the EUDR, the results of the simulations suggest that the potential macroeconomic impacts are limited: GDP would be reduced by an average of 0.14% with respect to the baseline scenario. However, the potential environmental impact is greater. Deforested hectares would be reduced by 2.45% and GHG emissions by 0.19%. Notwithstanding, EUDR due diligence costs may still prevent compliant production from entering the EU market, so the total impacts could be higher.</description>

      <title>Conformity: Resolving the Trade-Off Between Performance and Synchrony in Multi-Unit Organizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-unit organizations are a form of organizations where the geographically dispersed units provide similar products or services in different markets. Deciding on an appropriate level of centralization in such organizations presents a unique challenge. One the one hand the organizations want to maintain a consistent brand identity in all units through centralized control, but on the other hand, they want to provide the units with sufficient autonomy to respond to the challenges they face locally. Traditionally, this challenge was perceived to require a trade-off between performance and organizational synchrony, with performance demanding more decentralization and synchrony requiring more centralized control. However, our research explores how organizations can potentially resolve this trade-off by promoting norms for knowledge-sharing and setting up the right communication channels, relying on the unit managers' intrinsic tendency to conform to the behavior of their peers. We build an agent-based model of an organization with multiple interdependent units facing highly similar task environments to investigate how unit managers' ability to communicate, share knowledge, and conform to peer practices might influence organizational dynamics. We find that, under specific communication network structures, increased decentralization can enhance both performance and organizational synchrony without sacrificing one or the other. Furthermore, we discover that centralization might still be preferable for synchrony if the units are interdependent.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the global production network from cross-border firm transactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Critical for policy-making and business operations, the study of global supply chains has been severely hampered by a lack of detailed data. Here we harness global firm-level transaction data covering 20m global firms, and 1 billion cross-border transactions, to infer key inputs for over 1200 products. Transforming this data to a directed network, we find that products are clustered into three large groups including textiles, chemicals and food, and machinery and metals. European industrial nations and China dominate critical intermediate products in the network such as metals, common components and tools, while industrial complexity is correlated with embeddedness in densely connected supply chains. To validate the network, we find structural similarities with two alternative product networks, one generated via LLM queries and the other derived by NAFTA to track product origins. We further detect linkages between products identified in manually mapped single sector supply chains, including electric vehicle batteries and semi-conductors. Finally, metrics derived from network structure capturing both forward and backward linkages are able to predict country-product diversification patterns with high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Evaluating sugarcane bagasse-based biochar as an economically viable catalyst for agricultural and environmental advancement in Brazil through scenario-based economic modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing global demand for sustainable agricultural practices and effective waste management has highlighted the potential of biochar as a multifaceted solution. This study evaluates the economic viability of sugarcane bagasse-based biochar in Brazil, focusing on its potential to enhance agricultural productivity and contribute to environmental sustainability. While existing literature predominantly explores the production, crop yield benefits, and carbon sequestration capabilities of biochar, there is a notable gap in comprehensive economic modeling and viability analysis for the region. This paper aims to fill this gap by employing a scenario-based economic modeling approach, incorporating relevant economic models. Findings include that biochar implementation can be economically viable for medium and large sugarcane farms (20000-50000 hectares) given the availability of funding, breaking even in about 7.5 years with an internal rate of return of 18% on average. For small farms, biochar can only be viable when applying biochar to the soil, which in all scenarios is found to be the more profitable practice by a large margin. Sensitivity analyses found that generally, biochar becomes economically feasible at biochar carbon credit prices above $120 USD/tCO2e, and at sugarcane bagasse availability percentages above 60%. While the economic models are well-grounded in existing literature, the production of biochar at the studied scales is not yet widespread, especially in Brazil and uncertainties can result. Reviewing the results, the land application scenario was found to be the most viable, and large farms saw the best results, highlighting the importance of scale to biochar operation. Small and medium farms with no land application were concluded to have no and questionable viability, respectively.</description>

      <title>From fields to fuel: analyzing the global economic and emissions potential of agricultural pellets, informed by a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agricultural residues represent a vast, underutilized resource for renewable energy. This study combines empirical analysis from 179 countries with a case study of a pelletization facility to evaluate the global potential of agricultural pelletization for fossil fuel replacement. The findings estimate a technical availability of 1.44 billion tons of crop residues suitable for pellet production, translating to a 4.5% potential displacement of global fossil fuel energy use, equating to 22 million TJ and equivalent to 917 million tons of coal annually. The economically optimized scenario projects annual savings of $163 billion and a reduction of 1.35 billion tons of CO2 equivalent in emissions. Utilizing the custom-developed CLASP-P and RECOP models, the study further demonstrates that agricultural pellets can achieve competitive pricing against conventional fossil fuels in many markets. Despite logistical and policy challenges, agricultural pelletization emerges as a scalable, market-driven pathway to support global decarbonization goals while fostering rural economic development. These results reinforce the need for targeted investment, technological advancement, and supportive policy to unlock the full potential of agricultural pellets in the renewable energy mix.</description>

      <title>Do STEM graduates fare better at times of Crises? Evidence from COVID 19 pandemic in India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I study whether and to what extent STEM college degrees offer labor market resilience during the COVID 19 shock. Both the pandemic and its nationwide lockdown affected occupations unevenly. While some jobs could adapt by switching to remote work or surging demand, others could not. Using the nationally representative high-frequency labor force survey data (2017-2023), I used a difference-in-difference strategy to compare changes in employment participation and monthly earnings between STEM and non-STEM graduates during and after the pandemic. The results suggest that individuals with a STEM college degree were more likely to be employed compared to their non-STEM counterparts during and after the pandemic period. Although STEM graduates appeared to experience higher wage growth compared to their non-STEM peers, the difference was statistically insignificant. Additional evidence on mechanisms suggests that the results are driven by the type of industries with higher share of STEM graduates, their geographical location and their career stages. The main findings were robust across alternative specifications and falsification tests.</description>

      <title>Do the rich pay their fair share? Enumerating the price of flying (and abolishing) premium air travel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Premium air travel is often associated with a disproportionately large carbon emissions footprint. This association reflects the increased space and amenities typically found in premium cabins that existing discourse suggests makes their carriage more fuel, and consequently carbon, intensive. One increasingly popular solution is disincentivizing the use of premium cabins in favor of all-economy cabins. How effective might such a policy be. To what extent. And how may the revenue impact affect travelers. We address these questions by leveraging an empirical model that integrates cabin configuration data, fuel burn profiles across various aircraft types, and multi-month airfare datasets. Our findings are threefold. First, we find that favoring entirely foregoing premium travel classes can reduce per-passenger emissions by between 8.1 and 21.5 percent, the precise figure varying based on the type of aircraft and aircraft stage length involved. Second, we observe that these emissions reductions are far less assured on a per-flight and a lifespan basis. Here, an all-economy configuration can reduce emissions by 0.45 percent or increase emissions by as much as 1.43 percent. Third, we enumerate pronounced revenue consequences associated with an all-economy configuration. This configuration produces aggregate revenue declines of between 4.92 and 23.1 percent, necessitating airfare increases of between 6 and 30 percent to maintain baseline revenue. This increase risks imposing a profound and regressive economic burden on working-class travelers who exhibit markedly higher price elasticities of demand compared to their wealthier counterparts and highlights the cross-subsidization airlines leverage to ensure the accessibility of air travel.</description>

      <title>Testing health expenditure rationing under universal healthcare coverage: the case of Italy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of (private, out-of-pocket) "health expenditure rationing", or whether out-of-pocket health expenditures are shaped by income independently of actual health needs. Using microdata from an Italian Health Interview Survey, we assess the extent to which income explains variation in private health spending, after controlling for objective health conditions, self-assessed health, and a comprehensive set of socio-demographic factors. We find that individuals in the highest income brackets spend approximately 300 euros more annually than those in the lowest. Our findings point to a structural inequity in access and highlight the need for policy measures that address not only formal coverage but also the underlying role of income in shaping healthcare use.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Task Evaluation of LLMs' Processing of Academic Text Input</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How much large language models (LLMs) can aid scientific discovery, notably in assisting academic peer review, is in heated debate. Between a literature digest and a human-comparable research assistant lies their practical application potential. We organize individual tasks that computer science studies employ in separate terms into a guided and robust workflow to evaluate LLMs' processing of academic text input. We employ four tasks in the assessment: content reproduction/comparison/scoring/reflection, each demanding a specific role of the LLM (oracle/judgmental arbiter/knowledgeable arbiter/collaborator) in assisting scholarly works, and altogether testing LLMs with questions that increasingly require intellectual capabilities towards a solid understanding of scientific texts to yield desirable solutions. We exemplify a rigorous performance evaluation with detailed instructions on the prompts. Adopting first-rate Information Systems articles at three top journals as the input texts and an abundant set of text metrics, we record a compromised performance of the leading LLM - Google's Gemini: its summary and paraphrase of academic text is acceptably reliable; using it to rank texts through pairwise text comparison is faintly scalable; asking it to grade academic texts is prone to poor discrimination; its qualitative reflection on the text is self-consistent yet hardly insightful to inspire meaningful research. This evidence against an endorsement of LLMs' text-processing capabilities is consistent across metric-based internal (linguistic assessment), external (comparing to the ground truth), and human evaluation, and is robust to the variations of the prompt. Overall, we do not recommend an unchecked use of LLMs in constructing peer reviews.</description>

      <title>Virtual Trading in Multi-Settlement Electricity Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Day-Ahead (DA) market, suppliers sell and load-serving entities (LSEs) purchase energy commitments, with both sides adjusting for imbalances between contracted and actual deliveries in the Real-Time (RT) market. We develop a supply function equilibrium model to study how virtual trading-speculating on DA-RT price spreads without physical delivery-affects market efficiency. Without virtual trading, LSEs underbid relative to actual demand in the DA market, pushing DA prices below expected RT prices. Virtual trading narrows, and in the limit of large number traders can eliminates, this price gap. However, it does not induce quantity alignment: DA-cleared demand remains below true expected demand, as price alignment makes the LSE indifferent between markets and prompts it to reduce DA bids to avoid over-purchasing. Renewable energy suppliers cannot offset these strategic distortions. We provide empirical support to our main model implications using data from the California and New York Independent System Operators.</description>

      <title>Mapping Microscopic and Systemic Risks in TradFi and DeFi: a literature review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores the formation and propagation of systemic risks across traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi), offering a comparative framework that bridges these two increasingly interconnected ecosystems. We propose a conceptual model for systemic risk formation in TradFi, grounded in well-established mechanisms such as leverage cycles, liquidity crises, and interconnected institutional exposures. Extending this analysis to DeFi, we identify unique structural and technological characteristics - such as composability, smart contract vulnerabilities, and algorithm-driven mechanisms - that shape the emergence and transmission of risks within decentralized systems. Through a conceptual mapping, we highlight risks with similar foundations (e.g., trading vulnerabilities, liquidity shocks), while emphasizing how these risks manifest and propagate differently due to the contrasting architectures of TradFi and DeFi. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of crosstagion, a bidirectional process where instability in DeFi can spill over into TradFi, and vice versa. We illustrate how disruptions such as liquidity crises, regulatory actions, or political developments can cascade across these systems, leveraging their growing interdependence. By analyzing this mutual dynamics, we highlight the importance of understanding systemic risks not only within TradFi and DeFi individually, but also at their intersection. Our findings contribute to the evolving discourse on risk management in a hybrid financial ecosystem, offering insights for policymakers, regulators, and financial stakeholders navigating this complex landscape.</description>

      <title>EXOTIC: An Exact, Optimistic, Tree-Based Algorithm for Min-Max Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Min-max optimization arises in many domains such as game theory, adversarial machine learning, etc., with gradient-based methods as a typical computational tool. Beyond convex-concave min-max optimization, the solutions found by gradient-based methods may be arbitrarily far from global optima. In this work, we present an algorithmic apparatus for computing globally optimal solutions in convex-non-concave and non-convex-concave min-max optimization. For former, we employ a reformulation that transforms it into a non-concave-convex max-min optimization problem with suitably defined feasible sets and objective function. The new form can be viewed as a generalization of Sion's minimax theorem. Next, we introduce EXOTIC-an Exact, Optimistic, Tree-based algorithm for solving the reformulated max-min problem. EXOTIC employs an iterative convex optimization solver to (approximately) solve the inner minimization and a hierarchical tree search for the outer maximization to optimistically select promising regions to search based on the approximate solution returned by convex optimization solver. We establish an upper bound on its optimality gap as a function of the number of calls to the inner solver, the solver's convergence rate, and additional problem-dependent parameters. Both our algorithmic apparatus along with its accompanying theoretical analysis can also be applied for non-convex-concave min-max optimization. In addition, we propose a class of benchmark convex-non-concave min-max problems along with their analytical global solutions, providing a testbed for evaluating algorithms for min-max optimization. Empirically, EXOTIC outperforms gradient-based methods on this benchmark as well as on existing numerical benchmark problems from the literature. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of EXOTIC by computing security strategies in multi-player games with three or more players.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have sparked expectations of unprecedented economic growth. Yet, by enabling senior workers to accomplish more tasks independently, AI may inadvertently reduce entry-level opportunities, raising concerns about how future generations will acquire essential expertise. This paper develops a model to examine how advanced automation affects the intergenerational transmission of tacit knowledge -- practical insights that resist codification and are critical for workplace success. The analysis shows that the competitive equilibrium features socially excessive automation of early-career tasks and reveals a critical trade-off: while such automation delivers immediate productivity gains, it can undermine long-term growth by hindering younger workers' acquisition of tacit skills. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest AI-driven entry-level automation could lower the long-run annual growth rate of U.S. per capita output by 0.05 to 0.35 percentage points, depending on its scale. The analysis further shows that AI co-pilots -- systems providing access to tacit-like expertise once obtained only through direct experience -- can partially offset these losses by assisting individuals who fail to develop adequate skills early in their careers. However, co-pilots are not always beneficial, as they may also weaken junior workers' incentives to engage in hands-on learning. These findings challenge the view that AI will automatically lead to higher economic growth, highlighting the need to safeguard -- or deliberately create -- entry-level opportunities to fully realize AI's potential.</description>

      <title>Quotas for scholarship recipients: an efficient race-neutral alternative to affirmative action?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17191v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since 2018, France's centralized higher education platform, Parcoursup, has implemented quotas for scholarship recipients, with program-specific thresholds based on the applicants' composition. Using difference-in-differences methods, I find that these quotas enabled scholarship students to access more selective programs, although the intention-to-treat effects remain modest. Matching methods reveal that the policy improved the scholarship students' waiting list positions relative to those of comparable non-scholarship peers, and simulations suggest that the modest effect could be attributed to the low intensity of the treatment. However, I detect no robust or lasting effects on the extensive margin of higher education access. Despite high policy salience, quotas did not affect the application behavior or pre-college investment of scholarship students, even among high achievers. These findings align with research on affirmative action, suggesting that such policies primarily benefit disadvantaged students who access selective institutions, rather than expanding total enrollment. Nevertheless, scholarship quotas demonstrate that race-neutral alternatives can effectively promote socioeconomic diversity in prestigious programs.</description>

      <title>Will Compute Bottlenecks Prevent an Intelligence Explosion?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The possibility of a rapid, "software-only" intelligence explosion brought on by AI's recursive self-improvement (RSI) is a subject of intense debate within the AI community. This paper presents an economic model and an empirical estimation of the elasticity of substitution between research compute and cognitive labor at frontier AI firms to shed light on the possibility. We construct a novel panel dataset for four leading AI labs (OpenAI, DeepMind, Anthropic, and DeepSeek) from 2014 to 2024 and fit the data to two alternative Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) production function models. Our two specifications yield divergent results: a baseline model estimates that compute and labor are substitutes, whereas a 'frontier experiments' model, which accounts for the scale of state-of-the-art models, estimates that they are complements. We conclude by discussing the limitations of our analysis and the implications for forecasting AI progress.</description>

      <title>Note on Selection Bias in Observational Estimates of Algorithmic Progress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ho et. al (2024) attempts to estimate the degree of algorithmic progress from language models. They collect observational data on language models' loss and compute over time, and argue that as time has passed, language models' algorithmic efficiency has been rising. That is, the loss achieved for fixed compute has been dropping over time. In this note, I raise one potential methodological problem with the estimation strategy. Intuitively, if part of algorithmic quality is latent, and compute choices are endogenous to algorithmic quality, then resulting estimates of algorithmic quality will be contaminated by selection bias.</description>

      <title>Multilingual hierarchical classification of job advertisements for job vacancy statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to develop a multilingual classifier and conditional probability estimator of occupation codes for online job advertisements in accordance with the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) extended with the Polish Classification of Occupations and Specializations (KZiS), which is analogous to the European Classification of Occupations. In this paper, we utilise a range of data sources, including a novel one, namely the Central Job Offers Database, which is a register of all vacancies submitted to Public Employment Offices. Their staff members code the vacancies according to the ISCO and KZiS. A hierarchical multi-class classifier has been developed based on the transformer architecture. The classifier begins by encoding the jobs found in advertisements to the widest 1-digit occupational group, and then narrows the assignment to a 6-digit occupation code. We show that incorporation of the hierarchical structure of occupations improves prediction accuracy by 1-2 percentage points, particularly for the hand-coded online job advertisements. Finally, a bilingual (Polish and English) and multilingual (24 languages) model is developed based on data translated using closed and open-source software. The open-source software is provided for the benefit of the official statistics community, with a particular focus on international comparability.</description>

      <title>Towards an Approach for Evaluating the Impact of AI Standards The use case of entity resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is intended to provide an overview of how the evaluation of standards could be applied to entity resolution, or record linkage. Data quality is of critical importance for many AI applications, and the quality of data, particularly on individuals and businesses, depends critically, in turn, on the quality of the match of entities across different files. Getting entity resolution right is important, because high quality data on entities like people or organization are essential to many AI systems; creating high quality data increasingly requires correctly classifying information that comes from different sources as generated by the same entity. But it is also very difficult because data on the same entity that are acquired from different sources are often inconsistent and have to be carefully reconciled. The use of AI, in the form of machine learning methods, is becoming increasingly important because other approaches are less applicable for modern needs. In particular, manual methods to link data are too costly and slow to scale, and probabilistic methods are inappropriate in the increasingly frequent cases where unique identifiers are not available. The particular focus is on Learning Employment Records, which is a high profile example of the value of entity resolution</description>
