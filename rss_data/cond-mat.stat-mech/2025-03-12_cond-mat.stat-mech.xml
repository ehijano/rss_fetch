      <title>Critical behavior of a programmable time-crystal lattice gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time crystals are many-body systems whose ground state spontaneously breaks time-translation symmetry and thus exhibits long-range spatiotemporal order and robust periodic motion. Using hydrodynamics, we have recently shown how an $m$th-order external packing field coupled to density fluctuations in driven diffusive fluids can induce the spontaneous emergence of time-crystalline order in the form of $m$ rotating condensates, which can be further controlled and modulated. Here we analyze this phenomenon at the microscopic level in a paradigmatic model of particle diffusion under exclusion interactions, a generalization of the weakly asymmetric simple exclusion process with a configuration-dependent field called the time-crystal lattice gas. Using extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we characterize the nonequilibrium phase transition to these complex time-crystal phases for different values of $m$, including the order parameter, the susceptibility and the Binder cumulant, from which we measure the critical exponents, which turn out to be within the Kuramoto universality class for oscillator synchronization. We also elucidate the condensates density profiles and velocities, confirming along the way a scaling property predicted for the higher-order condensate shapes in terms of first-order ones, discussing also novel possibilities for this promising route to time crystals.</description>

      <title>Diffusive hydrodynamics of hard rods from microscopics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive exact equations governing the large-scale dynamics of hard rods, including diffusive effects that go beyond ballistic transport. Diffusive corrections are the first-order terms in the hydrodynamic gradient expansion and we obtain them through an explicit microscopic calculation of the dynamics of hard rods. We show that they differ significantly from the prediction of Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics, as the correct hydrodynamics description is instead given by two coupled equations, giving respectively the evolution of the one point functions and of the connected two-point correlations. The resulting equations are time-reversible and reduce to the usual Navier-Stokes hydrodynamic equations in the limit of near-equilibrium evolution. This represents the first exact microscopic calculation showing how ballistic dynamics generates long-range correlations, in agreement with general results from the recently developed ballistic macroscopic fluctuation theory, and showing how such long range-correlations directly affect the diffusive hydrodynamic terms, in agreement with, and clarifying, recent related results.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching for Discrete Systems: Efficient Free Energy Sampling Across Lattice Sizes and Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models have advanced significantly in sampling material systems with continuous variables, such as atomistic structures. However, their application to discrete variables, like atom types or spin states, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce a Boltzmann generator built on discrete flow matching, specifically tailored for systems with discrete phase-space coordinates (e.g., the Ising model or crystalline compounds). This approach enables a single model to sample free energy surfaces over a wide temperature range with minimal training overhead. In addition, the model generation is scalable to larger lattice sizes than those in the training set. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the 2D Ising model, showing efficient and reliable free energy sampling. This framework provides a scalable and computationally efficient solution for discrete coordinate systems and can be extended to sample the alchemical degrees of freedom in crystalline compounds.</description>

      <title>Neural network learning of multi-scale and discrete temporal features in directed percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network methods are increasingly applied to solve phase transition problems, particularly in identifying critical points in non-equilibrium phase transitions, offering more convenience compared to traditional methods. In this paper, we analyze the (1+1)-dimensional and (2+1)-dimensional directed percolation models using an autoencoder network. We demonstrate that single-step configurations after reaching steady state can replace traditional full configurations for learning purposes. This approach significantly reduces data size and accelerates training time.Furthermore, we introduce a multi-input branch autoencoder network to extract shared features from systems of different sizes. The neural network is capable of learning results from finite-size scaling. By modifying the network input to include configurations at discrete time steps, the network can also capture temporal information, enabling dynamic analysis of non-equilibrium phase boundaries. Our proposed method allows for high-precision identification of critical points using both spatial and temporal features.</description>

      <title>Multi-particle-collision simulation of heat transfer in low-dimensional fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation of transport properties of confined, low-dimensional fluids can be performed efficiently by means of Multi-Particle Collision (MPC) dynamics with suitable thermal-wall boundary conditions. We illustrate the effectiveness of the method by studying dimensionality effects and size-dependence of thermal conduction, properties of crucial importance for understanding heat transfer at the micro-nanoscale. We provide a sound numerical evidence that the simple MPC fluid displays the features previously predicted from hydrodynamics of lattice systems: (1) in 1D, the thermal conductivity $\kappa$ diverges with the system size $L$ as $\kappa\sim L^{1/3}$ and its total heat current autocorrelation function $C(t)$ decays with the time $t$ as $C(t)\sim t^{-2/3}$; (2) in 2D, $\kappa$ diverges with $L$ as $\kappa\sim \mathrm{ln} (L)$ and its $C(t)$ decays with $t$ as $C(t)\sim t^{-1}$; (3) in 3D, its $\kappa$ is independent with $L$ and its $C(t)$ decays with $t$ as $C(t)\sim t^{-3/2}$. For weak interaction (the nearly integrable case) in 1D and 2D, there exists an intermediate regime of sizes where kinetic effects dominate and transport is diffusive before crossing over to expected anomalous regime. The crossover can be studied by decomposing the heat current in two contributions, which allows for a very accurate test of the predictions. In addition, we also show that upon increasing the aspect ratio of the system, there exists a dimensional crossover from 2D or 3D dimensional behavior to the 1D one. Finally, we show that an applied magnetic field renders the transport normal, indicating that pseudomomentum conservation is not sufficient for the anomalous heat conduction behavior to occur.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical autoregressive neural networks in three-dimensional statistical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregressive Neural Networks (ANN) have been recently proposed as a mechanism to improve the efficiency of Monte Carlo algorithms for several spin systems. The idea relies on the fact that the total probability of a configuration can be factorized into conditional probabilities of each spin, which in turn can be approximated by a neural network. Once trained, the ANNs can be used to sample configurations from the approximated probability distribution and to evaluate explicitly this probability for a given configuration. It has also been observed that such conditional probabilities give access to information-theoretic observables such as mutual information or entanglement entropy. So far, these methods have been applied to two-dimensional statistical systems or one-dimensional quantum systems. In this paper, we describe a generalization of the hierarchical algorithm to three spatial dimensions and study its performance on the example of the Ising model. We discuss the efficiency of the training and also describe the scaling with the system's dimensionality by comparing results for two- and three-dimensional Ising models with the same number of spins. Finally, we provide estimates of thermodynamical observables for the three-dimensional Ising model, such as the entropy and free energy in a range of temperatures across the phase transition.</description>

      <title>Fine Spectrum from Crude Analytic Bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetic line defect in the $O(N)$ model gives rise to a non-trivial one-dimensional defect conformal field theory of theoretical and experimental value. This model is considered here in $d=4-\varepsilon$ and the full spectrum of defect operators with dimensions close to one, two and three at order $\varepsilon$ is presented. The spectrum of several classes of operators of dimension close to four and operators of large charge are also discussed. Analytic bootstrap techniques are used extensively, and efficient tools to deal with the unmixing of nearly degenerate operators are developed. Integral identities are also incorporated, and it is shown that they lead to constraints on some three-point function coefficients and anomalous dimensions to order $\varepsilon^2$.</description>

      <title>Counting with the quantum alternating operator ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a variational algorithm based on the quantum alternating operator ansatz (QAOA) for the approximate solution of computationally hard counting problems. Our algorithm, dubbed VQCount, is based on the equivalence between random sampling and approximate counting and employs QAOA as a solution sampler. We first prove that VQCount improves upon previous work by reducing exponentially the number of samples needed to obtain an approximation within a multiplicative factor of the exact count. Using tensor network simulations, we then study the typical performance of VQCount with shallow circuits on synthetic instances of two #P-hard problems, positive #NAE3SAT and positive #1-in-3SAT. We employ the original quantum approximate optimization algorithm version of QAOA, as well as the Grover-mixer variant which guarantees a uniform solution probability distribution. We observe a tradeoff between QAOA success probability and sampling uniformity, which we exploit to achieve an exponential gain in efficiency over naive rejection sampling. Our results highlight the potential and limitations of variational algorithms for approximate counting.</description>

      <title>Bypassing eigenstate thermalization with experimentally accessible quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eigenstate thermalization has played a prominent role as a determiner of the validity of quantum statistical mechanics since von Neumann's early works on quantum ergodicity. However, its connection to the dynamical process of quantum thermalization relies sensitively on nondegeneracy properties of the energy spectrum, as well as detailed features of individual eigenstates that are effective only over correspondingly large timescales, rendering it generically inaccessible given practical timescales and finite experimental resources. Here, we introduce the notion of energy-band thermalization to address these limitations, which coarse-grains over energy level spacings with a finite energy resolution. We show that energy-band thermalization implies the thermalization of an observable in almost all physical states over accessible timescales without relying on microscopic properties of the energy eigenvalues or eigenstates, and conversely, can be efficiently accessed in experiments via the dynamics of a single initial state (for a given observable) with only polynomially many resources in the system size. This allows us to directly determine thermalization, including in the presence of conserved charges, from this state: Most strikingly, if an observable thermalizes in this initial state over a finite range of times, then it must thermalize in almost all physical initial states over all longer timescales. As applications, we derive a finite-time Mazur-Suzuki inequality for quantum transport with approximately conserved charges, and establish the thermalization of local observables over finite timescales in almost all accessible states in (generally inhomogeneous) dual-unitary quantum circuits. We also propose measurement protocols for general many-qubit systems. This work initiates a rigorous treatment of quantum thermalization in terms of experimentally accessible quantities.</description>

Abstract: The birth, life, and death of Maxwell's demon provoked a profound discussion about the interplay between thermodynamics, computation, and information. Even after its exorcism, the demon continues to inspire a multidisciplinary field.

      <description>arXiv:2503.07747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A powerful way to guarantee the absence of a sign problem in determinantal quantum Monte Carlo simulations is imposing a particular type of anti-unitary symmetries. It is shown that these same symmetries give rise to constraints on correlation functions, which can be used to identify local operators whose correlations upper bound those of a large class of physically relevant operators, including for example superconducting order parameters. Our results also help understand why it is difficult to realize generic finite-momentum orders in sign problem-free models.</description>

      <title>Heat-to-motion conversion for quantum active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a model of an active quantum particle and discuss its properties. The particle has a set of internal states that mediate exchanges of heat with external reservoirs. Heat is then converted into motion by means of a spin-orbit term that couples internal and translational degrees of freedom. The quantum features of the active particle manifest both in the motion and in the heat-to-motion conversion. Furthermore, the stochastic nature of heat exchanges impacts the motion of the active particle and fluctuations can be orders of magnitude larger than the average values. The combination of spin-orbit interaction under nonequilibrium driving may bring active matter into the realm of cold atomic gases where our proposal can be implemented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability (KDQ) distribution associated to the stochastic instances of internal energy variations for the quantum system and environment particles in coherent Markovian collision models. In the case the interactions between the quantum system and the particles do not conserve energy, the KDQ of the non-energy-preserving stochastic work is also derived. These KDQ distributions can account for non-commutativity, and return the unperturbed average values and variances for a generic interaction-time, and generic local initial states of the quantum system and environment particles. Using this nonequilibrium-physics approach, we certify the conditions under which the collision process of the model exhibits quantum traits, and we quantify the rate of energy exchanged by the quantum system by looking at the variance of the KDQ energy distributions. Finally, we propose an experimental test of our results on a superconducting quantum circuit implementing a qubit system, with microwave photons representing the environment particles.</description>

      <title>Directional Locking and Hysteresis in Stripe and Bubble Forming Systems on One-Dimensional Periodic Substrates with a Rotating Drive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the dynamics of a two-dimensional stripe, bubble, and crystal forming system interacting with a periodic one-dimensional substrate under an applied drive that is rotated with respect to the substrate periodicity direction $x$. We find that the stripes remain strongly directionally locked to the $x$ direction for an extended range of drives before undergoing motion parallel to the drive. In some cases, the stripes break apart at the unlocking transition, but can dynamically reform into stripes aligned perpendicular to the $x$ direction, producing hysteresis in the directional locking and unlocking transitions. In contrast, moving anisotropic crystal and bubble phases exhibit weaker directional locking and reduced or no hysteresis. The hysteresis occurs in regimes where the particle rearrangements occur and is most pronounced near the stripe phase. We also show that for varied substrate strength, substrate spacing, and particle density, a number of novel dynamical patterns can form that include a combination of stripe, bubble, and crystal morphologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct invertible spectral parameter dependent Yang-Baxter solutions ($R$-matrices) by Baxterizing constant non-invertible Yang-Baxter solutions. The solutions are algebraic (representation independent). They are constructed using supersymmetry (SUSY) algebras. The resulting $R$-matrices are regular leading to local non-hermitian Hamiltonians written in terms of the SUSY generators. As particular examples we Baxterize the $4\times 4$ constant non-invertible solutions of Hietarinta leading to nearest-neighbor Hamiltonians. On comparing with the literature we find two of the models are new. Apart from being non-hermitian, many of them are also non-diagonalizable with interesting spectrums. With appropriate representations of the SUSY generators we obtain spin chains in all local Hilbert space dimensions.</description>

      <title>Sisyphus random walks in the presence of moving traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been proved that, in the presence of a static absorbing trap, Sisyphus random walkers with a restart mechanism are characterized by {\it exponentially} decreasing asymptotic survival probability functions. Interestingly, in the present compact paper we prove analytically that, in the presence of a moving trap whose velocity approaches zero asymptotically in time as $v_{\text{trap}}\sim 1/t$, the survival probabilities of the Sisyphus walkers are dramatically changed into inverse {\it power-law} decaying tails.</description>

      <title>Sampling the space of solutions of an artificial neural network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The weight space of an artificial neural network can be systematically explored using tools from statistical mechanics. We employ a combination of a hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm which performs long exploration steps, a ratchet-based algorithm to investigate connectivity paths, and coupled replica models simulations to study subdominant flat regions. Our analysis focuses on one hidden layer networks and spans a range of energy levels and constrained density regimes. Near the interpolation threshold, the low-energy manifold shows a spiky topology. While these spikes aid gradient descent, they can trap general sampling algorithms at low temperatures; they remain connected by complex paths in a confined, non-flat region. In the overparameterized regime, however, the low-energy manifold becomes entirely flat, forming an extended complex structure that is easy to sample. These numerical results are supported by an analytical study of the training error landscape, and we show numerically that the qualitative features of the loss landscape are robust across different data structures. Our study aims to provide new methodological insights for developing scalable methods for large networks.</description>

Abstract: The article presents the concept of a cumulant representation for distribution functions describing the states of many-particle systems with topological nearest-neighbor interaction. A solution to the Cauchy problem for the hierarchy of nonlinear evolution equations for the cumulants of distribution functions of such systems is constructed. The connection between the constructed solution and the series expansion structure for a solution to the Cauchy problem of the BBGKY hierarchy has been established. Furthermore, the expansion structure for a solution to the Cauchy problem of the hierarchy of evolution equations for reduced observables of topologically interacting particles is established.</description>

      <title>Tagged particle behavior in a harmonic chain of direction reversing active Brownian particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the tagged particle dynamics in a harmonic chain of direction reversing active Brownian particles, with spring constant $k$, rotation diffusion coefficient $D_{\text{r}}$, and directional reversal rate $\gamma$. We exactly compute the tagged particle position variance for quenched and annealed initial orientations of the particles. For well-separated time scales, $k^{-1}$, $D_{\text{r}}^{-1}$ and $\gamma^{-1}$, the strength of spring constant $k$ relative to $D_{\text{r}}$ and $\gamma$ gives rise to different coupling limits and for each coupling limit there are short, intermediate, and long time regimes. In the thermodynamic limit, we show that, to the leading order, the tagged particle variance exhibits an algebraic growth $t^{\nu}$, where the value of the exponent $\nu$ depends on the specific regime. For a quenched initial orientation, the exponent $\nu$ crosses over from $3$ to $1/2$, via intermediate values $5/2$ or $1$, depending on the specific coupling limits. On the other hand, for the annealed initial orientation, $\nu$ crosses over from $2$ to $1/2$ via an intermediate value $3/2$ or $1$ for strong coupling limit and weak coupling limit respectively. An additional time scale $t_N=N^2/k$ emerges for a system with a finite number of oscillators $N$. We show that the behavior of the tagged particle variance across $t_N$ can be expressed in terms of a crossover scaling function, which we find exactly. Finally, we characterize the stationary state behavior of the separation between two consecutive particles by calculating the corresponding spatio-temporal correlation function.</description>

      <title>Typicality from concentration of measure in models with binary state variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the emergence of typicality in classical systems with a large number of binary state variables. We show analytically that for sufficiently large subsets of the complete state space, state functions which can be associated with macroscopic observables, such as density or energy, are sharply concentrated around a typical value, i.e., the vast majority of microscopic states show the same macroscopic behavior. From this static typicality result we obtain the dynamical counterpart, which states that if two initial conditions are drawn from a sufficiently large subset of the state space, the dynamical trajectories of the macroscopic observables would be approximately the same, provided that the dynamics does not compress abruptly the size of sets of states under evolution. The ensuing dynamical typicality phenomenon is very similar to what was recently found in the context of the dynamics of isolated quantum systems. We illustrate and apply our analytical results by analyzing one-dimensional cellular automata.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a fluctuating hydrodynamic description of an active lattice gas model with excluded volume interactions that exhibits motility-induced phase separation under appropriate conditions. For quasi-one dimension and higher, stability analysis of the noiseless hydrodynamics gives quantitative bounds on the phase boundary of the motility-induced phase separation in terms of spinodal and binodal. Inclusion of the multiplicative noise in the fluctuating hydrodynamics describes the exponentially decaying two-point correlations in the stationary-state homogeneous phase. Our hydrodynamic description and theoretical predictions based on it are in excellent agreement with our Monte Carlo simulations and pseudospectral iteration of the hydrodynamics equations. Our construction of hydrodynamics for this model is not suitable in strictly one-dimension with single-file constraints, and we argue that this breakdown is associated with micro-phase separation.</description>

Abstract: We introduce classical many-body dynamics on a one-dimensional lattice comprising local two-body maps arranged on discrete space-time mesh that serve as discretizations of Hamiltonian dynamics with arbitrarily time-varying coupling constants. Time evolution is generated by passing an auxiliary degree of freedom along the lattice, resulting in a `fishnet' circuit structure. We construct integrable circuits consisting of Yang-Baxter maps and demonstrate their general properties, using the Toda and anisotropic Landau-Lifschitz models as examples. Upon stochastically rescaling time, the dynamics is dominated by fluctuations and we observe solitons undergoing Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Effective dimensional reduction of complex systems based on tensor networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exact treatment of Markovian models of complex systems requires knowledge of probability distributions exponentially large in the number of components $n$. Mean-field approximations provide an effective reduction in complexity of the models, requiring only a number of phase space variables polynomial in system size. However, this comes at the cost of losing accuracy close to critical points in the systems dynamics and an inability to capture correlations in the system. In this work, we introduce a tunable approximation scheme for Markovian spreading models on networks based on Matrix Product States (MPS). By controlling the bond dimensions of the MPS, we can investigate the effective dimensionality needed to accurately represent the exact $2^n$ dimensional steady-state distribution. We introduce the entanglement entropy as a measure of the compressibility of the system and find that it peaks just after the phase transition on the disordered side, in line with the intuition that more complex states are at the 'edge of chaos'. We compare the accuracy of the MPS with exact methods on different types of small random networks and with Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods for a simplified version of the railway network of the Netherlands with 55 nodes. The MPS provides a systematic way to tune the accuracy of the approximation by reducing the dimensionality of the systems state vector, leading to an improvement over second-order mean-field approximations for sufficiently large bond dimensions.</description>

      <title>Interaction quench of dipolar bosons in a one-dimensional optical lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Tonks-Girardeau (TG) gas is a highly correlated quantum state of strongly interacting bosons confined to one dimension, where repulsive interactions make the particles behave like impenetrable fermions. By suddenly tuning these interactions to the attractive regime, it is possible to realize a super-Tonks-Girardeau (sTG) gas -- a highly excited, metastable state of strongly attractive bosons with unique stability properties. Inspired by the sTG quench scenario, we investigate a similar setup but with the inclusion of long-range dipolar interactions, which modify the system away from the TG Mott insulating limit. We simulate an interaction quench on dipolar bosons initially prepared in various states and fillings, using real-space densities, orbital occupations, Glauber correlation functions, and autocorrelation functions to probe post-quench stability. Our results reveal that stability is maintained only at very weak dipolar interaction strengths when starting from a unit-filled TG Mott state. In contrast, all cluster states -- whether unit-filled or doubly-filled -- eventually collapse under attractive interactions. This collapse is not always visible in the density profile but becomes apparent in the autocorrelation function, indicating complex many-body restructuring of the quantum state. Our findings underscore the potential of dipolar interactions to drive novel quantum dynamics and highlight the delicate balance required to stabilize excited states in long-range interacting systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19293v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations reveal fundamental trade-offs between precision and thermodynamic quantities, yet their empirical verification remains limited. We present an approach using quantum computers to verify a general quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relation. Our method, which implements quantum dynamics on physical qubits, enables us to investigate the measurability of relevant quantities, the relation's validity under physical noise, and its empirical tightness. Specifically, quantum computers' versatility allows for the examination of arbitrary observables. We address current quantum processor limitations through a three-fold strategy: generalizing the relation to generic observables under arbitrary quantum channels, proposing a method to measure the target thermodynamic quantity (survival activity) in the weak coupling regime, and reducing circuit depth by leveraging relation properties. Demonstrations on IBM's cloud-based quantum processor validate our relation in open qubit systems and achieve saturation with an optimal observable requiring entangled measurements. The relation is further verified in a quantum time correlator measurement protocol, confirming the broad applicability of our method. This study highlights the potential of noisy quantum computers for demonstrating quantum thermodynamic trade-offs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04770v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emulating thermal observables on a digital quantum computer is essential for quantum simulation of many-body physics. However, thermalization typically requires a large system size due to incorporating a thermal bath, whilst limited resources of near-term digital quantum processors allow for simulating relatively small systems. We show that thermal observables and fluctuations may be obtained for a small closed system without a thermal bath. Thermal observables occur upon classically averaging quantum mechanical observables over randomized variants of their time evolution that run independently on a digital quantum processor. Using an IBM quantum computer, we experimentally find thermal occupation probabilities with finite positive and negative temperatures defined by the initial state's energy. Averaging over random evolutions facilitates error mitigation, with the noise contributing to the temperature in the simulated observables. This result fosters probing the dynamical emergence of equilibrium properties of matter at finite temperatures on noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Hedgehog topological defects in 3D amorphous solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The underlying structural disorder renders the concept of topological defects in amorphous solids difficult to apply and hinders a first-principle identification of the microscopic carriers of plasticity and of the regions more prone to structural rearrangements (``soft spots''). Recently, it has been proposed that well-defined topological defects can still be identified in glasses, and correlated to local and global plasticity, by looking at the eigenvector field or the particle displacement field. Nevertheless, all the existing proposals and analyses are only valid in two spatial dimensions. In this work, we propose the idea of using hedgehog topological defects to characterize the plasticity of 3D glasses and to geometrically predict the location of their soft spots. We corroborate our proposal by simulating a Kremer-Grest 3D polymer glass, and by using both the normal mode eigenvector field and the displacement field around large plastic events. Contrary to the 2D case, the sign of the topological charge defined from the eigenvector field is ambiguous and the geometry of the topological defects, whether radial or hyperbolic, plays a fundamental role in 3D. In fact, we find that the topological hedgehog defects relevant for plasticity are those exhibiting hyperbolic geometry, resembling the saddle-point structure of 2D topological defects with negative winding number (anti-vortices). Our results confirm that a topological characterization of plasticity in glasses is feasible and provide a concrete realization of this program in 3D amorphous systems.</description>

Abstract: These Lecture Notes discuss the recent theoretical advances in the understanding of open quantum many-body physics in platforms where both dissipative and coherent processes can be tuned and controlled to a high degree. We start by reviewing the theoretical frameworks and methods used to describe and tackle open quantum many-body systems. We then discuss the use of dissipative processes to engineer many-body stationary states with desired properties and the emergence of dissipative phase transitions arising out of the competition between coherent evolution and dissipation. We review the dynamics of open quantum many body systems in the presence of correlated many-body dissipative processes, such as heating and many-body losses. Finally we provide a different perspective on open quantum many-body systems by looking at stochastic quantum trajectories, relevant for the case in which the environment represents a monitoring device, and the associated measurement-induced phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12781v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the set of solutions to $M$ random polynomial equations whose $N$ variables are restricted to the $(N-1)$-sphere. Each equation has independent Gaussian coefficients and a target value $V_0$. When solutions exist, they form a manifold. We compute the average Euler characteristic of this manifold in the limit of large $N$, and find different behavior depending on the target value $V_0$, the ratio $\alpha=M/N$, and the variances of the coefficients. We divide this behavior into five phases with different implications for the topology of the solution manifold. When $M=1$ there is a correspondence between this problem and level sets of the energy in the spherical spin glasses. We conjecture that the transition energy dividing two of the topological phases corresponds to the energy asymptotically reached by gradient descent from a random initial condition, possibly resolving an open problem in out-of-equilibrium dynamics. However, the quality of the available data leaves the question open for now.</description>

      <title>Triplets of local minima in a high-dimensional random landscape: Correlations, clustering, and memoryless activated jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the distribution of triplets of stationary points in the energy landscape of the spherical p-spin model, by evaluating the quenched three-point complexity by means of the Kac-Rice formalism. We show the occurrence of transitions in the organization of stationary points in the landscape, identifying regions where local minima and saddles accumulate and cluster around other stationary points, thus displaying the presence of correlations in the landscape. We discuss the implications of these findings for the dynamical exploration of the energy landscape in the activated regime, specifying conditions under which transitions between local minima are expected to exhibit correlated rates and when, conversely, activated jumps are likely to be memoryless.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous emergence of run-and-tumble-like dynamics in coupled self-propelled robots: experiment and theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01257v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Run-and-tumble (RT) motion is commonly observed in flagellated microswimmers, arising from synchronous and asynchronous flagellar beating. In addition to hydrodynamic interactions, mechanical coupling has recently been recognized to play a key role in flagellar synchronization. To explore this, we design a macroscopic model system that comprises dry, self-propelled robots linked by a rigid rod to model a biflagellated microorganism. To mimic a low Reynolds number environment, we program each robot to undergo overdamped active Brownian (AB) motion. We find that such a system exhibits RT-like behavior, characterized by sharp tumbles and exponentially distributed run times, consistent with real microswimmers. We quantify tumbling frequency and demonstrate its tunability across experimental parameters. Additionally, we provide a theoretical model that reproduces our results, elucidating physical mechanisms governing RT dynamics.</description>

      <title>Unification of Stochastic and Quantum Thermodynamics in Scalar Field Theory via a Model with Brownian Thermostat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic procedure to derive a quantum master equation for thermal relaxation in real scalar field theory, expanding on the method proposed in [Koide and Nicacio, Phys. Lett. A494, 129277 (2024)]. We begin by introducing a generalized model for a classical scalar field interacting with a Brownian thermostat, consistent with stochastic thermodynamics. Applying canonical quantization to this model, we derive the corresponding quantum master equation, that is applicable to any form of the scalar field Hamiltonian. While its evolution is generally non-CPTP (Completely Positive and Trace-Preserving), it can be adjusted to describe a CPTP evolution, such as those found in the GKSL (Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad) equation by appropriately tuning the parameters of the model. In this framework, we define heat, work, and entropy in a way that satisfies the first and second laws of quantum thermodynamics. This suggests that the quantum-classical correspondence extends beyond closed systems governed by unitary time evolution to open systems as well. We further investigate the relation between the second law in quantum thermodynamics and relative entropy, providing insights into the study of quantum fluctuations through information-theoretical techniques in quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Lindblad many-body scars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars have received much recent attention for being both intriguing non-ergodic states in otherwise quantum chaotic systems and promising candidates to encode quantum information efficiently. So far, these studies have mostly been restricted to Hermitian systems. Here, we study many-body scars in many-body quantum chaotic systems coupled to a Markovian bath, which we term Lindblad many-body scars. They are defined as simultaneous eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian and dissipative parts of the vectorized Liouvillian. Importantly, because their eigenvalues are purely real, they are not related to revivals. The number and nature of the scars depend on both the symmetry of the Hamiltonian and the choice of jump operators. For a dissipative four-body Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model with $N$ fermions, either Majorana or complex, we construct analytically some of these Lindblad scars while others could only be obtained numerically. As an example of the former, we identify $N/2+1$ scars for complex fermions due to the $U(1)$ symmetry of the model and two scars for Majorana fermions as a consequence of the parity symmetry. Similar results are obtained for a dissipative XXZ spin chain. We also characterize the physical properties of Lindblad scars. First, the operator size is independent of the disorder realization and has a vanishing variance. By contrast, the operator size for non-scarred states, believed to be quantum chaotic, is well described by a distribution centered around a specific size and a finite variance, which could be relevant for a precise definition of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in dissipative quantum chaos. Moreover, the entanglement entropy of these scars has distinct features such as a strong dependence on the partition choice and, in certain cases, a large entanglement.</description>
