      <title>SPHEREx as a frontier for infrared transients: Classification of new Galactic FU Ori outbursts and classical novae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate proof-of-concept of a new strategy for studying infrared (IR) transients enabled by the newly launched SPHEREx space mission, by leveraging its synergy with the NEOWISE space mission. With its fifteen year baseline and all-sky mid-IR coverage, NEOWISE provides an excellent avenue to discover thousands of slowly evolving infrared outbursts. With its all-sky spectro-photometric coverage and mid-IR sensitivity matching NEOWISE, SPHEREx is uniquely positioned to provide low-resolution IR spectra for the vast majority of these outbursts, several of which are too obscured for ground-based spectroscopic classification. As a demonstration of this approach, we present SPHEREx spectra for eight Galactic transients identified in NEOWISE. This sample includes two previously known FU Orionis-type (FUOr) outbursts whose SPHEREx spectra exhibit clear signatures of cool molecular absorption and three known classical novae showing strong emission lines in SPHEREx. Using these sources as templates, we identify two new FUOrs and one previously missed Galactic nova. Our results highlight the potential of SPHEREx for systematic explorations of the relatively underexplored dynamic infrared sky.</description>

      <title>Assessment of DKIST/VTF Capabilities for the Detection of Local Acoustic Source Wavefronts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that temporal filtering can successfully identify local-acoustic-source wavefronts in radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the solar photosphere. Extending this capability to observations promises new insight into the stochastic excitation of solar p-modes, the source depth distribution below the photosphere, and the dominant physical processes underlying acoustic wave excitation. Such measurements would also enable improved characterization of the complex wavefield in the lower chromosphere and open the possibility of ultra-local helioseismic diagnostics. In this work, we assess an observational strategy for the detection of local acoustic wavefronts on the Sun using the National Science Foundation's Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope's Visible Tunable Filter (DKIST/VTF). Because wavefront identification requires high spatial and temporal resolution and is limited by the small amplitudes of the wave perturbations, we focus on identifying specific wavelength combinations within spectral lines that maximize the sensitivity to the wave signal at the atmospheric heights where that signal is highest while minimizing contamination by atmospheric variability at other heights. Under the cadence and spectral resolution constraints of DKIST/VTF observations and for the particular simulated wavefront we examine, this approach suggests two possible strategies for the detection of acoustic wavefronts in solar observations: fast monochromatic imaging at 6302.425 A, or ordered interleaved observations in the blue wing of either the Fe I 6302.5 A or Fe I 5250.6 A line (between 6302.419 A and 6302.465 A, or between 5250.579 A and 5250.607 A respectively).</description>

      <title>Variation of the sunspot area during the rising and declining phases of the solar cycle supports the toroidal flux loss due to flux emergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sunspots are obvious observable manifestations of the toroidal magnetic field generated through the dynamo in the convection zone. They appear in different sizes, having a wide distribution in their area. We analyse the sunspot group area of the past 13 cycles and the Bipolar Magnetic Region (BMR) flux for Cycles 23 and 24 to explore their area and flux distributions and connect with the theory. We find that, in general, the group area and BMR flux are statistically larger in the rising phase than in the declining phase of the solar cycle. This implies that the rising phase of the solar cycle is prone to drive more intense space weather. We further show that the mean and median of the area distribution during the rising phase are dependent on cycle strength. However, the distribution mean and median are cycle strength-independent or weakly dependent during the decline phases of the solar cycles, particularly during the last three years when the latitudinal bands of all cycles migrate towards the equator along the same trajectory. These results support the theoretical model of nonlinear flux loss due to flux emergence, which explains why solar cycles rise differently but decay similarly.</description>

      <title>A Detailed Model Atmosphere Analysis of Hot White Dwarfs in DESI DR1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed model atmosphere analysis of hot white dwarfs in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1. Our sample includes 19,321 unique targets with $G_{\rm BP}-G_{\rm RP}\leq0$. We use the DESI spectra along with Gaia parallaxes and SDSS, Pan-STARRS, and SkyMapper photometry to perform spectroscopic and photometric fits. We find a significant discrepancy between the photometric and spectroscopic masses for DA white dwarfs (a systematic offset of 0.05-$0.06~M_\odot$), indicating problems with the broad hydrogen line profiles in DESI spectroscopy data. Our photometric fits are consistent with a peak at the canonical mass of $0.6~M_\odot$. A remarkable feature of the mass distribution is the prevalence of magnetic white dwarfs among the ultramassive DA population and that of warm DQs in the non-DA distribution. We identify 70 DQs in the DESI hot white dwarf sample, including 9 DAQs with carbon and hydrogen atmospheres. We constrain the ratio of non-DA to DA white dwarfs as a function of temperature, and discuss the implications for the spectral evolution of white dwarfs in the temperature range $10^5-10^4$ K. We also discuss unusual objects in the sample, including metal-rich white dwarfs and extremely low mass white dwarfs. This analysis provides the first look at the large sample of Gaia-selected white dwarf candidates that will be observed with multiplexed spectroscopic surveys like DESI, SDSS-V, 4MOST, and WEAVE over the next several years.</description>

      <title>Emergence of a lithium dip in ~35 Myr "Snake" Open Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a lithium dip (Li-dip) in the stellar "Snake" (age = $35 \pm 5$ Myr), challenging the classical view that Li-dips emerge only at ages $\gtrsim 150$ Myr. Using high-resolution spectra from GALAH DR4 ($R \sim 28,000$) for 211 member stars, we identify a clear depletion feature in a $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ range of 6200--6800 K with a depth of $\Delta A(\mathrm{Li}) \approx 0.40$ dex. Our analysis reveals two key advances: the Li-dip appears $\gtrsim 100$ Myr earlier than the previous observations, and within the dip temperature range, a significant correlation is found between rotational velocity and lithium depletion. Specifically, fast rotators ($v \sin i &gt; 25$ km s$^{-1}$) exhibit stronger lithium depletion than slow rotators ($v \sin i &lt; 25$ km s$^{-1}$). This trend suggests that faster rotators develop stronger rotational shear at the convective-radiative boundary, which enhances turbulent mixing and accelerates lithium destruction. It is also found that the lower temperature edge of the lithium plateau can reach as low as 5500 K for the young open clusters.</description>

      <title>SXP 31.0 -- the 2025 near-Eddington double X-ray outburst after 26 years of quiescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SXP 31.0 is an X-ray source in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) that was first identified as a Be X-ray Binary (BeXRB) system when it went into X-ray outbusrst in 1998. It is now known to consist of an OBe main sequence star and a neutron star with a spin period of 31s. In 2025 a new X-ray outburst phase began with the source exhibiting a luminosities approaching the Eddington limit of 10^38 erg/s. Unusually, H-alpha images show it has a surrounding halo whose nature has not been clear. In this paper, we report new observations of this halo, including the first multi-fibre Integrated Flux Unit (IFU) observations, which identify this emission as probably a coincidental HII region. The X-ray, UV &amp; optical data cover a period of ~200d and reveal that the source underwent two bright, back-to-back, Type II outbursts in 2025 - a rare occurrence for any BeXRB system.</description>

      <title>Twisted Pseudodisk and Asymmetric Mass Accretion on the Circumstellar Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model gas inflow patterns onto circumstellar disks and the evolution of the pseudodisk using three-dimensional resistive MHD simulations. Starting from a prestellar core without turbulence and with a misalignment between the initial magnetic field and rotation axis, the simulations are performed for $\sim10^5$ yr after protostar formation. After disk formation, the magnetic field around the disk becomes significantly distorted due to the disk rotational motion. Consequently, the structure of the pseudodisk also evolves into a complex morphology. As a result, both accretion onto the disk and outflow become asymmetric and anisotropic. Accretion to the disk occurs primarily through narrow-channel flows or streams. The time evolution of the infalling envelope leads to non-steady accretion onto the disk, which in turn causes variability in the mass accretion onto the central protostar. This study demonstrates that complex infalling envelope structures and channelized accretion flows onto the disk naturally arise even without assuming turbulence or external asymmetric inflows.</description>

      <title>Toward a Comprehensive Grid of Cepheid Models with MESA II. Impact of Physical and Numerical Assumptions on Elemental Abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern tools for modeling stellar evolution, such as MESA (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics), offer state-of-the-art implementations of stellar theories. However, this parametric approach introduces many free parameters that are often not constrained by observations. This is particularly important for evolved stars, like classical Cepheids, because uncertainties increase with evolution time. In previous work, we studied the effect of varying microphysics, including solar abundance mixtures, nuclear networks, atmosphere models, mixing-length prescriptions, treatments of convective boundaries, and numerical setup on evolutionary tracks. Here, we extend this analysis to the surface abundances of the dominant elements H, He, C, N, O, Ne, and Mg.
  We establish a reference model and 22 variants for each mass and metallicity, evolving them from the Zero-Age Main Sequence to central helium exhaustion. Masses between 2 to 8 solar mass and metallicities Z=0.0014, 0.004, 0.014 are explored, spanning the range of classical Cepheids. Both canonical and overshooting models are computed and compared.
  We find that uncertainties in surface abundances are generally small, arising mainly from variations in the depth of the convective envelope during the first dredge-up. The size of the convective envelope is sensitive to many aspects, including mass and metallicity. The central C/O ratio, relevant for white dwarf evolution, can vary by about 0.15, driven largely by convective boundary treatments or by modifying the 12C(alpha,gamma)16O reaction rate during helium burning. Surface and central abundances for the considered models at several benchmark points during the evolution are provided online.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Y Dwarf Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global circulation regime of the coolest brown dwarfs, the Y dwarfs, remains largely unexplored. We investigate the interplay between convection, rotation, and cloud thermal feedback using a selected sample of Y dwarf atmospheric models. We explore effective temperatures $400~\mathrm{K} \leq T_{\mathrm{eff}} \leq 600~\mathrm{K}$ and rotation periods $P_{\mathrm{rot}} = 2.5 \text{--} 20\ \mathrm{h}$, where salt and sulfide condensates are expected. We include $\mathrm{KCl,~Na_{2}S}$, and $\mathrm{MnS}$ clouds to assess their atmospheric impact and identify circulation regimes across parameter space. We run twelve general circulation models (GCMs) spanning this grid and develop additional physics modules for the THOR GCM to model brown dwarf atmospheres. The dynamical core is coupled to interior thermal perturbations near the radiative-convective boundary, a mixing-length convection scheme, gray two-stream radiative transfer with Rosseland-mean opacities, and simple cloud tracers including thermal feedback and scattering. All simulations exhibit a radiative-forcing-dominated regime with weak winds, minimal horizontal temperature contrasts, and no persistent jets. Convection controls vertical mixing and sets the extent of salt and sulfide cloud layers below the photosphere. Thermal structures equilibrate quickly and cloud radiative feedback remains insignificant, with limited variability. Within the gray radiative transfer framework adopted here, Y dwarf atmospheres in this parameter space are controlled by interior thermal radiation. Rotation sets modest variability, while clouds play a secondary role. Because our single-band approach does not capture spectral windows that could probe deeper cloud layers, our constraints on cloud radiative feedback are likely conservative, and we outline pathways toward more active regimes.</description>

      <title>A single frequency approach to nonequilibrium modeling of the chromosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solar chromosphere is a region where radiation plays a critical role in energy transfer and interacts strongly with the plasma. In this layer, strong spectral lines, such as the Lyman lines, contribute significantly to radiative energy exchange. Due to the long ionization/relaxation timescale, departures from LTE become significant in the chromosphere. Accurately modeling this layer therefore requires one to solve the non-LTE radiative transfer for the Lyman transitions. We present an updated version of the MURaM code to enable more accurate simulations of chromospheric hydrogen level populations and temperature evolution. In the previous extension, a non-LTE equation of state, collisional transitions of hydrogen, and radiative transitions of non-Lyman lines were already implemented in the code. Building on this, we have now incorporated radiative transfer for the Lyman lines to compute radiative rate coefficients and the associated radiative losses. These were used to solve the population and temperature evolution equations, rendering the system self-consistent. To reduce computational cost, a single-frequency approximation was applied to each line in the numerical solution of the radiative transfer problem. The extended model shows good agreement with reference solutions from the Lightweaver framework, accurately capturing the radiative processes associated with Lyman lines in the chromosphere. The extension brings the simulated hydrogen level populations in the deep chromosphere closer to detailed radiative balance, while those in the upper chromosphere remain significantly out of balance, consistent with the expected conditions in the real solar atmosphere. The extension enables the MURaM code to accurately capture chromospheric dynamics.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability with Anisotropic Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability occurs in multiple heliospheric (solar-wind stream interfaces, planetary magnetospheres, cometary tails, heliopause flanks) and interstellar (protoplanetary disks, relativistic jets, neutron star accretion disks) environments. While the KH instability has been well-studied in the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) limit, only limited studies were performed in the collisionless regime, which is conducive to development of anisotropic pressures. Collisionless plasmas are often described using the Chew Goldberger and Low (CGL) equations which feature an anisotropic pressure tensor. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the CGL version of the KH instability using linearised and numerical techniques. We find that the largest growth rates and the greatest incidence of magnetic effects occur in the MHD limit. In the large relaxation time CGL limit, part of the energy goes into the formation of pressure anisotropies, resulting in smaller amounts of energy being available for bending the field lines. Consequently, when we cross-compare CGL and MHD simulations that are otherwise identical, the current densities are largest in the MHD limit, and the largest magnetic islands also form in that limit. Early and late time formation of pressure anisotropies have also been studied. We also find that the strongest trend for forming intermittencies in the flow also occurs in the MHD limit. The paper also discusses possible consequences of our results for turbulence and reconnection in the heliosheath (the layer between the solar wind termination shock and the heliopause).</description>

      <title>New Approach to Superflare Energy Determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new method for estimating the total energy radiated by stellar flares in broad-band continua, which assumes a constant emitting area but incorporates a time-dependent temperature evolution. This physically motivated approach offers an alternative to the commonly used method that assumes a fixed flare temperature about of 10 000\,K and variable area. By allowing the temperature to vary over time while keeping the emitting area constant, our method captures more realistic flare behaviour. This time-dependent treatment of the flare temperature is supported by numerous solar observations, numerical simulations, and multiwavelength studies of active stars. We demonstrate that using peak flare temperatures estimated from a semi-empirical model grid, rather than assuming an ad-hoc flare temperature value, improves the accuracy of total energy estimates. Although the most precise results still require a multi-band photometry/spectroscopy or independently constrained flare temperatures, our method offers a practical and scalable solution for single-band observations. It is particularly well suited for main-sequence stars of spectral types K4 and later with known effective temperatures. Finally we discuss how the flare continuum behaves under varying chromospheric conditions. Our method improves flare energy estimates by incorporating a physically relevant time-dependent temperature evolution and empirically derived peak temperatures, rather than assuming a constant 10 000\,K value. This modification reduces systematic errors that can reach factors up to ten as compared to previous estimates. We proved this on a sample of 50,320 TESS flares.</description>

      <title>A mapping method of age estimation for binary stars: Application to the $\alpha$ Centauri system A and B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the wealth of data provided by Gaia and the upcoming PLATO mission, it is essential to improve stellar models to obtain accurate stellar ages. Our objective is to apply a mapping technique to estimate the age of a system and the initial chemical composition. We also evaluate the influence of observational uncertainties in mass and heavy-element mixtures on results. We applied an inverse calibration method to the evolution of a multiple stellar system, assuming that the stars share the same age and initial chemical composition. This approach determines age, the initial mass fractions of helium ($Y_{ini}$) and heavy elements ($Z_{ini}$), as well as the convective mixing-length parameters ($\alpha_A $ and $\alpha_B$). It uses the observed luminosities ($L_A$ and $L_B$), radii ($R_A$ and $R_B$), and surface chemical compositions ($Z/X_A$ and $Z/X_B$). We used the most recent observational data for $M$, $R$, $L$, and $[Fe/H]$ of $\alpha$ Centauri A and B as input data for our method. We compared two assumptions for the $Z/X$ ratio, following the results for the solar composition. For an assumed high solar $Z/X_\odot =0.0245$, we obtain an age of $7.8 \pm 0.6$ Ga, $Y_{ini} = 0.284 \pm 0.004$, and $Z_{ini} = 0.0335 \pm 0.0015$. For a low solar $Z/X_\odot = 0.0181$, the derived age is $8.7 \pm 0.6$ Ga, $Y_{ini} = 0.267 \pm 0.008$, and $Z_{ini} = 0.025 \pm 0.002$. Observational errors in the stellar masses of $\pm$0.002 lead to an age error of 0.6 Ga. Overshooting of $0.05-0.20H_p$ at the boundary of the convective core increases the age by $0.6-2.1$ Ga. Models with higher $Z/X$ and radiative cores, with ages of $7.2-7.8$ Ga, appear preferable and show better agreement with the observed asteroseismic frequencies.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a double white dwarf in the Galactic globular cluster NGC 6397</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binaries in the cores of globular clusters are known to prevent the gravitational collapse of the cluster, and simulations predict that the core of NGC 6397 contains a large number of white dwarfs (WDs), of which many are expected to be part of a binary system. In this work, we report the discovery of a compact binary system consisting of two WDs in the centre of the Galactic globular cluster NGC 6397. The system, known in the literature as NF1, was observed as part of a MUSE radial-velocity survey aiming at characterizing the binary population in the centre of NGC 6397. The spectral analysis of NF1 provides an effective temperature of 16000 K and a surface gravity (log g) of 5.72 (cgs), which is consistent with an extremely low-mass He-core WD nature. This is further supported by the mass of 0.23 +/- 0.03 Msun obtained from fitting the star's spectral energy distribution using its HST magnitude in various filters. The system has a circular orbit with a period of 0.54 days. The radial velocities show a large semi-amplitude of 200 km/s, implying a minimum mass of 0.78 Msun for the invisible companion, which is likely another WD, or a neutron star if the inclination of the system is smaller than about 50 deg. Some significant residuals in radial velocity remain with our best orbital solution and we tested whether a model with a third body can explain these deviations. While this possibility seems promising, additional measurements are needed to confirm whether the star is actually part of a triple system.</description>

      <title>Is the nitrogen-rich source PN K4-47 a true planetary nebula?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PN K4-47 is a young planetary nebula that exhibits shock-excited bipolar lobes and a complex molecular environment, with the highest number of molecules detected within a planetary nebula. It has been questioned whether K4-47 is indeed a `typical' planetary nebula, or may be more exotic in nature. We examine this question using optical imaging and spectroscopy, and sub-millimetre and radio interferometry. Our observations spatially resolve the sub-millimetre environment of K4-47 for the first time. We find elongated CO (2-1) emission along a similar PA to the optical bipolar outflow. We derive a distance upper limit of 6 kpc to the source. The source hosts a fast ($\sim$350 km s$^{-1}$) bipolar optical outflow, and a slow (~50-60 km s$^{-1}$) molecular outflow along a similar PA. The outflow velocity indicates an age of 336 $\pm$ 119 yr. We also find that the excitation temperature and density of the atomic gas is~20 kK and 2800 cm$^{-3}$, respectively. The elemental and isotopic enrichment of K4-47 infers an AGB progenitor mass of 4-6 M$_{\odot}$, which corresponds to a white dwarf mass of ~1 M$_{\odot}$, following the initial-final mass relation for white dwarfs. We find that the core of K4-47 must contain 10$^{-2}$ M$_{\odot}$ of dust to explain the extinction, and that photoionisation alone cannot explain the excitation of the atomic gas. We instead require an additional heating mechanism, with shocks a likely scenario. It is likely that the progenitor star of K4-47 was a J-type carbon AGB star, which formed the molecular and dusty circumstellar environment. The bipolar outflow is later triggered, punching through the circumstellar environment, producing shocks, and shaping the environment into the elongated structure seen in the sub-millimetre. We therefore classify K4-47 as a genuine, if unusual, planetary nebula.</description>

      <title>Granulation signatures as seen by Kepler short-cadence data. I. A decoupling between granulation and oscillation timescales for dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Granulation is the observable signature of convection in envelopes of low-mass stars, forming the background in stellar power spectra. While well-studied in evolved giants, granulation on the MS has received less attention. We here study and characterise granulation signatures of MS and SGB stars, extending previous studies of giants to provide a continuous physical picture across evolutionary stages. We analyse 753 Kepler short-cadence stars using a Bayesian nested-sampling framework to evaluate three background descriptions and compare model preferences. This yields full posterior distributions for all parameters, enabling robust comparisons across a diverse stellar sample. No universal preference between background models is found. Assuming a Gaussian oscillation envelope, $\nu_\mathrm{max}$ estimates are sensitive to model misspecification, with the resulting systematics exceeding the formal uncertainties. The envelope width scales with $\nu_\mathrm{max}$ across models and shows a dependence on effective temperature. Total granulation amplitudes in dwarfs broadly follow giant-based scalings, however a decoupling appears between the timescale of the primary granulation and the oscillations for MS stars cooler than the Sun. The prolonged granulation timescale is reproduced by 3D simulations of a K-dwarf, driven by reduced convective velocities due to more efficient convective energy transport in denser envelopes. The prolonged granulation timescale increases the frequency separation to the oscillation excess, potentially aiding seismic detectability, while the reduced convective velocities may influence the excitation of stellar oscillations and relate to the low amplitudes observed in cool dwarfs. Finally, we contribute a dataset linking granulation, oscillations, and stellar parameters, providing a foundation for future investigations into their interdependence across the HR diagram.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the $\Sigma$-effect Model of the Solar Hemispherical Helicity Bias via Direct Numerical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Solar Hemispherical Helicity Rule(s) (SHHR) is a term used to represent a bias observed in proxies for the magnetic helicity in active regions at the solar surface. The SHHR states that predominantly negative magnetic helicity is observed in active regions in the northern hemisphere, whereas predominantly positive is found in the southern. The $\Sigma$-effect model of \cite{longcope1998flux} is one of the most cited models for the explanation of the SHHR. In this model, the magnetic structures derive the bias in their magnetic helicity from the kinetic helicity of the turbulent convection through which they travel, where the latter is handed owing to the rotational influence of the star. The original paper built an elegant mathematical model for the dynamics of thin flux tubes influenced by parameterized helical turbulence. Here, we attempt to explore the conceptual ideas of this original simplified model using fully-nonlinear, three-dimensional, Cartesian-domain simulations of isolated, finite cross-sectional, twisted magnetic flux structures rising though rotating, overshooting, turbulent compressible convection. We look for evidence of a correlation between the kinetic helicity content of the turbulence and the evolving magnetic helicity of the structures. We find little evidence of such a relationship, and do not even find any clear hemispheric dependence. Although these simulations are far from a perfect representation of the ideas, this work raises many questions about the potential efficacy of the $\Sigma$-effect in reality.</description>

      <title>The seismic diversity of four successive solar cycle minima as observed by the Birmingham Solar-Oscillations Network (BiSON)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have used data collected by the Birmingham Solar-Oscillations Network (BiSON) to perform a helioseismic diagnosis of changes to the Sun's internal structure between four successive solar cycle minima, beginning with the minimum at the end of cycle 21 and ending with the recent minimum at the beginning of cycle 25. The unique duration of the BiSON database makes such a study possible. We used the low-degree BiSON p-mode frequencies to constrain structural changes between minima in the layers above $\approx 0.9 R_{\odot}$. We accomplished this by examining variations in the HeII ionisation zone signature; and by inverting the frequency differences to infer changes in the sound speed. Additionally, we employed frequency differences between various solar models that had subtle modifications to their internal structures to facilitate analysis of the observations. We find evidence for small, but marginally significant, changes in structure between different minima. The HeII signature was larger, and the sound speed in the range $\approx 0.93$ to $0.97 R_{\odot}$ was slightly higher, during the cycle 23/24 minimum, than during the other minima. The cycle 23/24 minimum was the deepest, as measured by proxies of global solar activity. These findings are consistent with magnetic flux levels having been lower in this minimum than the others, resulting in a higher gas pressure, higher temperatures, and higher sound speed. Our results demonstrate the potential of using asteroseismic data to perform similar analyses on other solar-type stars.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Ready Data Sets for the Analysis and Nowcasting of Atmospheric Radiation at Aviation Altitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowcasting and forecasting of the radiation environment in the Earth's lower atmosphere are critical for the safety of aircraft and spacecraft crews and passengers. Currently, this problem is addressed by employing statistical and physics-based models that take into account particle transport and precipitation. However, given the increased number of radiation measurements available to the community, it is possible to start developing data-driven approaches. We prepared Machine Learning-ready (ML-ready) datasets to nowcast the effective dose rates at aviation altitudes. The presented datasets contain 92,476 individual measurements from 589 flights obtained by the Automated Radiation Measurements for Aerospace Safety (ARMAS) experiment from 2013 to 2023. The ARMAS measurements are augmented with the properties of the Geospace environment, such as solar soft X-ray and proton fluxes, solar wind properties, secondary cosmic ray neutrons, space weather indexes, and global solar activity indicators (such as daily sunspot number). ARMAS data are separated into three partitions, ensuring that (1) the data points from a single flight remain within the same partition, and (2) each partition samples the flight locations and Geospace environment conditions equally. Several versions of the datasets allow predictions based on point-in-time measurements and use up to 24 hours of Geospace parameter history. The test of the use case demonstrates a possibility of nowcasting ARMAS measurements with accuracies slightly better than the considered physics-based models. The publicly available ML-ready datasets could serve as the first step in data preparation for ML-driven nowcasting and forecasting of the radiation environment.</description>

      <title>Exploring the dynamical evolution of binary stars in multiple-population globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters leads to a complex dynamical environment that significantly influences the evolution of binary stars, which in turn impacts the evolution of the cluster itself. For this study, we used a series of Monte Carlo simulations run with the MOCCA code to investigate the long-term dynamical evolution of binary stars in globular clusters hosting two distinct stellar populations. We explored how global binary properties such as incidence, fraction, and spatial distribution evolve over time due to the unique dynamical environment associated with each population. Our results show how binaries in the more centrally concentrated second population (P2) experience increased rates of hardening and disruption relative to the first population (P1), leading to distinct radial profiles in binary incidence and fraction. We also demonstrate the difference in spatial mixing timescales for binaries compared to single stars, where binary stars in each population retain some memory of their initial configurations even after complete single star mixing. Additionally, we investigated the formation and evolution of mixed binaries (binaries composed of a P1 component and a P2 component), which form primarily within the core through dynamical interactions. Finally, we studied main sequence--white dwarf binaries and find that they represent a larger fraction of binaries in P1 compared to P2. The results of this paper highlight the interplay between cluster dynamics and the evolution of binary stars and how binaries can act as tracers of the cluster's initial conditions and dynamical evolution.</description>

Abstract: This paper describes the wave-front correction and image stabilisation system (CWS) developed for the Sunrise III balloon-borne telescope, and provides information about its performance as measured during the integration into the telescope and during the 2024 science flight. The fast image stabilisation is done by a correlation tracker (CT) and a fast tip-tilt mirror, low order aberrations such as defocus and coma are measured by a six-element Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor (WFS) and corrected by an active telescope secondary mirror for automated focus and manual coma correction. The CWS is specified to deliver a stabilised image with a precision of 0.005 arcsec (rms). The autofocus adjustment is specified to maintain a focus stability of 0.01 waves in the focal plane of the CWS.</description>

      <title>Properties of Galactic Outflows Driven by Starburst at Cosmic Noon: Insights from Hydrodynamical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate starburst-driven galactic outflows in low-mass galaxies ($9.0 &lt; \log(M_*/M_\odot) &lt; 10.0$) at cosmic noon using high-resolution 3D hydrodynamical simulations based on a framework that can reproduce the multiphase outflows in M82. The simulations produce starbursts lasting 20-30 Myr, with peak star formation rates of 2-68 M$_\odot \,\rm{yr}^{-1}$. Outflow properties vary strongly with time, radial distance to galaxy center, stellar mass, and gas fraction, exhibiting velocities of 50-1000 $\,\rm{km\,s}^{-1}$, mass outflow rates of 0.3-20 M$_\odot \,\rm{yr}^{-1}$, and mass loading factors, $\eta_\mathrm{M}$, of 0.24-6.26. The cool phase ($8000 &lt; T \le 2 \times 10^4$ K) dominates the outflow, and properties of the cool and warm phases are broadly consistent with observations. At $M_*= 10^{9.5}\,M_\odot$, average $\eta_\mathrm{M}$ for the total, cool, and warm phases are $\sim$1.2, 0.75, and 0.25, respectively. The mass loading factor decreases with increasing galaxy stellar mass, but increases with star formation rate. Given strong temporal and spatial evolution, scaling slopes from limited samples should be treated with caution. Our total $\eta_\mathrm{M}$ values are higher than FIRE-2 by 0.06 dex but lower than EAGLE and TNG50 by 0.50 and 0.84 dex. Accounting for methodological differences in outflow measurement reduces these gaps to 0.2-0.4 dex, suggesting that part of the discrepancy between observations and simulations reported in the literature may arise from inconsistent definitions and measurement methods, though differences in individual phases persist. Larger observational and simulation samples, together with consistent methods for measuring outflow properties, are required to draw robust conclusions about the scaling relations of galactic outflows.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Mass Constraints on Transition Disk Perturbers with the G23H Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present dynamical mass constraints on perturbers in 11 transition disk systems using a novel combination of calibrated Hipparcos and Gaia absolute astrometry data. Out of the sample of 11, we find support for companions in seven systems, with significant detections in three. These systems are: HD 142527, where we clearly detect the known low-mass stellar companion HD 142527 B; AB Aurigae, where we detect a low-mass stellar or sub-stellar companion; and MWC 758, where we detect a likely sub-stellar companion. We also find strong evidence of companions to HD 97048 and UX Tau A, and moderate evidence for companions to HD 100546 and CQ Tau. In the four systems with non-detections, we find no evidence for companions more massive than $\sim$6 $M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$ with a semi-major axis greater than 3 au for HD 100453, nor for companions more massive than $\sim$2 $M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$ with a semi-major axis greater than 2 au for TW Hya. We also find no evidence for stellar mass companions with semi-major axes between $\sim$3 and $\sim$25 au for both HD 34282 and RY Lup. In addition to our fiducial model, we perform cross validation between astrometry sources. By comparing results across models, we find tentative evidence of a short timescale excess astrometric noise that may impact some protoplanetary disk systems. We conclude with predictions for the prospects of making dynamical mass constraints on protoplanets in protoplanetary disk systems with Gaia data release 4 using detailed simulations of Gaia DR4 data of PDS 70 and WISPIT 2.</description>

      <title>Impact of embedded circumplanetary winds on the circumstellar disk: I. Reshaping the local accretion environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of winds is among the uncertainties related to the growth of giant planets. Such circumplanetary outflows have been proposed to explain kinematic and chemical structures in protoplanetary disks. We investigate the immediate impact of circumplanetary outflows on the circumstellar disk environment, the planetary vicinity, and planetary growth. We performed three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations using \texttt{FARGO3D}, implementing a parametric wind launched from the vicinity of an embedded planet. Although the imposed configurations for the outflows do not significantly alter the global structure of the disk, they do substantially redistribute material in the vicinity of the embedded planet. In particular, the wind redirects accretion flows from polar to equatorial latitudes, resulting in variable accretion patterns over time. Although the mass accretion rate variations depend on the efficiency of the outflows, their presence diminishes the accretion rate over time and the total mass reservoir within the Hill sphere and the planet's direct vicinity, potentially slowing or limiting planetary growth.</description>

      <title>JWST spectral retrieval of cold directly imaged planet WD0806 b and the first measurement of altitude-dependent K$_{zz}$ in exoplanet atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: WD0806 b is a rare exoplanet companion orbiting a white dwarf, currently with a projected orbital distance of 2500 au. The Spitzer mid-IR photometry suggests that the temperature is as cold as 350K, making it one of the coldest directly imaged exoplanets. In this paper, we present the Near-infrared Camera (NIRCam) F150W2, F200W, F356W, and F444W broadband photometry and a 3--5\um Near-Infrared spectroscopy (NIRSpec) G395M spectrum obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We develop a new retrieval framework based on the open-source PICASO software that includes additive and multiplicative systematic parameters. Our retrieval results reveal bounded abundances of H$_2$S, CO$_2$, CO, NH$_3$, H$_2$O, and CH$_4$. We present a new chemical analysis framework that utilizes retrieved abundances to measure altitude-dependent eddy diffusion coefficients (K$_{\mathrm zz}$) at multiple quenched pressures. We find that the eddy diffusion coefficients decrease from around $10^4$ to $10^2$ $\rm cm^2/s$ as the atmospheric pressure decreases from from 50 to 20 bars. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report altitude-dependent vertical mixing (or, equivalently, quenched-species-dependent vertical mixing) based on the measured molecular abundances of CO, CH$_4$, and CO$_2$. With the 1--21\um NIRCam, NIRSpec and the previously published MIRI data, we measure the bolometric luminosity to be log(L/L$_{\odot}$) = $-6.75\pm0.01$ and derive the mass to be $8\pm 1 \mathrm{M_J}$. The retrieval results suggest that \target has an elevated C/O ratio of 0.76, or 1.3$\times$ solar, sub-solar metallicity ([M/H ]= -0.25), and a nearly solar C/S ratio (1.17x solar).</description>

      <title>A Minimal Interpretation of the Galactic Cosmic-Ray Spectrum from GeV to PeV Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-precision measurements of the cosmic-ray (CR) proton spectrum have revealed significant deviations from a simple power-law behaviour. These deviations are characterised by three prominent features: (i) a progressive spectral hardening above approximately 200 GeV, (ii) an excess between 10 and 30 TeV (the ``multi-TeV bump''), followed by a sharp turnover around 100 TeV, and (iii) a pronounced structure between 0.1 and 10 PeV (the ``PeV bump''). We propose a minimal two cosmic-ray population framework that consistently accounts for the observed CR proton spectrum across six decades in energy, from GeV to PeV. In this scenario, the spectral complexity arises naturally from a transition between two Galactic CR proton populations in the 10-100 TeV energy range. The low-energy population exhibits a sharp cutoff at tens of TeV, while a second, higher-energy population emerges and dominates above 100 TeV, terminating with a smooth exponential cutoff at approximately 6.5 PeV. This framework reproduces all observed spectral features without invoking contributions from nearby sources or requiring non-standard assumptions about particle acceleration or propagation. Recent gamma-ray observations of supernova remnants, star-forming regions, and microquasars provide plausible astrophysical candidates for the origin of the two CR components.</description>

      <title>Indications of Rapid Dust Formation in the Inner Region of a Protoplanetary Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a significant increase in mid-infrared emission $\leq10$ $\mu$m in a transitional disk. The 2024 JWST/MIRI observation of the disk around CVSO 1942 reveals flux increase by a factor of two at $\lambda\leq10$ $\mu$m, compared to the near photospheric flux level observed with Spitzer/IRS in 2005. No significant change in flux at $\gtrsim15$ $\mu$m is detected in the spectra. Comparing the MIRI/MRS spectrum and NEOWISE photometry, we found that this $\leq10$ $\mu$m flux increase occurs on a timescale of 2 weeks and is consistent with the presence of warm (1,400 K), optically thick, large ($\gtrsim1$ $\mu$m) dust grains near the dust sublimation radius. We propose that this rapid dust appearance may indicate in situ dust formation, possibly from planetesimal collisions in the inner disk.</description>

      <title>An Exploration of the Equation of State Dependence of Core-Collapse Supernova Explosion Outcomes and Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore, using a state-of-the-art simulation code in 3D and to late enough times to witness final observables, the dependence of core-collapse supernova explosions on the nuclear equation of state. Going beyond questions of explodability, we compare final explosion energies, nucleosynthetic yields, recoil kicks, and gravitational-wave and neutrino signatures using the SFHo and DD2 nuclear equations of state (EOS) for a 9-$M_{\odot}$/solar-metallicity progenitor star. The DD2 EOS is stiffer and has a lower effective nucleon mass. The result is a more extended protoneutron star (PNS) and lower central densities. As a consequence, the mean neutrino energies, final explosion energy, and recoil kick speed are lower. Moreover, the evolution of PNS convection differs between the two EOS models in significant ways. This translates in part into interestingly altered neutrino ``light" curves and noticeably altered gravitational-wave signal strengths and frequency characteristics that may be diagnostic. The faster exploding model (SFHo) yields slightly more neutron-rich ejecta and more species with atomic weights between 60 and 90 and a weak r-process. However, this is merely a preliminary study. The next step is a more comprehensive and multi-progenitor set of 3D supernova simulations for various EOSes to late times when the observables have asymptoted. Such a future investigation will have a direct bearing on the neutron star and black hole birth mass functions and the quest towards a fully quantitative theory of supernova observables.</description>

      <title>SZ Lyncis: An Eccentric wide Binary with a possible neutron star</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SZ Lyn is a low-eccentricity ($e=0.186$) wide binary system hosting a post-main-sequence $\delta$ Scuti variable (SZ Lyn A) and an unseen compact companion (SZ Lyn B), orbiting with a $3.32$-yr period. Combining radial velocity measurements, asteroseismology, and LAMOST spectroscopy, we characterize both components. Asteroseismic modeling yields precise parameters for SZ Lyn A: $M_1 = 1.83^{+0.06}_{-0.01} M_{\odot}$, $R_1 = 2.899^{+0.027}_{-0.000} R_{\odot}$, $L_1 = 16.111^{+0.721}_{-0.354} L_{\odot}$, and core hydrogen abundance $X_{\mathrm{c}} = 0.089^{+0.032}_{-0.005}$. For SZ Lyn B, radial velocity ($M_2 = 1.69_{-0.634}^{+0.933} $M$_{\odot}$) and $O\!-\!C$ analysis ($M_2 = 1.97_{-1.12}^{+1.13} $M$_{\odot}$) yield consistent masses within uncertainties, combined with the astrometric orbital inclination from \textit{Hipparcos} mission. We identify SZ Lyn B as a neutron star candidate, though a massive white dwarf possibility remains. This demonstrates the efficacy of combining radial velocity, light travel time effect, and asteroseismology for compact object detection in wide binaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19594v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dipper stars are extrinsically variable stars with deep dimming events due to extended, often dusty, structures produced by a wide range of mechanisms such as collisions, protoplanetary evolution or stellar winds. ASAS-SN has discovered 12 dipper-like objects as part of its normal operations. Here we systematically search the $\sim 5.1$ million ASAS-SN targets with $13&lt;g&lt;14$~mag for dippers with $\Delta g\ge0.3$~mag to identify 4 new candidates. We also discover 15 long-period eclipsing binary candidates. We characterized the 19 new and 12 previously discovered objects using the ASAS-SN light curves and archival multi-wavelength data. We divide them into three categories: long-period eclipsing binaries with a single eclipse (13 total), long-period eclipsing binaries with multiple eclipses (7 total) and dipper stars with dust or disk occultations (11 total).</description>

      <title>Solar photospheric velocities measured in space: a comparison between SO/PHI-HRT and SDO/HMI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (SO/PHI) onboard Solar Orbiter is a spectropolarimeter scanning the Fe I line at 617.3 nm, providing data of the solar photosphere. The same line is sampled by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and many other on-ground instruments. In this paper, we aim at assessing the consistency between line-of-sight (LoS) velocity measurements from the two instruments. Reliable measurements of up and down flows from SO/PHI are crucial and unique when Solar Orbiter is facing the far side of the Sun. Also, a combination of measurements from two vantage points to study horizontal flows must rely on consistent observations. For this purpose, we compare the LoS velocity measured by SO/PHI's High Resolution Telescope (SO/PHI-HRT) and SDO/HMI on 29 March 2023, when Solar Orbiter was crossing the Sun-Earth line at a distance of 0.39 au from the Sun. Because such co-alignments are rare, this configuration offered an almost unique opportunity to directly compare data products from both telescopes. The data are aligned and remapped to allow a pixel-by-pixel comparison of the whole time series of 4 hours length. Temporal and spatial variations are considered for a direct combination of the measurements. The LoS velocity distributions are evaluated and a clear linear relation is found between the two instruments with a slope of 0.96 and a correlation of 92%. We find that the signals form at similar heights, with a separation of 7$\pm$14 km, which is larger than previous estimates. A close-up look at the penumbra of a sunspot and its Evershed flow is presented. We conclude that the signals inferred by SO/PHI-HRT and SDO/HMI show very good agreement and high correlation when instrumental effects and large-scale velocities on the Sun are properly accounted for.</description>

      <title>Automatic detection of CMEs using synthetically-trained Mask R-CNN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are a major driver of space weather. To assess CME geoeffectiveness, among other scientific goals, it is necessary to reliably identify and characterize their morphology and kinematics in coronagraph images. Current methods of CME identification are either subjected to human biases or perform a poor identification due to deficiencies in the automatic detection. In this approach, we have trained the deep convolutional neural model Mask R-CNN to automatically segment the outer envelope of one or multiple CMEs present in a single difference coronagraph image. The empirical training dataset is composed of 10^5 synthetic coronagraph images with known pixel-level CME segmentation masks. It is obtained by combining quiet coronagraph observations, with synthetic white-light CMEs produced using the GCS geometric model and ray-tracing technique. We found that our model-based trained Mask R-CNN infers segmentation masks that are smooth and topologically connected. While the inferred masks are not representative of the detailed outer envelope of complex CMEs, the neural model can better differentiate a CME from other radially moving background/foreground features, segment multiple simultaneous CMEs that are close to each other, and work with images from different instruments. This is accomplished without relying on kinematic information, i.e. only the included in the single input difference image. We obtain a median IoU=0.98 for 1.6*10^4 synthetic validation images, and IoU=0.77 when compared with two independent manual segmentations of 115 observations acquired by the COR2-A, COR2-B and LASCO C2 coronagraphs. The methodology presented in this work can be used with other CME models to produce more realistic synthetic brightness images while preserving desired morphological features, and obtain more robust and/or tailored segmentations.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic power spectra and visibilities of damped mixed modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observational studies of red giant stars have estimated the visibility of their mixed oscillation modes, which is a proxy of the average energy of these modes. Among other things, they demonstrated that although the damping rate of the oscillations in the core of many red giants appears to be negligible, other red giants exhibit high core damping rates that are sometimes consistent with the infinite value limit. Up until now, it has not been possible to link the mixed mode visibilities to core damping rates in a quantitative way. In this study, we use the progressive wave picture to derive an analytical function expressing the approximate resonance pattern of red giants up to a proportionality factor. This function can model the influence of the damping on the oscillations, as well as take into account other effects such as mode asymmetries. In particular, this expression can be used to obtain a quantitative estimate for the visibility of mixed modes and to predict the detectability of mixed mode and multiplet signatures under different core damping rates. Here, we conduct a parameter study to investigate how the damping processes affect these aspects. We find that the visibility approaches the value expected for an infinite core damping rate already at finite values. Furthermore, we find that both the mixed mode and the multiplet signatures disappear at finite core damping rates. This implies that the observational characteristics of red giants with finite core damping rates can appear as if their core damping rate were infinite, providing an explanation for the observed populations. Moreover, we have used our method to quantitatively estimate the core damping rates of red giants with unusually low mixed mode amplitudes from their observed visibilities.</description>

      <title>Magnetohydrodynamic instabilities in stellar radiative regions. I. Linear study of shear-driven instabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is the first in a series investigating magnetohydrodynamic instabilities that may contribute to angular-momentum transport and magnetic-field evolution in stellar radiative zones. We focus on shear-driven instabilities, specifically the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke (GSF) instability and the magnetorotational instability (MRI), which are expected to play key roles in the internal dynamics of radiative regions. We carried out a local linear stability analysis using a numerical approach that extends beyond classical limiting cases and includes stabilizing effects such as stratification and magnetic tension, allowing the exploration of realistic flow regimes. These results were validated through a global mode analysis in a Taylor-Couette configuration. We recovered the standard MRI and azimuthal MRI stability criteria and quantified the effects of stratification, magnetic tension, and diffusion on their growth. In strongly sheared regimes, we derived a new criterion for the magnetised GSF (MGSF) instability and clarified the transition from SMRI to MGSF as stratification and magnetic effects narrow the unstable domain. We also provided approximate growth-time formulae that identify the dominant instability under given stellar conditions and can be implemented in 1D stellar evolution codes. Global Taylor-Couette calculations validate the local WKB analysis. Applied to subgiants and young red giants, our results show that shear-driven instabilities can grow rapidly for magnetic fields below 100 kG. Strong axial fields (100 kG) confined to the hydrogen-burning shell suppress instabilities unless the shear is sufficiently distant. These results support incorporating our criteria and growth estimates into stellar evolution models to assess the efficiency of shear-driven transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scientific reasoning through Large Language Models in heliophysics involves more than just recalling facts: it requires incorporating physical assumptions, maintaining consistent units, and providing clear scientific formats through coordinated approaches. To address these challenges, we present Reasoning With a Star, a newly contributed heliophysics dataset applicable to reasoning; we also provide an initial benchmarking approach. Our data are constructed from National Aeronautics and Space Administration &amp; University Corporation for Atmospheric Research Living With a Star summer school problem sets and compiled into a readily consumable question-and-answer structure with question contexts, reasoning steps, expected answer type, ground-truth targets, format hints, and metadata. A programmatic grader checks the predictions using unit-aware numerical tolerance, symbolic equivalence, and schema validation. We benchmark a single-shot baseline and four multi-agent patterns, finding that decomposing workflows through systems engineering principles outperforms direct prompting on problems requiring deductive reasoning rather than pure inductive recall.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present atmospheric retrievals of the benchmark brown dwarf binary Luhman 16AB using high-resolution VLT/CRIRES spectra and the differentiable framework ExoJAX. We derive elemental abundances and temperature-pressure ($T$-$P$) profiles while explicitly testing the robustness of the results against major sources of systematic uncertainty. We first perform retrievals with a power-law $T$-$P$ profile and assess the sensitivity of inferred molecular abundances and C/O ratios to different CO line lists (ExoMol, HITEMP with air- and H2-broadening). We then introduce a flexible Gaussian process-based $T$-$P$ profile, allowing a non-parametric characterization of the thermal structure and a more conservative treatment of uncertainties. For both components, we infer C/O ratios of about 0.67, slightly above solar, with line list systematics at the 7 percent level emerging as the dominant source of uncertainty, whereas assumptions about $T$-$P$ parameterization or photometric variability play a lesser role. The retrieved $T$-$P$ profiles and molecular abundances are broadly consistent with atmospheric models and equilibrium chemistry. Our results establish Luhman 16AB as a key anchor for substellar C/O measurements, demonstrate the utility of flexible $T$-$P$ modeling in high-resolution retrievals, and highlight the importance of systematic tests -- particularly line list uncertainties -- for robust comparisons between brown dwarfs and giant exoplanets.</description>

      <title>On flying through the base of a pseudo-streamer</title>

Abstract: Near the 10 solar radius perihelion of Parker Solar Probe orbit 24, a confined region containing an enhanced plasma density of 25,000 particles per cubic centimeter and broadband electrostatic waves was encountered. The solar wind velocity of 200 kilometers per second and ion temperature of 25 eV were significantly reduced as compared to their values in the ambient solar wind. These anomalous plasma conditions were observed on closed magnetic field lines, as determined from observations of the suprathermal electron strahl. Because the polarity of the radial magnetic field did not change sign on the two sides of the crossing and the crossed region contained a double-peaked plasma structure, the spacecraft must have passed through the base of a pseudo-streamer whose structure extended out to 10 solar radii. In the plasma frame, an electric field as large as 400 millivolts per meter was detected during the crossing. The current associated with this electric field was less than one milliampere per square meter, corresponding to a drift velocity less than 2.5 kilometers per second. It also contained a turbulent plasma with density fluctuations divided by density as large as 0.3, suggesting that the resistive term in the generalized ohm's law was significant. Also, the density as a function of time had a non-zero slope when the electric field was non-zero, suggesting that the pressure gradient term also mattered. As compared to earlier remote sensing and theoretical results, it is surprising that the plasma in this pseudo-streamer had a remarkably low flow velocity and that the pseudo-streamer base extended out to 10 solar radii.</description>

      <title>Spectral Appearance of Self-gravitating AGN Disks Powered by Stellar Objects: Universal Effective Temperature in the Optical Continuum and Application to Little Red Dots</title>

Abstract: We revisit the spectral appearance of extended self-gravitating accretion disks around supermassive black holes. Using dust-poor opacity tables, we show that all optically thick disk solutions possess a universal outer effective temperature of $T_{\rm eff}\sim 4000-4500$K, closely resembling compact, high-redshift sources known as Little Red Dots (LRDs). Assuming the extended disk is primarily heated by stellar sources, this ``disk Hayashi limit" fixes the dominant optical continuum temperature of the disk spectrum independent of accretion rate $\dot{M}$, black hole mass $M_\bullet$, and disk viscosity $\alpha$, and removes the parameter-tuning required in previous disk interpretations of LRDs. We construct global self-gravitating accretion disk models with radially varying accretion rates, suggesting that burning of embedded stellar objects can both efficiently power the emission of the outer disk and hollow out the inner disk, strongly suppressing variable UV/X-ray associated with a standard quasar. The resulting disk emission is dominated by a luminous optical continuum while a separate, non-variable UV component arises from stellar populations on the nuclear to galaxy scale. We map the optimal region of parameter space for such systems and show that LRD-like appearances are guaranteed for $\dot{M}/\alpha \gtrsim 0.1 M_\odot /{\rm yr}$, a threshold insensitive to $M_\bullet$, below which the system may transition into classical non-self-gravitating AGN disks, potentially a later evolution stage. We expect this transition to be accompanied by the enhancement of metallicity and production of dust, giving rise to far infrared emission. This picture offers a physically motivated and quantitative framework connecting LRDs with AGNs and their associated nuclear stellar population.</description>
