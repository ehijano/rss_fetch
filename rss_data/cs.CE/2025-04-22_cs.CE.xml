      <title>A dual-stage constitutive modeling framework based on finite strain data-driven identification and physics-augmented neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution, we present a novel consistent dual-stage approach for the automated generation of hyperelastic constitutive models which only requires experimentally measurable data. To generate input data for our approach, an experiment with full-field measurement has to be conducted to gather testing force and corresponding displacement field of the sample. Then, in the first step of the dual-stage framework, a new finite strain Data-Driven Identification (DDI) formulation is applied. This method enables to identify tuples consisting of stresses and strains by only prescribing the applied boundary conditions and the measured displacement field. In the second step, the data set is used to calibrate a Physics-Augmented Neural Network (PANN), which fulfills all common conditions of hyperelasticity by construction and is very flexible at the same time. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by several descriptive examples. Two-dimensional synthetic data are exemplarily generated in virtual experiments by using a reference constitutive model. The calibrated PANN is then applied in 3D Finite Element simulations. In addition, a real experiment including noisy data is mimicked.</description>

      <title>Fast Higher-Order Interpolation and Restriction in ExaHyPE Avoiding Non-physical Reflections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave equations help us to understand phenomena ranging from earthquakes to tsunamis. These phenomena materialise over very large scales. It would be computationally infeasible to track them over a regular mesh. Yet, since the phenomena are localised, adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) can be used to construct meshes with a higher resolution close to the regions of interest. ExaHyPE is a software engine created to solve wave problems using AMR, and we use it as baseline to construct our numerical relativity application called ExaGRyPE. To advance the mesh in time, we have to interpolate and restrict along resolution transitions in each and every time step. ExaHyPE's vanilla code version uses a d-linear tensor-product approach. In benchmarks of a stationary black hole this performs slowly and leads to errors in conserved quantities near AMR boundaries. We therefore introduce a set of higher-order interpolation schemes where the derivatives are calculated at each coarse grid cell to approximate the enclosed fine cells. The resulting methods run faster than the tensor-product approach. Most importantly, when running the stationary black hole simulation using the higher order methods the errors near the AMR boundaries are removed.</description>

      <title>AneuPy: An open source Python tool for creating simulation-ready geometries of abdominal aortic aneurysms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are localized dilations of the abdominal aorta that can lead to life-threatening rupture if left untreated. AAAs predominantly affect older individuals, with a high mortality rate upon rupture, making early diagnosis and risk assessment critical. The geometric characteristics of an AAA, such as its maximum diameter, asymmetry, and wall thickness, play a crucial role in biomechanical models used to assess rupture risk. Despite the growing use of computational modeling to study AAAs, there is a lack of open source software that facilitates the generation of simulation-ready geometries tailored for biomechanical and hemodynamic analyses. To address this need, we introduce AneuPy, an open-source Python-based tool designed to generate idealized and patient-specific AAA geometrical models. AneuPy provides an efficient and automated approach to aneurysm geometry generation, requiring minimal input data while allowing for flexible parameterization. By streamlining the creation of simulation-ready geometries for finite element analysis (FEA), computational fluid dynamics (CFD), or fluid-structure interaction (FSI) models, AneuPy aims to facilitate research in AAAs and enhance patient-specific risk assessment.</description>

      <title>Trading Devil RL: Backdoor attack via Stock market, Bayesian Optimization and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17908v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of generative artificial intelligence, particularly large language models a number of sub-fields of deep learning have made significant progress and are now very useful in everyday applications. For example,financial institutions simulate a wide range of scenarios for various models created by their research teams using reinforcement learning, both before production and after regular operations. In this work, we propose a backdoor attack that focuses solely on data poisoning and a method of detection by dynamic systems and statistical analysis of the distribution of data. This particular backdoor attack is classified as an attack without prior consideration or trigger, and we name it FinanceLLMsBackRL. Our aim is to examine the potential effects of large language models that use reinforcement learning systems for text production or speech recognition, finance, physics, or the ecosystem of contemporary artificial intelligence models.</description>

      <title>Equi-Euler GraphNet: An Equivariant, Temporal-Dynamics Informed Graph Neural Network for Dual Force and Trajectory Prediction in Multi-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate real-time modeling of multi-body dynamical systems is essential for enabling digital twin applications across industries. While many data-driven approaches aim to learn system dynamics, jointly predicting internal loads and system trajectories remains a key challenge. This dual prediction is especially important for fault detection and predictive maintenance, where internal loads-such as contact forces-act as early indicators of faults, reflecting wear or misalignment before affecting motion. These forces also serve as inputs to degradation models (e.g., crack growth), enabling damage prediction and remaining useful life estimation. We propose Equi-Euler GraphNet, a physics-informed graph neural network (GNN) that simultaneously predicts internal forces and global trajectories in multi-body systems. In this mesh-free framework, nodes represent system components and edges encode interactions. Equi-Euler GraphNet introduces two inductive biases: (1) an equivariant message-passing scheme, interpreting edge messages as interaction forces consistent under Euclidean transformations; and (2) a temporal-aware iterative node update mechanism, based on Euler integration, to capture influence of distant interactions over time. Tailored for cylindrical roller bearings, it decouples ring dynamics from constrained motion of rolling elements. Trained on high-fidelity multiphysics simulations, Equi-Euler GraphNet generalizes beyond the training distribution, accurately predicting loads and trajectories under unseen speeds, loads, and configurations. It outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs focused on trajectory prediction, delivering stable rollouts over thousands of time steps with minimal error accumulation. Achieving up to a 200x speedup over conventional solvers while maintaining comparable accuracy, it serves as an efficient reduced-order model for digital twins, design, and maintenance.</description>
