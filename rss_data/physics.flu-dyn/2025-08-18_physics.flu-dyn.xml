      <title>The Effect of Flow Parameters and Wall Models on Gas-Surface Interactions: A Numerical Investigation of dsmcFoam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmosphere-breathing electric propulsion systems harness atmospheric particles as propellant, enabling efficient operation across diverse environmental conditions. To accurately simulate the captured gas flow through the modules, particle-surface interactions must be carefully modelled. To initiate this research, a parametric study is conducted using an extensive simulation matrix to investigate the effects of flow parameters, such as velocity, temperature, species, and angle of attack, and wall model parameters (diffuse fraction/accommodation coefficient) on gas-surface interactions. A simplified test geometry was created to run 2D simulations, where the flow interacts with an adjacent wall positioned perpendicular to one of the inlet patches. In this study, changes in reflection patterns, force density on the surface, and flow properties in the vicinity of the wall are investigated under varying flow and wall conditions using the current boundary conditions of the dsmcFoam solver. Furthermore, the capabilities of dsmcFoam's default boundary conditions in predicting gas-surface interaction physics are evaluated using the results of the simulation matrix. The findings highlight the need for new boundary conditions to accurately replicate interaction physics across various aspects.</description>

      <title>Bistable flow dynamics of airfoil stall under varying angle of attack: A stochastic model with multiplicative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on the intermittent bistable stall dynamics of an airfoil under varying angle of attack. We propose a one-dimensional Langevin equation where the stochastic forcing depends on the state of the system -- high-lift attached flow or low-lift detached flow -- and where the deterministic potential depends continuously on the angle of attack. The model, identified based on the flow statistics and dynamics, reproduces the S-shaped lift curve, as well as the flow dynamics. It also predicts the nature of the bifurcations that the flow undergoes as the angle of attack varies.</description>

      <title>Coherent Structure Dynamics of Heat Transfer in Wakes of an Inclined Elliptical Cylinder: A Novel Lagrangian Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel Lagrangian-based framework to analyze forced convective heat transfer in the unsteady wake of a heated elliptical cylinder inclined at angles ranging from $\theta = 0^\circ$ to $90^\circ$, in $15^\circ$ increments with $Pr = 0.71$ at a fixed Reynolds number of $Re = 100$. The framework correlates the temporal evolution of the surface-averaged Nusselt number with the dynamic behavior of Lagrangian saddle points, formed at the intersection of repelling and attracting Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCSs) extracted via Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE) fields.The study is carried out within a precisely constructed observational domain, a previously unreported influential region in the near-wake, where the trajectory analysis of the newly defined key saddle points (active saddle points) consistently aligns with the trends in surface heat transfer. This domain enables predictive identification of key transitional events in the Nusselt number profile, including local extrema and slope inflections, across all inclination angles. The analysis reveals that oblique displacement of active saddle points enhances heat transfer by promoting the shedding of repelling LCSs, while parallel displacement leads to weakened heat transfer due to the delayed detachment of repelling coherent structures. The proposed framework enables the construction of a temporal function that closely replicates the monotonicity and transitional features of the Nusselt number evolution. Furthermore, threshold displacement metrics are defined for dominant repelling LCSs to correspond with peak heat transfer efficiency. The proposed methodology not only generalizes across a wide range of inclination angles but also provides a physically interpretable framework for predicting heat transfer enhancement based on coherent structure evolution in unsteady flows.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Breaking in Chemical Systems: Engineering Complexity through Self-Organization and Marangoni Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18006v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Far from equilibrium, chemical and biological systems can form complex patterns and waves through reaction-diffusion coupling. Fluid motion often interferes with these self-organized concentration patterns. In this study, we investigate the influence of Marangoni-driven flows inside a thin layer of fluid ascending the outer surfaces of hydrophilic obstacles on the spatio-temporal dynamics of chemical waves in the modified Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction. Our observations reveal that circular waves originate nearly simultaneously at the obstacles and propagate outward. In a covered setup, where evaporation is minimal, the wavefronts maintain their circular shape. However, in an uncovered setup with significant evaporation and resulting Marangoni flows, the interplay between surface tension-driven Marangoni flows and gravity destabilizes the wavefronts, creating distinctive flower-like patterns around the obstacles. Our analysis shows that here solutal Marangoni forces are more relevant than thermal ones. Our experiments further show that the number of petals formed increases linearly with the obstacle's diameter, though a minimum diameter is required for these instabilities to appear. These findings demonstrate the potential to 'engineer' specific wave patterns, offering a method to control and direct reaction dynamics. This capability is especially important for developing microfluidic devices requiring precise control over chemical wave propagation.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network with Chebyshev Polynomials for Fluid Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04516v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) is essential in scientific forecasting and fluid dynamics. Traditional approaches often incur expensive computational costs and trade-offs in efficiency and accuracy. Recent deep neural networks have improved the accuracy but require high-quality training data. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) effectively integrate physical laws to reduce the data reliance in limited sample scenarios. A novel machine-learning framework, Chebyshev physics-informed Kolmogorov--Arnold network (ChebPIKAN), is proposed to integrate the robust architectures of Kolmogorov--Arnold networks (KAN) with physical constraints to enhance the calculation accuracy of PDEs for fluid mechanics. We study the fundamentals of KAN, take advantage of the orthogonality of Chebyshev polynomial basis functions in spline fitting, and integrate physics-informed loss functions that are tailored to specific PDEs in fluid dynamics, including Allen--Cahn equation, nonlinear Burgers equation, Helmholtz equations, Kovasznay flow, cylinder wake flow, and cavity flow. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed ChebPIKAN model significantly outperforms the standard KAN architecture in solving various PDEs by effectively embedding essential physical information. These results indicate that augmenting KAN with physical constraints can alleviate the overfitting issues of KAN and improve the extrapolation performance. Consequently, this study highlights the potential of ChebPIKAN as a powerful tool in computational fluid dynamics and propose a path toward fast and reliable predictions in fluid mechanics and beyond.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive and Reinforcement Learning Methods for Active Flow Control of an Airfoil with Dual-point Excitation of Plasma Actuators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for active flow control over a NACA 4412 airfoil near static stall at Reynolds number 4*10^5. By systematically evaluating these strategies, the research addresses a critical gap in optimizing excitation frequency and improving response time in flow control. The work contributes to understanding RL adaptability and performance versus MPC in aerodynamic flow separation control. Numerical simulations of the Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes equations with the Scale-Adaptive Simulation turbulence model are used. Dielectric Barrier Discharge plasma actuators in dual-point excitation mode control flow separation. The study evaluates adaptive MPC, temporal difference RL (TDRL), and deep Q-learning (DQL) for optimizing excitation frequency and expediting stabilization. An integrated signal processing DQL approach is also examined. Adaptive MPC achieved Cl = 1.60 at 110 Hz but struggled near physical limits. RL optimized excitation frequencies, reaching Cl = 1.62 in under 2.5 s at 100 or 200 Hz. The study presents a novel RL - MPC comparison for active flow control with DBD actuators, contrasting with prior work focusing on MPC or RL alone. Using an online learning framework, RL methods dynamically adapt to real-time conditions. Evaluating adaptive MPC and RL together in this setup yields new insights into comparative performance in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Shock compression-based equation of state for perfluorohexane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Perfluorohexane is a biocompatible material that serves as a liquid core for acoustically-responsive agents in biomedical applications. Despite its relatively widespread usage, there is a lack of experimental data determining its thermodynamic properties. This challenges numerical simulations to predict the acoustic response of agents developed using this material. In this study, we employ the well-established method of shock compression of materials at relatively high pressures (100--400 MPa) to estimate a kinematic equation of state for perfluorohexane. We use multi-objective optimization to obtain the Noble-Abel Stiffened-Gas equation of state, which is suitable for hydrodynamic numerical simulations. We then apply the extrapolated equation of state to simulate shock-wave propagation within a perfluorohexane droplet showing excellent agreement with equivalent experiments. This validates the equation of state and promotes the use of numerical simulations as a valuable tool for understanding the complex acoustic interactions involved in these biomedical agents, ultimately facilitating their translation for clinical purposes.</description>

      <title>Drops can Perpetually Bounce over a Vibrating Wettable Solid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04264v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On the surface of a vibrating liquid bath, instead of coalescing, a drop will continually bounce on a thin film of air between the drop and the free surface, giving rise to rich chaotic dynamics and quantum analog behavior. However, perpetual bouncing is yet to be demonstrated on a vibrating rigid solid, where the control of the drop's motion is not limited by the bath dynamics. Here we show that vibration of an atomically smooth mica surface prolongs a drop's hovering state by several orders of magnitude, increasing the time to wet from less than a second to several minutes. The excitation of the second spherical harmonic mode determines a transition between a bouncing state with high-amplitude rebounds, and a bound state, where the drop's motion is locked onto the vibrating solid above a thin air layer. We further develop a coupled linear spring model, accounting for the drop's deformation, that predicts bouncing trajectories without fitting parameters. Our results extend the scope of bouncing drop studies beyond the liquid bath and highlight the potential for precision manipulation of small liquid quantities in air.</description>

      <title>Upstream history quantification and scale-decomposed energy analysis for weak-to-strong adverse-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present study delineates the effects of pressure gradient history and local disequilibration on the small and large-scale energy in turbulent boundary layers (TBLs) imposed with a broad range of adverse-pressure-gradients (APG). This is made possible by analyzing four published high-fidelity APG TBL databases, which span weak to strong APGs and cover dynamic conditions ranging from near-equilibrium to strong disequilibrium. The influence of PG history on TBL statistics is quantified by the accumulated PG parameter ($\overline{\beta}$), proposed previously by Vinuesa et al. (2017) to study integral quanitites, which is compared here between cases at matched local PG strength ($\beta$), Reynolds number ($Re$) and ${\rm d}{\beta}/{{\rm d}{Re}}$ at nominally similar orders of magnitude. While the effects of local disequilibration (${\rm d}{\beta}/{{\rm d}{Re}}$) are investigated by considering TBL cases at matched $\beta$, $Re$, and fairly matched $\overline{\beta}$. It is found that $\overline{\beta}$ cannot unambiguously capture history effects when ${\rm d}{\beta}/{{\rm d}{Re}}$ levels are significantly high, as it does not account for the delayed response of the mean flow and turbulence, nor the attenuation of the pressure gradient effect with distance. In two comparisons of APG TBLs under strong non-equilibrium, the values of $\overline{\beta}$ and ${\rm d}{\beta}/{\rm d}{Re}$ expressed using Zagarola-Smits scaling were found to be consistent with the trends in mean velocity defect and Reynolds stresses noted previously for weak APG TBLs. While an increase in $\overline{\beta}$ is associated with energisation of both the small and large scales in the outer regions of APG TBLs, it affects only the large scales in the near-wall region. This confirms the ability of near-wall small scales to rapidly adjust to changes in PG strength.</description>
