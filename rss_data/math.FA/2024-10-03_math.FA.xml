      <title>Improved stability versions of the Pr\'ekopa-Leindler inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of stability for the Pr\'ekopa-Leindler inequality. Exploiting properties of the transport map between radially decreasing functions and a suitable functional version of the trace inequality, we obtain a uniform stability exponent for the Pr\'ekopa-Leindler inequality.
  Our result yields an exponent not only uniform in the dimension but also in the log-concavity parameter $\tau = \min(\lambda,1-\lambda)$ associated with its respective version of the Pr\'ekopa-Leindler inequality. As a further application of our methods, we prove a sharp stability result for log-concave functions in dimension 1, which also extends to a sharp stability result for log-concave radial functions in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Continuity of the solution map for hyperbolic polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperbolic polynomials are monic real-rooted polynomials. By Bronshtein's theorem, the increasingly ordered roots of a hyperbolic polynomial of degree $d$ with $C^{d-1,1}$ coefficients are locally Lipschitz and this solution map ``coefficients-to-roots'' is bounded. We prove continuity of the solution map from hyperbolic polynomials of degree $d$ with $C^d$ coefficients to their increasingly ordered roots with respect to the $C^d$ structure on the source space and the Sobolev $W^{1,q}$ structure, for all $1 \le q&lt;\infty$, on the target space. Continuity fails for $q=\infty$. As a consequence, we obtain continuity of the local surface area of the roots.</description>

      <title>On the continuity of the solution map for polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous work, we proved that the continuous roots of a monic polynomial of degree $d$ whose coefficients depend in a $C^{d-1,1}$ way on real parameters belong to the Sobolev space $W^{1,q}$ for all $1\le q&lt;d/(d-1)$. This is optimal. We obtained uniform bounds that show that the solution map ``coefficients-to-roots'' is bounded with respect to the $C^{d-1,1}$ and the Sobolev $W^{1,q}$ structures on source and target space, respectively. In this paper, we prove that the solution map is continuous, provided that we consider the $C^d$ structure on the space of coefficients. Since there is no canonical choice of an ordered $d$-tuple of the roots, we work in the space of $d$-valued Sobolev functions equipped with a strong notion of convergence. We also interpret the results in the Wasserstein space on the complex plane.</description>

      <title>A few last words on pointwise multipliers of Calder\'on--Lozanovski\u{i} spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We will provide a complete description of the space $M(X_F,X_G)$ of pointwise multipliers between two Calder\'on--Lozanovski\u{i} spaces $X_F$ and $X_G$ built upon a rearrangement invariant space $X$ and two Young functions $F$ and $G$. Meeting natural expectations, the space $M(X_F,X_G)$ turns out to be another Calder\'on--Lozanovski\u{i} space $X_{G \ominus F}$ with $G \ominus F$ being the appropriately understood generalized Young conjugate of $G$ with respect to $F$. Nevertheless, our argument is not a mere transplantation of existing techniques and requires a rather delicate analysis of the interplay between the space $X$ and functions $F$ and $G$. Furthermore, as an example to illustrate applications, we will solve the factorization problem for Calder\'on--Lozanovski\u{i} spaces. All this not only complements and improves earlier results (basically giving them the final touch), but also confirms the conjecture formulated by Kolwicz, Le\'snik and Maligranda in [Pointwise multipliers of Calder\'on--Lozanovski\u{i} spaces, Math. Nachr. 286 (2012), no. 8-9, 876--907]. We will close this work by formulating a number of open questions that outline a promising panorama for future research.</description>

By using Steklov type integral, we introduce a new version of Neural Network operators and we obtain some convergence theorems for the family, such as, pointwise and uniform convergence,rate of convergence via moduli of smoothness of order $r$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, $\mathcal{G}(g,L,M,N,R)\subset \ell^2(\mathbb{S},\mathbb{C}^R)$ denotes a $L-$window super Gabor system on a periodic set $\mathbb{S}$, where $L,M,N,R\in \mathbb{N}$ and $g=\{g_l\}_{l\in \mathbb{N}_L}\subset \ell^2(\mathbb{S},\mathbb{C}^R)$. We characterize which $g$ generates a complete multi-window super Gabor system and a multi-window super Gabor frame $\mathcal{G}(g,L,M,N,R)$ on $\mathbb{S}$ using the vector-valued Zak transform. Admissibility conditions for a periodic set to admit a complete multi-window super Gabor system, multi-window super Gabor (Parseval) frame, and multi--window super Gabor (orthonormal) basis $\mathcal{G}(g,L,M,N,R)$ are given with respect to the parameters $L$, $M$, $N$ and $R$.</description>

      <title>Hammerstein equations for sparse random matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding eigenvalue distributions for a number of sparse random matrix ensembles can be reduced to solving nonlinear integral equations of the Hammerstein type. While a systematic mathematical theory of such equations exists, it has not been previously applied to sparse matrix problems. We close this gap in the literature by showing how one can employ numerical solutions of Hammerstein equations to accurately recover the spectra of adjacency matrices and Laplacians of random graphs. While our treatment focuses on random graphs for concreteness, the methodology has broad applications to more general sparse random matrices.</description>

      <title>Spherical Analysis of Learning Nonlinear Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in the field of functional neural networks. They have been proposed and studied with the aim of approximating continuous functionals defined on sets of functions on Euclidean domains. In this paper, we consider functionals defined on sets of functions on spheres. The approximation ability of deep ReLU neural networks is investigated by novel spherical analysis using an encoder-decoder framework. An encoder comes up first to accommodate the infinite-dimensional nature of the domain of functionals. It utilizes spherical harmonics to help us extract the latent finite-dimensional information of functions, which in turn facilitates in the next step of approximation analysis using fully connected neural networks. Moreover, real-world objects are frequently sampled discretely and are often corrupted by noise. Therefore, encoders with discrete input and those with discrete and random noise input are constructed, respectively. The approximation rates with different encoder structures are provided therein.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an in-depth analysis of a parametrized version of the resolvent composition, an operation that combines a set-valued operator and a linear operator. We provide new properties and examples, and show that resolvent compositions can be interpreted as parallel compositions of perturbed operators. Additionally, we establish new monotonicity results, even in cases when the initial operator is not monotone. Finally, we derive asymptotic results regarding operator convergence, specifically focusing on graph-convergence and the $\rho$-Hausdorff distance.</description>

      <title>Three-Operator Splitting Method with Two-Step Inertial Extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to study the weak convergence analysis of sequence of iterates generated by a three-operator splitting method of Davis and Yin incorporated with two-step inertial extrapolation for solving monotone inclusion problem involving the sum of two maximal monotone operators and a co-coercive operator in Hilbert spaces. Our results improve on the setbacks observed recently in the literature that one-step inertial Douglas-Rachford splitting method may fail to provide acceleration. Our convergence results also dispense with the summability conditions imposed on inertial parameters and the sequence of iterates assumed in recent results on multi-step inertial methods in the literature. Numerical illustrations from image restoration problem and Smoothly Clipped Absolute Deviation (SCAD) penalty problem are given to show the efficiency and advantage gained by incorporating two-step inertial extrapolation over one-step inertial extrapolation for three-operator splitting method.</description>

      <title>The Laplacian with complex magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the two-dimensional magnetic Laplacian when the magnetic field is allowed to be complex-valued. Under the assumption that the imaginary part of the magnetic potential is relatively form-bounded with respect to the real part of the magnetic Laplacian, we introduce the operator as an m-sectorial operator. In two dimensions, sufficient conditions are established to guarantee that the resolvent is compact. In the case of non-critical complex magnetic fields, a WKB approach is used to construct semiclassical pseudomodes, which do not exist when the magnetic field is real-valued.</description>

      <title>Lossless Analog Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06887</link>
      <description>arXiv:1803.06887v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the fundamental limits of lossless analog compression by considering the recovery of arbitrary m-dimensional real random vectors x from the noiseless linear measurements y=Ax with n x m measurement matrix A. Our theory is inspired by the groundbreaking work of Wu and Verdu (2010) on almost lossless analog compression, but applies to the nonasymptotic, i.e., fixed-m case, and considers zero error probability. Specifically, our achievability result states that, for almost all A, the random vector x can be recovered with zero error probability provided that n &gt; K(x), where K(x) is given by the infimum of the lower modified Minkowski dimension over all support sets U of x. We then particularize this achievability result to the class of s-rectifiable random vectors as introduced in Koliander et al. (2016); these are random vectors of absolutely continuous distribution -- with respect to the s-dimensional Hausdorff measure -- supported on countable unions of s-dimensional differentiable submanifolds of the m-dimensional real coordinate space. Countable unions of differentiable submanifolds include essentially all signal models used in the compressed sensing literature. Specifically, we prove that, for almost all A, s-rectifiable random vectors x can be recovered with zero error probability from n&gt;s linear measurements. This threshold is, however, found not to be tight as exemplified by the construction of an s-rectifiable random vector that can be recovered with zero error probability from n&lt;s linear measurements. This leads us to the introduction of the new class of s-analytic random vectors, which admit a strong converse in the sense of n greater than or equal to s being necessary for recovery with probability of error smaller than one. The central conceptual tools in the development of our theory are geometric measure theory and the theory of real analytic functions.</description>

      <title>Recurrence Operators on Function Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although recurrence for dynamical systems has been studied since the end of the nineteenth century, the study of recurrence for linear operators started with papers by Costakis, Manoussos and Parissis in 2012 and 2014. We explore recurrence in Banach algebras, in the space of continuous linear operators on $\omega=\mathbb{C}^{\mathbb{N}},$ and for composition operators whose symbols are linear fractional transformations, acting on weighted Dirichlet spaces. In particular, we show that composition operators with a parabolic non automorphism symbol are never recurrent. Our results relate to work by Gallardo-Guti\'errez and Montes-Rodr\'iguez in their 2004 AMS Memoir in which they show, among other things, that composition operators induced by parabolic non automorphisms are never hypercyclic in weighted Dirichlet spaces. Our work also relates to a more recent paper by Karim, Benchiheb, and Amouch.</description>

      <title>Finitely $C^\infty$-generated associative and Hopf algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce finitely $C^\infty$-generated algebras, which can be treated as `algebras of functions' on non-commutative $C^\infty$-differentiable spaces. Our approach is based on the category of algebras that are projective limits of real Banach algebras of polynomial growth. We prove the existence of some universal constructions in this and some similar categories. By analogy with holomorphically finitely generated algebras of Pirkovskii, a finitely $C^\infty$-generated algebra is defined as a quotient of a finite-rank algebra of `free $C^\infty$-functions'. The latter notion was introduced in a previous article of the author. We prove in a full generality a structure result for `free $C^\infty$-functions', which was announced in that article and proved in dimension at most $2$.
  The central result asserts that the projective tensor product of a finite tuple of finitely $C^\infty$-generated algebras is finitely $C^\infty$-generated. In particular, this makes it natural to consider $C^\infty$-finitely generated topological Hopf algebras. Furthermore, a construction called `envelope' provides a functor from the category of affine real Hopf algebras to the category of $C^\infty$-finitely generated Hopf algebras.</description>

      <title>A lattice approach to matrix weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we recontextualize the theory of matrix weights within the setting of Banach lattices. We define an intrinsic notion of directional Banach function spaces, generalizing matrix weighted Lebesgue spaces. Moreover, we prove an extrapolation theorem for these spaces based on the boundedness of the convex-set valued maximal operator. We also provide bounds and equivalences related to the convex body sparse operator. Finally, we introduce a weak-type analogue of directional Banach function spaces. In particular, we show that the weak-type boundedness of the convex-set valued maximal operator on matrix weighted Lebesgue spaces is equivalent to the matrix Muckenhoupt condition, with equivalent constants.</description>

      <title>Existence and Uniqueness of Solutions of the Koopman--von Neumann Equation on Bounded Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Koopman--von Neumann equation describes the evolution of a complex-valued wavefunction corresponding to the probability distribution given by an associated classical Liouville equation. Typically, it is defined on the whole Euclidean space. The investigation of bounded domains, particularly in practical scenarios involving quantum-based simulations of dynamical systems, has received little attention so far. We consider the Koopman--von Neumann equation associated with an ordinary differential equation on a bounded domain whose trajectories are contained in the set's closure. Our main results are the construction of a strongly continuous semigroup together with the existence and uniqueness of solutions of the associated initial value problem. To this end, a functional-analytic framework connected to Sobolev spaces is proposed and analyzed. Moreover, the connection of the Koopman--von Neumann framework to transport equations is highlighted.</description>

      <title>Normed modules and the categorification of integrations, series expansions, and differentiations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the assignment of norms to $\Lambda$-modules over a finite-dimensional algebra $\Lambda$, resulting in the establishment of normed $\Lambda$-modules. Our primary contribution lies in constructing a new category $\mathscr{N}\!\!or^p$ related to normed modules along with its full subcategory $\mathscr{A}^p$. By examining the objects and morphisms in these categories, we establish a framework for understanding the categorification of integration, series expansions and derivatives. Furthermore, we obtain the Stone--Weierstrass approximation theorem in the sense of $\mathscr{A}^p$.</description>

      <title>Large Perturbations of Nest Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{N}$ be nests on separable Hilbert space. If the two nest algebras are distance less than 1 ($d(\mathcal{T}(\mathcal{M}),\mathcal{T}(\mathcal{N})) &lt; 1$), then the nests are distance less than 1 ($d(\mathcal{M},\mathcal{N})&lt;1$). If the nests are distance less than 1 apart, then the nest algebras are similar, i.e. there is an invertible $S$ such that $S\mathcal{M} = \mathcal{N}$, so that $S \mathcal{T}(\mathcal{M})S^{-1} = \mathcal{T}(\mathcal{N})$. However there are examples of nests closer than 1 for which the nest algebras are distance 1 apart.</description>

      <title>Sobolev inequality and its applications to nonlinear PDE on noncommutative Euclidean spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09100v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the Sobolev inequality on noncommutative Euclidean spaces. As a simple consequence, we obtain the Gagliardo-Nirenberg type inequality and as its application we show global well-posedness of nonlinear PDEs in the noncommutative Euclidean space. Moreover, we show that the logarithmic Sobolev inequality is equivalent to the Nash inequality for possibly different constants in this noncommutative setting by completing the list in noncommutative Varopoulos's theorem in [37]. Finally, we present a direct application of the Nash inequality to compute the time decay for solutions of the heat equation in the noncommutative setting.</description>
