      <title>Chaotic resetting: A resetting strategy for deterministic chaotic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Restarting a stochastic search process can accelerate its completion by providing an opportunity to take a more favorable path with each reset. This strategy, known as stochastic resetting, is well studied in random processes. Here, we introduce chaotic resetting, a fundamentally different resetting strategy designed for deterministic chaotic systems. Unlike stochastic resetting, where randomness is intrinsic to the dynamics, chaotic resetting exploits the extreme sensitivity to initial conditions inherent to chaotic motion: unavoidable uncertainties in the reset conditions effectively generate new realizations of the deterministic process. This extension is nontrivial because some realizations may significantly speed up the search, while others may significantly slow it down. We study the conditions required for chaotic resetting to be consistently advantageous, concluding that it requires the presence of a mixed phase space in which fractal and smooth regions coexist. We quantify its effectiveness by demonstrating substantial reductions in average search times when an optimal resetting interval is used. These results establish a clear conceptual bridge between deterministic chaos and search optimization, opening new avenues for accelerating processes in real-world chaotic systems where perfect control or knowledge of initial conditions is unattainable.</description>

      <title>How many-body chaos emerges in the presence of quasiparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many-body chaos is a default property of many-body systems; at the same time, near-integrable behaviour due to weakly interacting quasiparticles is ubiquitous throughout condensed matter at low temperature. There must therefore be a, possibly generic, crossover between these very different regimes. Here, we develop a theory encapsulating the notion of a cascade of lightcones seeded by sequences of scattering of weakly interacting harmonic modes as witnessed by a suitably defined chaos diagnostic (classical decorrelator) that measures the spatiotemporal profile of many-body chaos. Our numerics deals with the concrete case of a classical Heisenberg chain, for either sign of the interaction, at low temperatures where the short-time dynamics are well captured in terms of non-interacting spin waves. To model low-temperature dynamics, we use ensembles of initial states with randomly embedded point defects in an otherwise ordered background, which provides a controlled setting for studying the scattering events. The decorrelator exhibits a short-time integrable regime followed by an intermediate `scarred' regime of the cascade of lightcones in progress; these then overlap, leading to an avalanche of scattering events which finally yields the standard long-time signature of many-body chaos.</description>

      <title>Score-Based Modeling of Effective Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a constructive framework to learn effective Langevin equations from stationary time series that reproduce, by construction, both the observed steady-state density and temporal correlations of resolved variables. The drift is parameterized in terms of the score function--the gradient of the logarithm of the steady-state distribution--and a constant mobility matrix whose symmetric part controls dissipation and diffusion and whose antisymmetric part encodes nonequilibrium circulation. The score is learned from samples using denoising score matching, while the constant coefficients are inferred from short-lag correlation identities estimated via a clustering-based finite-volume discretization on a data-adaptive state-space partition. We validate the approach on low-dimensional stochastic benchmarks and on partially observed Kuramoto--Sivashinsky dynamics, where the resulting Markovian surrogate captures the marginal invariant measure and temporal correlations of the resolved modes. The resulting Langevin models define explicit reduced generators that enable efficient sampling and forecasting of resolved statistics without direct simulation of the underlying full dynamics.</description>

      <title>Chaotic stochastic resonance in Mackey-Glass equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04874v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic resonance (SR) manifests as switching dynamics between two quasi-stationary states in the stochastic Mackey-Glass equation. We identify chaotic SR, arising from the coexistence of resonance and chaos in stochastic dynamics. In contrast to classical SR, which is described by a random point attractor with a negative largest Lyapunov exponent, chaotic SR is described by a random strange attractor with a positive largest Lyapunov exponent. We observe chaotic SR in the Mackey-Glass equation as well as chaotic SR in the Duffing equation and the underdamped FitzHugh-Nagumo equation, demonstrating the universality of this phenomenon across a broad class of strongly nonlinear random dynamical systems.</description>
