      <title>GPU-Accelerated Charge-Equilibration for Shadow Molecular Dynamics in Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With recent advancements in machine learning for interatomic potentials, Python has become the go-to programming language for exploring new ideas. While machine-learning potentials are often developed in Python-based frameworks, existing molecular dynamics software is predominantly written in lower-level languages. This disparity complicates the integration of machine learning potentials into these molecular dynamics libraries. Additionally, machine learning potentials typically focus on local features, often neglecting long-range electrostatics due to computational complexities. This is a key limitation as applications can require long-range electrostatics and even flexible charges to achieve the desired accuracy. Recent charge equilibration models can address these issues, but they require iterative solvers to assign relaxed flexible charges to the atoms. Conventional implementations also demand very tight convergence to achieve long-term stability, further increasing computational cost. In this work, we present a scalable Python implementation of a recently proposed shadow molecular dynamics scheme based on a charge equilibration model, which avoids the convergence problem while maintaining long-term energy stability and accuracy of observable properties. To deliver a functional and user-friendly Python-based library, we implemented an efficient neighbor list algorithm, Particle Mesh Ewald, and traditional Ewald summation techniques, leveraging the GPU-accelerated power of Triton and PyTorch. We integrated these approaches with the Python-based shadow molecular dynamics scheme, enabling fast charge equilibration for scalable machine learning potentials involving systems with hundreds of thousands of atoms.</description>

      <title>High-Performance Computational Magnetohydrodynamics with Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the AGATE simulation code, a Python-based framework developed primarily for solving the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations while maintaining adaptability to other equation sets. The code employs a modular, object-oriented architecture that separates interface specifications from numerical implementations, allowing users to customize numerical methods and physics models. Built on a Godunov-type finite-volume scheme, AGATE currently supports the ideal, Hall, and Chew-Goldberger-Low (CGL) MHD equations, with multiple acceleration options ranging from Numpy to GPU-enabled computation via NVIDIA CUDA. Performance testing demonstrates that our GPU implementations achieve 40-60x speedups over CPU versions. Comprehensive validation through established benchmarks confirms accurate reproduction of both linear and nonlinear phenomena across different MHD regimes. This combination of modularity, performance, and extensibility makes AGATE suitable for multiple applications: from rapid prototyping to production simulations, and from numerical algorithm development to physics education.</description>

      <title>Optimal Rejection-Free Path Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficient novel path sampling-based framework designed to accelerate the investigation of rare events in complex molecular systems. A key innovation is the shift from sampling restricted path ensemble distributions, as in transition path sampling, to directly sampling the distribution of shooting points. This allows for a rejection-free algorithm that samples the entire path ensemble efficiently. Optimal sampling is achieved by applying a selection bias that is the inverse of the free energy along a reaction coordinate. The optimal reaction coordinate, the committor, is iteratively constructed as a neural network using AI for Molecular Mechanism Discovery (AIMMD), concurrently with the free energy profile, which is obtained through reweighting the sampled path ensembles. We showcase our algorithm on theoretical and molecular bechnmarks, and demonstrate how it provides at the same time molecular mechanism, free energy, and rates at a moderate computational cost.</description>

      <title>Reaction Dynamics of the H + HeH$^+$ $\rightarrow$ He + H$_2^+$ System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reaction dynamics for the H + HeH$^+$ $\rightarrow$ He + H$_2^+$ reaction in its electronic ground state is investigated using two different representations of the potential energy surface (PES). The first uses a combined kernel and neural network representation of UCCSD(T) reference data whereas the second is a corrected PES (cR-PES) that eliminates an artificial barrier in the entrance channel appearing in its initial expansion based on full configuration interaction reference data. Despite the differences between the two PESs, both yield $k_{v=0,j=0} \approx 2 \times 10^{-9}$ cm$^3$/molecule/s at $T = 10$ K which is consistent with a $T-$independent Langevin rate $k_{\rm L} = 2.1 \times 10^{-9}$ cm$^3$/molecule/s but considerably larger than the only experimentally reported value $k_{\rm ICR} = (9.1 \pm 2.5) \times 10^{-10}$ cm$^3$/molecule/s from ion cyclotron resonance experiments. Similarly, branching ratios for the reaction outcomes are comparable for the two PESs. However, when analysing less averaged properties such as initial state-selected $T-$dependent rate coefficients and final vibrational states of the H$_2^+$ product for low temperatures, the differences in the two PESs manifest themselves in the observables. Thus, depending on the property analyzed, accurate and globally valid representations of the PES are required, whereas more approximate and empirical construction schemes can be followed for state-averaged observables.</description>

      <title>Efficient Crystal Structure Prediction Using Genetic Algorithm and Universal Neural Network Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crystal structure prediction (CSP) is crucial for identifying stable crystal structures in given systems and is a prerequisite for computational atomistic simulations. Recent advances in neural network potentials (NNPs) have reduced the computational cost of CSP. However, searching for stable crystal structures across the entire composition space in multicomponent systems remains a significant challenge. Here, we propose a novel genetic algorithm (GA) -based CSP method using a universal NNP. Our GA-based methods are designed to efficiently expand convex hull volumes while preserving the diversity of crystal structures. This approach draws inspiration from the similarity between convex hull updates and Pareto front evolution in multi-objective optimization. Our evaluation shows that the present method outperforms the symmetry-aware random structure generation, achieving a larger convex hull with fewer trials. We demonstrated that our approach, combined with the developed universal NNP (PFP), can accurately reproduce and explore phase diagrams obtained through DFT calculations; this indicates the validity of PFP across a wide range of crystal structures and element combinations. This study, which integrates a universal NNP with a GA-based CSP method, highlights the promise of these methods in materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Limited Diffusion of Silicon in GaN: A DFT Study Supported by Experimental Evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon (Si) is the primary donor dopant in gallium nitride (GaN), introduced through epitaxial growth or ion implantation. However, precise control over Si diffusion remains a critical challenge for high-performance device applications. This study investigates Si diffusion mechanisms in bulk GaN using first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations, supported by ultra-high-pressure annealing (UHPA) experiments. Vacancy-mediated diffusion pathways were analyzed using the SIESTA code, with minimum energy paths (MEPs) and activation barriers determined via the nudged elastic band (NEB) method. The results indicate that Si diffusion barriers vary with crystallographic direction, with the lowest barrier of 3.2 eV along [11-20] and the highest barrier of ~9.9 eV along [1-100], rendering diffusion in this direction highly improbable. Alternative diffusion mechanisms, including direct exchange and ring-like migration, exhibit prohibitively high barriers ($&gt;$12 eV). Phonon calculations confirm that temperature-induced reductions in effective diffusion barriers are minimal. Experimental validation using SIMS analysis on Si-implanted GaN samples subjected to UHPA (1450{\deg}C, 1 GPa) confirms negligible Si diffusion under these extreme conditions. These findings resolve inconsistencies in prior reports and establish that Si-doped GaN remains highly stable, ensuring reliable doping profiles for advanced electronic and optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Mechanostat-type effective density correction for Carter-Hayes growth applied to topology optimization and its efficient interpolation for a target strain energy and volume fraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The need for optimized structures with good mechanical performance for the minimum weight is common in industry. Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) is a Topology Optimization (TO) method offering a trade-off between minimum compliance (i.e., maximum stiffness) and a fixed material amount for a given set of boundary conditions. Since TO is a non-convex problem, its gradient can be tuned by filtering the topology's contour, creating sharper material profiles without necessarily compromising optimality. However, despite simplifying the layout, some filters fail to address manufacturability concerns such as capillarity (thin tweaks as struts) generated by uncertain loading, vibration or fatigue.
  A tailored density-based filtering strategy is offered to tackle this issue. Additionally, volume fraction is left unconstrained so material can be strategically replenished through a logarithmic rule acting on the updated compliance. In doing so, an interpolation space with three degrees of freedom (volume, compliance, minimum thickness) is created, yielding diverse topologies for the same boundary conditions and design values along different stages of evolving topological families with distinct features.
  The optimization process is further accelerated by introducing the volume-compliance iterative scheme as a physical loss function in a Double Distance Neural Network (D$^2$NN), obtaining similar results to 2,000 steps worth of vanilla iteration within 500 training epochs. This proposal offers a novel topology optimization design space based on minimum strut thickness - via filtering - and topological families defined by minimum volume fraction and compliance. The methodology is tested on several examples with diverse loading and boundary conditions, obtaining similarly satisfactory results, and then boosted via Machine Learning, acting as a fast and cheap surrogate.</description>

      <title>Multiscale geometrical Lagrangian statistics of heavy impurities in drift-wave turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of heavy impurities in edge plasma turbulence by analyzing their trajectories using the Hasegawa-Wakatani model. Through direct numerical simulations, we track ensembles of charged impurity particles over hundreds of eddy turnover times within statistically steady turbulent flows. Assuming that heavy impurities lag behind the flow, a novel derivation of relaxation time of heavy impurities is proposed. Our results reveal that heavy impurities can cluster within turbulence. We provide multiscale geometrical Lagrangian statistics of heavy impurities trajectories. To quantify directional changes, we analyze the scale-dependent curvature angle, along with the influence of the Stokes number on the mean curvature angles and the probability distribution function of curvature angles.</description>

Abstract: We present the python package DiPolMol-Py, which can be used to calculate the rotational and hyperfine structure of $^2\Sigma$ molecules. The calculations can be performed in the presence of dc magnetic fields, dc electric fields and far off-resonant optical fields. We additionally include functions to calculate the polarisability of the molecule and the transition dipole moment between different energy eigenstates. The package is applicable to many of the molecules which can be laser cooled, specifically the alkaline earth fluorides. We provide a constants file which includes many of the required literature values for CaF, SrF and BaF. Additional species can easily be added by updating this file.</description>

      <title>Everything everywhere all at once: a probability-based enhanced sampling approach to rare events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17029v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of studying rare events is central to many areas of computer simulations. In a recent paper [Kang, P., et al., Nat. Comput. Sci. 4, 451-460, 2024], we have shown that a powerful way of solving this problem passes through the computation of the committor function, and we have demonstrated how the committor can be iteratively computed in a variational way and the transition state ensemble efficiently sampled. Here, we greatly ameliorate this procedure by combining it with a metadynamics-like enhanced sampling approach in which a logarithmic function of the committor is used as a collective variable. This integrated procedure leads to an accurate and balanced sampling of the free energy surface in which transition states and metastable basins are studied with the same thoroughness. We also show that our approach can be used in cases in which competing reactive paths are possible and intermediate metastable are encountered. In addition, we demonstrate how physical insights can be obtained from the optimized committor model and the sampled data, thus providing a full characterization of the rare event under study. We ascribe the success of this approach to the use of a probability-based description of rare events.</description>

      <title>FeynKrack: A continuum model for quasi-brittle damage through Feynman-Kac killed diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuum damage mechanics (CDM) is a popular framework for modelling crack propagation in solids. The CDM uses a damage parameter to quantitatively assess what one loosely calls `material degradation'. While this parameter is sometimes given a physical meaning, the mathematical equations for its evolution are generally not consistent with such physical interpretations. Curiously, degradation in the CDM may be viewed as a change of measures, wherein the damage variable appears as the Radon-Nikodym derivative. We adopt this point of view and use a probabilistic measure-valued description for the random microcracks underlying quasi-brittle damage. We show that the evolution of the underlying density may be described via killed diffusion as in the Feynman-Kac theory. Damage growth is then interpreted as the reduction in this measure over a region, which in turn quantifies the disruption of bonds through a loss of force-transmitting mechanisms between nearby material points. Remarkably, the evolution of damage admits an approximate closed-form solution. This brings forth substantive computational ease, facilitating fast yet accurate simulations of large dimensional problems. By selecting an appropriate killing rate, one accounts for the irreversibility of damage and thus eliminates the need for ad-hoc history-dependent routes typically employed, say, in phase field modelling of damage. Our proposal FeynKrack (a short form for Feynman-Kac crack propagator) is validated and demonstrated for its efficacy through several simulations on quasi-brittle damage. It also offers a promising stochastic route for future explorations of non-equilibrium thermodynamic aspects of damage.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic combination of loads in topology optimization designs via cumulative damage criteria</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topology optimization (TO) is a well-established methodology for structural design under user-defined constraints, e.g. minimum volume and maximum stiffness. However, such methods have traditionally been applied to static, deterministic loading, in which modulus, position and direction are known and invariant. This is against the probabilistic load combination used in the structural engineering designs, and entails two important shortcomings.
  The first one is related to maintenance and reliability: static loading fails to consider naturally occurring uncertainties in the loading process, measurements or regular service; also ignoring (quantitatively) unforeseen phenomena such as vibrations, and the material's behavior is assumed linear isotropic, ignoring fatigue, plasticity and anisotropy in functionally-graded materials. The second one concerns optimality itself: often times, the structure presented as "optimal" in fact over-estimates loading and thus wastes material by exceeding its real needs and/or distributing it poorly throughout the design dominion.
  In this article, a probabilistic framework is presented: uncertain and pseudo-dynamic loading is introduced to create robust topologies via a reinforced SIMP scheme with embedded penalization addressing fatigue damage, layer direction, mechanical response (traction/compression) and yield limit (von Mises equivalent stress). This computationally efficient framework is applied to various loading scenarios, generating diverse designs for the same volume fraction constraint with improved and more realistic performances. Under the proposed method, if loads are permanent and damage isotropic, the methodology converges to the traditional (deterministic) topological optimization results. Future ramifications of this work are pondered, especially regarding metamaterial design.</description>

Abstract: This document is a hands-on, comprehensive guide to deep learning in the realm of physical simulations. Rather than just theory, we emphasize practical application: every concept is paired with interactive Jupyter notebooks to get you up and running quickly. Beyond traditional supervised learning, we dive into physical loss-constraints, differentiable simulations, diffusion-based approaches for probabilistic generative AI, as well as reinforcement learning and advanced neural network architectures. These foundations are paving the way for the next generation of scientific foundation models. We are living in an era of rapid transformation. These methods have the potential to redefine what's possible in computational science.</description>

      <title>Multiple scales analysis of a nonlinear timestepping instability in simulations of solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The susceptibility of timestepping algorithms to numerical instabilities is an important consideration when simulating partial differential equations (PDEs). Here we identify and analyze a pernicious numerical instability arising in pseudospectral simulations of nonlinear wave propagation resulting in finite-time blow-up. The blow-up time scale is independent of the spatial resolution and spectral basis but sensitive to the timestepping scheme and the timestep size. The instability appears in multi-step and multi-stage implicit-explicit (IMEX) timestepping schemes of different orders of accuracy and has been found to manifest in simulations of soliton solutions of the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation and traveling wave solutions of a nonlinear generalized Klein-Gordon equation. Focusing on the case of KdV solitons, we show that modal predictions from linear stability theory are unable to explain the instability because the spurious growth from linear dispersion is small and nonlinear sources of error growth converge too slowly in the limit of small timestep size. We then develop a novel multi-scale asymptotic framework that captures the slow, nonlinear accumulation of timestepping errors. The framework allows the solution to vary with respect to multiple time scales related to the timestep size and thus recovers the instability as a function of a slow time scale dictated by the order of accuracy of the timestepping scheme. We show that this approach correctly describes our simulations of solitons by making accurate predictions of the blow-up time scale and transient features of the instability. Our work demonstrates that studies of long-time simulations of nonlinear waves should exercise caution when validating their timestepping schemes.</description>

      <title>Predicting Accurate X-ray Absorption Spectra for CN$^+$, CN, and CN$^-$: Insights from Multiconfigurational and Density Functional Simulations</title>

Abstract: High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy is an essential tool in X-ray astronomy, enabling detailed studies of celestial objects and their physical and chemical properties. However, comprehensive mapping of high-resolution X-ray spectra for even simple interstellar and circumstellar molecules is still lacking. In this study, we conducted systematic quantum chemical simulations to predict the C1s X-ray absorption spectra of CN$^+$, CN, and CN$^-$. Our findings provide valuable references for both X-ray astronomy and laboratory studies. We assigned the first electronic peak of CN$^+$ and CN to C1s $\rightarrow \sigma^*$ transitions, while the peak for CN$^-$ corresponds to a C1s $\rightarrow \pi^*$ transition. We explained that the two-fold degeneracy ($\pi^*_{xz}$ and $\pi^*_{yz}$) of the C1s$\rightarrow\pi^*$ transitions results in CN$^-$ exhibiting a significantly stronger first absorption compared to the other two systems. We further calculated the vibronic fine structures for these transitions using the quantum wavepacket method based on multiconfigurational-level, anharmonic potential energy curves, revealing distinct energy positions for the 0-0 absorptions at 280.7 eV, 279.6 eV, and 285.8 eV. Each vibronic profile features a prominent 0-0 peak, showing overall similarity but differing intensity ratios of the 0-0 and 0-1 peaks. Notably, introducing a C1s core hole leads to shortened C-N bond lengths and increased vibrational frequencies across all species. These findings enhance our understanding of the electronic structures and X-ray spectra of carbon-nitrogen species, emphasizing the influence of charge state on X-ray absorptions.</description>

      <title>Multiscale thermodynamic nonequilibrium effects in Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and their relative importance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02474v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the complex kinetics of thermodynamic nonequilibrium effects (TNEs) and their relative importance during the development of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) using high-order discrete Boltzmann models (DBMs). First, the capabilities and differences among various discrete velocity sets in capturing TNEs and distribution functions are assessed. Practical guidelines for constructing discrete velocity stencils are proposed to enhance phase-space discretization and improve the robustness of high-order DBM simulation. At different stages of KHI and under varying initial conditions, multiscale TNEs, such as viscous stresses of different orders, emerge with distinct dominant roles. Specifically, three scenarios are identified: (i) regimes dominated by first-order TNEs,(ii) alternation between first- and second-order TNEs, and (iii) states where second-order TNEs govern the system's behavior. To quantitatively capture these transitions, criteria for TNE dominance at different orders in KHI evolution are established based on the relative thermodynamic nonequilibrium intensity (\(R_{\text{TNE}}\)). In scenarios dominated by second-order TNEs, differences between first-order and second-order models are compared in terms of macroscopic quantities, nonequilibrium effects, and kinetic moments, revealing the physical limitations of low-order models in capturing TNEs. Furthermore, the effectiveness, extensibility, and limitations of a representative high-order model are examined under second-order TNE-dominated conditions. To encapsulate these findings, a nonequilibrium phase diagram that visually maps the multiscale characteristics of KHI is constructed. This diagram not only provides intuitive insights into the dynamic interplay of different nonequilibrium effects but also serves as a kinetic roadmap for selecting suitable models under diverse nonequilibrium conditions.</description>

      <title>Applying the Liouville-Lanczos Method of Time-Dependent Density-Functional Theory to Warm Dense Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ab initio modeling of dynamic structure factors (DSF) and related density response properties in the warm dense matter (WDM) regime is a challenging computational task. The DSF, convolved with a probing X-ray beam and instrument function, is measured in X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) experiments, which allows for the study of electronic structure properties at the microscopic level. Among the various ab initio methods, linear response time-dependent density functional theory (LR-TDDFT) is a key framework for simulating the DSF. The standard approach in LR-TDDFT for computing the DSF relies on the orbital representation. A significant drawback of this method is the unfavorable scaling of the number of required empty bands as the wavenumber increases, making LR-TDDFT impractical for modeling XRTS measurements over large energy scales, such as in backward scattering geometry. We consider and test an alternative approach that employs the Liouville-Lanczos (LL) method for simulating the DSF. This approach does not require empty states and allows the DSF at large momentum transfer values and over a broad frequency range to be accessed. We compare the results obtained from the LL method with those from the standard LR-TDDFT within the projector augmented-wave formalism for isochorically heated aluminum and warm dense hydrogen. Additionally, we utilize exact path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) results for the imaginary-time density-density correlation function (ITCF) of warm dense hydrogen to rigorously benchmark the LL approach. We discuss the application of the LL method for calculating DSFs and ITCFs at different wavenumbers, the effects of pseudopotentials, and the role of Lorentzian smearing. The successful validation of the LL method under WDM conditions makes it a valuable addition to the ab initio simulation landscape, supporting experimental efforts and advancing WDM theory.</description>

      <title>Revealing Nanostructures in High-Entropy Alloys via Machine-Learning Accelerated Scalable Monte Carlo Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The computational cost of traditional first-principles method quickly becomes prohibitively expensive as the number of atoms increases. This challenge is further amplified by the need to evaluate finite-temperature properties with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, which is inherently challenging to parallelize due to sequential Markov chain updates. Here, we introduce Scalable Monte Carlo (SMC), an efficient MC simulation method that overcomes the parallelization bottlenecks in conventional MC simulation, reducing the computational complexity of a MC sweep from quadratic to linear. We present a GPU implementation of the SMC method, SMC-GPU, which simultaneously harnesses the thousands of processing cores on a GPU to accelerate the computation. By adopting a data-driven workflow that surrogates the computationally expensive density functional theory (DFT) with ML models, we demonstrate that SMC-GPU is capable of simulating systems of more than one-billion atoms, while maintaining the accuracy of first-principles methods. Using this unprecedented capability, we performed billion-atom MC simulations to investigate the nanostructure evolution of two important high-entropy alloys (HEAs), FeCoNiAlTi and MoNbTaW, in which the nanostructures are believed to be responsible for their superb mechanical properties. Our results reveal a rich diversity of nanostructures, including nanoparticles (NP), 3D-connected NP, and disorder protected nanophases. We quantitatively analyze the size, composition, and morphology of the nanostructures, as well as directly simulate the atom-probe-tomography (APT) needle. The results align well with available experimental observations. This work underscores the promising potential of leveraging large-scale MC simulation to explore the largely uncharted territory of nanostructure evolution in HEAs.</description>

      <title>Immersed boundary - lattice Boltzmann method for wetting problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a mesoscale computational model to describe the interaction of a droplet with a solid. The model is based on the hybrid combination of the immersed boundary and the lattice Boltzmann computational schemes: the former is used to model the non-ideal sharp interface of the droplet coupled with the inner and outer fluids, simulated with the lattice Boltzmann scheme. We further introduce an interaction force to model the wetting interactions of the droplet with the solid: this interaction force is designed with the key computational advantage of providing a regularization of the interface profile close to the contact line, avoiding abrupt curvature changes that could otherwise cause numerical instabilities. The proposed model substantially improves earlier immersed boundary - lattice Boltzmann models for wetting in that it allows a description of an ample variety of wetting interactions, ranging from hydrophobic to hydrophilic cases, without the need for any pre-calibration study on model parameters to be used. Model validations against theoretical results for droplet shape at equilibrium and scaling laws for droplet spreading dynamics are addressed.</description>
