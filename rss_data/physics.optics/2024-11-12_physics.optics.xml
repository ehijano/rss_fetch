      <title>Corner cutting connects chiral colorimetry to net electric flux in lossless all-dielectric metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All-dielectric metasurfaces can produce structural colors, but the most advantageous design criteria are still being investigated. This work numerically studies how the two-dimensional shape of nanoparticles affects the colorimetric response under circularly polarized light (CPL) to develop a sensor distinguishing CPL orientations. Using lossless dielectric materials (silicon nitride on silicon dioxide), we achieve far-field dichroism by modifying oblong nanoparticles into L-shaped structures through corner cuts. This design suppresses one electric dipole under CPL illumination, leading to differential colorimetric responses. We link these responses to a decoupling effect in the near-field net electric flux. Our findings provide design guidelines for all-dielectric, lossless colorimetric sensors of chiral light.</description>

      <title>Bridging classical and quantum approaches in optical polarimetry: Predicting polarization-entangled photon behavior in scattering environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore quantum-based optical polarimetry as a potential diagnostic tool for biological tissues by developing a theoretical and experimental framework to understand polarization-entangled photon behavior in scattering media. We investigate the mathematical relationship between Wolf's coherency matrix in classical optics and the density matrix formalism of quantum mechanics which allows for the extension of classical Monte Carlo method to quantum states. The developed generalized Monte Carlo approach uniquely integrates the Bethe-Salpeter equation for classical scattering, the Jones vector formalism for polarization, and the density matrix approach for quantum state representation. Therefore, this unified framework can model both classical and quantum polarization states, handle multi-photon states, and account for varying degrees of entanglement. Additionally, it facilitates the prediction of quantum state evolution in scattering media based on classical optical principles. The validity of the computational model is experimentally confirmed through high-fidelity agreement between predicted and measured quantum state evolution in tissue-mimicking phantoms. This work bridges the gap between classical and quantum optical polarimetry by developing and validating a comprehensive theoretical framework that unifies these traditionally distinct domains, paving the way for future quantum-enhanced diagnostics of tissues and other turbid environments.</description>

      <title>Interface second harmonic generation enhancement in hetero-bilayer van der Waals nanoantennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered van der Waals (vdW) materials have emerged as a promising platform for nanophotonics due to large refractive indexes and giant optical anisotropy. Unlike conventional dielectrics and semiconductors, the absence of covalent bonds between layers allows for novel degrees of freedom in designing optically resonant nanophotonic structures down to the atomic scale, from the precise stacking of vertical heterostructures to controlling the twist angle between crystallographic axes. Specifically, while transition metal dichalcogenides monolayers exhibit giant second order nonlinear responses, their bulk counterparts with 2H stacking have zero second order response. In this work, we show second harmonic generation (SHG) arising from the interface of WS$_2$/MoS$_2$ hetero-bilayer thin films with an additional SHG enhancement in nanostructured optical antennas mediated by both the excitonic resonances and the anapole condition. When both conditions are met, we observe up to $10^2$ SHG signal enhancement. Our results highlights vdW materials as a platform for designing unique multilayer optical nanostructures and metamaterial, paving the way for advanced applications in nanophotonics and nonlinear optics.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning in Classical X-ray Ghost Imaging for Dose Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ghost imaging (GI) is an unconventional technique that combines information from two correlated patterned light fields to compute an image of the object of interest. GI can be performed with visible light as well as penetrating radiation such as x-rays, electrons, etc. Penetrating radiation is usually ionizing and damages biological specimens; therefore, minimising the dose of this radiation in a medical or biological imaging context is important. GI has been proposed as a potential way to achieve this. With prior knowledge of the object of interest, such as sparsity in a specific basis (e.g., Fourier basis) or access to a large dataset for neural network training, it is possible to reconstruct an image of the object with a limited number of measurements. However, low sampling does not inherently equate to low dose. Here, we specifically explore the scenario where reduced sampling corresponds to low-dose conditions. In this simulation-based paper, we examine how deep learning (DL) techniques could reduce dose in classical x-ray GI. Since GI is based on illumination patterns, we start by exploring optimal sets of patterns that allow us to reconstruct the image with the fewest measurements, or lowest sampling rate, possible. We then propose a DL neural network that can directly reconstruct images from GI measurements even when the sampling rate is extremely low. We demonstrate that our deep learning-based GI (DLGI) approach has potential in image reconstruction, with results comparable to direct imaging (DI) at the same dose. However, given the same prior knowledge and detector quantum efficiency, it is very challenging for DLGI to outperform DI under low-dose conditions. We discuss how it may be achievable due to the higher sensitivity of bucket detectors over pixel detectors.</description>

      <title>A color-corrected, high-contrast catadioptric relay for high-resolution biological photolithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale synthesis of DNA and RNA is a crucial technology for modern biological research ranging from genomics to nucleic acid therapeutics and for technological research ranging from nanofabrication of materials to molecular-level writing of digital data. Maskless Array Synthesis (MAS) is a versatile and efficient approach for creating the required complex microarrays and libraries of DNA and other nucleic acids for these applications and, more generally, for the synthesis of sequence-defined engineered and biological oligomers. MAS uses digital photomasks displayed by a digital micromirror device (DMD) illuminated by an appropriate light source and imaged into a photochemical reaction chamber with an optical relay system. Previously, Offner relay systems were used for imaging, but modern DMD formats with more and smaller micromirrors favor a different solution. We present a desktop MAS optical system with the larger numerical aperture and larger field of view required by 1080p and other large-format DMDs. The resulting catadioptric relay is well suited to modern DMDs in this application, and is corrected for first order axial and lateral color, enabling the use of high-power LEDs as inexpensive and long-lasting light sources spanning the ultraviolet-to-violet to perform the required photochemistry. Additional characteristics of the system, including high contrast and low scatter, make it ideal for reducing the error rates in photochemical synthesis of biomolecules.</description>

      <title>Chiral quantum optics: recent developments, and future directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral quantum optics is a growing field of research where light-matter interactions become asymmetrically dependent on momentum and spin, offering novel control over photonic and electronic degrees of freedom. Recently, the platforms for investigating chiral light-matter interactions have expanded from laser-cooled atoms and quantum dots to various solid-state systems, such as microcavity polaritons and two-dimensional layered materials, integrated into photonic structures like waveguides, cavities, and ring resonators. In this perspective, we begin by establishing the foundation for understanding and engineering these chiral light-matter regimes. We review the cutting-edge platforms that have enabled their successful realization in recent years, focusing on solid-state platforms, and discuss the most relevant experimental challenges to fully harness their potential. Finally, we explore the vast opportunities these chiral light-matter interfaces present, particularly their ability to reveal exotic quantum many-body phenomena, such as chiral many-body superradiance and fractional quantum Hall physics.</description>

      <title>Brillouin photonics engine in the thin-film lithium niobate platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) is revolutionizing low-noise lasers and microwave photonic systems. However, despite extensive explorations of a low-loss and versatile integrated platform for Brillouin photonic circuits, current options fall short due to limited technological scalability or inadequate SBS gain. Here we introduce the thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) platform as the go-to choice for integrated Brillouin photonics applications. We report the angle-dependent strong SBS gain in this platform, which can overcome the intrinsic propagation loss. Furthermore, we demonstrate the first stimulated Brillouin laser in TFLN with a tuning range &gt; 20 nm and utilize it to achieve high-purity RF signal generation with an intrinsic linewidth of 9 Hz. Finally, we devise a high-rejection Brillouin-based microwave photonic notch filter, for the first time, integrating an SBS spiral, an on-chip modulator, and a tunable ring all within the same platform. This TFLN-based Brillouin photonics engine uniquely combines the scalability of this platform and the versatility of SBS. Moreover, it bridges SBS with other functionalities in the TFLN platform, unlocking new possibilities for Brillouin-based applications with unparalleled performances.</description>

      <title>Opportunities and Challenges of Solid-State Quantum Nonlinear Optics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear interactions between single quantum particles are at the heart of any quantum information system, including analog quantum simulation and fault-tolerant quantum computing. This remains a particularly difficult problem for photonic qubits, as photons do not interact with each other. While engineering light-matter interaction can effectively create photon-photon interaction, the required photon number to observe any nonlinearity is very high, where any quantum mechanical signature disappears. However, with emerging low-dimensional materials, and engineered photonic resonators, the photon number can be potentially reduced to reach the quantum nonlinear optical regime. In this review paper, we discuss different mechanisms exploited in solid-state platforms to attain quantum nonlinear optics. We review emerging materials and optical resonator architecture with different dimensionalities. We also present new research directions and open problems in this field.</description>

      <title>Remote picometric acoustic sensing via ultrastable laser interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic detection has many applications across science and technology, from medical to imaging and communications. However, most acoustic sensors have a common limitation in that the detection must be near the acoustic source. Alternatively laser interferometry with picometer-scale motional displacement detection can rapidly and precisely measure sound induced minute vibrations on remote surfaces. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of sound detection up to 100 kHz at remote sites with ~ 60 m of optical path length via laser homodyne interferometry. Based on our ultrastable Hz-linewidth laser with 10-15 fractional stability, our laser interferometer achieves 0.5 pm/Hz1/2 displacement sensitivity near 10 kHz, bounded only by laser frequency noise over 10 kHz. Between 140 Hz to 15 kHz, we achieve a homodyne acoustic sensing sensitivity of sub-nm/Pa across our conversational frequency overtones. The minimal sound pressure detectable over 60 m of optical path length is ~ 2 mPa, with dynamic ranges over 100 dB. With the demonstrated standoff picometric distance metrology, we successfully detected and reconstructed musical scores of normal conversational volumes with high fidelity. The acoustic detection via this precision laser interferometer could be applied to selective area sound sensing for remote acoustic metrology, optomechanical vibrational motion sensing and ultrasensitive optical microphones at the laser frequency noise limits.</description>

      <title>All-On-chip Reconfigurable Structured Light Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured light carrying angular momentum, such as spin angular momentum (SAM) and orbital angular momentum (OAM), has been at the core of new science and applications, driving the need for compact on-chip sources. While many static on-chip solutions have been demonstrated, as well as on-chip sources of free-space modes, no architecture that is fully reconfigurable in all angular momentum states and all on-chip has so far been possible. Here we report the first all-on-chip structured light generator for the creation of both scalar and vectorial angular momentum beams, facilitated through a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) chip with a silica mode multiplexer (silica chip). We selectively stimulate six linearly-polarized (LP) modes of the silica multimode bus waveguide, precisely controlling the modal powers and phases with the SOI chip. This allows us to tailor arbitrary superpositions of the mode set thus synthesizing common cylindrical vector vortex beams as well as OAM beams of controlled spin and topological charge. Our compact structured light generator exhibits high switching speed and operates across the telecom band, paving the way for applications such as optical communication and integrated quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Photonic Matrix Multiplier Makes a Direction-Finding Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a photonic integrated circuit solution for the direction-of-arrival estimation in the optical frequency band. The proposed circuit is built on discrete sampling of the phasefront of an incident optical beam and its analog processing in a photonic matrix-vector multiplier that maps the angle of arrival into the intensity profile at the output ports. We derive conditions for perfect direction-of-arrival sensing for a discrete set of incident angles and its continuous interpolation and discuss the angular resolution and field-of-view of the proposed device in terms of the number of input and output ports of the matrix multiplier. We show that while, in general, a non-unitary matrix operation is required for perfect direction finding, under certain conditions, it can be approximated with a unitary operation that simplifies the device complexity while coming at the cost of reducing the field of view. The proposed device will enable real-time direction-finding sensing through its ultra-compact design and minimal digital signal processing requirements.</description>

      <title>Monochromatization of Electron Beams with Spatially and Temporally Modulated Optical Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inelastic interaction between coherent light with constant frequency and free electrons enables periodic phase modulation of electron wave packets leading to periodic side-bands in the electron energy spectra. In this Letter we propose a generalization of the interaction by considering linearly chirped electron wave packets interacting with chirped optical fields. We theoretically demonstrate that when matching the chirp parameters of the electron and light waves, the interaction leads to partial monochromatization of the electron spectra in one of the energy side-bands. Depending on the coherence time of the electrons, the electron spectrum may be narrowed down by a factor of 5-times with 26% of the electron distribution in the monochromatized energy band. This approach will improve the spectral resolution and reduce color aberrations in ultrafast imaging experiments with free electrons.</description>

      <title>Focused ion beam polishing based optimization of high-Q silica microdisk resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whispering gallery mode (WGM) microdisk resonators are promising optical devices that confine light efficiently and enable enhanced nonlinear optical effects. This work presents a novel approach to reduce sidewall roughness in SiO\textsubscript{2} microdisk resonators using focused ion beam (FIB) polishing. The microdisks, with varying diameter ranging from 5 to 20 $\mu$m are fabricated using a multi-step fabrication scheme. However, the etching process introduces significant sidewall roughness, which increases with decreasing microdisk radius, degrading the resonators' quality. To address this issue, a FIB system is employed to polish the sidewalls, using optimized process parameters to minimize Ga ion implantation. White light interferometry measurements reveal a significant reduction in surface roughness from 7 nm to 20 nm for a 5 $\mu$m diameter microdisk, leading to a substantial enhancement in the scattering quality factor (Qss) from $3\times 10^2$ to $2\times 10^6$. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of FIB polishing in improving the quality of microdisk resonators and open up new possibilities for the fabrication of advanced photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Crossover from inhomogeneous to homogeneous response of a resonantly driven hBN quantum emitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate a solid-state quantum emitter - a B center in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) - that has lifetime-limited coherence at short times, and experiences inhomogeneous broadening due to spectral diffusion at longer times. By making use of power broadening in resonant laser excitation, we explore the crossover between the inhomogeneous and the homogeneous broadening regimes. With the support of numerical simulations, we show that the lineshape, count rate, second-order correlations and long-time photon statistics evolve from a regime where they are dictated by spectral diffusion to a regime where they are simply given by the homogeneous response of the emitter, yielding restored Lorentzian shape and Poissonian photon statistics. Saturation of the count rate and line broadening occur not at the onset of the Rabi oscillations, but when the power-broadened homogeneous response becomes comparable with the inhomogeneous linewidth. Moreover, we identify specific signatures in both the second-order correlations and long-time photon statistics that are well explained by a microscopic spectral diffusion model based on discrete jumps at timescales of micro- to milliseconds. Our work provides an extensive description of the photophysics of B-centers under resonant excitation, and can be readily extended to a wide variety of solid-state quantum emitters.</description>

      <title>Transverse orbital angular momentum of amplitude-perturbed fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review and clarify several recent theoretical approaches to transverse orbital angular momentum (tOAM). We then apply our tOAM theory [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 193901 (2021)] to calculate the spatiotemporal torque applied to a light pulse by a pure amplitude perturbation. The theoretical results and associated simulations are in excellent agreement with experiments measuring the change in tOAM per photon, delta_Ly. The crucial factor in determining delta_Ly is the spatiotemporal distribution of tOAM density in the pulse. We show that even Gaussian pulses with zero total tOAM can have net tOAM induced by an amplitude perturbation stationary in the lab frame.</description>

      <title>Floquet Topological Dissipative Kerr Solitons and Incommensurate Frequency Combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating coherent optical frequency combs in micro-ring resonators with Kerr nonlinearity has remarkably advanced the fundamental understanding and applications of temporal dissipative solitons. However, the spectrum of such soliton combs is restricted to the conventional definition of combs as phase-locked, equidistant lines in frequency. Here, we introduce a new class of floquet topological soliton combs that emerge in two-dimensional arrays of strongly coupled resonators engineered using floquet topology. Specifically, we demonstrate novel incommensurate combs where the comb lines are not equidistant but remain phase-locked. These incommensurate combs are generated by self-organized, phase-locked floquet topological soliton molecules that circulate the edge of the array. We show that these floquet topological solitons are robust and they navigate around defects, allowing for agile tunability of the comb line spacing. Our results introduce a new paradigm in using floquet engineering to generate unconventional frequency combs beyond those achievable with single or weakly coupled resonators.</description>

      <title>Dual axis atomic magnetometer and gyroscope enabled by nuclear spin perturbation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alkali-noble-gas comagnetometers have become an essential tool for tests of fundamental physics and offer a compact platform for precision gyroscopy. They are, however, limited by technical noise at low frequencies, commonly due to their limited suppression of magnetic noise. Here we investigate a new method for co-magnetometry between a single noble gas and alkali species. While similar to well-known devices using self-compensation, our scheme introduces magnetic pulses that controllably perturb the noble gas and pulsed optical pumping to polarise the alkali atoms. These applied pulses allow our scheme to measure, rather than just suppress, the effect of magnetic noise thereby offering reduced cross-talk. We show numerically that our scheme retrieves four signals (rotations and magnetic fields on two transverse axes) with similar sensitivity to a single axis device. We also present a proof-of-principle experiment based on a 87Rb-129Xe cell. Our data shows a low magnetic-rotation cross-talk of $0.2 \pm 0.1\mu$Hz$/$pT, which is already on par with the most sensitive devices relying on self-compensation.</description>

      <title>Prion-ViT: Prions-Inspired Vision Transformers for Temperature prediction with Specklegrams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fiber Specklegram Sensors (FSS) are widely used in environmental monitoring due to their high sensitivity to temperature fluctuations, yet the complex, nonlinear nature of specklegram data poses significant challenges for conventional predictive models. This study introduces a novel Prion-Vision Transformer (Prion-ViT) model, inspired by biological prion memory mechanisms, to enhance long-term dependency modeling for accurate temperature prediction using FSS data. By leveraging a persistent memory state, the Prion-ViT effectively retains and propagates essential features across multiple layers, thereby improving prediction accuracy and reducing mean absolute error (MAE) to "0.52 Degree Celsius" outperforming traditional models like ResNet, Inception Net V2, and existing transformer-based architectures. The study addresses the specific challenges of applying Vision Transformers (ViTs) to FSS data and demonstrates that the prion-inspired memory mechanism offers a robust solution for capturing complex optical interference patterns in specklegrams. These findings establish Prion-ViT as a promising advancement for real-time industrial temperature monitoring applications, with potential applicability to other optical sensing domains.</description>

      <title>Integrated-Photonics-Based Systems for Polarization-Gradient Cooling of Trapped Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trapped ions are a promising modality for quantum systems, with demonstrated utility as the basis for quantum processors and optical clocks. However, traditional trapped-ion systems are implemented using complex free-space optical configurations, whose large size and susceptibility to vibrations and drift inhibit scaling to large numbers of qubits. In recent years, integrated-photonics-based systems have been demonstrated as an avenue to address the challenge of scaling trapped-ion systems while maintaining high fidelities. While these previous demonstrations have implemented both Doppler and resolved-sideband cooling of trapped ions, these cooling techniques are fundamentally limited in efficiency. In contrast, polarization-gradient cooling can enable faster and more power-efficient cooling and, therefore, improved computational efficiencies in trapped-ion systems. While free-space implementations of polarization-gradient cooling have demonstrated advantages over other cooling mechanisms, polarization-gradient cooling has never previously been implemented using integrated photonics. In this paper, we design and experimentally demonstrate key polarization-diverse integrated-photonics devices and utilize them to implement a variety of integrated-photonics-based polarization-gradient-cooling systems, culminating in the first experimental demonstration of polarization-gradient cooling of a trapped ion by an integrated-photonics-based system. By demonstrating polarization-gradient cooling using an integrated-photonics-based system and, in general, opening up the field of polarization-diverse integrated-photonics-based devices and systems for trapped ions, this work facilitates new capabilities for integrated-photonics-based trapped-ion platforms.</description>

      <title>Sub-Doppler cooling of a trapped ion in a phase-stable polarization gradient</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trapped ions provide a highly controlled platform for quantum sensors, clocks, simulators, and computers, all of which depend on cooling ions close to their motional ground state. Existing methods like Doppler, resolved sideband, and dark resonance cooling balance trade-offs between the final temperature and cooling rate. A traveling polarization gradient has been shown to cool multiple modes quickly and in parallel, but utilizing a stable polarization gradient can achieve lower ion energies, while also allowing more tailorable light-matter interactions in general. In this paper, we demonstrate cooling of a trapped ion below the Doppler limit using a phase-stable polarization gradient created using trap-integrated photonic devices. At an axial frequency of $2\pi\cdot1.45~ \rm MHz$ we achieve $\langle n \rangle = 1.3 \pm 1.1$ in $500~\mu \rm s$ and cooling rates of ${\sim}0.3 \, \rm quanta/\mu s$. We examine ion dynamics under different polarization gradient phases, detunings, and intensities, showing reasonable agreement between experimental results and a simple model. Cooling is fast and power-efficient, with improved performance compared to simulated operation under the corresponding running wave configuration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional materials offering ultrafast photoresponse suffer from low intrinsic absorbance, especially in the mid-infrared wavelength range. Challenges in 2d material doping further complicate the creation of light-sensitive $p-n$ junctions. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a graphene-based infrared detector with simultaneously enhanced absorption and strong structural asymmetry enabling zero-bias photocurrent. A key element for those properties is an asymmetric singular metasurface (ASMS) atop graphene with keen metal wedges providing singular enhancement of local absorbance. The ASMS geometry predefines extra device functionalities. The structures with connected metallic wedges demonstrate polarization ratios up to 200 in a broad range of carrier densities at a wavelength of 8.6 $\mu$m. The structures with isolated wedges display gate-controlled switching between polarization-discerning and polarization-stable photoresponse, a highly desirable yet scarce property for polarized imaging.</description>

      <title>A Fully Analog Pipeline for Portfolio Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Portfolio optimization is a ubiquitous problem in financial mathematics that relies on accurate estimates of covariance matrices for asset returns. However, estimates of pairwise covariance could be better and calculating time-sensitive optimal portfolios is energy-intensive for digital computers. We present an energy-efficient, fast, and fully analog pipeline for solving portfolio optimization problems that overcomes these limitations. The analog paradigm leverages the fundamental principles of physics to recover accurate optimal portfolios in a two-step process. Firstly, we utilize equilibrium propagation, an analog alternative to backpropagation, to train linear autoencoder neural networks to calculate low-rank covariance matrices. Then, analog continuous Hopfield networks output the minimum variance portfolio for a given desired expected return. The entire efficient frontier may then be recovered, and an optimal portfolio selected based on risk appetite.</description>

      <title>A hybrid single quantum dot coupled cavity on a CMOS-compatible SiC photonic chip for Purcell-enhanced deterministic single-photon emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to control nonclassical light emission from a single quantum emitter by an integrated cavity may unleash new perspectives for integrated photonic quantum applications. However, coupling a single quantum emitter to cavity within photonic circuitry towards creation of the Purcell-enhanced single-photon emission is elusive due to the complexity of integrating active devices in low-loss photonic circuits. Here we demonstrate a hybrid micro-ring resonator (HMRR) coupled with self-assembled quantum dots (QDs) for cavity-enhanced deterministic single-photon emission. The HMRR cavity supports whispering-gallery modes with quality factors up to 7800. By further introducing a micro-heater, we show that the photon emission of QDs can be locally and dynamically tuned over one free spectral ranges of the HMRR (~4 nm). This allows precise tuning of individual QDs in resonance with the cavity modes, thereby enhancing single-photon emission with a Purcell factor of about 4.9. Our results on the hybrid integrated cavities coupled with two-level quantum emitters emerge as promising devices for chip-based scalable photonic quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Optimized Quality of Service prediction in FSO Links over South Africa using Ensemble Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fibre optic communication system is expected to increase exponentially in terms of application due to the numerous advantages over copper wires. The optical network evolution presents several advantages such as over long-distance, low-power requirement, higher carrying capacity and high bandwidth among others Such network bandwidth surpasses methods of transmission that include copper cables and microwaves. Despite these benefits, free-space optical communications are severely impacted by harsh weather situations like mist, precipitation, blizzard, fume, soil, and drizzle debris in the atmosphere, all of which have an impact on the Quality of Service (QoS) rendered by the systems. The primary goal of this article is to optimize the QoS using the ensemble learning models Random Forest, ADaBoost Regression, Stacking Regression, Gradient Boost Regression, and Multilayer Neural Network. To accomplish the stated goal, meteorological data, visibility, wind speed, and altitude were obtained from the South Africa Weather Services archive during a ten-year period (2010 to 2019) at four different locations: Polokwane, Kimberley, Bloemfontein, and George. We estimated the data rate, power received, fog-induced attenuation, bit error rate and power penalty using the collected and processed data. The RMSE and R-squared values of the model across all the study locations, Polokwane, Kimberley, Bloemfontein, and George, are 0.0073 and 0.9951, 0.0065 and 0.9998, 0.0060 and 0.9941, and 0.0032 and 0.9906, respectively. The result showed that using ensemble learning techniques in transmission modeling can significantly enhance service quality and meet customer service level agreements and ensemble method was successful in efficiently optimizing the signal to noise ratio, which in turn enhanced the QoS at the point of reception.</description>

      <title>Quartic soliton solutions of a normal dispersion based mode-locked laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We studied the characteristics, regions of existence and stability of different types of solitons for a distributed model of a mode-locked laser whose dispersion is purely quartic and normal. Among the different types of solitons, we identified three main branches that are named according to their different amplitude: low, medium and high amplitude solitons. It was found that the first solitons are always unstable while the latter two exist and are stable in relatively large regions of the parameter space. Moreover, the stability regions of medium and high amplitude solitons overlap over a certain range of parameters, manifesting effects of bistability. The energy of high amplitude solitons increases quadratically with their width, whereas the energy of medium amplitude solitons may decrease or increase with the width depending on the parameter region. Furthermore, we have investigated the long term evolution of the continuous wave solutions under modulational instability, showing that medium amplitude solitons can arise in this scenario. Additionally, we assessed the effects of second and third order dispersion on medium and high amplitude solitons and found that both remain stable in the presence of these terms.</description>

      <title>Autonomous robotic mechanical exfoliation of two-dimensional semiconductors combined with Bayesian optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simple mechanical exfoliation of layered materials is the most frequently employed method for producing high-quality monolayers of two-dimensional semiconducting materials. However, the mechanical exfoliation by human hands is a microscopically sophisticated process with a large number of microscopic parameters, which requires significant operator efforts and limits the reproducibility in achieving high-quality and large-area monolayer semiconducting materials. Herein, we have proposed a new strategy for the mechanical exfoliation by combining a developed robotic system and Bayesian optimization. We have demonstrated that it is possible to explore the optimized experimental conditions among a large number of parameter combinations for mechanical exfoliation in a relatively small number of experimental trials. Moreover, the entire mechanical exfoliation process from preparation to detection of monolayer semiconductors was performed by the developed autonomous robotic system. The optimized experimental condition was determined through only 30 trials of mechanical exfoliation experiments, representing 2.5% of all experimental parameter conditions. As a result, the critical parameters for the efficient fabrication of large-area monolayer WSe$_2$ were elucidated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, a novel experimental setup analogous to joint spin/polarization measurement experiments is proposed by establishing a direct relationship between path (momentum) entanglement and concurrence. The results demonstrate that joint-detection probabilities can be governed not only by phase shifts but also by concurrence, which arises from the angle between the motion direction of particles from the same source and the Beam Splitter (BS) axis. This approach aims to set a new standard in entanglement measurement by integrating path entanglement within a concurrence-based framework. Here, we first examine phase-retarder-modified Mach-Zehnder (MZ) configurations within single-quanton systems, subsequently extending this approach to two-quanton systems to establish a connection between spatial correlations and concurrence. Last, by analyzing joint-detection probabilities across various BS configurations, we evaluate the potential of these setups as analogs for spin/polarization measurement experiments.</description>

      <title>Shaping Exciton Polarization Dynamics in 2D Semiconductors by Tailored Ultrafast Pulses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ultrafast formation of strongly bound excitons in two-dimensional semiconductors provide a rich platform for studying fundamental physics as well as developing novel optoelectronic technologies. While extensive research has explored the excitonic coherence, many-body interactions, and nonlinear optical properties, the potential to study these phenomena by directly controlling their coherent polarization dynamics has not been fully realized. In this work, we use a sub-10fs pulse shaper to study how temporal control of coherent exciton polarization affects the generation of four-wave mixing in monolayer WSe2 under ambient conditions. By tailoring multiphoton pathway interference, we tune the nonlinear response from destructive to constructive interference, resulting in a 2.6-fold enhancement over the four-wave mixing generated by a transform-limited pulse. This demonstrates a general method for nonlinear enhancement by shaping the pulse to counteract the temporal dispersion experienced during resonant light-matter interactions. Our method allows us to excite both 1s and 2s states, showcasing a selective control over the resonant state that produces nonlinearity. By comparing our results with theory, we find that exciton-exciton interactions dominate the nonlinear response, rather than Pauli blocking. This capability to manipulate exciton polarization dynamics in atomically thin crystals lays the groundwork for exploring a wide range of resonant phenomena in condensed matter systems and opens up new possibilities for precise optical control in advanced optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Chiral Flat-Band Optical Cavity with Atomically Thin Mirrors</title>

Abstract: A fundamental requirement for photonic technologies is the ability to control the confinement and propagation of light. Widely utilized platforms include two-dimensional (2D) optical microcavities in which electromagnetic waves are confined between either metallic or distributed Bragg reflectors. Recently, transition metal dichalcogenides hosting tightly bound excitons with high optical quality have emerged as promising atomically thin mirrors. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a sub-wavelength 2D nano-cavity using two atomically thin mirrors with degenerate resonances. Angle-resolved measurements show a flat band, which sets this system apart from conventional photonic cavities. Remarkably, we demonstrate how the excitonic nature of the mirrors enables the formation of chiral and tunable optical modes upon the application of an external magnetic field. Moreover, we show the electrical tunability of the confined mode. Our work demonstrates a mechanism for confining light with high-quality excitonic materials, opening perspectives for spin-photon interfaces, and chiral cavity electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of relativistic vortex electrons in external laser fields</title>

Abstract: Investigating the interactions of vortex electrons with electromagnetic fields is crucial for advancing particle acceleration techniques, scattering theory in background fields, and developing novel electron beams for material diagnostics. In this work, we systematically study the dynamics of relativistic vortex electrons during their head-on collisions with linearly polarized (LP) and circularly polarized (CP) laser pulses, as well as their superposition. We develop a theoretical framework using Volkov-Bessel wave functions to describe the spatiotemporal characteristics of vortex electrons in these external fields. We show that the beam center of the vortex electron follows the classical trajectory of a point-charge electron while maintaining the transverse structure of both vortex eigenstates and superposition states. Specifically, CP laser pulses cause the beam center to rotate, while LP laser pulses induce a lateral shift. The combined effect of LP and CP laser pulses in a two-mode field results in a twisted spiral pattern. Our findings demonstrate the potential for versatile control of vortex electron beams using various laser modes, providing a foundation for future experimental and theoretical studies. This work serves as a benchmark reference for investigations into the manipulation of vortex electron beams using more realistic laser or other types of external fields.</description>

      <title>Observation of broadband super-absorption of electromagnetic waves through space-time symmetry breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using time as an additional design parameter in electromagnetism, photonics, and wave physics is attracting considerable research interest, motivated by the possibility to explore physical phenomena and engineering opportunities beyond the physical limits of time-invariant systems. However, despite substantial theoretical promise, the practical realization and observation of many new effects and capabilities leveraging such temporal degrees of freedom have remained elusive. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of enhanced broadband absorption of electromagnetic waves in a continuously modulated time-varying system, exceeding one of the key theoretical limits of linear time-invariant absorbers. This is achieved by harnessing the frequency-wavevector transitions and enhanced interference effects enabled by breaking both continuous space- and time-translation symmetries in a periodically time-modulated absorbing structure operating at radio-frequencies. Furthermore, we demonstrate broadband coherent wave absorption using a secondary control wave, observing a nearly perfect, reconfigurable, anti-reflection effect over a broad continuous bandwidth. Our findings provide new insights to challenge existing paradigms on the limits of wave absorption and may pave the way to the development of devices that operate in a regime fundamentally beyond the reach of any linear time-invariant system.</description>

      <title>Spintwistronics: Photonic bilayer topological lattices tuning extreme spin-orbit interactions</title>

Abstract: Twistronics, the manipulation of Moir\'e superlattices via the twisting of two layers of two-dimensional (2D) materials to control diverse and nontrivial properties, has recently revolutionized the condensed matter and materials physics. Here, we introduce the principles of twistronics to spin photonics, coining this emerging field spintwistronics. In spintwistronics, instead of 2D materials, the two layers consist of photonic topological spin lattices on a surface plasmonic polariton (SPP) platform. Each 2D SPP wave supports the construction of topological lattices formed by photonic spins with stable skyrmion topology governed by rotational symmetry. By introducing spintwistronics into plasmonics, we demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that two layers of photonic spin lattices can produce Moir\'e spin superlattices at specific magic angles. These superlattices, modulated periodically by the quantum number of total angular momentum, exhibit novel properties-including new quasiparticle topologies, multiple fractal patterns, extremely slow-light control, and more-that cannot be achieved in conventional plasmonic systems. As a result, they open up multiple degrees of freedom for practical applications in quantum information, optical data storage and chiral light-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Dark-Field X-Ray Microscopy with Structured Illumination for Three-Dimensional Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a structured illumination technique for dark-field x-ray microscopy optimized for three-dimensional imaging of ordered materials at sub-micrometer length scales. Our method utilizes a coded aperture to spatially modulate the incident x-ray beam on the sample, enabling the reconstruction of the sample's 3D structure from images captured at various aperture positions. Unlike common volumetric imaging techniques such as tomography, our approach casts a scanning x-ray silhouette of a coded aperture for depth resolution along the axis of diffraction, eliminating any need for sample rotation or rastering, leading to a highly stable imaging modality. This modification provides robustness against geometric uncertainties during data acquisition, particularly for achieving sub-micrometer resolutions where geometric uncertainties typically limit resolution. We introduce the image reconstruction model and validate our results with experimental data on an isolated twin domain within a bulk single crystal of an iron pnictide obtained using a dark-field x-ray microscope. This timely advancement aligns with the enhanced brightness upgrade of the world's synchrotron radiation facilities, opening unprecedented opportunities in imaging.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the coupling of photon spin with rotation in connection with a recent proposal of Fedderke et al. [arXiv:2406.16178 [physics.optics]] regarding a precision gyroscope based on the intrinsic spin of light. To this end, we analyze the propagation of electromagnetic radiation in a physical system that uniformly rotates about the direction of wave propagation in the presence of an ambient medium. Finally, we consider the possibility of using this type of spin-of-light gyroscope to measure gravitomagnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Bell state generation and CNOT operation using on-demand identical photons from shape-controlled spatially ordered quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fault tolerant on-chip photonic quantum computation is enormously helped by (a) deterministic generation of the needed thousands to millions of photon qubits from (b) quantum emitters in designed spatially ordered arrays to enable networks for implementing many-qubit logic circuits. Scaling up photonic quantum information processing systems has, however, been prevented by the lack of such quantum emitters until the demonstration of the platform of mesa-top single quantum dots (MTSQDs) -- controlled shape, size, and volume single QD -- located in designed regular arrays. Here we demonstrate 2 qubit CNOT gate operation -- a universal gate necessary to enable quantum circuits of arbitrary complexity -- in polarization basis using photons emitted from individual MTSQDs. A Bell state fidelity of 0.825$\pm$0.010 is achieved with two photon interference (TPI) visibility of 0.947$\pm$0.0015 at 4K without Purcell enhancement. The results make a strong case for developing MTSQD arrays for utility scale optical quantum information processing platforms.</description>
