      <title>The Junction of Immersive Analytics and Virtual Reconstructions -- A Case Study on the Mausoleum of Emperor Maxentius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Virtual Archaeology has significantly evolved over the last decades through advancements in data acquisition and representation by, e.g., improved data recording technologies and virtual reality devices. Immersive environments provide novel ways to present historical events or objects with high visual quality for both, the general public as well as researchers. Here, we examine how the emerging field of Immersive Analytics can contribute to enhancing the understanding and exploration of archaeological data and explore the junction of Virtual Archaeology and Immersive Analytics, utilising reconstructions of the mausoleum of the late Roman emperor Maxentius in Rome for argumentation. Based on our work, we advocate the value of combining historical and computer science expertise for virtual reconstructions and immersive environments to facilitate deeper understanding and interactive exploration of archaeological data.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical Decomposition of Kullback-Leibler Divergence: Disentangling Marginal Mismatches from Statistical Dependencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09029v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is a foundational measure for comparing probability distributions. Yet in multivariate settings, its single value often obscures the underlying reasons for divergence, conflating mismatches in individual variable distributions (marginals) with effects arising from statistical dependencies. We derive an algebraically exact, additive, and hierarchical decomposition of the KL divergence between a joint distribution P(X1,...,Xn) and a standard product reference distribution Q(X1,...,Xn) = product_i q(Xi), where variables are assumed independent and identically distributed according to a common reference q. The total divergence precisely splits into two primary components: (1) the summed divergence of each marginal distribution Pi(Xi) from the common reference q(Xi), quantifying marginal deviations; and (2) the total correlation (or multi-information), capturing the total statistical dependency among variables. Leveraging Mobius inversion on the subset lattice, we further decompose this total correlation term into a hierarchy of signed contributions from distinct pairwise, triplet, and higher-order statistical interactions, expressed using standard Shannon information quantities. This decomposition provides an algebraically complete and interpretable breakdown of KL divergence using established information measures, requiring no approximations or model assumptions. Numerical validation using hypergeometric sampling confirms the decomposition's exactness to machine precision across diverse system configurations.</description>

      <title>Beyond Coordinates: Meta-Equivariance in Statistical Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimal statistical decisions should transcend the language used to describe them. Yet, how do we guarantee that the choice of coordinates - the parameterisation of an optimisation problem - does not subtly dictate the solution? This paper reveals a fundamental geometric invariance principle. We first analyse the optimal combination of two asymptotically normal estimators under a strictly convex trace-AMSE risk. While methods for finding optimal weights are known, we prove that the resulting optimal estimator is invariant under direct affine reparameterisations of the weighting scheme. This exemplifies a broader principle we term meta-equivariance: the unique minimiser of any strictly convex, differentiable scalar objective over a matrix space transforms covariantly under any invertible affine reparameterisation of that space. Distinct from classical statistical equivariance tied to data symmetries, meta-equivariance arises from the immutable geometry of convex optimisation itself. It guarantees that optimality, in these settings, is not an artefact of representation but an intrinsic, coordinate-free truth.</description>

      <title>Mixed Fractional Information: Consistency of Dissipation Measures for Stable Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetric alpha-stable (S alpha S) distributions with alpha&lt;2 lack finite classical Fisher information. Building on Johnson's framework, we define Mixed Fractional Information (MFI) via the initial rate of relative entropy dissipation during interpolation between S alpha S laws with differing scales, v and s. We demonstrate two equivalent formulations for MFI in this specific S alpha S-to-S alpha S setting. The first involves the derivative D'(v) of the relative entropy between the two S alpha S densities. The second uses an integral expectation E_gv[u(x,0) (pF_v(x) - pF_s(x))] involving the difference between Fisher scores (pF_v, pF_s) and a specific MMSE-related score function u(x,0) derived from the interpolation dynamics. Our central contribution is a rigorous proof of the consistency identity: D'(v) = (1/(alpha v)) E_gv[X (pF_v(X) - pF_s(X))]. This identity mathematically validates the equivalence of the two MFI formulations for S alpha S inputs, establishing MFI's internal coherence and directly linking entropy dissipation rates to score function differences. We further establish MFI's non-negativity (zero if and only if v=s), derive its closed-form expression for the Cauchy case (alpha=1), and numerically validate the consistency identity. MFI provides a finite, coherent, and computable information-theoretic measure for comparing S alpha S distributions where classical Fisher information fails, connecting entropy dynamics to score functions and estimation concepts. This work lays a foundation for exploring potential fractional I-MMSE relations and new functional inequalities tailored to heavy-tailed systems.</description>
