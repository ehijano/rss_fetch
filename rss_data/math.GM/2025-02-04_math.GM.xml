      <title>Paradoxical behavior in Collatz sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the set of positive integers, we consider an iterated process that sends $n$ to $\frac{3n+1}{2}$ or to $\frac{n}{2}$ depending on the parity of $n$. According to a conjecture due to Collatz, all such sequences end up in the cycle $(1,2)$. In a seminal paper, Terras further conjectured that the proportion of odd terms encountered when starting from $n\geq2$ is sufficient to determine its stopping time, namely, the number of iterations needed to descend below $n$. However, when iterating beyond the stopping time, there exist "paradoxical" sequences for which the first term is unexpectedly exceeded. In the present study, we show that this topic is strongly linked to the Collatz conjecture. Moreover, this non-typical behavior seems to occur finitely many times apart from the trivial cycle, thus lending support to Terras' conjecture.</description>

      <title>Squaring the Circle Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01202</link>
      <description>arXiv:1908.01202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Squaring the circle is impossible, but it can be squared approximately. Ramanujan gave a construction correct to eight decimal places. In his book Mathographics, Dixon gave constructions correct to three decimal places. In this article, we provide a new construction correct to three decimal places and another correct to nine decimal places.</description>

      <title>A Categorical Development of Right Derived Functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10332v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Category theory is the language of homological algebra, allowing us to state broadly applicable theorems and results without needing to specify the details for every instance of analogous objects. However, authors often stray from the realm of pure abstract category theory in their development of the field, leveraging the Freyd-Mitchell embedding theorem or similar results, or otherwise using set-theoretic language to augment a general categorical discussion. This paper seeks to demonstrate that - while it is not necessary for most mathematicians' purposes - a development of homological concepts can be contrived from purely categorical notions. We begin by outlining the categories we will work within, namely Abelian categories (building off additive categories). We continue to develop cohomology groups of sequences, eventually culminating in a development of right derived functors. This paper is designed to be a minimalist construction, supplying no examples or motivation beyond what is necessary to develop the ideas presented.</description>

      <title>A Primer on Chainmails: Structures for Point-free Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In point-free topology, one abstracts the poset of open subsets of a topological space, by replacing it with a frame (a complete lattice, where meet distributes over arbitrary join). In this paper we propose a similar abstraction of the posets of connected subsets in various space-like structures. The analogue of a frame is called a chainmail, which is defined as a poset admitting joins of its mails, i.e., subsets having a lower bound. The main result of the paper is an equivalence between a subcategory of the category of complete join-semilattices and the category of chainmails.</description>

      <title>Investigation about a statement equivalent to Riemann Hypothesis (RH)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11130v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We try to approach a known equivalence to RH involving relative maxima and minima of Xi(t) on critical line by a representation of the derivative of the phase of Xi(s) with respect to imaginary coordinate that involves directly Euler product. In this attempt it is found an object conjectured to be the ``spectrum'' of prime numbers . Reasons and consequences of the conjecture are highlighted.</description>
