      <title>On the fundamental limitations of multiproposal Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study multiproposal Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms, such as Multiple-try or generalised Metropolis-Hastings schemes, which have recently received renewed attention due to their amenability to parallel computing. First, we prove that no multiproposal scheme can speed-up convergence relative to the corresponding single proposal scheme by more than a factor of $K$, where $K$ denotes the number of proposals at each iteration. This result applies to arbitrary target distributions and it implies that serial multiproposal implementations are always less efficient than single proposal ones. Secondly, we consider log-concave distributions over Euclidean spaces, proving that, in this case, the speed-up is at most logarithmic in $K$, which implies that even parallel multiproposal implementations are fundamentally limited in the computational gain they can offer. Crucially, our results apply to arbitrary multiproposal schemes and purely rely on the two-step structure of the associated kernels (i.e. first generate $K$ candidate points, then select one among those). Our theoretical findings are validated through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Robust training of implicit generative models for multivariate and heavy-tailed distributions with an invariant statistical loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional implicit generative models are capable of learning highly complex data distributions. However, their training involves distinguishing real data from synthetically generated data using adversarial discriminators, which can lead to unstable training dynamics and mode dropping issues. In this work, we build on the \textit{invariant statistical loss} (ISL) method introduced in \cite{de2024training}, and extend it to handle heavy-tailed and multivariate data distributions.
  The data generated by many real-world phenomena can only be properly characterised using heavy-tailed probability distributions, and traditional implicit methods struggle to effectively capture their asymptotic behavior. To address this problem, we introduce a generator trained with ISL, that uses input noise from a generalised Pareto distribution (GPD). We refer to this generative scheme as Pareto-ISL for conciseness. Our experiments demonstrate that Pareto-ISL accurately models the tails of the distributions while still effectively capturing their central characteristics.
  The original ISL function was conceived for 1D data sets. When the actual data is $n$-dimensional, a straightforward extension of the method was obtained by targeting the $n$ marginal distributions of the data. This approach is computationally infeasible and ineffective in high-dimensional spaces. To overcome this, we extend the 1D approach using random projections and define a new loss function suited for multivariate data, keeping problems tractable by adjusting the number of projections. We assess its performance in multidimensional generative modeling and explore its potential as a pretraining technique for generative adversarial networks (GANs) to prevent mode collapse, reporting promising results and highlighting its robustness across various hyperparameter settings.</description>

      <title>Bayesian shared parameter joint models for heterogeneous populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Joint models (JMs) for longitudinal and time-to-event data are an important class of biostatistical models in health and medical research. When the study population consists of heterogeneous subgroups, the standard JM may be inadequate and lead to misleading results. Joint latent class models (JLCMs) and their variants have been proposed to incorporate latent class structures into JMs. JLCMs are useful for identifying latent subgroup structures, obtaining a more nuanced understanding of the relationships between longitudinal outcomes, and improving prediction performance. We consider the generic form of JLCM, which poses significant computational challenges for both frequentist and Bayesian approaches due to the numerical intractability and multimodality of the associated model's likelihood or posterior. Focusing on the less explored Bayesian paradigm, we propose a new Bayesian inference framework to tackle key limitations in the existing method. Our algorithm leverages state-of-the-art Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques and parallel computing for parameter estimation and model selection. Through a simulation study, we demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of our proposed method over the existing approach. Our simulations also generate important computational insights and practical guidance for implementing such complex models. We illustrate our method using data from the PAQUID prospective cohort study, where we jointly investigate the association between a repeatedly measured cognitive score and the risk of dementia and the latent class structure defined from the longitudinal outcomes.</description>

      <title>An Iterative Algorithm for Regularized Non-negative Matrix Factorizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the non-negative matrix factorization algorithm of Lee and Seung to accept a weighted norm, and to support ridge and Lasso regularization. We recast the Lee and Seung multiplicative update as an additive update which does not get stuck on zero values. We apply the companion R package rnnmf to the problem of finding a reduced rank representation of a database of cocktails.</description>

      <title>Novel Subsampling Strategies for Heavily Censored Reliability Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational capability often falls short when confronted with massive data, posing a common challenge in establishing a statistical model or statistical inference method dealing with big data. While subsampling techniques have been extensively developed to downsize the data volume, there is a notable gap in addressing the unique challenge of handling extensive reliability data, in which a common situation is that a large proportion of data is censored. In this article, we propose an efficient subsampling method for reliability analysis in the presence of censoring data, intending to estimate the parameters of lifetime distribution. Moreover, a novel subsampling method for subsampling from severely censored data is proposed, i.e., only a tiny proportion of data is complete. The subsampling-based estimators are given, and their asymptotic properties are derived. The optimal subsampling probabilities are derived through the L-optimality criterion, which minimizes the trace of the product of the asymptotic covariance matrix and a constant matrix. Efficient algorithms are proposed to implement the proposed subsampling methods to address the challenge that optimal subsampling strategy depends on unknown parameter estimation from full data. Real-world hard drive dataset case and simulative empirical studies are employed to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Prior Knowledge Accelerate Variance Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variance is a basic metric to evaluate the degree of data dispersion, and it is also frequently used in the realm of statistics. However, due to the computing variance and the large dataset being time-consuming, there is an urge to accelerate this computing process. The paper suggests a new method to reduce the time of this computation, it assumes a scenario in which we already know the variance of the original dataset, and the whole variance of this merge dataset could be expressed in the form of addition between the original variance and a remainder term. When we want to calculate the total variance after this adds up, the method only needs to calculate the remainder to get the result instead of recalculating the total variance again, which we named this type of method as PKA(Prior Knowledge Acceleration). The paper mathematically proves the effectiveness of PKA in variance calculation, and the conditions for this method to accelerate properly.</description>

      <title>Theoretical and Practical Limits of Kolmogorov-Zurbenko Periodograms with DiRienzo-Zurbenko Algorithm Smoothing in the Spectral Analysis of Time Series Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.03031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This investigation establishes the theoretical and practical limits of the Kolmogorov-Zurbenko periodogram with DiRienzo-Zurbenko algorithm smoothing with respect to sensitivity (i.e., ability to detect weak signals), accuracy (i.e., ability to correctly identify signal frequencies), resolution (i.e., ability to separate signals with close frequencies), and robustness (i.e., sensitivity, accuracy, and resolution despite high levels of missing data). Compared to standard periodograms that utilize static smoothing with a fixed window width, Kolmogorov-Zurbenko periodograms with DiRienzo-Zurbenko algorithm smoothing utilize dynamic smoothing with a variable window width. This article begins with a summary of its statistical derivation and development followed by instructions for accessing and utilizing this approach within the R statistical program platform. Brief definitions, importance, statistical bases, theoretical and practical limits, and demonstrations are provided for its sensitivity, accuracy, resolution, and robustness. Next using a simulated time series in which two signals close in frequency are embedded in a significant level of random noise, the predictive power of this approach is compared to an autoregressive integral moving average (ARIMA), with support also garnered for its being robust even in the face of a high level of missing data. The article concludes with brief descriptions of studies across a range of scientific disciplines that have capitalized on the power of the Kolmogorov-Zurbenko periodogram with DiRienzo-Zurbenko algorithm smoothing.</description>

      <title>Estimation of uncertainties in the density driven flow in fractured porous media using MLMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18003v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the Multi Level Monte Carlo method to estimate uncertainties in a Henry-like salt water intrusion problem with a fracture. The flow is induced by the variation of the density of the fluid phase, which depends on the mass fraction of salt. We assume that the fracture has a known fixed location but an uncertain aperture. Other input uncertainties are the porosity and permeability fields and the recharge. In our setting, porosity and permeability vary spatially and recharge is time-dependent. For each realisation of these uncertain parameters, the evolution of the mass fraction and pressure fields is modelled by a system of non-linear and time-dependent PDEs with a jump of the solution at the fracture. The uncertainties propagate into the distribution of the salt concentration, which is an important characteristic of the quality of water resources. We show that the multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method is able to reduce the overall computational cost compared to classical Monte Carlo methods. This is achieved by balancing discretisation and statistical errors. Multiple scenarios are evaluated at different spatial and temporal mesh levels. The deterministic solver ug4 is run in parallel to calculate all stochastic scenarios.</description>
