      <title>Finite groups with geodetic Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A connected undirected graph is called \emph{geodetic} if for every pair of vertices there is a unique shortest path connecting them. It has been conjectured that for finite groups, the only geodetic Cayley graphs which occur are odd cycles and complete graphs. In this article we present a series of theoretical results which contribute to a computer search verifying this conjecture for all groups of size up to 1024. The conjecture is also verified theoretically for several infinite families of groups including dihedral and some families of nilpotent groups. Two key results which enable the computer search to reach as far as it does are: if the center of a group has even order, then the conjecture holds (this eliminates all 2-groups from our computer search); if a Cayley graph is geodetic then there are bounds relating the size of the group, generating set and center (which cuts down the number of generating sets which must be searched significantly).</description>

      <title>Non-Isomorphic Groups with Isomorphic Power and Commuting Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The power graph of a group $G$ is a graph with vertex set $G$, in which two vertices are adjacent if one is some power of the other. In the commuting graph, with $G$ as the vertex set, two vertices are joined by an edge if they commute in $G$. The enhanced power graph of a group $G$ is a graph with vertex set $G$ and an edge joining two vertices $x$ and $y$ if $\langle x,y\rangle$ is cyclic. In this paper, we answer a question posed by P. J. Cameron, namely, if there exist groups $G$ and $H$ such that the power graph of $G$ is isomorphic to the commuting graph of $H$. We show that the answer is yes if $G$ is the generalised quaternion group and $H$ is the dihedral group. We also show that the enhanced power graph of the dicyclic group is isomorphic to the commuting graph of the dihedral group.</description>

      <title>Regularity of the semigroup of transformations preserving a length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X_n = \{1,2,\dots,n\}$ be a finite set $(n\geq 2)$ and $T_n$ the full transformation semigroup on $X_n$. For a positive integer $l\leq n-1$, we define $$T_n(l) = \{\alpha\in T_n \colon \forall x,y\in X_n,\, |x-y| = l \;\Rightarrow\; |x\alpha - y\alpha| = l\}$$ and $$T^*_n(l) = \{\alpha\in T_n \colon \forall x,y\in X_n,\, |x-y| = l \;\Leftrightarrow\; |x\alpha - y\alpha| = l\}.$$ Then $T_n(l)$ and $T^*_n(l)$ are subsemigroups of $T_n$. In this paper, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for $T_n(l)$ to be regular. Moreover, we prove that $T^*_n(l)$ is a regular semigroup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let G be a finite group. The nilpotent/commuting/solvable conjugacy class graph is a simple graph with non-central conjugacy classes of G as its vertex set and two vertices are adjacent if and only if a member of one conjugacy class with a member of another conjugacy class generates a nilpotent/abelian/solvable (sub)group. In this paper have discussed about the forbidden subgraphs of nilpotent, commuting and solvable conjugacy class graphs of groups.</description>

      <title>Crossed product splitting of intermediate operator algebras via 2-cocycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the C*-algebra inclusions $B \subset A \rtimes_{\rm r} \Gamma$ arising from inclusions $B \subset A$ of $\Gamma$-C*-algebras. The main result shows that, when $B \subset A$ is C*-irreducible in the sense of R{\o}rdam, and is centrally $\Gamma$-free in the sense of the author, then after tensoring with the Cuntz algebra $\mathcal{O}_2$, all intermediate C*-algebras $B \subset C\subset A \rtimes_{\rm r} \Gamma$ enjoy a natural crossed product splitting \[\mathcal{O}_2\otimes C=(\mathcal{O}_2 \otimes D) \rtimes_{{\rm r}, \gamma, \mathfrak{w}} \Lambda\] for $D:= C \cap A$, some $\Lambda&lt;\Gamma$, and a subsystem $(\gamma, \mathfrak{w})$ of a unitary perturbed cocycle action $\Lambda \curvearrowright \mathcal{O}_2\otimes A$. As an application, we give a new Galois's type theorem for the Bisch--Haagerup type inclusions \[A^K \subset A\rtimes_{\rm r} \Gamma\] for actions of compact-by-discrete groups $K \rtimes \Gamma$ on simple C*-algebras.
  Due to a K-theoretical obstruction, the operation $\mathcal{O}_2\otimes -$ is necessary to obtain the clean splitting. Also, in general 2-cocycles $\mathfrak{w}$ appearing in the splitting cannot be removed even further tensoring with any unital (cocycle) action. We show them by examples, which further show that $\mathcal{O}_2$ is a minimal possible choice.
  We also establish a von Neumann algebra analogue, where $\mathcal{O}_2$ is replaced by the type I factor $\mathbb{B}(\ell^2(\mathbb{N}))$.</description>

      <title>On Fuchs' problem for finitely generated abelian groups: The small torsion case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A classical problem, raised by Fuchs in 1960, asks to classify the abelian groups which are groups of units of some rings.
  In this paper, we consider the case of finitely generated abelian groups, solving Fuchs' problem for such group with the additional assumption that the torsion subgroups are small, for a suitable notion of small related to the Pr\"ufer rank. As a concrete instance, we classify for each $n\ge2$ the realisable groups of the form $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}^r$.
  Our tools require an investigation of the adjoint group of suitable radical rings of odd prime power order appearing in the picture, giving conditions under which the additive and adjoint groups are isomorphic.
  In the last section, we also deal with some groups of order a power of $2$, proving that the groups of the form $\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{Z}/2^{u}\mathbb{Z}$ are realisable if and only if $0\le u\le 3$ or $2^u+1$ is a Fermat's prime.</description>

      <title>Definable convolution and idempotent Keisler measures III. Generic stability, generic transitivity, and revised Newelski's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study idempotent measures and the structure of the convolution semigroups of measures over definable groups. We isolate the property of generic transitivity and demonstrate that it is sufficient (and necessary) to develop stable group theory localizing on a generically stable type, including invariant stratified ranks and connected components. We establish generic transitivity of generically stable idempotent types in important new cases, including abelian groups in arbitrary theories and arbitrary groups in rosy theories, and characterize them as generics of connected type-definable subgroups. Using tools from Keisler's randomization theory, we generalize some of these results from types to generically stable Keisler measures, and classify idempotent generically stable measures in abelian groups as (unique) translation-invariant measures on type-definable fsg subgroups. This provides a partial definable counterpart to the classical work of Rudin, Cohen and Pym for locally compact topological groups. Finally, we provide an explicit construction of a minimal left ideal in the convolution semigroup of measures for an arbitrary countable NIP group, from a minimal left ideal in the corresponding semigroup on types and a canonical measure constructed on its ideal subgroup. In order to achieve it, we in particular prove the revised Ellis group conjecture of Newelski for countable NIP groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to provide a new characterization of isomorphism classes of generalized Alexander quandles in terms of the underlying groups and their automorphisms. This extends the previous result [4, Theorem 1.4]. Additionally, we compute the number of generalized Alexander quandles up to quandle isomorphism arising from groups up to order 127 and their group automorphisms.</description>

      <title>Charactarisation of distal actions of automorphisms on the space of one-parameter subgroups of Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a connected Lie group $G$ and an automorphism $T$ of $G$, we consider the action of $T$ on Sub$_G$, the compact space of closed subgroups of $G$ endowed with the Chabauty topology. We study the action of $T$ on Sub$^p_G$, the closure in Sub$_G$ of the set of closed one-parameter subgroups of $G$. We relate the distality of the $T$-action on Sub$^p_G$ with that of the $T$-action on $G$ and characterise the same in terms of compactness of the closed subgroup generated by $T$ in Aut$(G)$ when $T$ acts distally on the maximal central torus and $G$ is not a vector group. We extend these results to the action of subgroups ${\mathcal H}$ of Aut$(G)$ and equate the distal action of any closed subgroup ${\mathcal H}$ on Sub$^p_G$ with that of every element in ${\mathcal H}$. Moreover, we show that a connected Lie group $G$ acts distally on Sub$^p_G$ by conjugation if and only if $G$ is either compact or it is isomorphic to a direct product of a compact group and a vector group. Our results generalise some results proven by Shah and Yadav.</description>

Abstract: It is proven that every non-abelian right-angled Artin group has the $R_\infty$-property and bounds are given on the $R_\infty$-nilpotency index. In case the graph is transposition-free, which is true for almost all graphs, it is shown that the $R_\infty$-nilpotency index is equal to 2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the search for idempotent cellular automata (CA), we study CA that act almost as the identity unless they read a fixed pattern $p$. We show that constant and symmetrical patterns always produce idempotent CA, and we characterize the quasi-constant patterns that produce idempotent CA. Our results are valid for CA over an arbitrary group $G$. Moreover, we study the semigroup theoretic natural partial order defined on idempotent CA. If $G$ is infinite, we prove that there is an infinite independent set of idempotent CA, and if $G$ has an element of infinite order, we prove that there is an infinite increasing chain of idempotent CA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize to (certain) Artin groups some results previously known for right-angled Artin groups (RAAGs). First, we generalize a result by Droms, B. Servatius, and H. Servatius, and prove that the derived subgroup of an Artin group is free if and only if the group is coherent. Second, coherent Artin groups over non complete graphs split as free amalgamated products along free abelian subgroups, and we extend to arbitrary Artin groups admitting such a splitting a recent result by Casals-Ruiz and the first author on finitely generated normal subgroups of RAAGs. Finally, we use splittings of even Artin groups of FC-type to generalize results of Minasyan and Osin on acylindrical hyperbolicity of their subgroups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The relative Gromov seminorm is a finer invariant than stable commutator length where a relative homology class is fixed. We show a duality result between bounded cohomology and the relative Gromov seminorm, analogously to Bavard duality for scl. We give an application to computations of scl in graphs of groups. We also explain how our duality result can be given a purely algebraic interpretation via a relative version of the Hopf formula. Moreover, we show that this leads to a natural generalisation of a result of Calegari on a connection between scl and the rotation quasimorphism.</description>

      <title>Contractive representations of odometer semigroup</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a natural number $n \geq 1$, the odometer semigroup $O_n$, also known as the adding machine or the Baumslag-Solitar monoid with two generators, is a well-known object in group theory. This paper examines the odometer semigroup in relation to representations of bounded linear operators. We focus on noncommutative operators and prove that contractive representations of $O_n$ always admit to nicer representations of $O_n$. We give a complete description of representations of $O_n$ on the Fock space and relate it to the odometer lifting and subrepresentations of $O_n$. Along the way, we also classify Nica covariant representations of $O_n$.</description>
