      <title>Hyperfine-Resolved Spectroscopy of Dysprosium Monoxide (DyO) for Precision Measurements of the Nuclear Schiff Moment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform laser spectroscopy of dysprosium monoxide (DyO) to determine the hyperfine structure of the ground X8 and excited [17.1]7 states in the $^{161}$Dy and $^{163}$Dy isotopologues. These dysprosium nuclei have non-zero nuclear spin and dynamical octupole deformation, which gives them high sensitivity to time-reversal-violating new physics via the nuclear Schiff moment (NSM). The DyO molecule was recently identified as being amenable to optical cycling -- the basis for many laser cooling and quantum control techniques -- which makes it a practical candidate for NSM searches. The measurements reported here are prerequisites to implementing optical cycling, designing precision measurement protocols, and benchmarking calculations of molecular sensitivity to symmetry-violating effects. The measured hyperfine parameters are interpreted using simple molecular orbital diagrams and show excellent agreement with relativistic quantum chemical calculations.</description>

      <title>Response time of electrons to light in strong-field ionization of polar molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study tunneling ionization of HeH+ in strong elliptical laser fields numerically and analytically. The calculated photoelectron momentum distribution (PMD) show two different offset angles corresponding to ionization events occurring in the first and the second half cycles of one laser cycle. When the larger angle is greater than the angle of a model symmetric molecule with a similar ionization potential to the polar molecule, the smaller angle is smaller than the symmetric molecule. Using a developed strong-field model that consider effects of both the permanent dipole (PD) and the asymmetric Coulomb potential, we are able to quantitatively reproduce these phenomena. We show that the PD effect can increase (decrease) the response time of electrons within polar molecules to light in photoemission, thereby increasing (decreasing) the offset angle related to the first (second) half cycle of a laser cycle. The laser-dressed asymmetric Coulomb potential near the atomic nuclei also plays an important role in the sub-cycle-related response time and offset angle. This model may be useful for quantitatively studying attosecond ionization dynamics of polar molecules in strong laser fields.</description>

      <title>Second-order correlations in directed emissions in sodium atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on measurements of second-order intensity correlations $g^{(2)}(\tau)$ of infrared emission under bichromatic excitation at 589.2\,nm and 569.0\,nm of sodium atoms contained in a buffer-gas-free and uncoated 10-cm-long vapor cell. Directional emissions at $2.34\,\mu$m in the forward direction and $2.21\,\mu$m in both forward and backward directions under different experimental parameters are considered for this study. The measured values of $g^{(2)}(0)$ in all cases are found to exceed unity, while remaining significantly below the thermal light limit of 2. Cross-correlation measurements reveal that forward- and backward-propagating $2.21\,\mu$m radiations are correlated. Oscillatory features in $g^{(2)}(\tau)$ are observed over a broad range of excitation powers, and the dependence of the oscillation frequency on laser power can be attributed to AC Stark shifts, with contributions from hyperfine atomic structure in selected atomic velocity groups even in the presence of Doppler broadening. Our study establishes that the observed mid-infrared emission arises from a phase-matched, continuous-wave cooperative process that combines features of lasing and collective amplified spontaneous emission. The results highlight the buildup of long-range dipole coherence and velocity-selective coupling of atomic groups, which together govern the observed photon correlations and forward-backward emission symmetry. The demonstrated backward emission is of particular interest for applications in laser guidestar generation and mesospheric remote sensing, where understanding the statistical properties of the emitted light is essential for optimizing sodium-based light sources.</description>

      <title>Prospects for a Solid-State Nuclear Clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental breakthroughs toward a realization of a solid-state Thorium-229 nuclear clock, we review the technology, basic physics motivation, and limitations of the present generation of atomic clocks. We then discuss prospects for a new generation of clocks based on an anomalous low-energy 8.4 eV nuclear transition in Th-229, with an extremely long lifetime of 641 seconds when doped into CaF crystals. To realize such solid-state nuclear clocks one must confront basic nuclear, AMO, and solid state physics questions. Key challenges are understanding and minimizing the effects of inhomogeneous broadening, associated with strains and electric field gradients due to both the Th dopants and intrinsic crystal defects.</description>

      <title>K-shell ionization and characteristic x-ray radiation by high-energy electrons and positrons in oriented silicon crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: K-shell ionization and characteristic x-ray radiation (CXR) by high-energy electrons and positrons in oriented silicon crystals are studied using computer simulation. A method for this simulation has been developed and is described in detail. The evolution of the angular distribution of CXR from the upstream surface of the crystal with changes in the angle between the incident particle momentum and the crystal &lt;100&gt; axis or (100) plane, as well as with changes in particle energy over a wide range (1-1000 GeV), is investigated. It is shown that in most cases this evolution is non-monotonic. The physical mechanisms underlying this behavior are discussed. In particular, the impact of the dechanneling process on CXR produced by electrons is analyzed.</description>

      <title>Optical investigation of ultra-slow spin relaxation in $^{171}$Yb$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$ single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of spin relaxation dynamics at cryogenic temperatures in a rare-earth-doped crystal used for quantum memory applications: $^{171}$Yb:Y$_2$SiO$_5$. Spin relaxation is indeed a major limiting factor for both the efficiency and storage time of quantum memory protocols based on atomic frequency combs in rare-earth materials. The relaxation dynamics among the four ground-state hyperfine levels were simultaneously investigated by optically perturbing the spin population distribution and monitoring its return to thermal equilibrium through optical absorption spectroscopy. By applying different types of perturbations, we were also able to distinguish between two types of relaxation processes, induced by spin-phonon and spin-spin interactions.
  Below 1 K, we observed that the re-thermalization of the Yb$^{3+}$ ion population takes several hours, driven solely by direct phonon absorption or emission. However, the effective lifetime of individual spin states is much shorter - on the order of several seconds in low-doped (2 ppm) samples and of milliseconds in 10 ppm samples - due to spin-spin interactions. These findings provide valuable guidelines for optimizing doping levels and operating temperatures in rare-earth-doped crystals for quantum applications. Notably, they suggest that atomic frequency combs with lifetimes of several hours could be realized using $^{171}$Yb:Y$_2$SiO$_5$ crystals with slightly less than 2 ppm doping and operating near 1 K.</description>

      <title>Lellouch-L\"uscher relation for ultracold few-atom systems under confinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive an analog of the Lellouch-L\"uscher (LL) relation for few-body bosonic systems, linking few-body scattering loss rates to the energies and widths of the corresponding harmonically trapped few-body states. Three-body numerical simulations show that the LL relation applies across a broad range of interaction strengths and energies and allows the determination of scattering rates within a single partial wave. Our work establishes a robust theoretical framework for understanding the role of the finite volume effect in few-body observables in optical lattice and tweezer experiments, enabling precise determination of multi-body scattering rates.</description>

      <title>Transitional Bell Correlation from Dirac Wavepackets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a closed-form expression for the Bell--CHSH correlation of entangled, counter-propagating electrons using realistic Dirac wavepackets and localized detection. In contrast to the conventional distance-independent result, the Bell parameter evolves continuously from the quantum bound $2\sqrt{2}$ to the classical limit $2$ as the spatial overlap of the two waves decreases. The quantum enhancement arises entirely from transverse overlap, showing that the Bell violation reflects the local overlap of propagating Dirac waves rather than any action at a distance.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative 2D spatial measurements of electric fields within a plasma sheath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an all-optical quantum-enhanced diagnostic for electric fields in low-temperature plasmas. Trace amounts of rubidium vapor, added to argon plasma, allow us to produce spectrally narrow electric field-sensitive optical resonances via quantum optical effect of Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency, and to non-invasively measure electric field in plasma with sensitivity exceeding 1 V/cm. By collecting fluorescence from the illuminated region of interest, we reconstruct a 2D spatial profile of the electric field magnitude with $30~\mu$m resolution. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, we measured the changes in electric field within the plasma sheath surrounding a biased Langmuir probe tip. This method holds significant potential for studying sheath structures in low-temperature plasmas.</description>

      <title>Generation of Bright and Controllable Isolated Attosecond X-Ray Pulses from Synchronized Mid-Infrared and Ultra-short Ultraviolet Laser Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate, by solving the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation in the single-active-electron approximation in helium, a two-color scheme for tabletop high-order harmonic generation (HHG) that combines a mid-infrared (MIR) driving field with an ultrashort ultraviolet (UV) pulse that could be generated via resonant dispersive wave emission in gas-filled hollow-core fibers. This configuration enables the generation of bright, isolated, and tunable attosecond X-ray pulses. In contrast to single-color driving schemes, which suffer from low conversion efficiency, unfavorable wavelength scaling, and limited spectral control, the MIR+UV approach provides a practical and controllable route for advancing tabletop ultrafast spectroscopy and real-time molecular imaging within current experimental capabilities.</description>

      <title>Small clusters of He atoms in finite-cutoff EFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small clusters of $^4$He atoms provide a paradigmatic setting for exploring universal phenomena in few-body quantum systems with large scattering length. Their weakly bound states serve as ideal test cases for studying Efimov physics and the emergence of universality beyond the three-body sector. In this work, we investigate few-$^4$He systems within a finite-cutoff effective field theory (EFT) framework. The EFT interactions are calibrated to reproduce low-energy observables obtained from the realistic LM2M2 potential, enabling a direct and systematic comparison between the two approaches. We demonstrate that, for suitably chosen finite cutoffs, the empirical effective range is accurately reproduced already at leading order, achieving next-to-leading-order precision without explicit higher-order corrections. Using these interactions, we solve the Schr\"odinger equation for systems of a few atoms, obtaining binding energies and scattering observables in excellent agreement with results derived from realistic interatomic potentials. In particular, we compute atom--tetramer scattering parameters and binding energies of clusters up to eight atoms, thereby extending the EFT description to larger helium systems. Our findings establish a quantitative bridge between realistic helium potentials and finite-cutoff EFT, showing that the latter provides an efficient and predictive framework for describing few-body universality in weakly bound quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic signatures of emergent elementary excitations in a kinetically constrained long-range interacting two-dimensional spin system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice spin models featuring kinetic constraints constitute a paradigmatic setting for the investigation of glassiness and localization phenomena. The intricate dynamical behavior of these systems is a result of the dramatically reduced connectivity between many-body configurations. This truncation of transition pathways often leads to a fragmentation of the Hilbert space, yielding highly collective and therefore often slow dynamics. Moreover, this mechanism supports the formation of characteristic elementary excitations, which we investigate here theoretically in a two-dimensional Rydberg lattice gas. We explore their properties as a function of interaction strength and range, and illustrate how they can be experimentally probed via sideband spectroscopy. Here, we show that the transition rate to certain delocalized superposition states of elementary excitations displays collective many-body enhancement.</description>

      <title>Temporal dynamics in the Bragg reflection of light by cold atoms: flash effect and superradiant decay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the temporal dynamics of light interacting with a one-dimensional lattice of cold atoms. In such a system, a photonic band gap opens up, yielding an efficient Bragg reflection for an incident field incoming with the right angle and detuning. Here, we report two new effects appearing in the Bragg reflection. First, for some detunings, there is a ``flash'', i.e., a transient increase of the reflected intensity when the incident field is switched off. Second, the subsequent extinction of the reflected field is clearly superradiant, with decay rates up to height times the natural decay rate of the atomic excited state. Numerical simulations are in qualitative agreement with the observations, which can be explained by a classical photonic model. Our results are a step towards exploiting this photonic band gap in atomic systems for quantum-optical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The leading-order two-loop vacuum-polarization potential, linear in the Coulomb field of a nucleus, was first derived in the seminal 1955 work of K\"all\'en-Sabry. The higher-order two-loop vacuum-polarization corrections, however, have remained unknown until now. In this work, we compute Coulomb corrections to the K\"all\'en-Sabry potential, specifically those involving three, five, and seven Coulomb interactions inside the vacuum-polarization loop. The potentials are evaluated in momentum space and subsequently used to calculate one-electron energy shifts. Our results drastically reduce the theoretical uncertainty of the two-loop vacuum-polarization contribution to transition energies, which is required for next-generation tests of bound-state QED in heavy one and few-electron ions as well as for the determination of nuclear charge radii.</description>

      <title>Optical field characterization at the fundamental limit of spatial resolution with a trapped ion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical systems capable of generating fields with sub-wavelength spatial features have become standard in science and engineering research and industry. Pertinent examples include atom- and ion-based quantum computers and optical lithography setups. So far, no tools exist to characterize such fields - both intensity and polarization - at sub-wavelength length scales. We use a single trapped atomic ion, confined to approximately 40 nm X 40 nm X 180 nm to sense a laser light field at a wavelength of 370 nm. With its spatial extent smaller than the absorption cross-section of a resonant detector, the ion-sensor operates at the fundamental limit of spatial resolution. Our technique relies on developing an analytical model of the ion-light interaction and using the model to extract the intensity and polarization. An important insight provided in this work is also that the inverse of this model can be learned, in a restricted sense, on a deep neural network, speeding up the intensity and polarization readout by five orders of magnitude. This speed-up makes the technique field-deployable to characterize optical instruments by probing light at the sub-wavelength scale.</description>

      <title>Probing critical phenomena in open quantum systems using atom arrays</title>

Abstract: At continuous phase transitions, quantum many-body systems exhibit scale-invariance and complex, emergent universal behavior. Most strikingly, at a quantum critical point, correlations decay as a power law, with exponents determined by a set of universal scaling dimensions. Experimentally probing such power-law correlations is extremely challenging, owing to the complex interplay between decoherence, the vanishing energy gap, and boundary effects. Here, we employ a Rydberg quantum simulator to adiabatically prepare critical ground states of both a one-dimensional ring and a two-dimensional square lattice. By accounting for and tuning the openness of our quantum system, which is well-captured by the introduction of a single phenomenological length scale, we are able to directly observe power-law correlations and extract the corresponding scaling dimensions. Moreover, in two dimensions, we observe a decoupling between phase transitions in the bulk and on the boundary, allowing us to identify two distinct boundary universality classes. Our work demonstrates that direct adiabatic preparation of critical states in quantum simulators can complement recent approaches to studying quantum criticality using the Kibble-Zurek mechanism or digital quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Observation of Rayleigh optical activity for chiral molecules: a new chiroptical tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By measuring a small circularly polarized component in the scattered light, we report the first observation of Rayleigh optical activity (RayOA) for isotropic samples of chiral molecules, namely the two enantiomers of $\alpha$-pinene in neat liquid form. Our work validates fundamental theoretical predictions made over fifty years ago and expands the chiroptical toolkit.</description>
