      <title>The $K\to\pi\gamma^*\gamma^*$ transitions at leading order and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition amplitude of a kaon to a pion and two off-shell photons is studied. First, it is computed at leading order (one-loop level) of the Chiral Perturbation Theory expansion. Explicit analytical results for the leading-order amplitude are presented, constituting the first complete calculation for the doubly off-shell case. Subsequently, it is reevaluated by employing a refined diagrammatic notation and a generic ansatz incorporating effects beyond leading order. The dependence on the underlying $K\pi PP$ vertex parameters is analyzed. This offers valuable insights into amplitude properties and allows inclusion of unitarity corrections from $K\to3\pi$, yielding the complete $K\to\pi\gamma^*\gamma^*$ amplitude structure. Both the charged and neutral channels are treated in parallel. The presented results provide crucial input for phenomenological studies of related rare decays like $K\to\pi\ell^+\ell^-[\gamma]$ or $K\to\pi\ell_1^+\ell_1^-\ell_2^+\ell_2^-$ and support ongoing precision measurements at experiments like NA62 at CERN. These results may also find application in other related processes, including $\eta^{(\prime)}$ decays.</description>

      <title>A novel phenomenological approach to total charm cross-section measurements at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel, data-driven method for determining total charm cross sections in proton-proton collisions by extrapolating measured fiducial cross sections without assuming any particular fragmentation model. In this way, the method accounts for the recently observed charm fragmentation non-universality at the LHC through a data-driven extrapolation function called ddFONLL. Applied to $D^0$ production at 5 and 13 TeV, this approach yields total charm cross sections that fully incorporate fragmentation non-universality. The results, which differ significantly from previous universality-based estimates, are consistent with NNLO QCD predictions and enable direct comparisons free from fragmentation assumptions. We use this to evaluate the sensitivity of total cross-section measurements to parton distribution functions and the charm-quark mass. An outlook is given on the potential of further expanding the use of the ddFONLL method.</description>

      <title>Study on Pentaqaurks by Solving Schrodinger Equation in the Non-Hermitian Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of the charmed baryon and the anticharmed meson is assumed to be realized by exchanging a scalar meson of $f_0(500)$, and then these systems are studied by solving the Schrodinger equation, respectively. When the pentaquarks $P_{c\bar{c}}(4312)^{+}$, $P_{c\bar{c}}(4457)^{+}$, $P_{c\bar{c}s}(4338)^0$, and $P_{c\bar{c}s}(4459)^{0}$ are treated as $\Sigma_c \bar{D}$, $\Sigma_c \bar{D}^*$, $\Xi_c \bar{D}$ and $\Xi_c \bar{D}^*$ bound states, four resonance states of them are obtained as solutions of the Schrodinger equation under the outgoing wave condition, respectively. The resonance state of $\Sigma_c \bar{D}$ might correspond to the particle $P_{c\bar{c}}(4440)^{+}$, while the other three resonance states have no counterparts in the review of the Particle Data Group(PDG). Although the binding energy of the bound state is only several MeVs, all these resonance states are more than 100 MeV higher than their corresponding thresholds, respectively. The calculation results indicate that the spectrums of the strange and non-strange pentaquarks are symmetric to each other.</description>

      <title>A unified origin for dark energy and resonant dark matter from strongly-coupled gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a single strongly coupled gauge theory naturally gives rise to a unified description of the dark sector, simultaneously addressing the origin of dark energy at the meV scale and self-interacting dark matter at the TeV scale. Building on the density-responsive scalar field framework that resolves cosmological singularities and generates dark energy without fine-tuning, we show that the same underlying SU(3) gauge theory with $N_f = 10$ flavors predicts complete dark matter phenomenology. The theory generates not only the required anomalous dimension $\gamma \approx 0.50\pm0.05$ for the dark-energy mechanism, but also produces a composite particle spectrum featuring a TeV-scale dark matter candidate ($m_\chi \approx 600$~GeV) and a heavier scalar meson. Remarkably, the mass ratio $m_{\Phi_h}/m_\chi \approx 2$ naturally emerges from the dynamics of confinement, without any fine-tuning. This resonance condition, which initially appears as a coincidence, is revealed to be a robust prediction of the gauge dynamics, completely resolving the long-standing tension between achieving the correct relic abundance and solving small-scale structure problems through self-interactions. The framework makes sharp, testable predictions: a narrow scalar resonance at $\sim 1.2$~TeV accessible at HL-LHC, dark matter self-interactions of $\sigma_T/m \sim 1$~cm$^2$/g at dwarf galaxy velocities, and a stochastic gravitational wave background from the confinement phase transition. By deriving both dark energy and dark matter from a single microscopic theory, our work demonstrates how 95\% of the universe's energy content can emerge from one underlying strongly-coupled gauge theory, providing a complete and predictive framework for dark sector physics across 15 orders of magnitude in energy.</description>

      <title>EFT approach to the endpoint of muon decay-in-orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As upcoming experiments aim to probe muon conversion with unprecedented precision, equally precise theoretical predictions are crucial to maximize discovery potential. This applies not only to the new physics signal, muon-electron conversion, but also to its only irreducible background, muon decay-in-orbit (DIO) near the endpoint. Accurate computation of higher-order corrections in bound states is a long-standing challenge due to the difficulty of systematically organizing contributions. In previous work, we developed an Effective Field Theory framework to address this issue and applied it to muon conversion. Here, we extend this approach to the DIO endpoint, a more complex problem due to the presence of a neutrino-antineutrino pair in the final state. We present the most precise prediction to date of the background spectrum relevant for future muon conversion searches, achieving next-to-leading logarithmic prime accuracy for QED corrections.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the strong vertices $\Lambda_cD^{(*)}N^*(1535)$ and $\Lambda_bB^{(*)}N^*(1535)$ in QCD sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we firstly analyze the mass and pole residue of negative parity nucleon $N^*(1535)$ within the two-point QCD sum rules. Basing on these results, we continuously study the strong coupling constants of vertices $\Lambda_cDN^*$, $\Lambda_cD^*N^*$, $\Lambda_bBN^*$ and $\Lambda_bB^*N^*$ in the framework of three-point QCD sum rules. At hadron side, all possible couplings of interpolating current to hadronic states are considered. At QCD side, the contributions of vacuum condensate terms $\langle\bar{q}q\rangle$, $\langle g_s^2GG\rangle$, $\langle\bar{q} g_s\sigma Gq\rangle$, $\langle\bar{q}q\rangle^2$ and $g_s^2\langle\bar{q}q\rangle^2$ are also considered. By setting the four momentum of $D^{(*)}[B^{(*)}]$ mesons off-shell, the strong coupling constants in deep space-like regions ($Q^2=-q^2\gg\Lambda_{QCD}^2$) are obtained. Then, the momentum dependent coupling constants in space-like regions are fitted into analytical function $G(Q^2)$ and are extrapolated into time-like regions ($Q^2&lt;0$). Finally, the on-shell values of strong coupling constants are obtained by taking $Q^{2}=-m_{D^{(*)}[B^{(*)}]}^2$. The results are $G_{\Lambda_cDN^*}(Q^2=-m_D^2)=4.06^{+0.96}_{-0.75}$, $f_{\Lambda_cD^*N^*}(Q^2=-m_{D^*}^2)=3.73^{+0.68}_{-0.16}$, $g_{\Lambda_cD^*N^*}(Q^2=-m_{D^*}^2)=9.22^{+3.16}_{-0.36}$, $G_{\Lambda_bBN^*}(Q^2=-m_B^2)=9.11^{+1.54}_{-1.61}$, $f_{\Lambda_bB^*N^*}(Q^2=-m_{B^*}^2)=8.55^{+2.69}_{-2.21}$ and $g_{\Lambda_bB^*N^*}(Q^2=-m_{B^*}^2)=-0.25^{+0.16}_{-0.01}$.</description>

      <title>Baryogenesis through leptogenesis in the minimal flipped $SU(5)$ with radiative seesaw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The minimal flipped $SU(5)$ unification with the right-handed neutrino Majorana mass scale generated as a two-loop effect is arguably one of the most constrained models of perturbative baryon and lepton number violation currently on the market. This is namely due to its very simple scalar sector structure which, subject to perturbativity and non-tachyonicity bounds, leads to the emergence of characteristic flavour patterns providing interesting insights into proton decay phenomenology, neutrino physics etc.
  In this contribution, we discuss the potential impact of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe as an additional requirement imposed onto the already strongly constrained flavour structure of the model, focusing on thermal leptogenesis as its hypothetical primary source in this framework. Remarkably, this single extra condition leads, among other things, to a very interesting upper limit on the absolute neutrino mass scale which, in turn, renders the model potentially testable in the existing beta-decay experiments such as KATRIN.</description>

      <title>Thermal leptogenesis in minimal unified models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the status of thermal leptogenesis in the minimal $SU(5)\times U(1)$ and $SO(10)$ unified models under the assumption that the leptonic asymmetry generated in the out-of-equilibrium decays of heavy Majorana neutrinos (and its subsequent conversion into baryons via sphalerons) constitutes the primary source of baryon asymmetry of the Universe. In both cases, leptogenesis is shown to provide a strong extra constraint on the flavour structure of the model under consideration, leading to interesting and potentially testable phenomenological effects.</description>

      <title>Conversion of photons to dileptons in the Kroll-Wada and parton shower approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of dileptons in high-energy heavy-ion collisions provides critical insights into the properties of the quark-gluon plasma and the thermal radiation emitted throughout its evolution. In the low-mass region, dileptons originate from both direct photon conversion and hadronic decays, with the Kroll-Wada equation traditionally used to relate direct real and direct virtual photon production. In this work, we explore the possibility of using parton shower event generators to model this conversion process, leveraging their unitary treatment of internal photon conversions that naturally preserves normalisation, as well as their ability to incorporate higher-order corrections, recoil kinematics, and realistic experimental selection criteria. We compare the Kroll-Wada approach to simulations using the Pythia8 simple shower, the Vincia sector shower, and the POWHEG+PYTHIA NLO event generator. Our results reveal that parton shower approaches offer improved accuracy in describing the dilepton spectrum, particularly towards larger invariant masses where phase-space suppression effects become relevant.</description>

      <title>One-loop analysis of dark matter constraints in a complex scalar extension of the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the complex singlet extension of the Standard Model, which provides a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone dark matter candidate. In addition to the latest and most stringent bounds from dark matter direct detection experiment, we impose the observed DM relic abundance and a novel condition that the imaginary component of the singlet field does not develop a vacuum expectation value, ensuring its stability as dark matter. We perform a full one-loop analysis of the effective potential, including counterterm contributions, and examine their impact on the allowed parameter space. Our results reveal that viable regions still exist, some of which appear only when counterterms are properly included, highlighting the importance of quantum corrections and the vacuum structure in precision dark matter studies.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric Hybrid Inflation with K\"{a}hler-Induced $\mathbf{R}$-Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the role of explicit nonrenormalizable $R$-symmetry breaking interactions in the context of supersymmetric hybrid inflation. In particular, we focus on scenarios where such breaking arises predominantly from the K\"{a}hler potential, while the renormalizable terms in both the superpotential and K\"{a}hler potential preserve $R$-symmetry. Incorporating radiative corrections, soft SUSY-breaking contributions, and supergravity effects, we construct a consistent and predictive inflationary framework. Notably, the presence of $R$-symmetry violating terms at the nonrenormalizable level helps resolve the common issue of light waterfall fields in grand unified theories, rendering them sufficiently heavy without disturbing gauge coupling unification. Our numerical analysis demonstrates that these $R$-symmetry breaking contributions play a crucial role in bringing the scalar spectral index $n_s$ into excellent agreement with the recent cosmological observations, particularly the Data Release 6 of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. The tensor-to-scalar ratio remains suppressed, with $r &lt; 10^{-5}$, below the reach of current and near-future experiments. However, observable gravitational waves with $r \lesssim 0.01$ can be achieved by allowing moderate deviations in the parameter space associated with a non-minimal K\"{a}hler potential.</description>

      <title>Type II Seesaw Leptogenesis in a Majoron background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss spontaneous Leptogenesis in the Type II Seesaw model of neutrino masses featuring an electroweak triplet scalar $T$ in a coherent pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) background. In the "wash-in" scenario the inverse decays of Higgs bosons to $T$ generate a chemical potential for the triplet that is then transmitted to the lepton sector via the leptonic decays of $T$. Our mechanism works with a single triplet that can be as light as 1 TeV, and has a vacuum expectation value $v_T$ in the window $\mathcal{O}(1~\text{keV})&lt;v_T&lt;\mathcal{O}(1~\text{MeV})$. This range of $v_T$ can lead to appreciable decays of the triplet's doubly charged component into both same sign di-leptons and same sign pairs of $W$-bosons, which could potentially allow for an experimental distinction from a recently proposed inflationary Type II Seesaw Affleck-Dine scenario preferring the leptonic mode. In the "singlet-doublet-triplet Majoron" UV-completion of the Type II Seesaw model, the required pNGB is automatically included in the form of the Majoron, that originates from the phase of the lepton number breaking singlet scalar. The coherent motion of the Majoron can furthermore explain the dark matter relic abundance via the kinetic misalignment mechanism. Cogenesis of dark matter and the baryon asymmetry can work for a lepton number breaking scale of $\mathcal{O}(10^5\;\text{GeV})&lt;v_\sigma&lt; \mathcal{O}(10^8~\text{GeV})$ and a Majoron mass of $\mathcal{O}(1~\text{eV}) &gt; m_j &gt;\mathcal{O}(1~\mu\text{eV})$.</description>

      <title>Modular Flavor Symmetries and Fermion Mass Hierarchies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate fermion mass hierarchies in models with modular flavor symmetries. Several key conclusions arise from the observation that the determinants of mass matrices transform as 1-dimensional vector-valued modular forms. We demonstrate that, under some fairly general assumptions, achieving hierarchical fermion masses requires the vacuum expectation value of the modulus $\tau$ to be located near one of the critical points, $i$, $i\infty$, or $\omega$. We also revisit the universal near-critical behavior around these points and classify the resulting mass hierarchies for the critical points $i$ and $\omega$. We compare the traditional Froggatt--Nielsen mechanism with its modular variant. The knowledge and boundedness of Fourier and Taylor coefficients are crucial to the predictive power of modular flavor symmetries.</description>

      <title>Probing the ATOMKI X17 vector boson using Dalitz decays $V\to Pe^+e^-$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent anomalies observed in $e^+e^-$ nuclear transitions of $^8 \textrm{Be}$, $^4 \textrm{He}$, and $^{12} \textrm{C}$ by the ATOMKI collaboration may hint at the existence of a vector boson with a mass around 17 MeV, referred to as X17. If it exists, this boson would also affect similar processes in particle physics, including the Dalitz decays of vector mesons. Recently, the BESIII collaboration measured the Dalitz decay $D^{*0}\to D^0e^+e^-$ for the first time and reported a $3.5\sigma$ excess over the theoretical prediction based on the vector meson dominance (VMD) model. This excess may be another signal of the X17. In this study, we investigate the possible effects of the X17 on the Dalitz decays $D^*_{(s)}\to D_{(s)}e^+e^-$, $B^*_{(s)}\to B_{(s)}e^+e^-$, and $J/\psi\to \eta_ce^+e^-$. The required hadronic form factors are calculated within the framework of our covariant confined quark model, without relying on heavy quark effective theory or the VMD model. We present predictions for the Dalitz decay widths and the ratios $R_{ee}(V)\equiv \Gamma(V\to Pe^+e^-)/\Gamma(V\to P\gamma)$ within the Standard Model and in several new physics scenarios involving modifications due to the X17. Our results are compared with other theoretical calculations.</description>

      <title>Flavour and precision probes of a class of scotogenic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the phenomenological impact of a well-motivated class of scotogenic models regarding flavour and electroweak precision observables. In particular, and for the case of a ``T1-2-A'' variant, we carry out a full computation of the next-to-leading order corrections to leptonic Higgs and $Z$-boson decays. In view of the evolution in the tension between theory and observation regarding the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, we revisit previously drawn conclusions on operator dominance and constraints on the parameter space. Finally, we consider the role of $H \to \mu\mu$ decays (and other flavour conserving Higgs decays) in probing this class of models at future colliders.</description>

      <title>Neutrino masses, matter-antimatter asymmetry, dark matter, and supermassive black hole formation explained with Majorons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spontaneous breaking of a global lepton number symmetry can result in a (pseudo) Nambu-Goldstone boson known as the Majoron. We study a singlet Majoron model that couples to two Higgs doublets in which the lepton number current develops an electromagnetic anomaly, allowing the decay of Majorons into photons. We focus on Majorons at the eV scale with an enhanced anomaly and show that it serves as a dark matter candidate whose decay signals can be probed by space telescope observations. Furthermore, if the decay produces Lyman-Werner photons, heavy black hole seeds can be generated via the direct collapse mechanism and evolve into the active galactic nuclei we observe at high redshifts. Our framework thus simultaneously addresses the origin of neutrino masses, the baryon asymmetry of the Universe, the nature of dark matter, and the formation of high redshift supermassive black holes.</description>

      <title>A strange contribution to the neutron EDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the contribution of hypothetical quark electric dipoles to the electric dipole moment (EDM) of the neutron. Particular emphasis is devoted to the strange quark contribution. Considerations based on perturbative QCD, the large N expansion, a critic reassessment of the non-relativistic quark model as well as a next to leading order calculation in heavy baryon effective field theory, all consistently indicate that, barring accidental cancellations, the matrix element of the strange quark dipole should be of order a tenth of those of the valence quarks. This implies that the strange EDM provides the dominant contribution to the neutron EDM in many scenarios beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Running scalar spectral index in warm natural inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The validity of inflation models is mainly evaluated according to the consistency of the predicted scalar spectral index $n_{\mathrm{s}}$, the tensor scalar ratio $r$, and the running scalar spectral index $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ with cosmic microwave background observations. In warm inflation (WI) scenarios, one can find exact analytical solutions for $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ in principle, but long expressions may be obtained. Previous studies for WI scenarios have only shown approximate analytical solutions or numerical results for $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$. In this study, we present a general analytical expression of $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ without approximation in WI. The obtained analytical expression of $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ is used in the study of warm natural inflation (WNI). Although $n_{\mathrm{s}}$ and $r$ have been previously investigated, $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ is omitted in previous studies on WNI. Our study of $\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ completes previous phenomenological studies on WNI. In particular, the lower limit of the symmetry-breaking scale in WNI becomes more concrete in this study.</description>

      <title>Probing the structure of exotic hadrons through correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past 20 years, many new hadron states have been discovered, but understanding their nature remains a key experimental and theoretical challenge. Recent studies have established that hadron-hadron interactions primarily govern the generation of new hadronic states, with their spectroscopy serving as a powerful tool for probing these interactions and determining the corresponding compositeness. In this work, we study four scenarios to determine the $DK$ interaction by reproducing the mass of the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$, i.e., assuming the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ as a $DK$ molecule, a mixture of a $DK$ molecule and a bare state, a $DK-D_s\eta$ molecule, and a mixture of a $DK-D_s\eta$ molecule and a bare state. Using the $D^{0}K^{+}$ interactions derived from these scenarios, we predict the $D^{0}K^{+}$ correlation functions. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of a bare state significantly alters the lineshape of the $D^{0}K^{+}$ correlation functions. These variations provide key physical observables to probe the internal structure of the $D_{s0}^*(2317)$. Using the shallow bound state candidate $X(3872)$ as input, we study the impact of including a bare state on the lineshape of the $D^0\bar{D}^{*0}$ correlation functions, revealing more pronounced variations. Our analysis provides critical insights into the internal structure of exotic hadronic states via momentum correlation measurements.</description>

      <title>Search for pseudoscalar Higgs boson $A_0$ of the Bestest Little Higgs model at the LHC and FCC-hh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the sensitivity of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the Future Circular Collider-hadron-hadron (FCC-hh) to the existence of pseudoscalar Higgs boson $A_0$ predicted by the Bestest Little Higgs model. We study the tree-level (two and three body) and one-loop decays of the pseudoscalar, $A_0 \to b\bar b, t \bar t, \gamma t\bar t, \gamma b \bar b, Zt\bar t, Zb \bar b, Wt\bar b, h_0 t \bar t, h_0 b \bar b$, and $A_0 \to \gamma\gamma, \gamma Z, ZZ, gg, WW$, respectively. In addition, we perform a phenomenological study of the production of the pseudoscalar $A_0$ via gluon fusion $gg \to A_0 \to Y$ processes, where $Y \equiv \gamma\gamma, \gamma Z, ZZ, gg, WW$. From the cross section of the processes of interest and the expected integrated luminosity of the LHC and FCC-hh, we determined the number of events that could be produced in both colliders.</description>

      <title>Double-strangeness hidden-charm pentaquarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the possible existence of double-strangeness hidden-charm pentaquark states, denoted as $P_{c\bar{c}ss}$, within an off-shell coupled-channel formalism. Eleven meson-baryon channels with total strangeness $S = -2$ are constructed by combining charmed mesons and singly charmed baryons. The two-body scattering amplitudes are derived from an effective Lagrangian that respects heavy-quark spin symmetry, hidden local symmetry, and flavor SU(3) symmetry. The Bethe-Salpeter equation is solved using the Blankenbecler-Sugar reduction scheme, and resonances are identified as poles in the scattering amplitudes on the complex energy plane. We find five negative-parity $P_{c\bar{c}ss}$ states with spins $J = 1/2$, $3/2$, and $5/2$, all located below their relevant thresholds. Three positive-parity states are also found: two with $J = 1/2$ and one with $J = 3/2$, lying above the thresholds with substantial widths. The coupling strengths of each resonance to relevant meson-baryon channels are extracted. The sensitivity of the results to the cutoff parameter $\Lambda_0 = \Lambda - m$ is examined. These results provide theoretical predictions that may assist future experimental searches for $P_{c\bar{c}ss}$ states in the $J/\psi\,\Xi$ channel.</description>

      <title>Singly heavy Omega Baryon ($\Omega_c^0$ \&amp; $\Omega_b^-$) Spectroscopy in the Relativistic Framework of Independent Quark Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Independent Quark Model, formulated for a three-body system within a relativistic framework, is applied to singly heavy baryons \( \Omega_c^0 \) and \( \Omega_b^- \) to investigate their spectroscopic properties. A Martin-like potential with an equal mixture of scalar and vector components is employed, with potential parameters fitted using ground-state experimental data. The resulting mass spectra include both radial and orbital excitations. The spin-parity for the recently observed states \( \Omega_c^0(3000) \), \( \Omega_c^0(3050) \), \( \Omega_c^0(3067) \), \( \Omega_c^0(3120) \), and \( \Omega_c^0(3185) \) as well as possible spin assignments for the four newly observed excited states of \( \Omega_b^- \) (\(\Omega_b^-(6316)\), \(\Omega_b^-(6330)\), \(\Omega_b^-(6340)\), and \(\Omega_b^-(6350)\)) are proposed. The magnetic moments of the ground and first excited states are also calculated, along with radiative decay widths and transition magnetic moments. The non-leptonic weak decays of \( \Omega_c^0 \) are analyzed, with decay widths and branching ratios computed and compared with experimental data to validate the predictive power of the model. The branching ratios for the non-leptonic decays of $\Omega_b^-$ are also predicted for future observations.</description>

      <title>Collective phenomena in chirally imbalanced medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the gluon polarization tensor for a chirally imbalanced plasma using hard thermal loop approximation in the real time formulation of thermal field theory. The dispersion relations obtained from the poles of the effective gluon propagator are solved numerically as well as analytically in appropriate limiting cases. It is seen that the degenerate transverse modes split into left and right handed circularly polarized modes. We also compute imaginary poles of the propagator which signal the presence of instability in the plasma. Relevant time scales for development of such instabilities are discussed in detail. Furthermore, we compute both the real and imaginary parts of the static heavy-quark potential in the chirally imbalanced plasma and argue that quarkonium suppression is enhanced due to the combined effects of a reduced debye screening length and an increased decay width. In addition, we calculate the gluon spectral density, sum rules and residues for various cases, providing a comprehensive understanding of the collective behaviour of the medium.</description>

      <title>Radiative Mass Generation in Gauged Theories of Flavour: A Path to Fermion Mass Hierarchies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a class of models based on extended gauged flavour symmetries that address the hierarchical structure of fermion masses in the Standard Model (SM) through the radiative mass generation mechanism. In these frameworks, only third-generation fermions acquire tree-level masses, while the first and second generations gain their masses via quantum corrections induced by new gauge bosons, naturally explaining the observed mass hierarchy. Since the technically natural structure of fermion masses in the SM prevents such a mechanism from being implemented directly, we propose extensions involving both Abelian and non-Abelian gauge symmetries. Abelian extensions, which must be flavour non-universal, typically generate masses for only second-generation fermions at the 1-loop level, requiring higher order corrections or extension of gauge structure to account for first-generation masses. We show that either a $U(1)_1 \times U(1)_2$ extension or a single $U(1)_F$ with up to 2-loop mass generation can successfully realize the mechanism, with the latter predicting a viable new physics scale around $10^3$ TeV when flavour-violating charges are optimized. Non-Abelian extensions, such as those based on $SU(3)_F$, provide a more constrained and predictive setup due to a comparatively fewer number of free parameters. We also explore a radiative mechanism in Abelian extensions within left-right symmetric theories, which simultaneously addresses the strong CP problem. All these models collectively offer a compelling and testable framework for generating a realistic SM fermion mass spectrum.</description>

      <title>Significance of soft-scale breaking on primordial black hole production in Coleman-Weinberg type supercooling-phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-supercooling phase transitions can generate large overdensities in the Universe, potentially leading to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs), which can also be a dark matter candidate. In this work, we focus on the supercooling phase transition for the scale symmetry breaking based on the effective potential of the Coleman-Weinberg (CW) type. We investigate the effect on the PBH production in the presence of an additional mass term for the CW scalar field, what we call a soft-scale breaking term, which serves as the extra explicit-scale breaking term other than the quantum scale anomaly induced by the CW mechanism. We demonstrate that even a small size of the soft-scale breaking term can significantly affect the PBH production depending on its sign: a positive term slows down the phase transition, thereby enhancing the PBH abundance and improving the model's ability to account for dark matter; in contrast, a negative term suppresses the PBH formation. The inclusion of such soft-scale breaking terms broadens the viable parameter space and increases the flexibility of the framework. We further illustrate our results through two ultraviolet-complete realizations: i) a many-flavor QCD-inspired model as a reference model which can dynamically induce a positive-soft scale breaking; ii) a Higgs portal model with a $B-L$ scalar as the benchmark for the case where a negative-soft scale breaking is induced. Our study would provide a new testable link between PBH dark matter and gravitational wave signatures in the CW-type scenario.</description>

      <title>$X(3872)$ and hidden charmed tetraquarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a constituent quark model, a hidden charmed tetraquark is assumed consisting of a $cq$ diquark and an $\bar c\bar q$ antidiquark or vice versa. The Semay-Silvestre-Brac potentials are employed to calculate the masses of $cq$ (q=u, d) diquarks. The mass of the $cq$ diquark or $\bar c\bar q$ antidiquark with spin-$0$ is predicted with $\sim 2175$ MeV, and the spin-$1$ one is predicted with $\sim 2220$ MeV. The masses of hidden charmed tetraquarks from $1S$ to $2P$ excitations are systemically calculated in terms of the same potentials. It is found that the mass of hidden charmed tetraquark without radial excitation grows higher in $1^{+-},~1^{++},~1^{--},~0^{-+},~0^{--},~1^{-+},~\cdots$ sequence, and the tetraquarks with exotic $J^{PC}=0^{--},~1^{-+}$ have higher masses. The hidden charmed tetraquarks with radial excitations have masses larger than $4300$ MeV. The $1S-1P$ and $1S-2S$ mass splittings of the hidden charmed tetraquarks are about $390-400$ MeV and $550-570$ MeV, respectively, which are about $70$ MeV and $50$ MeV smaller than those of normal charmonium. The $1P-2P$ and $2S-2P$ mass splittings are similar to those for conventional $c\bar c$ charmonium mesons. Based on our predicted masses for hidden charmed tetraquarks, some XYZ exotics are analyzed and tentatively assigned. $X^*(3860)$ is possibly the $0^{++}$ tetraquark. $Z_c(3900)$ and $X(3940)$ are possibly the $1^{+-}$ tetraquarks, and $X(3872)$ is possibly a $1^{++}$ tetraquark. $X(4250)$ may be a $0^{-+}$, $0^{++}$ or $1^{-+}$ tetraquark, $X(4240)$ may be a $0^{--}$ tetraquark. With radial excitations, $X(4350)$ may be a $0^{++}$ tetraquark, $Z_c(4430)$ may be a $1^{+-}$ tetraquark, $X(4630)$ may be a $0^{-+}$ or $1^{-+}$ tetraquark, and $X(Y)(4660)$ may be the $1^{--}$ tetraquark. $Y(4008)$ or $Y(4390)$ seems impossibly the $1^{--}$ tetraquark.</description>

      <title>Constraining Inflation via FIMP dark matter using the $\beta$-function with collider implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study connects inflation and freeze-in type dark matter (DM) within the same setup. Although the observables in these two phenomena lie at vastly different energy scales, they have been properly handled using the RG running of couplings. For studying DM and inflation, the SM has been minimally extended by introducing an abelian dark gauge symmetry and a dark singlet scalar. In studying inflation, the SM Higgs doublet has been considered as the inflaton, which has a non-minimal coupling with the Ricci scalar. All inflationary observables have been computed at the horizon exit scale and constrained using the Planck data. Moreover, inflationary constraints have revealed strong correlations among model parameters, significantly reducing the allowed parameter space. In particular, in the Higgs mixing angle and BSM Higgs mass plane, only those values that ensure the Higgs quartic coupling remains above 0.18 are allowed. The additional gauge boson serves as a suitable DM candidate, produced via the freeze-in mechanism and stabilised by charge conjugation symmetry. The upper bound on the DM relic density further shrinks the parameter space allowed from inflationary constraints, becoming even narrower if we assume that the present vector DM constitutes the total DM density. Since DM interactions are feeble, it remains safe from all terrestrial experimental constraints. Additionally, the feeble dark matter coupling requires the dark Higgs-Ricci scalar non-minimal coupling to be negligible to satisfy Higgs inflation conditions. Finally, we have explored collider aspects and found that the trilinear and quartic Higgs vertices deviate from their SM values after incorporating inflation and DM constraints. Therefore, once we measure $\kappa_{3,4}$ at the future collider, we can establish the robustness of the Higgs inflation scenario.</description>

      <title>Analytic NNLO transverse-momentum-dependent soft function for heavy quark pair hadroproduction at threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) soft function for non-relativisitc heavy quark pair production at hadron colliders is analytically computed at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in the strong coupling expansion. We present the details of our computational approach and analyze the general two-loop structure of the soft function. The final result, which takes a particularly simple form, provides the last missing ingredient for a complete NNLO calculation of color-octet $S$-wave quarkonium hadroproduction--including charmonium, bottomonium, and toponium--using the $q_T$-slicing formalism. It also enables next-to-next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic (N$^3$LL) resummation at small transverse momentum for the same process.</description>

      <title>Polarization Probes of New Physics in Lepton-Flavor-Violating Hyperon Production from $e^- N \to \tau^- Y$ Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While charged lepton-flavor-violating tau decays to strange mesons provide powerful probes of the underlying $\tau\to\ell d \bar{s}$ transition, the corresponding decay modes involving hyperons are kinematically forbidden. To address this gap, we propose the quasi-elastic scattering processes $e^- N \to \tau^- Y$. Within a general low-energy effective Lagrangian, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the final-state polarizations of both the $\tau$ lepton and the hyperon $Y$, systematically addressing the theoretical uncertainty driven by the model dependence of form factors. Our analysis demonstrates that while this uncertainty leads to large variations in predicted rates, the polarization observables can potentially distinguish between the form factor models, and help to determine the chiral nature of the vectorial new physics interaction. Finally, we forecast the event rates for future facilities, revealing a strong dependence on the form factor models, with predicted yields ranging from potentially observable levels to rates far below current detection thresholds.</description>

      <title>The \emph{Echo 12-23 Texture}: A Novel Flavour Paradigm for Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a flavour guided model that realises the distinctive \emph{Echo 12-23 Texture} in the neutrino mass matrix through a non-trivial interplay of symmetries. While the model accounts for charged lepton mass hierarchy, the texture offers interesting insights specifically into neutrino mass ordering and flavour dynamics. With clear imprints on low energy observables, the framework provides a minimal yet testable path toward understanding the origin of neutrino properties.</description>

      <title>Effect of anomalous $HHH$ coupling on the decay $H\rightarrow Z\,Z^*\rightarrow$ 4 charged leptons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have computed the electroweak corrections to $H\rightarrow Z\,Z^*\rightarrow$ 4 charged leptons, including the effect of anomalous $HHH$ coupling in the $\kappa$-framework. The results of this scaling are gauge invariant. We have computed the results for $ H \to e^+ e^- \mu^+ \mu^-$ and $ H \to e^+ e^- e^+ e^-$ processes. The corrections for the both processes depend on the input parameter scheme. In the $G_F$ scheme, the electroweak corrections are about $1.26\%$ for the $ H \to e^+ e^- \mu^+ \mu^-$ and about $0.25\%$ for the $ H \to e^+ e^- e^+ e^-$ process. However changing the $\kappa$ from $4$ to $-4$, the corrections vary from less than $1\%$ to about $-6\%$. We have plotted a number of kinematic distributions. The corrections over most of the phase space regions are similar. These large corrections can be used to put a bound on the $HHH$ coupling. This can help in determining the structure of the Higgs potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a pedagogical introduction to the origin of the mass of the nucleon. We first review the trace anomaly of the energy-momentum tensor, which generates most of the nucleon mass via the gluon fields and thus contributes even in the case of vanishing quark masses. We then discuss the contributions to the nucleon mass that do originate from the Higgs mechanism via the quark masses, reviewing the current status of nucleon $\sigma$-terms that encode the corresponding matrix elements.</description>

      <title>Neutrino oscillations in the Ellis wormhole spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing is a powerful tool to probe compact astrophysical objects and the distribution of dark matter at large scales. As a counterpart of photons, lensed relativistic neutrinos could also be used to explore properties of curved spacetimes. In the present paper we consider neutrino oscillations in the Ellis wormhole (WH) spacetime in comparison with the widely discussed black hole (BH) spacetimes. We investigate the oscillations involving lensing effects with 2- and 3-flavor neutrinos under the weak-field approximation. In the two-flavor model, the flavor oscillation probabilities display the impacts of the throat radius, neutrino mass hierarchy, and the lightest neutrino mass. In the realistic 3-flavor case, the similar observations are obtained with the up-to-date global fit data of neutrino experiments. The influence of the Ellis WH on the coherence of neutrinos is also studied in the paper. In general, the observations from neutrino oscillations cannot be used to discriminate Ellis WH spacetimes from typical BH spacetimes under the weak-field limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.24011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) measurements claim that the dark energy equation of state $w \ne -1$. This observation can be explained by the axion Dark Energy (aDE) model of an ultralight axion plus a cosmological constant $\Lambda$. Despite a relatively large degeneracy, there is a high probability that $\Lambda &lt;0$. This negative $\Lambda$ leads the universe to end in a big crunch. Using the best-fit values of the model as a benchmark, we find the lifespan of our universe to be 33 billion years.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.24023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hadronization is a fundamental process occurring at a distance scale of about $1\,\rm fm \simeq \Lambda_{QCD}^{-1} $, hence within non-perturbative dynamics. In elementary collisions, like $e^+e^-$, $e^-p$, or $pp$, phenomenological approaches to hadronization have been developed based on vacuum-like dynamics that require the creation of quark-antiquark and/or diquark pairs during the hadronization process. In the 2000s, the idea was developed that in ultra-relativistic nucleus-nucleus (AA) collisions, which lead to the formation of a partonic medium with large (anti-)quark densities, hadronization can occur through the recombination of in-medium quarks, unlike the situation in $e^+e^-$, $e^-p$, and $pp$. We give an overview of the main features that characterize quark recombination and have enabled a description of several important experimental observables at both RHIC and LHC over the last two decades. We highlight some additional developments and open issues. We specifically discuss the impact of coalescence on the study of heavy-flavor hadronization, including recent developments showing signatures of (the onset of) quark coalescence even in $pp$ collisions at TeV energies. Furthermore, we highlight specific features of hadronization for quarkonium in AA collisions, where it has been possible to develop a dynamical kinetic approach that allows to extract more detailed information about the temperature dependence of the heavy-quark interaction in hot QCD matter.</description>

      <title>Dark matter as the source of neutrino mass: theory overview and experimental prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review theoretical frameworks in which small neutrino masses arise radiatively through interactions with a dark sector that also accounts for cosmological dark matter. A prototypical example is provided by scotogenic schemes, that extend the inert Higgs doublet model. We outline their key features and limitations, including possible completions, such as the revamped setup. The phenomenological signatures of both fermionic and bosonic scotogenic dark matter are discussed, along with scoto-seesaw models that merge scotogenic and seesaw mechanisms, and scenarios where the dark sector triggers a low-scale seesaw. These frameworks can accommodate dark matter as either Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) or Feebly Interacting Massive Particles (FIMPs). While hidden dark sector models are inherently difficult to test experimentally, those based on visible dark sectors offer clear predictions that could be confirmed -- or ruled out -- by forthcoming dark matter searches, collider experiments, and lepton flavor violation studies.</description>

      <title>Positive Integrands from Feynman Integrals in the Minkowski Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for rewriting dimensionally regulated Feynman parameter integrals in the Minkowski regime as a sum of real, positive integrands multiplied by complex prefactors. This representation eliminates the need for contour deformation, allowing for direct numerical or analytic evaluation of the integrals. We develop an algorithm to construct such representations for a broad class of integrals and demonstrate its generalisation through selected examples. Our approach is applied to integrals up to three loops, including cases with internal masses and off-shell external legs. The resulting expressions are suitable for evaluation using existing techniques, such as sector decomposition, where we observe performance gains of up to four orders of magnitude in certain cases.</description>

      <title>Soft and virtual corrections to semi-inclusive DIS up to four loops in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the threshold resummation formalism for semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) to derive the soft and virtual corrections for the SIDIS cross section up to four loops in QCD. Using the recently computed next-to-next-to-leading order QCD corrections for the SIDIS cross section together with known results for the form factor and splitting functions in QCD up to four loops, we derive the complete soft and collinear contributions to the SIDIS coefficient functions at four-loop order. We also include systematically the next-to-leading power corrections, which are suppressed near threshold. The numerical analysis of the new four-loop corrections shows a small effect on the cross section underpinning the very good perturbative stability of the SIDIS process at that order in perturbation theory, including the reduced dependence on the renormalization and factorization scales $\mu_R$ and $\mu_F$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.24094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Three-Higgs-Doublet Model (3HDM) extends the Standard Model by introducing two additional scalar doublets, leading to a rich spectrum of new particles: three neutral CP-even Higgs bosons ($h_1$, $H_2$, $H_3$), two neutral CP-odd Higgs bosons ($A_2$, $A_3$), and two charged Higgs bosons ($H_2^+$, $H_3^+$). In this work, we present a phenomenological study of the 3HDM at the future International Linear Collider (ILC) with a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 1000\,\text{GeV}$. Applying a comprehensive set of theoretical and experimental constraints, we identify promising new physics signals with sufficiently large production cross-sections. Our analysis shows that $e^+e^- \to H_2 A_2$, $e^+e^- \to H_2 H_2 Z$, $A_2 A_2 Z$, $H_2 H_2^{\pm} W^{\mp}$, $A_2 H_2^{\pm} W^{\mp}$ and $H_1 H_2 A_2$ are among the most sensitive channels to probe this extended Higgs sector. We demonstrate that a future ILC would offer a powerful platform to test these interactions and discover these heavier Higgs bosons thus providing evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive numerical study on four categories of holographic dark energy models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09064v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Holographic dark energy (HDE), which arises from a theoretical attempt to apply the holographic principle (HP) to the dark energy (DE) problem, has attracted significant attention over the past two decades. We perform a comprehensive numerical study on HDE models that can be classified into four categories: 1) HDE models with other characteristic length scale, 2) HDE models with extended Hubble scale, 3) HDE models with dark sector interaction, 4) HDE models with modified black hole entropy. For theoretical models, we select seven representative models, including the original HDE (OHDE) model, Ricci HDE (RDE) model, generalized Ricci HDE (GRDE) model, interacting HDE (IHDE1 and IHDE2) models, Tsallis HDE (THDE) model, and Barrow HDE (BHDE) model. For cosmological data, we use the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) 2024 measurements, the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) distance priors data from the Planck 2018, and the type Ia supernovae (SNe) data from the PantheonPlus compilation. Using $\chi^2$ statistic and Bayesian evidence, we compare these HDE models with current observational data. It is found that: 1) The $\Lambda$CDM remains the most competitive model, while the RDE model is ruled out. 2) HDE models with dark sector interaction perform the worst across the four categories, indicating that the interaction term is not favored under the framework of HDE. 3) The other three categories show comparable performance. The OHDE model performs better in the BAO+CMB dataset, and the HDE models with modified black hole entropy perform better in the BAO+CMB+SN dataset. 4) HDE models with the future event horizon exhibit significant discrepancies in parameter space across datasets. The BAO+CMB dataset favors a phantom-like HDE, whereas the BAO+CMB+SN leads to an equation of state (EoS) much closer to the cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Three-Family Supersymmetric Pati-Salam models from Intersecting D6-Branes on Rigid Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intersecting D6-brane models without discrete torsion typically suffer from unstabilized open string moduli, arising from D-brane positions and Wilson lines. These moduli generate additional massless adjoint fields, obstructing the realization of negative beta functions necessary for asymptotic freedom unless they are decoupled around string scale. A viable solution involves utilizing rigid cycles, which eliminate these unwanted adjoint fields. In this work, we for the first time present a class of consistent three-family supersymmetric Pati-Salam models from rigid intersecting D6-branes on the factorizable $\mathbb{T}^6/(\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2^\prime)$ orientifold with discrete torsion. These models satisfy all the known consistency conditions, including $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry, K-theory constraints, tadpole cancellation, and recent swampland bounds on the maximal gauge group rank. We provide detailed particle spectra, analyze their phenomenological implications, and discuss the decoupling of exotic states through strong dynamics in the hidden sector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microquasars, compact binary systems with an accreting stellar-mass black hole or neutron star, are promising candidates for high-energy particle acceleration. Recently, the LHAASO collaboration reported on the detection of $&gt;100$ TeV $\gamma$-ray emission from five microquasars, suggesting that these sources are efficient particle accelerators. In microquasars, high-energy $\gamma$-rays can be produced in large-scale jets or winds. In this work, we explore the X-ray, $\gamma$-ray and neutrino emission from SS 433, V4641 Sgr and GRS 1905+105. We consider leptonic and hadronic scenarios to explain the spectra observed by LHAASO and other high-energy $\gamma$-ray detectors. We estimate the neutrino flux associated with the hadronic component and investigate the detectability of neutrinos from these sources in current and future neutrino telescopes. We find that among the three sources, V4641 Sgr has the best prospects of observation with a combined next-generation neutrino telescopes.</description>

      <title>Solving inverse problems of Type IIB flux vacua with conditional generative models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the inverse problem in Type IIB flux compactifications of identifying flux vacua with targeted phenomenological properties such as specific superpotential values or tadpole constraints using conditional generative models. These machine learning techniques overcome computational bottlenecks in traditional approaches such as rejection sampling and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which struggle to generate rare, finely-tuned vacua. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that conditional generative models provide a more efficient alternative, specifically using conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs). We introduce a CVAE framework tailored to flux compactifications, incorporating physical constraints directly into the loss function - enabling the generation of physically consistent vacua beyond the training set. Our experiments on conifold and symmetric torus background geometries show that the CVAE achieves a speedup of about $O(10^3)$ compared to Metropolis sampling, particularly in narrow target ranges for superpotential values. Additionally, the CVAE generates novel, distinct flux configurations beyond the training data, highlighting its potential for probing computationally challenging regions of the string landscape. Our results establish conditional generative models as a powerful and scalable tool for targeted flux vacua generation, opening new pathways for model building in regions of the landscape previously inaccessible by traditional model building techniques.</description>

      <title>Probing the transition from classical to quantum radiation reaction in relativistic plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the transition from classical radiation reaction, described by the Landau-Lifshitz model, to the quantum mechanical regime. The plasma is subject to a circularly polarized field where the self-consistent plasma current is the source of the electromagnetic field through Ampere's law. The radiation reaction implies wave energy loss, frequency up-conversion, and a modified distribution function. Increasing the value of the quantum $\chi$-parameter, the quantum results gradually differ from the classical ones. Moreover, the deviation between models also depends on the plasma parameters, including density and temperature. We discuss the implications of our findings.</description>

      <title>Lattice study of correlators for quarkonium decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While there has been a lot of progress in developing a
  formalism for the study of quarkonia in QGP, a nonperturbative
  study is still difficult. For bottomonia, where the system size
  is much less than the inverse temperature, the interaction of the
  system with the medium can be approximated by a dipole interaction with
  the color electric field. The decay of the quarkonia can be connected to
  a correlation function of the color electric field.
  We present preliminary results from a lattice study of the relevant color
  electric field correlator. The structure of the correlator, and its
  difference from the corresponding correlator studied for heavy quark
  diffusion, is discussed.</description>

      <title>Ultrahigh Energy Cosmic Ray Production in Binary Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We predict the spectrum and composition of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays (UCRs for short) generated in a binary neutron star merger, exploiting the highly constrained initial conditions to make quantitative predictions for the cutoff energy for various nuclei. The key mechanism producing UCRs heavier than helium is acceleration in the magnetized turbulent outflow outside the jets. We find the rigidity cutoff of this component is $\mathcal{R}_{\rm cut} \equiv E_{\rm cut}/eZ \approx 6-9$ EV, consistent with the measured value $\mathcal{R}_{\rm cut} = 6.8^{+5.8}_{-2.8}\,$EV from fitting data. This agreement strengthens the case that BNS mergers are the main site of UCR production.
  The jets may also be capable of accelerating particles to ultrahigh energy: these UCRs would be protons and/or helium, in a ratio that depends on the neutron star equation of state. We estimate the cutoff energies of such a component to be $E_{\rm cut}\approx\! 10\,$EeV for p and $\approx\! 30\,$EeV for He. Such a jet component may explain the hint of a secondary light population at higher energy found in the analysis of Muzio et al. (2019). With more precise data, the locus of production of helium and intermediate mass nuclei can be inferred from their rigidity structure, and the predicted small deviations from a pure Peters Cycle can be checked. Predicting the relative abundances of different elements and the total energy in UCRs per merger event is feasible, but beyond the scope of this paper.
  This scenario predicts that each neutrino above 1 PEV is co-directional with a gravitational wave arriving ~1 day earlier, and that the highest energy UCRs have masses heavier than iron.</description>

      <title>The diffuse supernova neutrino background: a modern approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new, state-of-the-art computation of the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB), where we use neutrino spectra from multi-dimensional, multi-second core collapse supernova simulations - including both neutron-star and black-hole forming collapses - and binary evolution effects from modern population synthesis codes. Large sets of numerical results are processed and connected in a consistent manner, using two key quantities: the mass of the star's Carbon-Oxygen (CO) core at an advanced pre-collapse stage - which depends on binary evolution effects - and the compactness parameter, which is the main descriptor of the post-collapse neutrino emission. The method enables us to model the neutrino emission of a very diverse, binary-affected population of stars, which cannot unambiguously be mapped in detail by existing core collapse simulations. We find that including black hole-forming collapses enhances the DSNB by up to 50% at energies greater than 30-40 MeV. Binary evolution effects can change the total rate of collapses and generate a sub-population of high core mass stars that are stronger neutrino emitters. However, the net effect on the DSNB is moderate - up to a 15% increase in flux - due to the rarity of these super-massive cores and to the relatively modest dependence of the neutrino emission on the CO core mass. The methodology presented here is suitable for extensions and generalizations, and therefore it lays the foundation for modern treatments of the DSNB.</description>

      <title>Elliptic flow of charged hadrons in d+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 200 GeV using a multi-phase transport model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the elliptic flow coefficient, $v_2$, for charged hadrons at mid-rapidity in d+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 200\mathrm{~GeV}$. Utilizing the AMPT model in both default and string melting modes, we examine the dependence of $v_2$ on transverse momentum, collision centrality, and particle type. Furthermore, we present $v_2$ scaled by participant eccentricity, which indicates a similar level of collectivity across different centrality intervals in d+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 200\mathrm{~GeV}$ within the AMPT-SM model. Our results indicate that the early-stage partonic phase significantly influences $v_2$, as observed by variations in parton scattering cross-section, while the later stage hadronic rescattering shows minimal impact. Comparisons with STAR and PHENIX experimental data show that the AMPT model effectively captures the transverse momentum dependence of $v_2$, underlining the importance of parton scattering mechanisms and the need for careful interpretation of experimental results in asymmetric systems.</description>

      <title>Bayesian constraints on quark and neutron stars from multi-messenger observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We constrain the quark matter equation of state (EOS) with color superconductivity (2SC, 2SC+s, CFL phases) and QCD corrections using Bayesian inference informed by multi-messenger observations from the NICER pulsars, HESS J1731-347 and GW170817. Our results reveal that the bag constant $B$ = 47$\text{--}$55 MeV/fm$^{3}$ are tightly constrained, the QCD correction strength $a_4$ is phase-dependent ($a_4 \approx$ 0.9 for 2SC, $\sim$0.6 for 2SC+s). A large surface tension is required for 2SC phase ($\sigma \gtrsim 95$ MeV/fm$^2$) according to the stability constraints of ${^{266}\mathrm{Hs}}$. The mass-radius relations support quark stars as explanations for HESS J1731-347. The squared speed of sound converges to $c^2/3$, ruling out extreme stiffening. The inferred maximum quark star mass $M_{\mathrm{max}}&lt; 2.28M_\odot$ (90\% confidence level) rules out the secondary component of GW190814 (2.59$\pm$0.08$M_\odot$) as a quark star. In particular, the quark stars (2SC phase) is strongly favored when including HESS J1731-347 data with the bayes factor $B_{\text{2SC, NS}}$ = 10.6, but neutron stars are moderately preferred with $B_{\text{NS, 2SC}}$ = 3.22 if HESS J1731-347 data is excluded. This demonstrates low-mass compact objects critically discriminate between quark matter phases and between quark and neutron-star models.</description>

      <title>A generalized definition of the isothermal compressibility in (2+1)-flavor QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a generalized definition of the isothermal compressibility ($\kappa_{T,\sigma_Q^2}$) calculable by keeping net conserved charge fluctuations rather than total number densities constant. We present lattice QCD results for this isothermal compressibility, expressed in terms of fluctuations of conserved charges that are related to baryon ($B$), electric charge ($Q$) and strangeness ($S$) quantum numbers. This generalized isothermal compressibility is compared with hadron resonance gas model calculations as well as with heavy-ion collision data obtained at RHIC and the LHC. We find $\kappa_{T,\sigma_Q^2}=13.8(1.3)$~fm$^3$/GeV at $T_{pc,0}=156.5(1.5)$~MeV and $\hat{\mu}_B=0$. This finding is consistent with the rescaled result of the ALICE Collaboration, where we replaced the number of charged hadrons ($N_{\rm ch}$) by the total number of hadrons ($N_{\rm tot}$) at freeze-out. Normalizing this result with the QCD pressure ($P$) we find that the isothermal compressibility on the pseudo-critical line stays close to that of an {\it ideal gas}, {\it i.e.} $P \kappa_{T,\sigma_Q^2}\simeq 1$.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing dark energy with model independent methods after DESI DR2 BAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ two model-independent approaches, including redshift binning method and polynomial interpolation method, to reconstruct dark energy (DE) equation of state (EoS) $w(z)$ and DE density function $f(z)$. Our analysis incorporates data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) data release 2, Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) distance priors from Planck 2018 and Atacama Cosmology Telescope data release 6, and three Type Ia supernovae (SN) compilations (PantheonPlus, Union3, and DESY5). To ensure model independence, we adopt three redshift binning schemes (n=3, 4, 5) and three polynomial interpolation schemes with the same number of nodes (n=3, 4, 5). Our main conclusions are as follows: 1) After taking into account DESI data, there is a clear trend that DE should evolve with redshift (with deviations from the cosmological constant reaching at least a $2.13\sigma$ confidence level), indicating that current observations favor a dynamical DE. 2) In the redshift range $0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.5$, the DE EoS w(z) exhibits a decreasing trend and crosses the phantom divide $w=-1$, suggesting quintom-like behavior. 3) The DE density f(z) first increases at low redshift, reaching a hump around $z\approx 0.5$, and then decreases at $0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.5$, with a rapid decrease at $z&gt;1.0$. 4) For $z &gt; 1.5$, current data are insufficient to place strong constraints on the evolution of DE, resulting in large uncertainties in the DE reconstruction. It must be emphasized that, these four main conclusions are independent of specific reconstruction models, and are insensitive to the choice of SN compilations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We tackle the issue of estimating dynamical parameters in quantum electrodynamics. We numerically compute the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM) of physical parameters in electron-muon and Compton scattering at tree level. In particular, we consider the estimation of centre-of-mass three-momentum magnitude and polar scattering angle through measurements on the internal degrees of freedom (helicity or polarisation) of the scattered particles. Computations are carried out for pure and maximally mixed initial states. The QFIM values are then used to compute the quantum Cram\'er-Rao lower bounds on the estimations at hand. Further, we compare such ultimate bounds to the classical Fisher information of local polarisation or helicity degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Ultra High Energy Neutrino Event KM3-230213A as a Signal of Electroweak Vacuum Turbulence in Merging Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent detection of the ultra-high-energy neutrino event KM3-230213A ($\sim$220 PeV) by KM3NeT telescope poses a challenge to conventional astrophysical models, particularly in light of the absence of similar $\gtrsim$100 PeV events in IceCube data, despite its larger exposure. We propose a novel mechanism in which binary black hole mergers act as transient neutrino sources via gravitationally induced electroweak vacuum instability. In this scenario, the extreme spacetime curvature near the horizons during the final inspiral phase destabilizes the Higgs vacuum, triggering nucleation of true-vacuum bubbles. Collisions between these bubbles produce microscopic black holes that rapidly evaporate via Hawking radiation, emitting intense, short-lived bursts of neutrinos with energies exceeding 100 PeV. The resulting neutrino fluence follows a heavy-tailed distribution, allowing rare but highly luminous sources to account for events like KM3-230213A while remaining consistent with IceCube's non-detections. This framework links gravitational wave sources to ultra-high-energy neutrino production and suggests that future multi-messenger observations may detect electromagnetic signatures from microscopic black hole evaporation.</description>

      <title>Implications of Yukawa interactions in scalar sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, a field theory model containing a real scalar singlet and an SU(2) symmetry preserving complex doublet is studied using the method of lattice simulations. The model considers all quartic vertices along with the Yukawa vertex between a real scalar singlet and an SU(2) symmetry preserving complex doublet field. Machine learning is used to extract representative functions of the field propagators, lattice regulator, and the Yukawa vertex. In the considered renormalization scheme the field propagators are found enhanced compared to their respective tree level structure. It is found that mixing of operators containing scalar singlet with SU(2) invariant field operators results in $0^{+}$ states with a peculiar scarcity in hundreds of $GeV$s. The Yukawa vertex shows weak dependence on the field momenta while the theory remain interactive as found by the renormalized field propagators. The impact of the real scalar quartic self interaction is found mitigated due to other interaction vertices. The field expectation values exhibit a certain classification despite no conclusive signal of phase transition.</description>

      <title>From new physics to a running power law and back again: Minimal refitting techniques for the reconstruction of the gravitational-wave background signal in pulsar timing array data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations recently presented evidence for a gravitational-wave background (GWB) signal at nanohertz frequencies. In this paper, we introduce new refitting techniques for PTA data analysis that elevate related techniques in the literature to a more rigorous level and thus provide the basis for fast and accurate Bayesian inference and physically intuitive model comparisons. The key idea behind our approach is to construct maps \Phi from GWB spectral models to a running-power-law (RPL) reference model, such that the pullback \Phi^* P_RPL of the RPL posterior density P_RPL induces a likelihood on the GWB model parameter space; in other words, we refit spectral models to the RPL posterior density. In order to construct \Phi, we introduce a matched-filtering approach in which \Phi follows from a \chi^2 minimization that accounts for the frequency dependence of PTA sensitivity curves. We validate and illustrate our techniques by three concrete examples: GWs from stable cosmic strings, GWs from metastable strings, and scalar-induced GWs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate how observables with optimal sensitivity to environmental properties can be constructed explicitly from the master equation of an open-quantum system. Our approach does not rely on the explicit solution of the master equation. This makes the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD), the operator of optimal sensitivity and key quantity in quantum metrology, available to a large class of systems of interest, both in and out-of-equilibrium. We validate our approach by reproducing the SLD for temperature in quantum Brownian motion and demonstrate its versatility by constructing the optimal observable for the non-equilibrium relaxation rate.</description>

Abstract: We study the properties of non-topological solitons in two-dimensional conformal field theory. The spectrum of linear perturbations on these solutions is found to be trivial, containing only symmetry-related zero modes. The interpretation of this feature is given by considering the relativistic generalization of our theory in which the conformal symmetry is violated. It is explicitly seen that the restoration of this symmetry leads to the absence of decay/vibrational modes.</description>

Abstract: We propose a new axion dark matter detection strategy that employs optical readout of laser beam ellipticity modulations caused by axion-induced electric fields in a microwave cavity, using electro-optic (EO) crystals, enhanced by externally injected radio-frequency (RF) power. Building upon the variance-based probing method, PRD 107, 103005, (2023), we extend this concept to the optical domain: a weak probe laser interacts with an EO crystal placed inside a resonant microwave cavity at cryogenic temperatures, and the axion-induced electric field is revealed through induced ellipticity. The injected RF signal coherently interferes with that of the axion field, amplifying the optical response and significantly improving sensitivity. While our EO-based method employs a Fabry-Perot resonator, we do not require Michelson interferometers. Our method hence enables compact, high-frequency axion searches, across the 0.5-50\,GHz range. Operating at cryogenic temperatures not only suppresses thermal backgrounds but, critically, allows the probing method to mitigate the laser quantum noise. This approach offers a scalable path forward for axion detection over the $\sim (\text{few}-200$)~$\mu$eV mass range -- covering the preferred parameter space for the post-inflationary Peccei-Quinn axion dark matter -- using compact, tunable systems.</description>

      <title>Comment on "LaMET's Asymptotic Extrapolation vs. Inverse Problem"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In arXiv:2504.17706 {Dutrieux:2025jed} we criticized the excessive model-dependence introduced by rigid few-parameter fits to extrapolate lattice data in the large momentum effective theory (LaMET) when the data are noisy and lose signal before an exponential asymptotic behavior of the space-like correlators is established. In reaction, arXiv:2505.14619 {Chen:2025cxr} claims that even when the data is of poor quality, rigid parametrizations are better than attempts at representing the uncertainty using what they call "inverse problem methods". We clarify the fundamental differences in our perspectives regarding how to meaningfully handle noisy lattice matrix elements, especially when they exhibit a strong sensitivity to the choice of regularization in the inverse problem. We additionally correct misunderstandings of {Chen:2025cxr} on our message and methods.</description>

      <title>Constraining self-interacting ultrahigh-energy neutrinos by cosmic microwave background spectral distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The neutrino telescopes have firmly established the existence of ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrinos. Observations of these neutrinos offer a unique probe of neutrino self-interactions. This work investigates how the self-interacting neutrinos, mediated by scalar bosons, inject energy into the medium through radiative scattering with the cosmic neutrino background, leaving an imprint on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) spectrum. The energy injection into plasma in redshift ranges, $5\times10^4\lesssim z\lesssim2\times10^6$ and $ z\lesssim5\times10^4$, leads to $\mu$-type and $y$-type of CMB spectral distortions, respectively. Using observational constraints from Cosmic Background Explorer/Far Infrared Absolute Spectrophotometer (COBE/FIRAS) and projected sensitivities from Primordial Inflation Explorer (PIXIE) experiments for $\mu$-type and $y$-type CMB distortions, we derive the stringent upper bounds on the self-interaction coupling strength as a function of mediator mass for neutrino interactions. We focus on flavor-specific self-interaction related to muon neutrinos and sub-GeV mass mediators ($m_{\phi}$). We find the upper bound on the self-interaction coupling strength to be $\sim 3.1\times 10^{-5}$ for the muon neutrino, considering UHE muon neutrino energy to be 1 PeV and PIXIE projected upper bounds on $\mu$-type CMB spectral distortion. The bound remains constant till the mediator mass reaches the center of mass energy, and after that, it gets relaxed and becomes proportional to the mediator mass. We have also compared our results with existing bounds in the literature. Our findings indicate that CMB spectral distortion could play a decisive role in exploring neutrino physics beyond the standard model of particle physics, and future missions like PIXIE can provide valuable insights.</description>

Abstract: We address the Light-Shining-Through-a-thin-Wall (LSthinW) laboratory setup to estimate the sensitivity of axion-like particle (ALP) detection using two radio-frequency (RF) cavities immersed in a static magnetic field. We analytically evaluate the asymptotic sensitivity in the off-shell regime for the lowest electromagnetic pump modes. We show that a sufficiently thin wall separating can lead to the improved sensitivity of the pure laboratory probes of ALP in the mass range $10^{-6}~{\rm eV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 10^{-4}~{\rm eV}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a mechanism to make dark matter stable based on the Pauli blocking in the fermion background. In the background where fermions occupy the states, the decay of dark matter to those final states is not allowed, as a result, DM becomes stable. We derive the evolution equations of the distribution function in the quantum field theory and compare it with the Boltzmann equation. We apply this mechanism to a realistic model of neutrino and dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combining the KSVZ axion model and the type-I seesaw mechanism, we construct a minimal flavored axion model that can affect the neutrino mass matrix. This minimal model requires a flavor dependent PQ charge assignment and two additional standard model (SM) singlet scalars which generate specific patterns of lepton mass matrices, yielding a particular texture of Majorana neutrino mass matrix. Combined with fact that $\theta _{13}$ is much smaller than the other mixing angles, this texture predicts an Inverted Hierarchy of neutrino masses with $17\lesssim m_1/m_3\lesssim 44$, and a hierarchy between the two VEVs of SM-singlet scalars. We also examine the couplings between the axion and the leptons in this model. Especially, the axion-neutrino couplings have the potential effect on neutrino oscillation.</description>

      <title>Evolution of unpolarized transverse momentum dependent parton distributions of twist-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09667v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the calculation of the evolution equations for four unpolarized twist-3 transverse momentum dependent (TMD) parton distribution functions (PDFs) at $\mathcal {O}(\alpha_s)$. Unlike the existing calculations in the literature, which are based on the background field method, we derive the evolution equations directly through diagram expansion. Additionally, instead of using the $\delta$ regulator, we employ the exponential regulator to regularize the rapidity divergences. We find that the evolutions of the four twist-3 TMD PDFs are governed by eight homogeneous equations. Our evolution kernels agree with one set of results in the literature, but differ from another by a sign. Considering the advantages of the exponential regulator in high-order perturbative calculations, our results are crucial for computing the twist-3 TMD PDFs at $\mathcal {O}(\alpha_s^2)$.</description>

Abstract: We compute the branching fractions of vector quarkonia ($V_Q=J/\psi, \psi', \Upsilon(nS)$) decays into neutrino pairs, considering both Dirac and Majorana types, within the Standard Model (SM) and beyond. The vector nature of quarkonium states yields a decay width in the SM that depends upon the weak vector coupling of the heavy quark, offering the possibility to measure the weak mixing angle at the quarkonia mass scales. If neutrinos have non-standard neutral weak couplings, this could help to distinguish the nature of neutrinos in principle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $Z_2$ symmetry under which "dark'' and "visible'' fields transform differently can further seclude already dark particles. In a dark sector consisting of an axion-like particle and a dark photon the dominant interaction can then be via a dark photon-axion portal to the ordinary photon. If the axion is lighter than the dark photon it naturally emerges as a viable dark matter candidate. We explore its freeze-in production both in a standard high reheating temperature and weak coupling as well as a low reheating temperature and strong coupling regime. Cosmological constraints are taken into account to identify viable regions in parameter space. For the strong freeze-in regime, we highlight the possibility of probing it at B-factories. We also briefly discuss a potential misalignment contribution to the dark matter density and delineate under which conditions it can be neglected.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of the Critical Endpoint in 2+1-Flavor System from Holographic QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a Bayesian holographic model constructed by integrating the equation of state and baryon number susceptibility at zero chemical potential from lattice QCD. The model incorporates error estimates derived from lattice data. With this model, we systematically investigate the thermodynamic properties of the 2+1-flavor QCD system. Using Bayesian Inference, we perform precise calibration of the model parameters and determined the critical endpoint (CEP) position under the maximum a posterior (MAP) estimation to be $(T^{c},\mu_{B}^{c})=(0.0859\;\mathrm{GeV},0.742\;\mathrm{GeV})$. Additionally, we predict the CEP positions within 68\% and 95\% confidence levels, yielding $(T^{c},\; \mu_{B}^{c})_{68\%}$=$(0.0820\text{--}0.0889, 0.71\text{--}0.77)\;\mathrm{GeV}$ and $(T^{c},\; \mu_{B}^{c})_{95\%}$=$(0.0816\text{--}0.0898,\; 0.71\text{--}0.79)\;\mathrm{GeV}$, respectively. Moreover, to validate the reliability and predictive power of our approach, we conduct a comprehensive comparison between our predictions and potential CEP locations proposed by other theoretical models. This work not only establishes a novel Bayesian framework for holographic modeling but also provides valuable insights and theoretical support for exploring phase transitions in strongly-interacting matter under extreme conditions.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the perturbative corrections in the strong coupling to the unpolarized quark transverse-momentum dependent parton distribution function (TMDPDF) operator within a background-field framework, extending the approach of Ref. [1]. We focus on ensuring gauge invariance, identifying two key components needed: a gauge-invariant TMDPDF operator with a transverse gauge link at spatial infinity, and accounting of the equations of motion (EoM) of the background fields. We go beyond next-to-leading order in strong coupling expansion, considering multiple interactions with the background field at all orders of strong coupling. By examining the interplay between quark and gluon contributions, we show that spurious singularities, proportional to EoM, can be misinterpreted as genuine divergences in QCD factorization unless properly identified and removed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15632v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we utilize light-cone QCD sum rules at twist-3 accuracy to compute the coupling parameters of the $\chi_{c1}(2P)$ state with $D$ and $D^*$ mesons. The analysis reveals that the observed $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ meson incorporates significant amounts of both charmonium and molecular components. The interplay between these components highlights the exotic nature of $\chi_{c1}(3872)$. Furthermore, implications for a possible mixing between the $\chi_{b1}(2P)$ state and a potential $B\bar{B}^*$ molecule is discussed. These findings contribute to the understanding of exotic hadron states and their intricate internal structures.</description>

      <title>Analysis of three-body hadronic $D$-meson decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental advances in three-body hadronic $D$ decays from BESIII, we present a systematic analysis of $D_{(s)} \to P_1 (V \to) P_2 P_3 $ decay processes, where $V$ denotes vector resonances ($\rho, K^*, \omega$, $\phi$) and $P_{1,2,3}$ are light pseudoscalar mesons ($\pi,K, \eta^{(\prime)}$). Using the factorization-assisted topological-amplitude (FAT) approach we calculate the intermediate subprocesses $D_{(s)} \to P_1 V$, incorporating relativistic Breit-Wigner distributions to model the subsequent $V \to P_2 P_3$ strong decays. By comprehensively including all relevant resonances ($\rho, K^*, \omega, \phi$), we calculate branching fractions for these decay modes as well as the Breit-Wigner-tail effects in $D_{(s)} \to P_1 (\omega \to) KK$ processes. Our framework comprehensively incorporates both factorizable and nonfactorizable contributions, significantly improving theoretical predictions in the nonperturbative regime where conventional methods face challenges due to the limited mass scale of charm mesons. The FAT approach yields results in good agreement with experimental data, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing nonfactorizable contributions with improved precision. Our predictions for yet-unobserved decay modes, particularly those with branching fractions in the order of $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-3}$, are expected to be tested in future high-precision experiments at BESIII and LHCb.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new type of lepton seesaw model introducing a modular $A_4$ flavor symmetry in which isospin doublet vector fermions play an important role in constructing seesaw mechanisms for both the charged-lepton mass matrix and the neutrino one. The charged-lepton mass matrix is induced via the Dirac seesaw with a two-by-two block mass matrix. On the other hand, the neutrino mass matrix is generated via a seesaw with four-by-four block mass matrix where the right-handed neutral fermions are also added. Remarkably the neutral fermion mass matrix provides us a new type of seesaw formula for active neutrino mass. Through our chi square analysis, we find some tendencies about observables focusing on two fixed points $\tau=i,\ \omega$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19374v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studying exotic hadrons is a challenge against the conventional quark model, providing us with a good platform to deepen our understanding of the strong interaction. An inclusive study of the exotic hadrons in vacuum and at finite temperature is an intriguing approach to shed light on their nature. As a first step, we study the $Z_c(3900)$ in both the $D\bar{D}^\ast$ hadronic molecular and the triangle singularity pictures, and discuss the behaviors of $Z_c(3900)$ at finite temperature in these two different pictures. As a result, we show the properties that its mass becomes smaller and its width becomes larger when the temperature increases, which are seen commonly in the hadronic molecular picture and in the triangle singularity picture. The enhanced widths in hot medium indicate that the $Z_c(3900)$ will be dissociated at a sufficiently high temperature. This feature is also reflected by a decrease of the effective couplings in the hadronic molecular picture. It is concluded that, not only in vacuum but also in hot medium, the behaviors of $Z_{c}(3900)$ are similar in the two different interpretations of $Z_c(3900)$.</description>

The latter is identified as the $\textit{smoking gun signature}$ of two Higgs doublet models (2HDMs) with first-order electroweak (EW) phase transition, a necessary condition for EW baryogenesis. In the general 2HDM (G2HDM) that has flavor-changing neutral Higgs couplings, $H$ may decay dominantly via $t\bar c + \bar tc$ final states, giving rise to trilepton signals. By a phenomenological analysis, we show that $A \to ZH$ in $\ell^+ \ell^- t\bar c$ or $\ell^+ \ell^- \bar t c$ final states could be a promising probe of G2HDM at the LHC with flavor violation.</description>

      <title>Effects of the Matter Potential at One-Loop Level on Neutrino Oscillations in Long-Baseline Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate in a quantitative way how much radiative corrections to the matter potential for neutrino oscillations can impact the sensitivity to neutrino mass ordering in long-baseline accelerator experiments. Using numerical simulations for the future experiment DUNE, we find that the statistical significance for excluding the incorrect mass ordering can be enhanced by about $0.4\sigma$ if a one-loop correction of $2.0\%$ -- based on the Fermi coupling constant $G^{}_\mu$ derived from measurements of muon lifetime -- is included. The radiative corrections at one-loop level lead to resolving the neutrino mass ordering at $5\sigma$ confidence level 4-9 days earlier than at tree level. In contrast, the sensitivity to leptonic CP violation in DUNE is essentially unchanged. Finally, we emphasize that one-loop corrections should be incorporated into analyses of future neutrino oscillation data in a consistent and systematic manner.</description>

      <title>Exploring Potential Higgs Resonances at 650 GeV and 95 GeV in the 2HDM Type III</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent searches by the CMS collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in the `diphoton plus $b\bar{b}$ final state' have revealed an excess near 650 GeV, which might indicate the presence of a (broad) heavy resonance decaying into a Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson and an additional particle. At the same time, both ATLAS and CMS as well as all experiments at the Large Electron-Position (LEP) collider have reported excesses consistent with a light Higgs boson channel around 95 GeV, suggesting a potential connection between these two signals. In this study, we investigate these anomalies within the context of the CP-conserving 2-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM) Type~III. In our proposed scenario, a heavy CP-odd Higgs boson $A$ with a mass near 650 GeV decays into a SM-like Higgs boson $H$ and a $Z$ boson, with the $H$ boson subsequently decaying into diphotons and the $Z$ boson decaying into $b\bar{b}$ pairs. To explain the excess around 95 GeV, we independently select the mass of the light CP-even Higgs boson of the model $h$ to be around this value. This configuration allows for a consistent explanation of both the high- and low-mass excesses observed in the experiments. Through a detailed analysis, we demonstrate that these two signals can be fitted simultaneously at the 2.5$\sigma$ significance level, offering a promising solution to the observed anomalies and potentially hinting at new physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM).</description>

      <title>Multi-step Strong First-Order Electroweak Phase Transitions in the Inverted Type-I 2HDM: Parameter Space, Gravitational Waves, and Collider Phenomenology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the electroweak phase transition (EWPT) within the inverted Type-I two-Higgs-doublet model, where the observed $125\,\text{GeV}$ Higgs boson is identified as the heavier \textit{CP}-even scalar $H$. Through a comprehensive parameter-space scan consistent with current theoretical and experimental constraints, we identify regions supporting strong first-order EWPTs (SFOEWPTs), including multi-step transitions. We find that two-step SFOEWPTs occur as frequently as one-step transitions, while three-step transitions can occur, albeit rarely. Crucially, the parameter spaces inducing one-step and two-step transitions are partially yet significantly separated: one-step transitions restrict the charged Higgs mass and $\tan\beta$ to $m_{H^\pm}\in[295,441]\,\text{GeV}$ and $\tan\beta\in[4.2,8.8]$, whereas two-step transitions allow $m_{H^\pm}\in[100,350]\,\text{GeV}$ and $\tan\beta\in[2.5,45.4]$. Notably, negative values of $\sin(\beta-\alpha)$ arise almost exclusively in one-step scenarios. We present the calculation of gravitational wave (GW) signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) at LISA for multi-step EWPTs, finding that detectable GW signals ($\text{SNR}&gt;10$) predominantly emerge from two-step transitions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the correlation between the vacuum uplifting measure $\Delta F_0$ and $\xi_c$ persists in one-step transitions and breaks down in multi-step cases. Finally, we perform a dedicated collider analysis for representative SFOEWPT parameter points at the $1.5\,\text{TeV}$ CLIC, identifying $e^+ e^- \to H^+ H^- \to W^+ W^- hh$ as a promising discovery channel. Enhanced $h\to\gamma\gamma$ branching ratios for negative $\sin(\beta-\alpha)$ motivate two complementary golden final states, $W^+ W^- b\bar{b} \tau^+ \tau^-$ and $W^+ W^- b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma$, which demonstrate high discovery potential due to negligible Standard Model backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Doubly charged Higgs boson at same-sign lepton colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the search for doubly charged Higgs bosons in the Georgi-Machacek (GM) model at same-sign lepton colliders. The dominant production mode is vector boson fusion, through which the particle is singly produced and decays into a pair of same-sign $W$ bosons if the triplet vacuum expectation value is sufficiently large, as allowed in the GM model. Considering the leptonic decays of the $W$ bosons, we discuss the discovery reach of the signal and a method to extract the mass of the doubly charged Higgs boson. It is impossible to construct the transverse mass of the decay product to obtain the mass because of the neutrinos radiated from the initial-state leptons. Alternatively, we propose to make use of the invariant mass of the same-sign leptons. We perform $\chi^2$ fitting using the analytical formula for the invariant mass distribution and demonstrate that this approach is effective in extracting the information on the mass. We also compare the process with pair production processes at the opposite-sign lepton colliders.</description>

      <title>Hadronic decays of possible pseudoscalar $P$-wave $D\bar{D}^\ast/\bar{D}D^\ast$ molecular state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the new structure $G(3900)$ observed by the BESIII collaboration in the $e^+e^-\to D\bar{D}$ was identified to be the $P$-wave $D\bar{D}^\ast/\bar{D}D^\ast$ vector molecular resonance using a unified meson exchange model. Apart from the vector $P$-wave state, a possible pseudoscalar $P$-wave molecular state of the $D\bar{D}^\ast/\bar{D}D^\ast$ (called $G_0(3900)$ for short) was also predicted, which is likely to be observed in the future experiments. Within the molecular framework, we calculated the partial decay widths for a series of hadronic decays of the $G_0$, including $G_0\to \omega(\rho^0) J/\psi $, $\pi^+\pi^- \eta_c (1S)$, $\pi^+\pi^- \chi_{c1} (1P)$, and $D^0\bar{D}^0\pi^0$. Under present model parameters, the hidden-charm decay modes are dominated by the $G_0\to\omega J/\psi$ and $G_0\to\pi^+\pi^-\eta_c (1S)$, and the partial widths can reach 1 MeV and 0.1 MeV, respectively. The open-charm channel $G_0\to D^0\bar{D}^0\pi^0$ exhibit a rather small decay rate ($\sim 0.1~\mathrm{keV}$). In terms of our present predictions, we suggest BESIII and Belle II to search for the pseudoscalar $P$-wave $D\bar{D}^\ast / \bar{D}D^\ast$ molecular state with $J^{PC} = 0^{-+}$ in the hidden-charm processes $G_0 \to \omega J/\psi$ or $G_0 \to \pi^+\pi^-\eta_c(1S)$.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the Standard Model fit to electroweak precision observables in using the latest data and the Particle Data Group (PDG) measurement of the W boson mass. The analysis is then repeated in light of the new W boson mass measurement from the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF) collaboration. We then introduce a dark photon to the model, placing constraints on the parameter space arising from these electroweak precision observables, both for the PDG and CDF values for the W boson mass. We also extend previous work by placing the first electroweak precision observable constraints on the coupling of dark photons to the fermionic dark matter sector.</description>

      <title>An On-Shell Derivation of the Soft Effective Action in Abelian Gauge Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the soft effective action in $(d+2)$-dimensional abelian gauge theories from the on-shell action obeying Neumann boundary conditions at timelike and null infinity and Dirichlet boundary conditions at spatial infinity. This allows us to identify the on-shell degrees of freedom on the boundary with the soft modes living on the celestial sphere. Following the work of Donnelly and Wall, this suggests that we can interpret soft modes as entanglement edge modes on the celestial sphere and study entanglement properties of soft modes in abelian gauge theories.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the nonabelian dipole problem in the context of a simple semiclassical approach which incorporates some essential features of the infrared sector of Yang-Mills theories in the Landau gauge, in particular, the fact that both the running coupling and the gluon propagator remain finite at infrared scales and that the latter shows positivity violations which reflects the presence of massless modes. We obtain a simple flux tube solution in a controlled approximation scheme, that we compare to the results of lattice simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00358v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new self-consistent perturbative expansion for realistic isolated differentially rotating systems -- disc galaxies. At leading order it is formally equivalent to Ehlers' Newton-Cartan limit, which we reinterpret in terms of quasilocal energy and angular momentum. The self-consistent coupling of these quasilocal terms leads to first-order differences from the conventional Newtonian limit. A modified Poisson equation is obtained, along with modifications to the equations of motion for the effective fluid elements. By fitting to astrophysical data, we show that the phenomenology of collisionless dark matter for disc galaxies can be reproduced. Potential important consequences for gravitational physics on galactic and cosmological scales are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Origin of CMB Large-Scale Features Using LiteBIRD and CMB-S4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several missions following Planck are currently under development, which will provide high-precision measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies. Specifically, measurements of the E modes will become nearly limited by cosmic variance, which, especially when considering the sharpness of the E-mode transfer functions, may allow for the ability to detect deviations from the concordance model in the CMB data. We investigate the capability of upcoming missions to scrutinize models that have been proposed to address large-scale anomalies observed in the temperature spectra from WMAP and Planck. To this purpose, we consider four benchmarks that modify the CMB angular power spectra at large scales: models producing suppression, a dip, and amplification in the primordial scalar power spectrum, as well as a beyond-Lambda CDM prescription of dark energy. Our analysis shows that large-scale measurements from LiteBIRD will be able to distinguish between various types of primordial and late-time models that predict modifications to the angular spectra at these scales. Moreover, if these deviations from the standard cosmological model are determined to be systematic and do not reflect the true universe model, future experiments could potentially dismiss these features as statistical fluctuations. We also show that additional measurements from CMB-S4 can impose more stringent constraints by probing correlated signals that these models predict at smaller scales (l&gt;100). A byproduct of our analysis is that a recently proposed "Dark Dimension" scenario, featuring power amplification at large scales, is strongly bound by current data, pushing the deviation from the standard model to unobservable scales. Overall, our results demonstrate that future CMB measurements can provide valuable insights into large-scale anomalies that are present in the current CMB data.</description>

      <title>Kibble-Zurek scaling of the superfluid-supersolid transition in an elongated dipolar gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We simulate interaction quenches crossing from a superfluid to a supersolid state in a dipolar quantum gas of ${}^{164}\mathrm{Dy}$ atoms, trapped in an elongated tube with periodic boundary conditions, via the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation. A freeze-out time is observed through a delay in supersolid formation after crossing the critical point. We compute the density-density correlations at the freeze-out time and extract the frozen correlation length for the solid order. An analysis of the freeze-out time and correlation length versus the interaction quench rate allows us to extract universal exponents corresponding to the relaxation time and correlation length based on predictions of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Over several orders of magnitude, clear power-law scaling is observed for both the freeze-out time and the correlation length, and the corresponding exponents are compatible with predictions based on the excitation spectrum calculated via Bogoliubov theory. Defects due to independent local breaking of translational symmetry, contributing to globally incommensurate supersolid order, are identified, and their number at the freeze-out time is found to also scale as a power law. Our results support the hypothesis of a continuous transition whose universality class remains to be determined but appears to differ from that of the (1+1)D XY model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic diagrammatic investigation of the classical limit of observables computed from scattering amplitudes in quantum field theory through the Kosower-Maybee-O'Connell (KMOC) formalism, motivated by the study of gravitational waves from black hole binaries. We achieve the manifest cancellation of divergences in the $\hbar \to 0$ limit at the integrand level beyond one loop by employing the Schwinger parametrisation to rewrite both cut and uncut propagators in a worldline-like representation before they are combined. The resulting finite classical integrand takes the same form as the counterpart in the worldline formalisms such as post-Minkowskian effective field theory (PMEFT) and worldline quantum field theory (WQFT), and in fact exactly coincides with the latter in various examples, showing explicitly the equivalence between scattering amplitude and worldline formalisms. The classical causality flow, as expressed by the retarded propagator prescription, appears as an emergent feature. Examples are presented for impulse observables in electrodynamics and a scalar model at two loops, as well as certain subclasses of diagrams to higher orders and all orders.</description>

      <title>Radiation-Reaction and Angular Momentum Loss at $\mathcal{O}(G^4)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02904v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We point out that the odd-in-velocity contribution to the $\mathcal{O}(G^4)$ radiated angular momentum for two-body scattering is determined by the radiation-reaction (RR) term in the one-loop waveform. This RR term is actually proportional to the tree-level waveform, and this reduces the calculation of the odd-in-velocity contribution to the $\mathcal{O}(G^4)$ angular momentum loss, $J_\text{2rad}$, to two loops, instead of three loops as one would expect by power counting. We exploit this simplification, which follows from unitarity, to obtain a closed-form expression for $J_\text{2rad}$ for generic velocities, which resums all fractional post-Newtonian (PN) corrections to the $\mathcal{O}(G^4)$ angular momentum loss starting at 1.5PN.</description>

      <title>A Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield bound with a first-order system in the $2D$ Gross-Pitaevskii equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04092v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) bound for the Gross-Pitaevskii equations in two spatial dimensions is presented. The energy can be bounded from below in terms of the combination of two boundary terms, one related to the vorticity (but ``dressed'' by the condensate profile) and the second to the ``skewness'' of the configurations. The bound is saturated by configurations that satisfy a system of two first-order partial differential equations. When such a BPS system is satisfied, the Gross-Pitaevskii equations are also satisfied. The analytic solutions of this BPS system in the present manuscript represent configurations with fractional vorticity living in an annulus. Using these techniques, we present the first analytic examples of this kind. The hydrodynamical interpretation of the BPS system is discussed, and the implications of these results are outlined.</description>

      <title>Three family supersymmetric Pati-Salam model from rigid intersecting D6-branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08590v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct, for the first time, a three-family $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam model from rigid intersecting D6-branes on a factorizable $\mathbb{T}^6/(\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2')$ orientifold with discrete torsion. The factorizable geometry allows for explicit control over rigid cycles and moduli stabilization. We can break the Pati-Salam gauge symmetry down to the Standard Model (SM) gauge symmetry via the supersymmetry preserving Higgs mechanism, generate the SM fermion masses and mixings, and break the supersymmetry via gaugino condensations in the hidden sector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-energy nuclear collisions has recently emerged as a powerful ``imaging-by-smashing'' tool to reveal the global shapes of atomic nuclei. Here, I layout a conceptual framework for this technique, explaining how nuclear shapes are encoded during quark-gluon plasma formation and evolution, and how they can be decoded from final-state particle distributions. I highlight the method's potential to advance our understanding of both nuclear structure and quark-gluon plasma physics.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of strongly magnetized dense quark matter from hard dense loop perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the hard dense loop perturbation theory approach for studying the thermodynamics of strongly magnetized dense quark matter. The free energy of quarks and gluons have been calculated for one-loop quark and gluon self-energies, respectively. The longitudinal and transverse components of pressure, magnetization, second-order quark number susceptibility, and speed of sound have been computed, and their behavior with chemical potential and magnetic field has been analyzed. Our numerical results show that the longitudinal pressure increases with chemical potential and magnetic field, while for the transverse component, it is diminished. We also analyze the longitudinal component of the speed of sound at high chemical potentials, which approaches the speed of light in the asymptotic limit. The obtained results may be helpful in studying magnetized quark matter in the core of neutron stars and magnetars.</description>

      <title>How Much NEC Breaking Can the Universe Endure?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum fields can notoriously violate the null energy condition (NEC). In a cosmological context, NEC violation can lead to, e.g., dark energy at late times with an equation-of-state parameter smaller than $-1$ and nonsingular bounces at early times. However, it is expected that there should still be a limit in semiclasssical gravity to how much `negative energy' can accumulate over time and in space as a result of quantum effects. In the course of formulating quantum-motivated energy conditions, the smeared null energy condition has emerged as a recent proposal. This condition conjectures the existence of a semilocal bound on negative energy along null geodesics, which is expected to hold in semiclassical gravity. In this work, we show how the smeared null energy condition translates into theoretical constraints on NEC-violating cosmologies. Specifically, we derive the implied bounds on dark energy equation-of-state parameters and an inequality between the duration of a bouncing phase and the growth rate of the Hubble parameter at the bounce. In the case of dark energy, we identify the parameter space over which the smeared null energy condition is consistent with the recent constraints from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI).</description>

      <title>Separating non-collective effects in d-Au collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we present the multiplicity and yields of charged hadrons and particle ratios in d-Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}= 200$ GeV using the PYTHIA8/Angantyr. The model reproduces the multiplicity ($N_{ch}$) and pseudo-rapidity distribution reasonably well in minimum-biased d-Au collisions without assuming the formation of a thermalized medium. The invariant yield from Angantyr underpredicts the data in central collisions. We discussed the similarity between the nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ and data/MC from Angantyr and the possibility of using it as an alternative to check in-medium effects. The data/MC suggests that the central d-Au collisions exhibit signals like baryon enhancement, but no high $p_T$ suppression was found. The d-Au collisions have a much smaller invariant yield than the thermal model calculation for similar $N_{part}$. Based on the available data and simulation results, we argue that a medium may form in the central d-Au collision, but it differs from the perfect QGP formed in Pb-Pb collisions at LHC.</description>

      <title>Identifying $\alpha$-cluster configurations in $^{20}$Ne via ultracentral Ne+Ne Collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The initial-state geometry in relativistic heavy-ion collisions provides a novel probe to nuclear cluster structure. For $^{20}$Ne, a novel approach is proposed to distinguish between the cluster configurations (5$\alpha$ versus $\alpha + ^{16}$O) in order to gain insight into nuclear structure transitions governed by many-body quantum correlations. Through the microscopic Brink model, we establish the normalized symmetric cumulant NSC (3, 2) and the Pearson coefficient $\rho (\varepsilon_{3}^{2},\ \delta d_{\perp})$ as quantitative discriminators to reveal enhanced cluster degrees of freedom in the ground state of $^{20}$Ne. The upcoming ultracentral Ne+Ne collisions at the LHC can experimentally identify these two competing configurations via these flow correlation observables, opening a new paradigm for probing clustering in light nuclei.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the global multiplicity and spectral shape fluctuations in radial flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radial flow is a key collective phenomenon in heavy-ion collisions, manifests through event-by-event fluctuations in transverse momentum ($p_{\mathrm{T}}$) spectra. The $p_{\mathrm{T}}$-differential radial flow, $v_0(p_{\mathrm{T}})$, initially conceived to capture local spectral shape fluctuations, is influenced by global multiplicity fluctuations. Using the HIJING model, we explore how different definitions of event activity for centrality and spectral normalization schemes affect $v_0(p_{\mathrm{T}})$. We find these methodological variations induce a constant offset in $v_0(p_{\mathrm{T}})$ without altering its shape, indicating that the dynamic $p_{\mathrm{T}}$-differential information on radial flow remains robust, but its absolute magnitude is meaningful only up to a baseline offset dictated by global multiplicity fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Revealing the nature of ultra-long period objects with space-based gravitational-wave interferometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A few members of the recently-discovered class of ultra-long period objects have been identified as binaries with white-dwarf primaries. In most cases however, electromagnetic data are inconclusive and isolated magnetars or compact binaries remain viable. If the pulsation period matches that of the orbit though -- as is the case for ILT J1101+5521 and GLEAM-X J0704-37 -- some of these elusive radio transients could be gravitational-wave bright in the mHz band. Space-based interferometers could thus be used to provide independent constraints on their nature. We quantify the signal-to-noise ratio for the known systems, under a variety of scenarios, and show that a few could be detectable for sufficiently large chirp masses. Astrophysical implications for (non-)detections are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that dark matter interactions can profoundly influence stellar nucleosynthesis in the early universe by altering thermodynamic gradients and modifying nuclear reaction rates within primordial stars. Incorporating a dark matter-modified Fermi-Dirac distribution and accounting for localized energy injection from annihilation heating, our model predicts enhanced production of carbon and nitrogen alongside reduced oxygen synthesis. These compositional shifts significantly reshape stellar structure and produce synthetic spectra that closely reproduce the observed characteristics of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars. Our findings reveal a direct and previously overlooked role of dark matter in driving the chemical evolution of the early cosmos, offering a plausible link between fundamental particle physics and observable astrophysical signatures.</description>

      <title>Accurately simulating core-collapse self-interacting dark matter halos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The properties of satellite halos provide a promising probe for dark matter (DM) physics. Observations motivate current efforts to explain surprisingly compact DM halos. If DM is not collisionless but has strong self-interactions, halos can undergo gravothermal collapse, leading to higher densities in the central region of the halo. However, it is challenging to model this collapse phase from first principles. To improve on this, we seek to better understand numerical challenges and convergence properties of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) N-body simulations in the collapse phase. Especially we aim for a better understanding of the evolution of satellite halos. To do so, we run SIDM N-body simulations of a low mass halo in isolation and within an external gravitational potential. The simulation setup is motivated by the perturber of the stellar stream GD-1. We find that the halo evolution is very sensitive to energy conservation errors, and a too large SIDM kernel size can artificially speed up the collapse. Moreover, we demonstrate that the King model can describe the density profile at small radii for the late stages that we have simulated. Furthermore, for our highest-resolved simulation (N = 5x10^7) we make the data public. It can serve as a benchmark. Overall, we find that the current numerical methods do not suffer from convergence problems in the late collapse phase and provide guidance on how to choose numerical parameters, e.g. that the energy conservation error is better kept well below 1%. This allows to run simulations of halos becoming concentrated enough to explain observations of GD-1 like stellar streams or strong gravitational lensing systems.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of black and white holes in ensemble of Planckons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13145v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Tsallis-Cirto non-extensive statistics with $\delta=2$ describes the processes of splitting and merging of black holes and their thermodynamics. Here we consider a toy model, which matches this generalized statistics and extends it by providing the integer valued entropy of the black hole, $S_{\rm BH}(N)=N(N-1)/2$. In this model the black hole consists of $N$ the so-called Planckons -- objects with reduced Planck mass $m_{\rm P}=1/\sqrt{8\pi G}$ -- so that its mass is quantized, $M=Nm_{\rm P}$. The entropy of each Planckon is zero, but the entropy of black hole with $N$ Planckons is provided by the $N(N-1)/2$ degrees of freedom -- the correlations between the gravitationally attracted Planckons. This toy model can be extended to a charged Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black hole, which consists of charged Planckons. Despite the charge, the statistical ensemble of Planckons remains the same, and the RN black hole with $N$ Planckons has the same entropy as the electrically neutral hole, $S_{\rm RNBH}(N)=N(N-1)/2$. This is supported by the adiabatic process of transformation from the RN to Schwarzschild black hole by varying the fine structure constant. The adiabaticity is violated in the extreme limit, when the gravitational interaction between two Planckons is compensated by the repulsion between their electric charges, and the RN black hole loses stability. The entropy of a white hole formed by the same $N$ Planckons has negative entropy, $S_{\rm WH}(N)=-N(N-1)/2$.</description>

      <title>What new physics can we extract from inflation using the ACT DR6 and DESI DR2 Observations?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of inflationary models in light of projected sensitivities from forthcoming CMB and gravitational wave experiments, incorporating data from recent ACT DR6, DESI DR2, CMB-S4, LiteBIRD, and SPHEREx. Focusing on precise predictions in the $(n_s, \alpha_s, \beta_s)$ parameter space, we evaluate a broad class of inflationary scenarios -- including canonical single-field models, non-minimally coupled theories, and string-inspired constructions such as Starobinsky, Higgs, Hilltop, $\alpha$-attractors, and D-brane models. Our results show that next-generation observations will sharply constrain the scale dependence of the scalar power spectrum, elevating $\alpha_s$ and $\beta_s$ as key discriminants between large-field and small-field dynamics. Strikingly, several widely studied models -- such as quartic Hilltop inflation and specific DBI variants -- are forecast to be excluded at high significance. We further demonstrate that the combined measurement of $\beta_s$ and the field excursion $\Delta\phi$ offers a novel diagnostic of kinetic structure and UV sensitivity. These findings underscore the power of upcoming precision cosmology to probe the microphysical origin of inflation and decisively test broad classes of theoretical models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the monodromy group of the differential systems for multiloop integrals. We describe a simple heuristic method to obtain the monodromy matrices as functions of space-time dimension $d$. We observe that in a special basis the elements of these matrices are Laurent polynomials in $z=\exp(i\pi d)$ with integer coefficients, i.e., the monodromy group is a subgroup of $GL(n,\mathbb{Z}[z,1/z])$. We derive bilinear relations for monodromies in $d$ and $-d$ dimensions which follow from the twisted Riemann bilinear relations and check that the found monodromy matrices satisfy them.</description>

      <title>Precise Measurement of the $\Lambda$ Electric Dipole Moment through the Entangled Strange Baryon-Antibaryon System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dominance of matter over antimatter in the universe has consistently driven the pursuit of new physics beyond the Standard Model that violates charge-parity symmetry. Unlike the well-constrained electrons and neutrons, strange baryons (hyperons) remain a largely unexplored territory, in which interactions between hyperons and particles from new physics could induce a non-trivial electric dipole moment (EDM). However, direct measurements of hyperon EDMs through spin precession are highly challenging due to their short lifetimes. In this paper, we present a novel method to extract the EDM of the lightest hyperon, $\Lambda$, using the entangled $\Lambda$$\overline{\Lambda}$ system. Our result is consistent with zero, achieving a three-order-of-magnitude improvement over the previous upper limit established in the 1980s with comparable statistics, providing stringent constraints on potential new physics.</description>

Abstract: This Ph.D. thesis investigates effective field and string theories in which supersymmetry is realized and broken in various ways. Chapter 1 addresses effective theories with nonlinearly realized supersymmetry, constructed using the formalism of constrained superfields. We establish a criterion for identifying inconsistent constraints, formulate their improved versions, and propose, along these lines, improved supergravity models of inflation. In Chapter 2, we discuss a peculiar application of this framework: the gravitational production of massive gravitinos in time-dependent backgrounds. We emphasize some physical subtleties in the standard description of this mechanism, which become particularly severe in the case of the gravitino. Next, the focus shifts to linear supersymmetry, and we investigate the leading-order coupling of the massive spin-2 field supermultiplet to pure supergravity in four dimensions. This analysis is carried out using the supercurrent superfield formalism, and it shows that only a single class of such couplings can be consistently defined. This is fundamentally distinct from the coupling obtained by compactifying higher-dimensional supergravities, and it has interesting connections to string theory and the string lamppost principle. Finally, in Chapter 3, we present a novel orientifold projection of type IIB string theory. This is a Scherk--Schwarz orientifold in which supersymmetry is entirely broken, and the O-planes couple only to the twisted sector of the theory. We argue that this model is invariant under S-duality and can be formulated as an F-theory compactification. We also analyze the D-brane spectrum of the theory and compare the results with earlier similar constructions. All original findings presented in this thesis are preceded by a comprehensive and detailed introduction to the general frameworks to which they belong.</description>
