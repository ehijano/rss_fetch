      <title>Archean Methane Cycling and Life's Co-Evolution: Intertwining Early Biogeochemical Processes and Ancient Microbial Metabolism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter explores the key carbon compounds that shaped the Archean biogeochemical cycle, delineating their substantial impact on Earth's primordial atmospheric and biospheric evolution. At the heart of the Archean carbon cycle were carbon dioxide and methane, which served as key regulators of Earth's early climate. Particular emphasis is placed on methane cycling, encompassing both abiotic methane production and consumption, as well as their biotic counterparts-methanogenesis and methanotrophy. These ancient microbial pathways not only shaped methane fluxes but were also tightly interwoven with Earth's evolving redox state. We provide a comprehensive exploration of the intertwined evolution of Earth's geochemical environment and microbial life. The interdisciplinary approach of this chapter not only sheds light on the complex dynamics of Earth's early methane cycling but also offers critical insights that could inform the search for life beyond our planet, thereby marking a contribution to Earth sciences, astrobiology, and related fields.</description>

      <title>Reconciled warning signals in observations and models imply approaching AMOC tipping point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Paleoclimate proxy records and models suggest that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) can transition abruptly between a strong and a weak state. Empirical warning signals in observational fingerprints indeed suggest a stability decline and raise concerns that the system may be approaching a tipping point. However, state-of-the-art Earth System Models (ESMs) do not consistently show such a stability loss, hence inconclusive in their projections of AMOC collapse under global warming. It remains unclear whether warning signals of AMOC tipping are overlooked in ESMs or overinterpreted in observations, calling for further investigations of AMOC stability. Here, based on the concept of critical slowing down, AMOC stability decline that can be interpreted as a warning signal of AMOC tipping is identified in the eastern SPNA in both observations and ESMs. This warning signal is in accordance with a physical indicator of AMOC stability, AMOC-induced freshwater convergence into the Atlantic basin. The observed signal can be reconciled with the modeled one only under warming exceeding the Paris Agreement goal, suggesting that AMOC stability is overestimated in ESMs. Our results suggest that the observed AMOC may indeed be losing stability and could thus reach a tipping point much earlier than state-of-the-art ESMs suggest.</description>

      <title>Improved calculation of the second-order ocean Doppler spectrum for sea state inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04991v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe and exploit a reformulation, based on a recently-introduced change of variables, of the double integral that describes the second-order ocean Doppler spectrum measured by High-Frequency radars. We show that this alternative expression, which was primarily designed for improving the numerical inversion of the ocean wave spectrum, is also advantageous for the analytical inversion of the main sea state parameters. To this end, we revisit Barrick's method for the estimation of the significant wave height and the mean period from the ocean Doppler spectrum. On the basis of numerical simulations we show that a better estimation of these parameters can be achieved which necessitates a preliminary bias correction that depends only on the radar frequency. A second consequence of this improved formulation is the derivation of a simple yet analytical nonlinear approximation of the second-order ocean Doppler spectrum when the Doppler frequency is larger than the Bragg frequency. This opens up new perspectives for the inversion of directional wave spectra from High-Frequency radar measurements.</description>

      <title>HF radar estimation of ocean wave parameters: second-order Doppler spectrum versus Bragg wave modulation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07658v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an original technique for the HF radar estimation of the main sea state parameters by exploiting the amplitude modulation of the radar signal time series. While the classical method for ocean wave measurement is based on the second-order ocean Doppler spectrum, this alternative approach uses the slow amplitude modulation of the Bragg wave in the radar signal. Using a nearby buoy and the WWIII model as ground truth, we apply this method to an annual set of HF radar data in the vicinity of Toulon (Mediterranean coast of France) and compare it with \col{the classical formulas proposed by Barrick (1977) to derive the main wave parameters from the Doppler spectrum. Although the modulation approach is physically attractive and easier to implement, we find that the Doppler spectrum-based method is far superior at this stage in calculating the significant wave height and the peak wave frequency, even at long range.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-based Denoising of Surface Solar Irradiance simulated with Monte Carlo Ray Tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating radiative transfer in the atmosphere with Monte Carlo ray tracing provides realistic surface irradiance in cloud-resolving models. However, Monte Carlo methods are computationally expensive because large sampling budgets are required to obtain sufficient convergence. Here, we explore the use of machine learning for denoising direct and diffuse surface solar irradiance fields. We use Monte Carlo ray tracing to compute pairs of noisy and well-converged surface irradiance fields for an ensemble of cumulus cloud fields and solar angles, and train a denoising autoencoder to predict the well-converged irradiance fields from the noisy input. We demonstrate that denoising diffuse irradiance from 1 sample per pixel (per spectral quadrature point) is an order of magnitude faster and twice as accurate as ray tracing with 128 samples per pixel, illustrating the advantage of denoising over larger sampling budgets. Denoising of direct irradiance is effective in sunlit areas, while errors persist on the edges of cloud shadows. For diffuse irradiance, providing additional atmospheric information such as liquid water paths and solar angles to train the denoising algorithm reduces errors by approximately a factor of two. Our results open up possibilities for coupled Monte Carlo ray tracing with computational costs approaching those of two-stream-based radiative transfer solvers, although future work is needed to improve generalization across resolutions and cloud types.</description>

      <title>Smoothing and spatial verification of global fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00936v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Forecast verification plays a crucial role in the development cycle of operational numerical weather prediction models. At the same time, verification remains a challenge as the traditionally used non-spatial forecast quality metrics exhibit certain drawbacks, with new spatial metrics being developed to address these problems. Some of these new metrics are based on smoothing, with one example being the widely used Fraction Skill Score (FSS) and its many derivatives. However, while the FSS has been used by many researchers in limited area domains, there are, as of yet, no examples of it being used in a global domain. The issue is due to the increased computational complexity of smoothing in a global domain, with its inherent spherical geometry and non-equidistant and/or irregular grids. At the same time, there clearly exists a need for spatial metrics that could be used in the global domain as the operational global models continue to be developed and improved along with the new machine-learning-based models. Here, we present two new methodologies for smoothing in a global domain that are potentially fast enough to make the smoothing of high-resolution global fields feasible. Both approaches also consider the variability of grid point area sizes and can handle missing data appropriately. This, in turn, makes the calculation of smoothing-based metrics, such as FSS and its derivatives, in a global domain possible, which we demonstrate by evaluating the performance of operational high-resolution global precipitation forecasts provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Seasonal Climate Predictions via Variational Inference and Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most operational climate services providers base their seasonal predictions on initialised general circulation models (GCMs) or statistical techniques that fit past observations. GCMs require substantial computational resources, which limits their capacity. In contrast, statistical methods often lack robustness due to short historical records. Recent works propose machine learning methods trained on climate model output, leveraging larger sample sizes and simulated scenarios. Yet, many of these studies focus on prediction tasks that might be restricted in spatial extent or temporal coverage, opening a gap with existing operational predictions. Thus, the present study evaluates the effectiveness of a methodology that combines variational inference with transformer models to predict fields of seasonal anomalies. The predictions cover all four seasons and are initialised one month before the start of each season. The model was trained on climate model output from CMIP6 and tested using ERA5 reanalysis data. We analyse the method's performance in predicting interannual anomalies beyond the climate change-induced trend. We also test the proposed methodology in a regional context with a use case focused on Europe. While climate change trends dominate the skill of temperature predictions, the method presents additional skill over the climatological forecast in regions influenced by known teleconnections. We reach similar conclusions based on the validation of precipitation predictions. Despite underperforming SEAS5 in most tropics, our model offers added value in numerous extratropical inland regions. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of training generative models on climate model output for seasonal predictions, providing skilful predictions beyond the induced climate change trend at time scales and lead times relevant for user applications.</description>

      <title>Tackling the Accuracy-Interpretability Trade-off in a Hierarchy of Machine Learning Models for the Prediction of Extreme Heatwaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When performing predictions that use Machine Learning (ML), we are mainly interested in performance and interpretability. This generates a natural trade-off, where complex models generally have higher skills but are harder to explain and thus trust. Interpretability is particularly important in the climate community, where we aim at gaining a physical understanding of the underlying phenomena. Even more so when the prediction concerns extreme weather events with high impact on society. In this paper, we perform probabilistic forecasts of extreme heatwaves over France, using a hierarchy of increasingly complex ML models, which allows us to find the best compromise between accuracy and interpretability. More precisely, we use models that range from a global Gaussian Approximation (GA) to deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with the intermediate steps of a simple Intrinsically Interpretable Neural Network (IINN) and a model using the Scattering Transform (ScatNet). Our findings reveal that CNNs provide higher accuracy, but their black-box nature severely limits interpretability, even when using state-of-the-art Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) tools. In contrast, ScatNet achieves similar performance to CNNs while providing greater transparency, identifying key scales and patterns in the data that drive predictions. This study underscores the potential of interpretability in ML models for climate science, demonstrating that simpler models can rival the performance of their more complex counterparts, all the while being much easier to understand. This gained interpretability is crucial for building trust in model predictions and uncovering new scientific insights, ultimately advancing our understanding and management of extreme weather events.</description>
