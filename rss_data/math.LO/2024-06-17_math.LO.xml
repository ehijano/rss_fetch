      <title>A general theory of iterated forcing using finitely additive measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the work of Shelah, Kellner, and T\u{a}nasie (Fund. Math., 166(1-2):109-136, 2000 and Comment. Math. Univ. Carolin., 60(1):61-95, 2019), and the recent developments in the third author's master's thesis, we develop a general theory of iterated forcing using finitely additive measures. For this purpose, we introduce two new notions: on the one hand, we define a new linkedness property, called $\mu$-$\mathrm{FAM}$-linked and, on the other hand, we generalize the notion of intersection number to forcing notions, which justifies the limit steps of our iteration theory. Our theory also generalizes iterations with ultrafilters, which have played an important role in the proof of the consistency of Cicho\'n's maximum.
  We further show that any iteration constructed with our general theory preserves strong unbounded families and what we call \emph{anti-Bendixson families}, which play a central role in preserving witnesses of $\mathrm{cov}(\mathcal{N})$ of singular size (even of countable cofinality). Finally, we apply our theory to prove the consistency of a new separation of the left-hand side of Cicho\'n's diagram where $\mathrm{cov}(\mathcal{N})$ is possibly singular, even with countable cofinality.</description>

      <title>Goldblat-Thomason Theorems for Fundamental (Modal) Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holliday recently introduced a non-classical logic called Fundamental Logic, which intends to capture exactly those properties of the connectives "and", "or" and "not" that hold in virtue of their introduction and elimination rules in Fitch's natural deduction system for propositional logic. Holliday provides an intuitive relational semantics for fundamental logic which generalizes both Goldblatt's semantics for orthologic and Kripke semantics for intuitionistic logic. In this paper, we further the analysis of this semantics by providing a Goldblatt-Thomason theorem for Fundamental Logic. We identify necessary and sufficient conditions on a class K of fundamental frames for it to be axiomatic, i.e., to be the class of frames satisfying some logic extending Fundamental Logic. As a straightforward application of our main result, we also obtain a Goldblatt-Thomason theorem for Fundamental Modal Logic, which extends Fundamental Logic with standard Box and Diamond operators.</description>

      <title>Consistent Update Synthesis via Privatized Beliefs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kripke models are an effective and widely used tool for representing epistemic attitudes of agents in multi-agent systems, including distributed systems. Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL) adds communication in the form of model transforming updates. Private communication is key in distributed systems as processes exchanging (potentially corrupted) information about their private local state should not be detectable by any other processes. This focus on privacy clashes with the standard DEL assumption for which updates are applied to the whole Kripke model, which is usually commonly known by all agents, potentially leading to information leakage. In addition, a commonly known model cannot minimize the corruption of agents' local states due to fault information dissemination. The contribution of this paper is twofold: (I) To represent leak-free agent-to-agent communication, we introduce a way to synthesize an action model which stratifies a pointed Kripke model into private agent-clusters, each representing the local knowledge of the processes: Given a goal formula $\varphi$ representing the effect of private communication, we provide a procedure to construct an action model that (a) makes the goal formula true, (b) maintain consistency of agents' beliefs, if possible, without causing "unrelated" beliefs (minimal change) thus minimizing the corruption of local states in case of inconsistent information. (II) We introduce a new operation between pointed Kripke models and pointed action models called pointed updates which, unlike the product update operation of DEL, maintain only the subset of the world-event pairs that are reachable from the point, without unnecessarily blowing up the model size.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of the big Ramsey degrees of the generic partial order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10088v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a result of 33 intercontinental Zoom calls, we characterise big Ramsey degrees of the generic partial order. This is an infinitary extension of the well known fact that finite partial orders endowed with linear extensions form a Ramsey class (this result was announced by Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and R\"odl in 1984 with first published proof by Paoli, Trotter and Walker in 1985). Towards this, we refine earlier upper bounds obtained by Hubi\v{c}ka based on a new connection of big Ramsey degrees to the Carlson-Simpson theorem and we also introduce a new technique of giving lower bounds using an iterated application of the upper-bound theorem.</description>

      <title>A finitely presented group with transcendental spectral radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide examples of groups with transcendental spectral radius. The proofs relies on links between decidability of the Word Problem and semi-computability of the spectral radius, and on classical small-cancellation theory.</description>
