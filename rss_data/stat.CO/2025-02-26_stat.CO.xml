      <title>Learning Density Evolution from Snapshot Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by learning dynamical structures from static snapshot data, this paper presents a distribution-on-scalar regression approach for estimating the density evolution of a stochastic process from its noisy temporal point clouds. We propose an entropy-regularized nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator (E-NPMLE), which leverages the entropic optimal transport as a smoothing regularizer for the density flow. We show that the E-NPMLE has almost dimension-free statistical rates of convergence to the ground truth distributions, which exhibit a striking phase transition phenomenon in terms of the number of snapshots and per-snapshot sample size. To efficiently compute the E-NPMLE, we design a novel particle-based and grid-free coordinate KL divergence gradient descent (CKLGD) algorithm and prove its polynomial iteration complexity. Moreover, we provide numerical evidence on synthetic data to support our theoretical findings. This work contributes to the theoretical understanding and practical computation of estimating density evolution from noisy observations in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>Geometry and factorization of multivariate Markov chains with applications to the swapping algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12589v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the factorizability and geometry of transition matrices of multivariate Markov chains. Specifically, we demonstrate that the induced chains on factors of a product space can be regarded as information projections with respect to the Kullback-Leibler divergence. This perspective yields Han-Shearer type inequalities and submodularity of the entropy rate of Markov chains, as well as applications in the context of large deviations and mixing time comparison. As a concrete algorithmic application, we introduce a projection sampler based on the swapping algorithm, which resamples the highest-temperature coordinate at stationarity at each step. We prove that such practice accelerates the mixing time by multiplicative factors related to the number of temperatures and the dimension of the underlying state space when compared with the original swapping algorithm.</description>

      <title>Learned Reference-based Diffusion Sampling for multi-modal distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past few years, several approaches utilizing score-based diffusion have been proposed to sample from probability distributions, that is without having access to exact samples and relying solely on evaluations of unnormalized densities. The resulting samplers approximate the time-reversal of a noising diffusion process, bridging the target distribution to an easy-to-sample base distribution. In practice, the performance of these methods heavily depends on key hyperparameters that require ground truth samples to be accurately tuned. Our work aims to highlight and address this fundamental issue, focusing in particular on multi-modal distributions, which pose significant challenges for existing sampling methods. Building on existing approaches, we introduce Learned Reference-based Diffusion Sampler (LRDS), a methodology specifically designed to leverage prior knowledge on the location of the target modes in order to bypass the obstacle of hyperparameter tuning. LRDS proceeds in two steps by (i) learning a reference diffusion model on samples located in high-density space regions and tailored for multimodality, and (ii) using this reference model to foster the training of a diffusion-based sampler. We experimentally demonstrate that LRDS best exploits prior knowledge on the target distribution compared to competing algorithms on a variety of challenging distributions.</description>

      <title>A partial likelihood approach to tree-based density modeling and its application in Bayesian inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11692v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tree-based priors for probability distributions are usually specified using a predetermined, data-independent collection of candidate recursive partitions of the sample space. To characterize an unknown target density in detail over the entire sample space, candidate partitions must have the capacity to expand deeply into all areas of the sample space with potential non-zero sampling probability. Such an expansive system of partitions often incurs prohibitive computational costs and makes inference prone to overfitting, especially in regions with little probability mass. Thus, existing models typically make a compromise and rely on relatively shallow trees. This hampers one of the most desirable features of trees, their ability to characterize local features, and results in reduced statistical efficiency. Traditional wisdom suggests that this compromise is inevitable to ensure coherent likelihood-based reasoning in Bayesian inference, as a data-dependent partition system that allows deeper expansion only in regions with more observations would induce double dipping of the data. We propose a simple strategy to restore coherency while allowing the candidate partitions to be data-dependent, using Cox's partial likelihood. Our partial likelihood approach is broadly applicable to existing likelihood-based methods and, in particular, to Bayesian inference on tree-based models. We give examples in density estimation in which the partial likelihood is endowed with existing priors on tree-based models and compare with the standard, full-likelihood approach. The results show substantial gains in estimation accuracy and computational efficiency from adopting the partial likelihood.</description>
