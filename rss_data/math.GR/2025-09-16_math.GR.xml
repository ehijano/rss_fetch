      <title>On cardinalities whose arithmetical properties determine the structure of solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to provide purely arithmetical characterisations of those natural numbers $n$ for which every non-degenerate set-theoretic solution of cardinality $n$ of the Yang--Baxter equation arising from a skew brace (sb-solution for short) satisfies some relevant properties, such as being a flip or being involutive. For example, it turns out that every sb-solution of cardinality $n$ has finite multipermutation level if and only if its prime factorisation $n= p_1^{\alpha_1} \ldots p_t^{\alpha_t}$ is cube-free, namely $\alpha_i\leq 2$ for every $i$, and $p_i$ does not divide $p_j^{\alpha_j}-1$ for $i\neq j$. Two novel constructions of skew braces will play a central role in our proofs.
  We shall also introduce the notion of supersoluble solution and show how this concept is related to that of supersoluble skew brace. In doing so, we have spotted an irreparable mistake in the proof of Theorem C [Ballester-Bolinches et al., Adv. Math. 455 (2024)], which characterizes soluble solutions in terms of soluble skew braces.</description>

      <title>Ancona inequalities along generic geodesic rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents several versions of the Ancona inequality for finitely supported, irreducible random walks on non-amenable groups. We first study a class of Morse subsets with narrow points and prove the Ancona inequality around these points in any finitely generated non-amenable group. This result implies the inequality along all Morse geodesics and recovers the known case for relatively hyperbolic groups.
  We then consider any geometric action of a non-amenable group with contracting elements. For such groups, we construct a class of generic geodesic rays, termed proportionally contracting rays, and establish the Ancona inequality along a sequence of good points. This leads to an embedding of a full-measure subset of the horofunction boundary into the minimal Martin boundary.
  A stronger Ancona inequality is established for groups acting geometrically on an irreducible CAT(0) cube complex with a Morse hyperplane. In this setting, we show that the orbital maps extend continuously to a partial boundary map from a full-measure subset of the Roller boundary into the minimal Martin boundary. Finally, we provide explicit examples, including right-angled Coxeter groups (RACGs) defined by an irreducible graph with at least one vertex not belonging to any induced 4-cycle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a semigroup construction generalising the two-sided wreath product. We develop the foundations of this construction and show that for groups it is isomorphic to the usual wreath product. We also show that it gives a slightly finer version of the decomposition in the Krohn-Rhodes Theorem, in which the three-element flip-flop monoid is replaced by the two-element semilattice.</description>

      <title>The double cone group is isomorphic to the archipelago group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the conjecture of James W. Cannon and Gregory R. Conner that the fundamental group of the Griffiths double cone space is isomorphic to that of the harmonic archipelago. From this and earlier work in this area, we conclude that the isomorphism class of these groups is quite large and includes groups with a great variety of descriptions.</description>

      <title>Computable Folner sequences of amenable groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper considers computable Folner sequences in computably enumerable amenable groups. We extend some basic results of M. Cavaleri on existence of such sequences to the case of groups where finite generation is not assumed. We also initiate some new directions in this topic, for example complexity of families of effective Folner sequences. Possible extensions of this approach to metric groups are also discussed.
  This paper also contains some unpublished results from the paper of the first author arXiv:1904.02640.</description>

      <title>Non-split sharply 2-transitive groups of bounded exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11958v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct here the first known examples of non-split sharply 2-transitive groups of bounded exponent in odd positive characteristic for every large enough prime $p \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$. In fact, we show that there are countably many pairwise non-isomorphic countable non-split sharply 2-transitive groups of characteristic $p$ for each such $p$. Furthermore, we construct non-periodic non-split sharply 2-transitive groups (of these same characteristics) with centralizers of involutions of bounded exponent. As a consequence of these results, we answer two open questions about sharply 2-transitive and 2-transitive permutation groups. The constructions of groups as announced rely on iteratively applying (geometric) small cancellation methods in the presence of involutions. To that end, we develop a method to control some small cancellation parameters in the presence of even-order torsion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every finitely generated residually finite group $G$ can be embedded in a finitely generated branch group $\Gamma$ such that two elements in $G$ are conjugate in $G$ if and only if they are conjugate in $\Gamma$. As an application we construct a finitely generated branch group with solvable word problem and unsolvable conjugacy problem and thereby answer a question of Bartholdi, Grigorchuk, and \v{S}uni\'{k}.</description>

      <title>Amenability, Optimal Transport and Abstract Ergodic Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using tools from the theory of optimal transport, we establish several results concerning isometric actions of amenable topological groups with potentially unbounded orbits. Specifically, suppose $d$ is a compatible left-invariant metric on an amenable topological group $G$ with no non-trivial homomorphisms to $\mathbb R$. Then, for every finite subset $E\subseteq G$ and $\epsilon&gt;0$, there is a finitely supported probability measure $\beta$ on $G$ such that $$ \max_{g,h\in E}\, {\sf W}(\beta g, \beta h)&lt;\epsilon, $$ where ${\sf W}$ denotes the Wasserstein distance between probability measures on the metric space $(G,d)$. When $d$ is the word metric on a finitely generated group $G$, this strengthens a well known theorem of Reiter and, when $d$ is bounded, recovers a result of Schneider and Thom. Furthermore, when $G$ is locally compact, $\beta$ may be replaced by an appropriate probability density $f\in L^1(G)$.
  Also, when $G\curvearrowright X$ is a continuous isometric action on a metric space, the space of Lipschitz functions on the quotient $X/\!\!/G$ is isometrically isomorphic to a $1$-complemented subspace of the Lipschitz functions on $X$. And, when additionally $G$ is skew-amenable, there is a $G$-invariant contraction $$ \mathfrak {Lip}\, X \overset S\longrightarrow\mathfrak{Lip}(X/\!\!/G) $$ so that $(S\phi\big)\big(\overline{Gx}\big)=\phi(x)$ whenever $\phi$ is constant on every orbit of $G\curvearrowright X$. This latter extends results of Cuth and Doucha from the setting of locally compact or balanced groups.</description>

      <title>Chabauty limits of fixed point groups of $p$-adic involutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Chabauty limits of the fixed-point group of $k$-points $H_k$ associated with an involutive $k$-automorphism $\theta$ of a connected linear reductive group $G$ defined over a non-Archimedean local field $k$ of characteristic zero. Leveraging the geometry of the Bruhat--Tits building, the structure of $(\theta,k)$-split tori, and the $K\mathcal{B}_kH_k$ decomposition of $G_k$, we establish that any nontrivial Chabauty limit $L$ of $H_k$ is $G_k$-conjugate to a subgroup of $$U_{\sigma_+}(k) \rtimes (Ker(\alpha)^0 \cdot (H_k \cap M_{\sigma_{\pm}})) \leq P_{\sigma_+}(k),$$ where $\alpha$ is a projection map arising from a Levi factor $M_{\sigma_{\pm}}$ of a parabolic subgroup $P_{\sigma_+} \subset G$, and $Ker(\alpha)^0$ denotes the subgroup of elliptic elements in the kernel of $\alpha$. Our analysis distinguishes between elliptic and hyperbolic elements and constructs explicit unipotent elements in the limit group $L$ using the Moufang property of $G_k$. Furthermore, we show that $L$ acts transitively on the set of ideal simplices opposite to $\sigma_+$. These results yield a detailed description of the Chabauty compactification of $H_k$, and provide new insights into its interaction with the non-Archimedean geometry of $G_k$.</description>

      <title>Permutahedron Triangulations via Total Linear Stability and the Dual Braid Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For each finite Coxeter group $W$ and each standard Coxeter element of $W$, we construct a triangulation of the $W$-permutahedron. For particular realizations of the $W$-permutahedron, we show that this is a regular triangulation induced by a height function coming from the theory of total linear stability for Dynkin quivers. We also explore several notable combinatorial properties of these triangulations that relate the Bruhat order, the noncrossing partition lattice, and Cambrian congruences. Each triangulation gives an explicit mechanism for relating two different presentations of the corresponding braid group (the standard Artin presentation and Bessis's dual presentation). This is a step toward uniformly proving conjectural simple, explicit, and type-uniform presentations for the corresponding pure braid group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These notes give a short introduction to finite Coxeter groups, their classification, and some parts of their representation theory, with a focus on the infinite families. They are based on lectures delivered by the author at the conferences Recent Trends in Group Theory at IIT Bhubaneswar and the Asian - European School in Mathematics at NEHU, Shillong. The first draft was prepared by Archita Gupta (IIT Kanpur) and Sahanawaz Sabnam (NISER Bhubaneswar), to whom the author is deeply grateful. We hope these notes will be useful both for beginners and for readers who wish to study the subject further. The author also thanks the organizers and participants of the above conferences for their support and encouragement.</description>

      <title>The List-distinguishing chromatic number of graphs containing only small complete bigraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2006, Collins and Trenk obtained a general sharp upper bound for the distinguishing chromatic number of a connected graph. Inspired by Catlin's combinatorial techniques from 1978, we establish improved upper bounds for classes of connected graphs that have only small complete bigraphs as induced subgraphs. In this framework, we also consider the list-distinguishing chromatic number of such graphs.
  We apply Menger's theorem to demonstrate applications of our main result for graphs whose constructions are based on Paley graphs, Cayley graphs on Dihedral groups, and circulant Cayley graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a topological stability result for the actions of hyperbolic groups on their Bowditch boundaries. More precisely, we show that a sufficiently small perturbation of the standard boundary action, if assumed on each parabolic subgroup to be a perturbation by semi-conjugacy, is in fact always globally semi-conjugate to the standard action. This proves a relative version of the main result of arXiv:2206.14914. The assumption of control on the perturbation of parabolics is necessary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A general overview of the phenomenon of automatic continuity of homomorphisms between Polish groups is given. In particular, we study variants and improvements of the closed graph theorem, applying these to the problem of continuity of universally measurable homomorphisms and also to gauge the amount of choice needed to construct discontinuous homomorphisms between Polish groups. Furthermore, we provide a simple proof of automatic continuity in the context of homeomorphism groups of compact manifolds and a complete reworking of automatic continuity theory in the context of isometry groups of highly homogeneous complete metric structures.</description>

Abstract: We prove a product theorem for sublinear bilipschitz equivalences which generalizes the classical work of Kapovich, Kleiner and Leeb on quasiisometries between product spaces. We employ our product theorem to distinguish up to quasiisometry certain families among these groups which share the same dimension, cone-dimension and Dehn function; actually we do this by distinguishing them up to sublinear bilipschitz equivalence, which is slightly stronger. Especially, we recover the fact, recently obtained by Bourdon and R\'emy with different groups, that there exists uncountably many quasiisometry classes of indecomposable, non-unimodular, higher rank solvable Lie groups.</description>

      <title>Infinite stationary measures of co-compact group actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23600v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a finitely generated group, and let $\mu$ be a nondegenerate, finitely supported probability measure on $\Gamma$. We show that every co-compact $\Gamma$ action on a locally compact Hausdorff space admits a nonzero $\mu$-stationary Radon measure. The main ingredient of the proof is a stationary analogue of Tarski's theorem: we show that for every nonempty subset $A \subseteq \Gamma$ there is a $\mu$-stationary, finitely additive measure on $\Gamma$ that assigns unit mass to $A$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose $G\curvearrowright X$ is a Polish group action, $H$ is a Polish group and $G\times X\overset{\psi}\longrightarrow H$ is a cocycle that is continuous in the second variable. If $\psi$ is either Baire measurable or is $\lambda\times \mu$-measurable with respect to a Haar measure $\lambda$ on $G$ and a fully supported $\sigma$-finite Borel measure $\mu$ on $X$, then $\psi$ is jointly continuous.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We gather evidence on a new local-global conjecture of Moret\'o and Rizo on values of irreducible characters of finite groups. For this we study subnormalisers and picky elements in finite groups of Lie type and determine them in many cases, for unipotent elements as well as for semisimple elements of prime power order. We also discuss subnormalisers of unipotent and semisimple elements in connected as well as in disconnected reductive linear algebraic groups.</description>

      <title>Finite groups with mostly involuted cyclic subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group, define $I(G)=\{x\in G : x^{2}=1\}$, $C(G)=$ set of the cyclic subgroups of $G$, $i(G)=|I(G)|$ and $c(G)=|C(G)|$. In this article, we will classify finite groups with $i(G)=c(G)-r$ for $r=0,1,$ and $2$. We also prove that the range of the function given by $\beta(G)=\frac{i(G)}{c(G)}$ is dense in $[0,1]$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic lifting for completely positive maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.09176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ and $B$ be $C^*$-algebras with $A$ separable, let $I$ be an ideal in $B$, and let $\psi\colon A\to B/I$ be a completely positive contractive linear map. We show that there is a continuous family $\Theta_t\colon A\to B$, for $t\in [1,\infty)$, of lifts of $\psi$ that are asymptotically linear, asymptotically completely positive and asymptotically contractive. If $\psi$ is of order zero, then $\Theta_t$ can be chosen to have this property asymptotically. If $A$ and $B$ carry continuous actions of a second countable locally compact group $G$ such that $I$ is $G$-invariant and $\psi$ is equivariant, we show that the family $\Theta_t$ can be chosen to be asymptotically equivariant. If a linear completely positive lift for $\psi$ exists, we can arrange that $\Theta_t$ is linear and completely positive for all $t\in [1,\infty)$. In the equivariant setting, if $A$, $B$ and $\psi$ are unital, we show that asymptotically linear unital lifts are only guaranteed to exist if $G$ is amenable. This leads to a new characterization of amenability in terms of the existence of asymptotically equivariant unital sections for quotient maps.</description>

      <title>Classification of orientable torus bundles over closed orientable surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14138v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $g$ be a non-negative integer, $\Sigma _g$ a closed orientable surface of genus $g$, and $\mathcal{M}_g$ its mapping class group. We classify all the group homomorphisms $\pi _1(\Sigma _g)\to G$ up to the action of $\mathcal{M}_g$ on $\pi _1(\Sigma _g)$ in the following cases; (1) $G=PSL(2;\mathbb{Z})$, (2) $G=SL(2;\mathbb{Z})$. As an application of the case (2), we completely classify orientable $T^2$-bundles over closed orientable surfaces up to bundle isomorphisms. In particular, we show that any orientable $T^2$-bundle over $\Sigma _g$ with $g\geq 1$ is isomorphic to the fiber connected sum of $g$ pieces of $T^2$-bundles over $T^2$. Moreover, the classification result in the case (1) can be generalized into the case where $G$ is the free product of finite number of finite cyclic groups. We also apply it to an extension problem of maps from a closed surface to the connected sum of lens spaces.</description>

      <title>Constructing reducibly geometrically finite subgroups of the mapping class group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we consider qualified notions of geometric finiteness in mapping class groups called parabolically geometrically finite (PGF) and reducibly geometrically finite (RGF). We examine several constructions of subgroups and determine when they produce a PGF or RGF subgroup. These results provide a variety of new examples of PGF and RGF subgroups. Firstly, we consider the right-angled Artin subgroups constructed by Koberda and Clay--Leininger--Mangahas, which are generated by high powers of given elements of the mapping class group. We give conditions on the supports of these elements that imply the resulting right-angled Artin subgroup is RGF. Secondly, we prove combination theorems which provide conditions for when a collection of reducible subgroups, or sufficiently deep finite-index subgroups thereof, generate an RGF subgroup.</description>

      <title>A Classification of the Isomorphism Types of Indecomposable and Simple Modules in Finite Group Modular Representation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17197v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a field of prime order $p$ and let $\bar{F}$ denote an algebraic closure of $F$. Then for any finite group $G$ we obtain a well-defined surjective map $\Gamma$ from the set of finitely generated isomorphism types of indecomposable $\bar{F}G$-modules, $(\text{ITI}(\bar{F}G))$ to the corresponding set of $FG$-modules $(\text{ITI}(FG))$ such that if $X$ is a finitely generated indecomposable $\bar{F}G$-module, then $X$ and $\Gamma(X)$ share some important common Green Theory Invariants. We also prove a similar result for simple modules and a formula for the number of isomorphism types of simple $\bar{F}G$-modules.</description>

      <title>Embedding Higman-Thompson groups of unfolding trees into the Leavitt path algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01363v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The isomorphism problem of regular Higman-Thompson groups was solved in arXiv:1006.1759, via embedding it into the Leavitt algebra. In this paper, we will expand these results to embed the Higman-Thompson groups of unfolding trees of directed graphs into the Leavitt path algebra. This embedding allows us to show that any isomorphism of rooted Leavitt path algebras induces an isomorphism between Higman-Thompson groups.</description>
