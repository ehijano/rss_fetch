      <title>Hume's dictum as a guide to ontology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper I aim to defend one version at least of Hume's dictum: roughly, the idea that possibility is determined by ontology through something like independent variation. My defence is broadly pragmatic, in the sense that adherence to something like Hume's dictum delivers at least three benefits. The first benefit is that, through Hume's dictum, a physical theory's ontology delimits a range of possibilities, that I call \emph{kinematical possibilities}, which serves as a sufficiently permissive notion of possibility to sustain something like an intensional semantics for its claims, and a sufficiently demanding notion of supervenience to sustain plausible claims of inter-theoretic reduction and theoretical equivalence. The second benefit is that Hume's dictum allows us to work backwards from a range of kinematical possibilities to an ontology. This is especially useful when aiming to glean an interpretation of a physical theory, since often we are more confident that we have arrived at the right space of possibilities than that we have arrived at the right ontology. The third benefit is that Hume's dictum -- at least the version I aim to defend here -- may be applied to physical theories more or less as we find them, and therefore we can practice something resembling ontology without having to force our theories into some Procrustean bed, such as a first-order language.</description>

      <title>On the logical structure of physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the main claims of the paper is that Dirac's calculus and broader theories of physics can be treated as theories written in the language of Continuous Logic. Establishing its true interpretation (model) is a model theory problem. The paper introduces such a model for the fragment which covers ``free theories'', that is physical theories with Gaussian (quadratic) potential. The model is pseudo-finite (equivalently, a limit of finite models), based on a pseudo-finite field in place of the field of complex numbers. The advantage of this unusual setting is that it treats the quantum and the statistical mechanics as just domains in the same model and explains Wick rotation as a natural transformation of the model corresponding to a shift in scales of physical units.</description>

      <title>Is a particle an irreducible representation of the Poincar\'e group?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The claim that a particle is an irreducible representation of the Poincar\'e group -- what I call \emph{Wigner's identification} -- is now, decades on from Wigner's (1939) original paper, so much a part of particle physics folklore that it is often taken as, or claimed to be, a definition. My aims in this paper are to: (i) clarify, and partially defend, the guiding ideas behind this identification; (ii) raise objections to its being an adequate definition; and (iii) offer a rival characterisation of particles. My main objections to Wigner's identification appeal to the problem of interacting particles, and to alternative spacetimes. I argue that the link implied in Wigner's identification, between a spacetime's symmetries and the generator of a particle's space of states, is at best misleading, and that there is no good reason to link the generator of a particle's space of states to symmetries of any kind. I propose an alternative characterisation of particles, which captures both the relativistic and non-relativistic setting. I further defend this proposal by appeal to a theorem which links the decomposition of Poincar\'e generators into purely orbital and spin components with canonical algebraic relations between position, momentum and spin.</description>

      <title>Conventional Quantum Theory Does Not Support A Coherent Relational Account</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum theory in its conventional formulation is notoriously subject to various measurement-related paradoxes, as exemplified by the "Schrodinger's Cat" and "Wigner's Friend" thought experiments. It has been shown, for example by Frauchiger and Renner, that nested measurements such as those occurring in the Wigner's Friend experiment can lead to inconsistencies concerning the putative outcomes of measurements. Such inconsistencies are commonly presumed to remain private and incommensurable, but this is not the case. A counterexample, in which the inconsistencies can be revealed among the observers, is reviewed. The implications for a recent attempt to shield Relational Quantum Mechanics from such inconsistencies are considered, and it is concluded that the attempt is not successful. Further implications for the state of the debate concerning the viability of quantum theory in its various formulations are discussed.</description>
