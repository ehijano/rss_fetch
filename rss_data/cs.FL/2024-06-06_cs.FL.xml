      <title>Characterizations of Monadic Second Order Definable Context-Free Sets of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04764v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a characterization of the sets of graphs that are both definable in Counting Monadic Second Order Logic (CMSO) and context-free, i.e., least solutions of Hyperedge-Replacement (HR) grammars introduced by Courcelle and Engelfriet. We prove the equivalence of these sets with: (a) recognizable sets (in the algebra of graphs with HR-operations) of bounded tree-width; we refine this condition further and show equivalence with recognizability in a finitely generated subalgebra of the HR-algebra of graphs; (b) parsable sets, for which there is an MSO-definable transduction from graphs to a set of derivation trees labelled by HR operations, such that the set of graphs is the image of the set of derivation trees under the canonical evaluation of the HR operations; (c) images of recognizable unranked sets of trees under an MSO-definable transduction, whose inverse is also MSO-definable. We rely on a novel connection between two seminal results, a logical characterization of context-free graph languages in terms of tree to graph MSO-definable transductions, by Courcelle and Engelfriet and a proof that an optimal-width tree decomposition of a graph can be built by an MSO-definable transduction, by Bojanczyk and Pilipczuk.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Finite Automaton Emptiness is undecidable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is undecidable whether the language recognized by a probabilistic finite automaton is empty. Several other undecidability results, in particular regarding problems about matrix products, are based on this important theorem. We present three proofs of this theorem from the literature in a self-contained way, and we derive some strengthenings. For example, we show that the problem remains undecidable for a fixed probabilistic finite automaton with 11 states, where only the starting distribution is given as input.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Empirical-Theoretical Gap in Neural Network Formal Language Learning Using Minimum Description Length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks offer good approximation to many tasks but consistently fail to reach perfect generalization, even when theoretical work shows that such perfect solutions can be expressed by certain architectures. Using the task of formal language learning, we focus on one simple formal language and show that the theoretically correct solution is in fact not an optimum of commonly used objectives -- even with regularization techniques that according to common wisdom should lead to simple weights and good generalization (L1, L2) or other meta-heuristics (early-stopping, dropout). On the other hand, replacing standard targets with the Minimum Description Length objective (MDL) results in the correct solution being an optimum.</description>
