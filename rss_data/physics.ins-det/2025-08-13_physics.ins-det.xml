      <title>Fluorescence time profile measurement of LAB based liquid scintillator in response to medium relativistic ion particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid scintillator is widely used in particle physics experiments due to its high light yield, good timing resolution, scalability and low cost. Certain liquid scintillators exhibit pulse shape discrimination capabilities because of difference in fluorescence timing properties induced by different particles. Its fluoresence timing properties have been measured mostly for radioactive decay sources at MeV energies. We present a novel measurement of fluorescence time properties of LAB based liquid scintillator in response to high-energy ions of hydrogen (Z = 1), helium (Z = 2) and Krypton at around 200-300 MeV/u for the first time. We compared the results to those from radioactive sources and observed a distinct $dE/dX$ dependence, regardless of the particle type. These findings are essential for physics searches such as the diffuse supernova neutrino background in large liquid scintillator detectors like JUNO, and are also critical towards understanding the underlying scintillation timing mechanism.</description>

      <title>A 28nm Multiply-Accumulate ASIC Architecture for On-Chip Data Compression in MHz Frame Rate X-ray and Electron Pixel Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern X-ray detector systems urgently require compact, efficient, and fast data compression schemes to handle the transmission of big data from pixel arrays, enabling frame rates in the MHz regime. In this work, a data compression ASIC that implements a streaming fixed-length lossy compression scheme is introduced and analyzed, proving the feasibility and benefits of on-chip compression. The compression scheme utilizes a vector matrix product logic, which performs a number of floating-point multiplications, additions, and accumulations. The logic is verified, synthesized, and shown to fit in the area resource available for the X-ray detector under study, which comprises 192 x 168 pixels each of 12-bit width, and having a total area of 20 mm x 20 mm, about 2 mm x 20 mm of which are available for the digital logic. Several system architectures, precisions, and compression ratios ranging from 100 to 250 were analyzed to pave the way for on-chip fixed-length compression (e.g., principal component analysis, singular value decomposition) and data reduction (e.g., azimuthal integration) for X-ray and electron detectors.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Beam Profiles in Accelerator Neutrino Experiments through Off-Axis Neutrino Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach that utilizes neutrino events from the off-axis near detector to investigate the beam profile in long-baseline neutrino experiments. Understanding the dynamics of the neutrino beam is crucial for improving the precision of neutrino oscillation measurements. We demonstrate that certain observables related to the azimuthal angle of the neutrino direction are useful for determining the average neutrino production point from experimental data, providing a valuable cross-check against Monte Carlo simulations. Additionally, these observables can help identify potential alignment issues between the detector and the decay volume. In future neutrino experiments with significantly higher statistics, these observables will become essential to ensure the accuracy and stability of the beam profile.</description>
