      <title>Comprehensive view on a $z\sim6.5$ radio-loud QSO: from the radio to the optical/NIR to the X-ray band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multi-wavelength analysis, from the radio to the X-ray band, of the redshift $z=6.44$ VIK J2318$-$31 radio-loud (RL) quasi stellar object (QSO), one of the most distant currently known in this class. The work is based on newly obtained (uGMRT, ATCA, Chandra) as well as archival (GNIRS and X-Shooter) dedicated observations that have not been published yet. Based on the observed X-ray and radio emission, its relativistic jets are likely young and misaligned from our line of sight. Moreover, we can confirm, with simultaneous observations, the presence of a turnover in the radio spectrum at $\nu_{\rm peak} \sim 650$ MHz which is unlikely to be associated with self-synchrotron absorption. From the NIR spectrum we derived the mass of the central black hole, M$_{\rm BH}=8.1^{+6.8}_{-5.6} \times 10^8 {\rm M_{\odot}}$, and the Eddington ratio, $\lambda_{\rm EDD} = 0.8^{+0.8}_{-0.6}$, using broad emission lines as well as an accretion disc model fit to the continuum emission. Given the high accretion rate, the presence of a $\sim$8$\times$10$^8$ M$_\odot$ black hole at $z=6.44$ can be explained by a seed black hole ($\sim$10$^{4}$ M$_\odot$) that formed at $z\sim25$, assuming a radiative efficiency $\eta_{\rm d}\sim0.1$. However, by assuming $\eta_{\rm d}\sim0.3$, as expected for jetted systems, the mass observed would challenge current theoretical models of black hole formation.</description>

      <title>Feedback mechanisms stopping the star formation in a pair of massive galaxies in the early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feedback is the key physical mechanism regulating galaxy formation. Stars in galaxies form when baryons radiatively cool down and fall into gravitational wells. Eventually, star formation quenches as gas is depleted and/or perturbed by feedback processes, no longer being able to collapse and condense. For massive galaxies, astronomers identify feedback from accreting supermassive black holes (active galactic nuclei, AGN) as the main agent responsible for quenching. We report the first spatially resolved spectroscopic observations of a massive, completely quiescent galaxy at $z=3.714$ (Jekyll) and its neighborhood. Jekyll is part of a galaxy pair with a compact, dusty, massive star-forming companion (Hyde). We find large amounts of ionized and neutral gas in the intergalactic medium around the pair, yet Jekyll has remained quiescent for more than 500~Myr. The emitting gas is consistent with AGN photoionization, but no AGN is observed in Jekyll. We find that, in contrast to standard scenarios, AGN in satellite galaxies can be critical contributors for keeping massive galaxies quiescent in the early Universe. After the accelerated formation and quenching of the massive central galaxy, tidally induced gas stripping additionally contributes to the star-formation regulation on subsequent satellite galaxy generations.</description>

      <title>Comparing the VANDELS sample to a zoom-in Radiative Hydrodynamical Simulation: using the Si II and C II line spectra as tracers of galaxy evolution and Lyman Continuum leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare mock ultraviolet C II and Si II absorption and emission line features generated using a ~10$^9$ $M_\odot$ virtual galaxy with observations of 131 $z~3$ galaxies from the VANDELS survey. We find that the mock spectra reproduce reasonably well a large majority (83%) of the \vandels\ spectra ($\chi^2&lt;2$), but do not resemble the most massive objects ($&gt;10^{10}M_\odot$) which exhibit broad absorption features. Interestingly, the best-matching mock spectra originate from periods of intense star formation in the virtual galaxy, where its luminosity is four times higher than in periods of relative quiescence. Furthermore, for each galaxy, we predict the Lyman Continuum (LyC) escape fractions using the environment of the virtual galaxy. We derive an average escape fraction of 0.01$\pm$0.02, consistent with other estimates from the literature. The predicted escape fractions are tightly correlated with the Lyman-$\alpha$ escape fractions and highly consistent with observed empirical trends. Additionally, galaxies with larger predicted escape fractions exhibit bluer $\beta$ slopes, more Lyman-$\alpha$ flux, and weaker low-ionization absorption lines. Building upon the good agreement between our predictions and observationally established LyC diagnostics, we examine the LyC leakage mechanisms in the simulation. We find that LyC photon leakage is enhanced in directions where the observed flux dominantly emerges from compact regions depleted of neutral gas and dust, mirroring the scenario inferred from observational data. In general, this study further highlights the potential of high-resolution radiation hydrodynamics simulations in analyzing UV absorption and emission line features and providing valuable insights into the LyC leakage of star-forming galaxies.</description>

      <title>How non-thermal pressure impacts the modelling of star formation in galaxy formation simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In cosmological simulations of large-scale structure star formation and feedback in galaxies are modelled by so-called sub-grid models, that represent a physically motivated approximation of processes occurring below the resolution limit. However, when additional physical processes are considered in these simulations, for instance, magnetic fields or cosmic rays, they are often not consistently coupled within the descriptions of the underlying sub-grid star formation models. Here, we present a careful study on how one of the most commonly used sub-grid models for star formation in current large-scale cosmological simulations can be modified to self consistently include the effects of non-thermal components (e.g., magnetic fields) within the fluid. We demonstrate that our new modelling approach, that includes the magnetic pressure as an additional regulation on star formation, can reproduce global properties of the magnetic field within galaxies in a setup of an isolated Milky Way-like galaxy simulation, but is also successful in reproducing local properties such as the anti-correlation between the local magnetic field strength with the local star formation rate as observed in galaxies (i.e. NGC 1097). This reveals how crucial a consistent treatment of different physical processes is within cosmological simulations and gives guidance for future simulations.</description>

      <title>Tracing satellite planes in the Sculptor group: II. Discovery of five faint dwarf galaxies in the DESI Legacy Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of missing satellites still remains one of the well-known problems of the Lambda-CDM cosmological theory. Despite significant progress in cosmological modeling achieved in recent years, the search for new dwarf galaxies-satellites of nearby giant galaxies remains extremely important. In this series of papers we report the first results of an on-going systematic survey of faint dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the vicinity of the bright late-type spiral NGC 253 galaxy, the brightest member of the Sculptor filament located at a distance of 3.7 Mpc. We performed a new NGC 253 satellite search by means of visual inspection using co-added image cutouts reprocessed in the DESI Legacy image surveys, reaching a very low surface brightness regime (28.0--29.0 mag arcsec-2). Five new dwarf galaxies have been discovered in the vicinity of NGC 253, that we named them Do V, Do VI, Do VII, Do VIII and Do IX. Assuming they are associated to NGC 253, their total absolute V-magnitudes fall in the -7 to -9 mag range, which is typical for dwarf satellites in the local Universe. The central surface brightness tend to be extremely low for all the discovered dwarfs and fall roughly in the range of 25--26 mag arcsec-2 in g-band. We present a new list of galaxies located around the giant spiral NGC 253. With the inclusion of these additional satellites, the overall spatial distribution of the system becomes less flattened and is now broadly consistent with analogs drawn from Lambda-CDM expectations. Interestingly, the distribution appears to be rather lopsided. Yet, firm conclusions on the presence of absence of a correlated satellite structure are hampered since distance information is lacking, the census of observed dwarfs in the system remains far from complete, and spectroscopic velocities are not even available for most known satellites.</description>

      <title>Large Scale Overdensity of Lyman Break Galaxies Around the z=6.3 Ultraluminous Quasar J0100+2802</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the environment of the z=6.33 ultraluminous quasar SDSS J010013.02+280225.8 (J0100) to understand its association with large-scale structure. Theoretical models propose high-redshift quasars as markers of galaxy overdensities residing in the most massive dark matter halos (DMHs) in the early universe. J0100 is an ultraluminous quasar with the most massive black hole known at z&gt;6, suggesting a high likelihood of residing in a massive DMH. We present wide-field ($\sim$522 square arcminute) imaging in the r-, i-, and z-bands from the Large Binocular Camera on the Large Binocular Telescope, with Y- and J-band imaging from the Wide-field Infrared Camera on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, centered on J0100. Applying color selections, we identify 23 objects as i-droput Lyman Break Galaxy (LBG) candidates in the J0100 field. We use the deep photometric catalog in the 1.27 square degree COSMOS field to calculate the density of LBGs in a blank field, and to estimate the selection completeness and purity. The observed surface density of LBG candidates in the J0100 field corresponds to a galaxy overdensity of $\delta$=4 (at 8.4$\sigma$). This large-scale overdensity suggests that the $\sim$ 22 square arcminute overdensity found by Kashino et al. using JWST data extends out to much larger scales. We calculate the angular auto-correlation function of the candidates and find a positive correlation on $\lesssim$ 10 arcminute scales as well as evidence of asymmetries in their spatial distribution, further suggesting a direct detection of large-scale structure around the ultra-luminous quasar J0100.</description>

      <title>Star Proper Motions Based on Two-epoch Observations from the SDSS and DESI Imaging Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present the construction of a new proper motion catalog utilizing the photometric data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) imaging surveys, with a median time baseline of about 13 years. To mitigate systematic errors, the DESI galaxy positions are employed to establish a reference frame and to correct the position-, magnitude-, and color-dependent discrepancies between SDSS and DESI imaging datasets. Spanning 12,589 square degrees, the catalog encompasses about 206.6 million non-Gaia objects down to $m_r \sim$ 23. Based on 734k quasars, the assessment of the global systematic errors in DESI-SDSS proper motion catalog yields values of 0.14 mas yr$^{-1}$ for $\mu_{\alpha *}$ and 0.11 mas yr$^{-1}$ for $\mu_{\delta}$. The catalog exhibits a precision surpassing 3.7 mas yr$^{-1}$, albeit varying with position, color, and magnitude. An additional evaluation employing approximately 5,300 distant star samples yields an overall precision of approximately 3.0 and 2.9 mas yr$^{-1}$ for $\mu_{\alpha *}$ and $\mu_{\delta}$, respectively. Further comparisons with proper motions from SDSS Stripe 82 reveal a strong consistency between the two datasets. As a practical application, we utilize fainter non-Gaia objects in our catalog to update the proper motions of 17 star clusters. The resulting proper motions for these clusters exhibit excellent consistency with those derived from Gaia data. Our proper motion measurements, characterized by a deeper limiting magnitude, stands as a valuable complement to the Gaia dataset. The catalog is publicly available at \url{https://www.scidb.cn/s/YzaIv2}.</description>

      <title>Stellar Population near NGC 2021: Procession of Star Formation in the South Rim of Supergiant Shell LMC 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supergiant shells (SGSs) are the largest interstellar structures where heated and enriched gas flows into the host galaxy's halo. The SGSs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) are so close that their stars can be resolved with ground-based telescopes to allow studies of star formation history. Aiming to study the star formation history and energy budget of LMC 4, we have conducted a pilot study of the cluster NGC 2021 and the OB associations in its vicinity near the south rim of LMC 4. We use the Magellanic Cloud Photometric Survey data of the LMC to establish a methodology to examine the stellar population and assess the massive star formation history. We find a radial procession of massive star formation from the northwest part of the OB association LH79 through NGC 2021 to the OB association LH78 in the south. Using the stellar content of NGC 2021 and the assumption of Salpeter's initial mass function, we estimate that $\sim$4 supernovae have occurred in NGC 2021, injecting at least $4\times10^{51}$ ergs of kinetic energy into the interior of LMC 4.</description>

      <title>A MeerKAT Polarization Survey of Southern Calibration Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on full-Stokes L-band observations of 98 MeerKAT calibration sources. Linear polarization is detected in 71 objects above a fractional level of 0.2\%. We identify ten sources with strong fractional linear polarization and low Faraday Rotation Measure that could be suitable for wide-band absolute polarization calibration. We detect significant circular polarization from 24\% of the sample down to a detection level of 0.07\%. Circularly polarized emission is seen only for flat spectrum sources $\alpha &gt; -0.5$. We compare our polarized intensities and Faraday Synthesis results to data from the NVSS at 1400\,MHz and the ATCA SPASS survey at 2300\,MHz. NVSS data exists for 54 of our sources and SPASS data for 20 sources. The percent polarization and Rotation Measures from both surveys agree well with our results.
  The residual instrumental linear polarization for these observations is measured at 0.16\% and the residual instrumental circular polarization is measured at 0.05\%. These levels may reflect either instabilities in the relative bandpass between the two polarization channels with either time or antenna orientation, or atmospheric/ionospheric variations with pointing direction. Tracking of the hourly gain solutions on J0408-6545 after transfer of the primary gain solutions suggests a deterioration of the gain stability by a factor of several starting about two hours after sunrise. This suggests that observing during the nighttime could dramatically improve the precision of polarization calibration.</description>

      <title>Structure and Kinematics of Star-forming Elliptical Galaxies in SDSS-MaNGA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using spatially resolved spectroscopy, we investigated the characteristics and different modes of formation of stars in elliptical galaxies. We identified an unusual population of 59 star-forming elliptical (SF-E) galaxies in SDSS-MaNGA, our primary sample. To identify these rare star-forming ellipticals, we combined GSWLC-A2 containing outputs of stellar population synthesis models with morphological results from the deep-learning catalogue and resolved and integrated properties from the MaNGA Pipe3D value-added catalogue. We have also constructed two control samples of star-forming spirals (SF-Sps; 2419 galaxies) and quenched ellipticals (Q-Es; 684 galaxies) to compare with our primary sample of SF-Es. H$\alpha$ emission line flux of SF-Es is similar to spiral galaxies. The D4000 spectral index indicates that SF-Es have a mixture of old and young stellar populations. Mass-weighted stellar age and metallicity for the SF-Es are lower than the Q-Es. 67\% of stellar and gas velocity maps of the primary sample show signs of kinematic disturbance. All of these indicate that SF-Es have acquired metal-poor gas through recent mergers or interactions with other galaxies and are forming a new generation of stars. Further, we subdivide our primary sample of SF-Es into four classes based on their $B/T$ and $\lambda_{re}$. These four classes have their distinct evolutionary history and modes of formation. Based on these results, we suggest that the Hubble diagram does not accurately capture galaxy evolution processes, and we need a revised morphology diagram like the comb morphology diagram to get a complete picture of the galaxy evolution processes.</description>

      <title>CAVITY, Calar Alto Void Integral-field Treasury surveY and project extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have learnt in the last decades that the majority of galaxies belong to high density regions interconnected in a sponge-like fashion. This large-scale structure is characterised by clusters, filaments, walls, where most galaxies concentrate, but also under-dense regions, called voids. The void regions and the galaxies within represent an ideal place for the study of galaxy formation and evolution as they are largely unaffected by the complex physical processes that transform galaxies in high-density environments. These void galaxies can hold the key as well to answer current challenges to the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. The Calar Alto Void Integral-field Treasury surveY (CAVITY) is a Legacy project approved by the Calar Alto Observatory to obtain spatially resolved spectroscopic information of $\sim300$ void galaxies in the Local Universe (0.005 &lt; z &lt; 0.050) covering from -17.0 to -21.5 in $\rm r$ band absolute magnitude. It officially started in January 2021 and has been awarded 110 useful dark observing nights at the 3.5 m telescope using the PMAS spectrograph. Complementary follow-up projects including deep optical imaging, integrated, as well as resolved CO data, and integrated HI spectra, have joint the PMAS observations and naturally complete the scientific aim of characterising galaxies in cosmic voids. The extension data has been denominated CAVITY+. The data will be available to the whole community in different data releases, the first of which is planned for July 2024, and it will provide the community with PMAS data cubes for around 100 void galaxies through a user friendly, and well documented, database platform. We present here the survey, sample selection, data reduction, quality control schemes, science goals, and some examples of the scientific power of the CAVITY and CAVITY+ data.</description>

      <title>Morphological Evidence for the eROSITA Bubbles Being Giant and Distant Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04264</link>

Abstract: There are two contradictory views of the eROSITA bubbles: either a 10 kpc-scale pair of giant bubbles blown by the Galactic center (GC), or a 100 pc-scale local structure coincidentally located in the direction of GC. A key element of this controversy is the distance to the bubbles. Based on the 3D dust distribution in the Galactic plane, we found three isolated, distant (500-800 pc) clouds at intermediate Galactic latitudes. Their projected morphologies perfectly match the X-ray shadows on the defining features of the north eROSITA bubble, i.e., the North Polar Spur (NPS) and the Lotus Petal Cloud (LPC), indicating that both the NPS and LPC are distant with a distance lower limit of nearly 1kpc. In the X-ray dark region between the NPS and LPC, we found a few polarized radio arcs and attributed them to the bubble's shock front. These arcs match up perfectly with the outer border of the NPS and LPC and provide a way to define the bubble's border. The border defined in this way can be well described by the line-of-sight tangent of a 3D skewed cup model rooted in the GC. We conclude that, instead of being two independent, distant features, NPS and LPC compose a single, giant bubble, which, therefore, is most plausibly a 10-kpc scale bubble rooted at the GC.</description>

      <title>Very Long Baseline Array Observations of Parsec-scale Radio Emission in Dual Active Galactic Nuclei</title>

Abstract: It is believed that dual active galactic nuclei (dual AGN) will form during galaxies merge. Studying dual-AGN emission can provide valuable insights into galaxy merging and evolution. To investigate parsec-scale radio emission properties, we observed eight radio components of four selected dual-AGN systems using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at 5 GHz in multiple-phase-center mode. Among them, two compact radio components, labeled J0051+0020B and J2300-0005A, were detected clearly on parsec scales for the first time. However, the radio emission of the other six components was resolved out in the high-resolution images. We provided the values or upper limits of the brightness temperature and radio emission power, and analyzed the emission origins in detail for each target. Based on their physical properties reported in this work and in the literature, we suggest the radio emission in J0051+0020B and J2300-0005A originates primarily from compact jets, while the other six sources show more complex emission mechanisms. In addition, our VLBA observations suggest the systematic X-ray deficit in our dual-AGN sample is likely attributed to the tidally induced effect and possible viewing angle effect.</description>

      <title>ASKAP reveals the radio tail structure of the Corkscrew Galaxy shaped by its passage through the Abell 3627 cluster</title>

Abstract: Among the bent tail radio galaxies common in galaxy clusters are some with long, collimated tails (so-called head-tail galaxies) shaped by their interactions with the intracluster medium (ICM). Here we report the discovery of intricate filamentary structure in and beyond the ~28' (570 kpc) long, helical radio tail of the Corkscrew Galaxy (1610-60.5, ESO137-G007), which resides in the X-ray bright cluster Abell 3627 (D = 70 Mpc). Deep radio continuum data were obtained with wide-field Phased Array Feeds on the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) at 944 MHz and 1.4 GHz. The Corkscrew Galaxy is located 15' north of the prominent wide-angle tail (WAT) radio galaxy 1610-60.8 (ESO137-G006) near the cluster centre. While the bright (young) part of its radio tail is highly collimated, the faint (old) part shows increasing oscillation amplitudes, break-ups, and filaments. We find a stunning set of arc-shaped radio filaments beyond and mostly orthogonal to the collimated Corkscrew tail end, forming a partial bubble. This may be the first detection of a "proto-lobe" seen in 3D MHD simulations by Nolting et al. (2019), formed by the face-on impact of the Corkscrew Galaxy with a shock front in the cluster outskirts. Interactions of the radio galaxy tail with the ICM are likely responsible for the tail collimation and shear forces within the ICM for its increasingly filamentary structure. We also report the discovery of small (~20-30 kpc) ram-pressure stripped radio tails in four Abell 3627 cluster galaxies.</description>

      <title>COMAP Galactic Science I: Observations of Spinning Dust Emission at 30GHz in Dark Clouds Surrounding the {\lambda}-Orionis Hii Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomalous Microwave Emission (AME) is a major component of Galactic emission in the frequency band 10 to 60 GHz and is commonly modelled as rapidly rotating spinning dust grains. The photodissociation region (PDR) at the boundary of the $\lambda$-Orionis Hii region has been identified by several recent analyses as one of the brightest spinning dust emitting sources in the sky. We investigate the Barnard 30 dark cloud, a dark cloud embedded within the $\lambda$-Orionis PDR. We use total-power observations of Barnard 30 from the CO Mapping Array Project (COMAP) pathfinder instrument at 26 to 34GHz with a resolution of 4.5 arcminutes alongside existing data from Planck, WISE, IRAS, ACT, and the 1.447GHz GALFACTS survey. We use aperture photometry and template fitting to measure the spectral energy distribution of Barnard 30. We find that the spinning dust is the dominant emission component in the 26 to 34GHz range at the $7 \sigma$ level ($S_{30GHz} = 2.85\pm0.43$Jy). We find no evidence that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are the preferred carrier for the spinning dust emission, suggesting that the spinning dust carriers are due to a mixed population of very small grains. Finally, we find evidence for variations in spinning dust emissivity and peak frequency within Barnard 30, and that these variations are possibly driven by changes in dust grain population and the total radiation field. Confirming the origin of the variations in the spinning dust spectrum will require both future COMAP observations at 15GHz combined with spectroscopic mid-infrared data of Barnard 30.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 4D eigenvector 1 (E1) sequence has emerged as a powerful tool for organizing the observational and physical characteristics of type-1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of the metallicity of the broad line region gas, incorporating both new data and previously published findings, to assess the presence of any trend along the sequence. We perform a multi-component analysis on the strongest UV and optical emission lines, compute $\sim 10$ diagnostic ratios, and compare them with the prediction of CLOUDY photoionization simulations, identifying a photoionization solution closest to the data. Our investigation reveals a consistent pattern along the optical plane of the E1. We observe a systematic progression in metallicity, ranging from sub-solar values to metallicity levels several times higher than solar values. These findings underscore the role of metallicity as a fundamental correlate of the 4DE1/main sequence. Extreme values of metallicity, at least several tens solar, are confirmed in low-$z$ AGNs radiating at a high Eddington ratio, although the origin of the extreme enrichment remains open to debate.</description>

      <title>The Population II Extragalactic Distance Scale: A TRGB Distance to the Fornax Cluster with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differences between the local value of the Hubble constant measured via the distance ladder versus the value inferred from the cosmic microwave background with the assumption of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model have reached over 5$\sigma$ significance. To determine if this discrepancy is due to new physics or more mundane systematic errors, it is essential to remove as many sources of systematic uncertainty as possible by developing high-precision distance ladders that are independent of the traditional Cepheid and Type Ia supernovae route. Here we present JWST observations of three early-type Fornax Cluster galaxies, the first of fourteen observations from a Cycle 2 JWST program. Our modest integration times allow us to measure highly precise tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) distances, and will also be used to perform measurements of Surface Brightness Fluctuations (SBF). From these three galaxies, we determine an average TRGB distance modulus to the Fornax Cluster of $\mu$ = 31.424 $\pm$ 0.077 mag, or D = 19.3 $\pm$ 0.7 Mpc. With eleven more scheduled observations in nearby elliptical galaxies, our program will allow us set the zero point of the SBF scale to better than 2$\%$ for more distant measurements, charting a path towards a high-precision measurement of $H_{0}$ that is independent of the traditional Cepheid-SN Ia distance ladder.</description>

      <title>Discovery of the Remarkably Red L/T Transition Object VHS J183135.58-551355.9</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the discovery of VHS J183135.58$-$551355.9 (hereafter VHS J1831$-$5513), an L/T transition dwarf identified as a result of its unusually red near-infrared colors ($J-K_{\rm S}=3.633\pm0.277$ mag; $J-W2=6.249\pm0.245$ mag) from the VISTA Hemisphere Survey and CatWISE2020 surveys. We obtain low resolution near-infrared spectroscopy of VHS J1831$-$5513 using Magellan/FIRE to confirm its extremely red nature and assess features sensitive to surface gravity (i.e., youth). Its near-infrared spectrum shows multiple CH$_{\rm 4}$ absorption features, indicating an exceptionally low effective temperature for its spectral type. Based on proper motion measurements from CatWISE2020 and a photometric distance derived from its $K_{\rm S}$-band magnitude, we find that VHS J1831$-$5513 is a likely ($\sim$85$\%$ probability) kinematic member of the $\beta$ Pictoris moving group. Future radial velocity and trigonometric parallax measurements will clarify such membership. Follow-up mid-infrared or higher resolution near-infrared spectroscopy of this object will allow for further investigation as to the cause(s) of its redness, such as youth, clouds, and viewing geometry.</description>

      <title>A variable star population in the open cluster NGC\,6819 observed by the Kepler spacecraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the list of variable stars we found in the \kep\ superstamp data covering approximately nine arcminutes from the central region of NGC6819. This is a continuation of our work presented by Sanjayan et al.(2022a). We classified the variable stars based on the variability type and we established their cluster membership based on the available Gaia Data Release 3 astrometry. Our search revealed 385 variable stars but only 128 were found to be cluster members. In the case of eclipsing and contact binaries we calculated the mid-times of eclipses and derived ephemerides. We searched for eclipse timing variation using the observed minus calculated diagrams. Only five objects show significant orbital period variation. We used isochrones calculated within the MESA Isochrones and Stellar Tracks project and derived the average age (2.54 Gyr), average distance (2.3 kpc) and iron content [Fe/H] = -0.01(2), of NGC6819. We confirm this distance by the one derived from Gaia astrometry of the cluster members with membership probabilities greater than 0.9.</description>

      <title>VLBA Astrometry of the Galactic Double Neutron Stars PSR J0509+3801 and PSR J1930-1852: A Preliminary Transverse Velocity Distribution of Double Neutron Stars and Its Implications</title>

Abstract: The mergers of double neutron stars (DNSs) systems are believed to drive the majority of short $\gamma$-ray bursts (SGRBs), while also serving as production sites of heavy r-process elements. Despite being key to i) confirming the nature of the extragalactic SGRBs, ii) addressing the poorly-understood r-process enrichment in the ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDGs), and iii) probing the formation process of DNS systems, the space velocity distribution of DNSs is still poorly constrained due to the small number of DNSs with well-determined astrometry. In this work, we determine new proper motions and parallaxes of two Galactic DNSs -- PSR J0509+3801 and PSR J1930-1852, using the Very Long Baseline Array, and estimate the transverse velocities $v_\perp$ of all the 11 isolated Galactic DNSs having proper motion measurements in a consistent manner. Our correlation analysis reveals that the DNS $v_\perp$ is tentatively correlated with three parameters: spin period, orbital eccentricity, and companion mass. With the preliminary $v_\perp$ distribution, we obtain the following findings. Firstly, the refined $v_\perp$ distribution is confirmed to agree with the observed displacements of the localized SGRBs from their host galaxy birth sites. Secondly, we estimate that around 11% and 25% of DNSs remain gravitationally bound to UFDGs with escape velocities of 15$\mathrm{~km~s^{-1}}$ and 25$\mathrm{~km~s^{-1}}$, respectively. Hence, the retained DNSs might indeed be responsible for the r-process enrichment confirmed so far in a few UFDGs. Finally, we discuss how a future ensemble of astrometrically determined DNSs may probe the multimodality of the $v_\perp$ distribution.</description>

      <title>Extracting parity-violating gravitational waves from projected tidal force tensor in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) may be produced by various mechanisms in the early universe. In particular, if parity is violated, it may lead to the production of parity-violating GWs. In this paper, we focus on GWs on the scale of the large-scale structure. Since GWs induce tidal deformations of the shape of galaxies, one can extract such GW signals by observing images of galaxies in galaxy surveys. Conventionally the detection of such signals is discussed by considering the three-dimensional power spectra of the $E/B$-modes. Here, we develop a complementary new technique to estimate the contribution of GWs to the tidal force tensor field projected on the celestial sphere, which is a directly observable quantity. We introduce two two-dimensional vector fields constructed by taking the divergence and curl of the projected tidal field in three dimensions. Their auto-correlation functions naturally contain contributions of the scalar-type tidal field. However, we find that the divergence of the curl of the projected tidal field, which is a pseudo-scalar quantity, is free from the scalar contribution and thus enables us to extract GW signals. We also find that we can detect parity-violating signals in the GWs by observing the nonzero cross-correlation between the divergence of the projected tidal field and the curl of it. It roughly corresponds to measuring the cross-power spectrum of E and B-modes, but these are complementary to each other in the sense that our estimator can be naturally defined locally in position space. Finally we present expressions of the correlation functions in the form of Fourier integrals, and discuss the properties of the kernels specific to the GW case, which we call the overlap reduction function, borrowing the terminology used in the pulsar timing array experiments.</description>

      <title>Double white dwarf binary population in MOCCA star clusters -- Comparisons with observations of close and wide binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There could be a significant population of double white dwarf binaries (DWDs) inside globular clusters (GCs), however, these are often too faint to be individually observed. We have utilized a large number GC models evolved with the Monte Carlo Cluster Simulator (MOCCA) code, to create a large statistical dataset of DWDs. These models include multiple-stellar populations, resulting in two distinct initial populations: one dense and another less dense. Due to the lower density of one population, a large number of objects escape during the early GC evolution, leading to a high mass-loss rate. In this dataset we have analysed three main groups of DWDs, namely in-cluster binaries, escaped binaries, and isolated evolution of primordial binaries. We compared the properties of these groups to observations of close and wide binaries. We find that the number of escaping DWDs is significantly larger than the number of in-cluster binaries and those that form via the isolated evolution of all promiridial binaries in our GC models. This suggests that dynamics play an important role in the formation of DWDs. For close binaries, we found a good agreement in the separations of escaped binaries and isolated binaries, but in-cluster binaries showed slight differences. We could not reproduce the observed extremely low mass WDs due to the limitations of our stellar and binary evolution prescriptions. For wide binaries, we also found a good agreement in the separations and masses, after accounting for observational selection effects. We conclude that, even though the current observational samples of DWDs are extremely biased and incomplete, our results compare reasonably well with observations.</description>

      <title>Accretion mediated spin-eccentricity correlations in LISA massive black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine expected effective spin ($\chi_{{\rm eff},1\rm yr}$) and orbital eccentricity ($e_{1\rm yr}$) correlations for a population of observable equal-mass massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with total redshifted mass $M_z\sim[10^{4.5},10^{7.5}]~{\rm M}_\odot$ embedded in a circumbinary disc (CBD), one-year before merging in the LISA band. We find a strong correlation between measurable eccentricity and negative effective spin for MBHBs that are carried to merger by retrograde accretion. This is due to the well-established eccentricity pumping of retrograde accretion and the formation of retrograde CBD-aligned mini-discs, as observed in hydrodynamical simulations. Conversely, prograde accretion channels result in positive $\chi_{{\rm eff},1\rm yr}$ and non-measurable $e_{1\rm yr}$. This clear contrast between the two CBD orientations -- and particularly the unique signature of retrograde configurations -- provides a promising way to unlock the mysteries of MBHB formation channels in the LISA era.</description>

      <title>Cosmology from one galaxy in voids?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding galaxy properties may be the key to unlocking some of the most intriguing mysteries of modern cosmology. Recent work relied on machine learning to extract cosmological constraints on $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ using only $\textit{one}$ galaxy. But if this is true, how should we select $\textit{the}$ galaxy to use for cosmology inference? In this paper, we consider selecting a galaxy that lies in cosmic voids, the underdense regions of the cosmic web, and compare the constraints obtained with the ones obtained when randomly selecting a galaxy in the whole sample. We use the IllustrisTNG galaxy catalog from the CAMELS project and the VIDE void finder to identify galaxies inside voids. We show that void galaxies provide stronger constraints on $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ compared to randomly selected galaxies. This result suggests that the distinctive characteristics of void galaxies may provide a cleaner and more effective environment for extracting cosmological information.</description>

      <title>The ultraviolet continuum slopes of high-redshift galaxies: evidence for the emergence of dust-free stellar populations at z &gt; 10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the ultraviolet (UV) continuum slopes ($\beta$) for a sample of $172$ galaxy candidates at $8 &lt; z_{\mathrm{phot}} &lt; 16$ selected from a combination of JWST NIRCam imaging and COSMOS/UltraVISTA ground-based near-infrared imaging. Focusing primarily on a new sample of $121$ galaxies at $\langle z \rangle \simeq 11$ selected from $\simeq 320$ arcmin$^2$ of public JWST imaging data across $15$ independent data sets, we investigate the evolution of $\beta$ in the galaxy population at $z \geq 9$. We find a significant trend between $\beta$ and redshift, with the inverse-variance weighted mean UV slope evolving from $\langle \beta \rangle = -2.17 \pm 0.06$ at $z = 9.5$ to $\langle \beta \rangle = -2.59 \pm 0.06$ at $z = 11.5$. Based on a comparison with stellar population models including nebular continuum emission, we find that at $z&gt;10.5$ the average UV continuum slope is consistent with the intrinsic blue limit of dust-free stellar populations $(\beta_{\mathrm{int}} \simeq -2.6)$. These results suggest that the moderately dust-reddened galaxy population at $z &lt; 10$ was essentially unattenuated at $z \simeq 11$. The extremely blue galaxies being uncovered at $z&gt;10$ place important constraints on dust attenuation in galaxies in the early Universe, and imply that the already observed galaxy population is likely supplying an ionising photon budget capable of maintaining ionised IGM fractions of $\gtrsim 5$ per cent at $z\simeq11$.</description>

      <title>A critical review of recent GAIA wide binary gravity tests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the last couple of years, the appearance of the {\it Gaia} DR3 has triggered the performance of various wide binary low acceleration gravity tests. Wide binaries with typical total masses $\approx 1.0 - 1.6 M_{\odot}$ and separations above a few thousand au probe the low acceleration $a \lesssim a_{0}$ regime, where at galactic and larger scales gravitational anomalies typically attributed to the presence of an as yet undetected dark matter component appear, where $a_{0} \approx 1.2\times 10^{-10}$ m s$^{-2}$ is the acceleration scale of MOND. Thus, studies of the relative velocities and separations on the plane of the sky, $v_{2D}$ and $s_{2D}$ respectively, of wide binary stars extending to separations above a few kau, provide an independent approach on the empirical study of gravity in the interesting $a \lesssim a_{0}$ acceleration range. Two independent groups, through complementary approaches, have obtained evidence for a departure from Newtonian predictions in the low acceleration regime, using the latest high quality {\it Gaia} catalogue. These two groups, also report this observed gravitational anomaly to be consistent with MOND expectations for wide binary orbits in the Solar Neighbourhood. Two other groups however, have instead reported results showing a clear preference for Newtonian gravity over various MOND alternatives tested, over the same low acceleration regime. We here take a critical look at the various studies in question, from sample selection to statistical treatment of the wide binary relative velocities obtained, in an attempt to clarify the current state of affairs. We discover a couple of critical problems in the formal design and statistical implementation shared by the two groups reporting a preference for Newtonian gravity over MOND models, and show explicitly how these yield biased conclusions.</description>

      <title>Radio-only and Radio-to-far-ultraviolet Spectral Energy Distribution Modeling of 14 ULIRGs: Insights into the Global Properties of Infrared Bright Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present detailed spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling of 14 local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) with outstanding photometric data from the literature covering the ultraviolet--infrared (FIR) and radio bands ($\sim$50 MHz to $\sim$30 GHz). We employ the CIGALE SED fitting code to model the ultraviolet--FIR--radio SED. For the radio-only SED modeling, we use the UltraNest package, leveraging its nested sampling algorithm. Combining the results from our previous study on 11 luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs), we discuss the global astrophysical properties of a sample of 25 starburst galaxies (z $&lt;$ 0.5). Their radio spectra are frequently characterized by bends and turnovers, with no indication of ULIRGs exhibiting more complicated SEDs than LIRGs despite showing more signs of interactions. Including radio measurements in the CIGALE modeling constrained the dust luminosity and star formation rate (SFR) estimates by more than 1 order of magnitude better than previously reported for starburst galaxies. We show that total and nonthermal radio luminosity at 1.4 and 4.8 GHz frequencies can be good estimators of recent SFRs for all LIRGs and those ULIRGS with an insignificant influence of active galactic nuclei. A weaker but still significant correlation is observed between radio SFRs at 1.4 GHz and old (averaged over 100 Myr) SFRs based on SED modeling, indicative of multiple episodes of starburst activity during their lifetime. The thermal radio luminosity at 4.8 GHz is a better tracer of recent star formation than the thermal luminosity at 1.4 GHz. Statistically, our modeled nonthermal radio spectral indices do not significantly correlate with redshift, stellar mass, SFR, specific SFR, and dust mass.</description>

      <title>Molecular gas scaling relations for local star-forming galaxies in the low-$M_*$ regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derived molecular gas fractions ($f_\mathrm{mol}=M_\mathrm{mol}/M_*$) and depletion times ($\tau_\mathrm{mol}= M_\mathrm{mol}/\mathrm{SFR} $) for 353 galaxies representative of the local star-forming population with $10^{8.5}\,M_\odot &lt; M_* &lt; 10^{10.5}\,M_\odot$ drawn from the ALLSMOG and xCOLDGASS surveys of CO(2-1) and CO(1-0) line emission. By adding constraints from low-mass galaxies and upper limits for CO non-detections, we find the median molecular gas fraction of the local star-forming population to be constant at $\log f_\mathrm{mol}=-0.99^{+0.22}_{-0.19}$, challenging previous reports of increased molecular gas fractions in low-mass galaxies. Above $M_*\sim 10^{10.5}\,M_\odot$, we find the $f_\mathrm{mol}$ vs. $M_*$ relation to be sensitive to the selection criteria for star-forming galaxies. We tested the robustness of our results against different prescriptions for the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor and different selection criteria for star-forming galaxies. The depletion timescale $\tau_\mathrm{mol}$ weakly depends on $M_*$, following a power law with a best-fit slope of $0.16\pm 0.03$. This suggests that small variations in specific SFR ($ \mathrm{sSFR=SFR}/M_*$) across the local main sequence of star-forming galaxies with $M_* &lt; 10^{10.5}\,M_\odot$ are mainly driven by differences in the efficiency of converting the available molecular gas into stars. We tested these results against a possible dependence of $f_\mathrm{mol}$ and $\tau_\mathrm{mol}$ on the surrounding (group) environment of the targets by splitting them into centrals, satellites, and isolated galaxies, and find no significant variation between these populations. We conclude that the group environment is unlikely to have a large systematic effect on the molecular gas content of star-forming galaxies in the local Universe.</description>

Abstract: Dwarf highly star-forming galaxies (SFGs) dominated the early Universe and are considered the main driver of its reionization. However, direct observations of these distant galaxies are mainly confined to rest-frame ultraviolet and visible light, limiting our understanding of their complete properties. Therefore, it is still paramount to study their local analogs, the Green Pea (GP) and Blueberry (BB) galaxies. This work aims to expand our knowledge of BBs by identifying new instances, particularly in closer proximity and in the southern sky. In addition to the already known, this new sample of BBs allows for a statistically significant study of their properties probed by visible and infrared (IR) light. By utilizing the HECATE catalog, which provides optical/IR photometry and characterization of galaxies, along with data from Pan-STARSS and SDSS, this study selects and analyzes a new sample of BBs. Spectral energy distribution fitting is employed to derive homogeneous measurements of star-formation rates and stellar masses. Additionally, emission-line fluxes, including $\rm He~{\small II}~\lambda 4686$, are measured through spectral fitting. This work has identified 48 BBs, out of which 40 are new, with the nearest at 19 Mpc. 14 BBs are in the south sky. The BBs tend to be extremely IR red in both WISE W1-W2 and W2-W3 colors distinguishing them from typical SFGs. Dwarf SFGs with higher specific star-formation rates tend to have redder IR colors. Blueberry galaxies stand out as the most intensely star-forming sources in the local Universe among dwarf galaxies. They exhibit unique characteristics, being intrinsically bluer in visible light and redder in the infrared, less massive, with higher specific star-formation rates and equivalent widths, lower metallicities, and possessing the most strongly ionized interstellar medium compared to typical SFGs and GPs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Planetary nebulae (PNe) have three main components: a central star (CS), ionised gas and dust in the nebula. Each of them contains critical chemical fingerprints of their evolution, serving as tracers of the evolution, nucleosynthesis and dust production that occurred during the preceding asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. We aim to build a bridge to link the PN phase to the evolution of their progenitors, trying to better understand the dust production and mass-loss mechanism during the final AGB phase. Here, we present a comprehensive study of nine Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) spherical or elliptical PNe whose observations from the ultraviolet (UV) through the infrared (IR) are available in the literature. We characterize nebulae and CSs, finding information as the amount of gas that makes up the nebula and the dust that surrounds the CS, necessary to reconstruct the evolutionary history of mass-loss and dust production. We compare the observed energy distribution of the selected PNe to that obtained from photoionization modeling, taking into account the presence of dust. The physical and chemical parameters of the central stars are then compared with the predictions from the evolutionary tracks. We characterized the source, assigning to each CS a progenitor, early-AGB mass. We estimated the mass of the nebula and the dust-to-gas ratio. For 5 objects, we find evidence for the presence of a near-IR bump, which would be connected to the presence of hot dust.</description>

Abstract: We compile a catalog of 578 highly probable and 62 likely red supergiants (RSGs) of the Milky Way, which represents the largest list of Galactic RSG candidates designed for continuous follow-up to date. We match distances measured by Gaia DR3, 2MASS photometry, and a 3D Galactic dust map to obtain luminous bright late-type stars. Determining the stars' bolometric luminosities and effective temperatures, we compare to Geneva stellar evolution tracks to determine likely RSG candidates, and quantify contamination using a catalog of Galactic AGB in the same luminosity-temperature space. We add details for common or interesting characteristics of RSG, such as multi-star system membership, variability, and classification as a runaway. As potential future core-collapse supernova (SN) progenitors, we study the ability of the catalog to inform the Supernova Early Warning System (SNEWS) coincidence network made to automate pointing, and show that for 3D position estimates made possible by neutrinos, the number of progenitor candidates can be significantly reduced, improving our ability to observe the progenitor pre-explosion and the early phases of the core-collapse supernova.</description>

Abstract: Upcoming surveys of the large-scale structure of our Universe will employ a large coverage area of about half of the sky and will significantly increase the observational depth. With these surveys, we will be able to cross-correlate CMB gravitational lensing and galaxy surveys divided into narrow redshift bins to map the evolution of the cosmological parameters with redshift. In this paper, we study the effect of the redshift bin mismatch of objects that is due to photometric redshift errors in tomographic cross-correlation measurements. We used the code FLASK to create Monte Carlo simulations of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and Planck CMB lensing convergence. We simulated log-normal fields and divided galaxies into nine redshift bins with the Gaussian and modified Lorentzian photometric redshift errors. To estimate the parameters, we used angular power spectra of CMB lensing and galaxy density contrast fields and the maximum likelihood estimation method. We show that even with simple Gaussian errors with a standard deviation of $\sigma(z)=0.02(1+z)$, the galaxy auto-power spectra in tomographic bins are offset by $2-15\%$. The estimated cross-power spectra between galaxy clustering and CMB lensing are also biased, with smaller deviations $&lt;5\%$. As a result, the $\sigma_{8}$ parameter deviates between $0.2-1.2\,\sigma$ due to the redshift bin mismatch of the objects. We propose a computationally fast and robust method based on the scattering matrix approach of Zhang et al. (2010), to correct for the redshift bin mismatch of the objects. The estimates of the parameters in tomographic studies such as the linear galaxy bias, the cross-correlation amplitude, and $\sigma_{8}$ are biased due to the redshift bin mismatch of the objects. The biases in these parameters are alleviated with our scattering matrix approach.</description>
